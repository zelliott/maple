zzso stroke is associated with zzso dysfunction and zzso with intrinsic cerebral zzso disease of unknown zzso zzso dysfunction could impair zzso barrier zzso We assessed background zzso barrier leakage in patients with zzso zzso stroke compared with cortical stroke zzso 

We recruited patients with zzso or mild cortical zzso stroke and assessed generalized cerebral zzso barrier leak with zzso and intravenous zzso at least 1 month after zzso We used detailed image processing to compare signal change before and for 30 minutes zzso throughout gray matter, white matter, and zzso fluid with summary analyses and general linear zzso 

Among 48 patients (29 zzso 19 zzso zzso enhancement was significantly higher in zzso fluid zzso zzso U), and zzso higher in white matter, in zzso than in cortical strokes, with no difference in gray zzso General linear modeling confirmed significantly greater zzso enhancement in zzso fluid in zzso patients than in cortical controls zzso zzso 

These preliminary data suggest that the zzso barrier may be dysfunctional throughout zzso white matter zzso matter drains via zzso spaces to zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso Further studies are required to confirm these findings and determine whether abnormal zzso barrier might zzso development of zzso zzso zzso barrier dysfunction may be an important mechanism for brain damage in cerebral zzso zzso
