zzso are common zzso and zzso zzso They are treated primarily by surgical zzso zzso recurrence following surgery is frequent despite advances in zzso However, it is not clear whether zzso zzso close or distant to the primary zzso site, arise from incomplete zzso dissemination of tumor fragments or from independent tumor zzso In order to address the question of zzso in recurring zzso we examined a series of five patients with a total of 14 tumors for zzso zzso in the tumor zzso Four patients with a total of 11 zzso were zzso for zzso either in the zzso or the zzso zzso All zzso zzso were found to be zzso with respect to the primary zzso This finding suggests a common molecular zzso of primary zzso and subsequent zzso zzso In a sixth patient, we analyzed the zzso gene for zzso in the primary and 5 zzso zzso All six zzso carried the identical zzso zzso strongly indicating a common origin for these zzso We conclude that zzso zzso usually arise from dissemination of tumor fragments, most likely at the time of the first surgical zzso Our data should alert to the potential of zzso cells for seeding during surgical zzso
