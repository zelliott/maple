We examined the relationship between the zzso depressive state and silent cerebral zzso using zzso The subjects studied were 56 patients 50 years of age or older with a depressive state who underwent zzso and who were hospitalized and treated at the Department of zzso or the Department of zzso of zzso zzso zzso We made a diagnosis of depression in patients who fulfilled the criteria of zzso for major zzso Patients in whom zzso attacks had occurred, or who had local zzso symptoms or a history of evident cerebrovascular disorders, were not included in the zzso Silent cerebral zzso was observed with zzso onset in zzso of patients with a zzso depressive state, and the complication rate was significantly higher than for cases with juvenile onset zzso For patients with a senile depressive state, the complication of silent cerebral zzso was found in zzso of cases of zzso onset and in zzso of cases of senile zzso These rates were remarkably higher than the age-related complication rate of silent cerebral zzso in normal persons reported zzso we therefore suspect that nearly half of patients with depressive state of zzso onset and most of patients with that of senile onset might have an zzso state complicated by silent cerebral zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found, suggesting that zzso zzso of depressive states were zzso When we divided the depressive states complicated by cerebral zzso into 2 zzso those complicated by a zzso zzso and those by a zzso zzso and compared the 2 types, we found possible differences in clinical symptoms and course between the zzso These differences seem worthy of further zzso Among zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso followed by frontal and then zzso zzso in zzso There were significantly more left frontal zzso than right frontal zzso zzso of both the zzso lobe and left frontal lobe may be related to the depressive zzso Compared with cases not complicated by cerebral zzso those with zzso and zzso cerebral zzso were complicated with zzso significantly more zzso similarity in risk factors and pathology between zzso cerebral zzso and zzso was suggested by these zzso
