zzso zzso tumor zzso is a newly zzso zzso benign tumor arising within the zzso zzso and having a zzso association with partial complex zzso We reviewed the MR appearance of the brains of six patients with zzso without and with administration of zzso emphasizing the clinical and zzso zzso 

The MR images in six patients (five male, one zzso with zzso proved zzso were zzso Five had partial complex zzso and one had partial simple zzso Age at onset of partial zzso ranged from 2 to 19 zzso zzso were obtained with conventional zzso and zzso weighting without and with the administration of zzso All patients had zzso for medically zzso zzso and zzso examination of all specimens was available for zzso 

MR demonstrated a focal cortical mass in all zzso Five were located in the zzso lobe and one was located within the zzso zzso Two showed enhancement with zzso zzso occurred in one zzso Common features included very low signal intensity on zzso images and high signal on zzso images, similar to zzso zzso zzso density images demonstrated slightly higher signal intensity in the zzso than zzso zzso The margin of the tumor is zzso and may zzso the adjacent zzso 

zzso a newly described zzso entity resulting in zzso often zzso intractable seizures, has characteristic features on MR that allow it to be suggested in the differential zzso These zzso may simulate benign zzso however, increased signal intensity on zzso density images should prompt further investigation in the proper clinical zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso is not possible by zzso
