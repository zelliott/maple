Five patients with zzso proven diagnosis of double outlet right zzso zzso were studied with magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso resonance was compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired on a zzso T zzso zzso resonance was equivalent to zzso in demonstrating relative relationships of the great arteries with respect to each other, the relative positions of the great arteries with respect to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the caliber of the great zzso It was comparable in zzso of the size and position of the zzso and position of the zzso zzso Due to limited spatial resolution, MR failed to identify zzso zzso of a zzso valve and incorrectly interpreted pulmonary zzso as pulmonary zzso A small patch leak of an internal zzso was only zzso on zzso We conclude that MR is superior to zzso in the zzso assessment of the spatial arrangement and caliber of the great zzso As such, it is a useful adjunct to zzso in the zzso assessment of zzso
