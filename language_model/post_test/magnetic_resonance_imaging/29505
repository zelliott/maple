To evaluate the safety of and compare the enhancement characteristics of zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging, Milan, zzso with those of a standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Berlin, zzso in primary and secondary brain tumors on the basis of qualitative and quantitative zzso on an zzso zzso 

zzso patients with either high-grade zzso or zzso were enrolled in a zzso zzso crossover study to compare zzso enhancement with doses of zzso zzso per zzso of body weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was performed before injection zzso zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 16 minutes after injection zzso zzso zzso zzso assessment was performed by blinded off-site readers (for 22 zzso and on-site investigators (for 24 zzso in terms of global contrast enhancement, zzso contrast, zzso zzso internal zzso zzso and structure, tumor zzso and global image zzso Additional quantitative assessment with zzso analysis was performed by off-site readers zzso zzso analysis of qualitative data was performed with the zzso signed rank test, whereas a zzso approach was adopted for analysis of quantitative zzso 

zzso zzso zzso preference for zzso zzso over zzso zzso was noted both off-site and on-site for the global assessment of contrast zzso For off-site readers 1 and 2 and the on-site investigators, respectively, zzso zzso was preferred in 13, 17, and 16 zzso zzso zzso was preferred in four, four, and four zzso and equality was found in five, one, and four zzso Similar preference for zzso zzso was noted by off-site readers and on-site investigators for zzso contrast and all other qualitative zzso zzso quantitative evaluation revealed significantly zzso zzso superior enhancement for zzso zzso compared with that for zzso zzso at all time points from 3 minutes after zzso 

zzso superior contrast enhancement of zzso enhancing brain tumors was achieved with zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with that with zzso zzso zzso zzso
