The objective of this study was to calculate tumor blood flow zzso in musculoskeletal zzso and to evaluate the usefulness of this zzso in zzso zzso from benign zzso and monitoring the treatment response to zzso zzso 

Altogether, 33 patients with musculoskeletal zzso underwent a total of 50 dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso including 28 on 9 patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso was calculated using zzso zzso zzso slope zzso was determined from the zzso curve during the first pass of contrast zzso 

zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso in benign zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso SS ranged from zzso to zzso for benign zzso and from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso and SS did not differ significantly between benign and zzso zzso Among the nine patients who underwent zzso chemotherapy, zzso after chemotherapy was lower in good zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, tumor necrosis zzso or zzso than in poor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, tumor necrosis zzso 

zzso and SS cannot reliably differentiate zzso from benign zzso However, they have potential utility in evaluating the zzso treatment response in patients with zzso musculoskeletal zzso
