Many therapeutic techniques have been used for the treatment of symptomatic zzso zzso zzso and each has its own zzso Our objective was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of alcohol zzso for treating these zzso 

Fourteen patients with zzso were treated by injection of absolute alcohol into the zzso via the zzso zzso route under CT zzso zzso before treatment included zzso deficit in 13 patients and debilitating pain in zzso All patients underwent zzso MR zzso All patients had clinical and MR imaging follow-up zzso patients at zzso hours and 2 zzso six at zzso zzso zzso were divided into excellent zzso of work, zzso of zzso good zzso zzso and failure of treatment categories on the basis of zzso assessment of clinical zzso Clinical zzso was correlated with zzso zzso 

All patients showed transient deterioration of zzso status after alcohol zzso zzso excellent results were seen in five patients and eight were in the good zzso One patient in whom treatment failed also developed a complication zzso zzso Four of the eight patients with good results had zzso zzso zzso Total follow-up ranged from 5 to 31 months, with 11 patients showing stable zzso One patient developed zzso zzso within a zzso Another patient became symptomatic after initial good response, secondary to the collapse of the involved zzso zzso Good correlation was found between clinical improvement and reduction of zzso zzso masses on MR zzso zzso signal zzso seen on MR images in four treated patients, however, did not show any change after zzso 

Alcohol zzso is an effective management option for symptomatic zzso zzso Although encouraging results were seen in almost zzso of our patients, a longer follow-up period still is needed to assess the stability of zzso Potential complications include zzso collapse and zzso
