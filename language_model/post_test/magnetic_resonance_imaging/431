Left zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso occurs frequently despite successful zzso coronary intervention zzso but cannot be predicted by simple clinical zzso 

This prospective study tested the value of rest and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for early prediction of zzso zzso in patients treated by zzso in the acute phase of a first zzso zzso size, zzso severity, regional wall motion zzso zzso and wall zzso score zzso were assessed at rest and on zzso by zzso 6 zzso 2 days after zzso in 40 zzso zzso zzso was defined as zzso increase at 6 months in zzso zzso volume assessed by zzso zzso severity at rest showed the best zzso values for left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters at neither rest nor zzso study further improved zzso values of the zzso zzso 

zzso severity assessed by zzso zzso performed in the zzso phase of a first zzso predicts zzso zzso with high accuracy without incremental value nor of functional parameters nor of zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso should not be used in this zzso
