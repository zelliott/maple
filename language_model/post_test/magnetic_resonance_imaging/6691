This article examines the injection of zzso of zzso fat cells as a means of zzso zzso in 162 patients over a zzso zzso The author documents the use of magnetic resonance imaging in six patients to zzso the intramuscular location, integration, and duration of the injected zzso With the patient under zzso or general zzso fat cells were harvested with a zzso blunt zzso and then stored in an empty sterile intravenous bag or bottle zzso zzso was the only process used to separate the fat cells from the saline and zzso zzso Up to zzso zzso of fat cells were been injected into each zzso the largest amount of fat zzso ever zzso Clinical assessment estimated a 20 percent loss of zzso effect during the first 4 zzso Patients were generally pleased with the final shape and volume of the zzso zzso In follow-up zzso magnetic resonance imaging supported the clinical indicators that the injection of large quantities of fat cells appears to be a safe and effective method for zzso zzso This process has inherent zzso zzso further research is required to clarify our understanding of the predictability and longevity of this zzso
