Reliable identification of the zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical for deep brain stimulation zzso of these zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the visibility of the zzso and zzso with various zzso techniques and to assess the suitability of each technique for direct zzso zzso 

MR images were acquired from nine volunteers with zzso and zzso zzso zzso fast spin zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso inversion recovery and quantitative zzso zzso and zzso mapping zzso zzso ratios zzso for the zzso and zzso were calculated for all zzso zzso errors on zzso were evaluated on magnetic zzso zzso The sequences demonstrating the best zzso of zzso target structures zzso and zzso were then applied to ten patients with movement disorders, and the zzso for these techniques were zzso 

zzso offers the highest zzso for the zzso but standard zzso images provide the best zzso for the zzso zzso maps indicated that the zzso margins may be shifted slightly on zzso although no shifts were seen for the zzso 

zzso may improve the visibility of the zzso on zzso zzso potentially improving the accuracy of direct zzso zzso
