To report the clinical features, causes and outcome of cerebral cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The authors zzso included patients with zzso zzso among individuals zzso admitted in Stroke zzso 

zzso patients presented zzso out of zzso with zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso clinical characteristics existed in zzso in comparison with other cerebral zzso as a whole, zzso zzso frequent transient symptoms at onset zzso vs zzso zzso and low severity score zzso vs zzso zzso zzso early zzso in first 2 weeks zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso even when focusing only on other zzso involving the cerebral zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical presentation but specific zzso zzso allowing a clinical suspicion of zzso before zzso and zzso frequently associated internal carotid disease zzso with subsequent early surgery in zzso of the zzso Following adapted care in stroke unit, zzso prognosis appeared good zzso score zzso at zzso for zzso of the zzso 

Some clinical features are overrepresented in such zzso including initial transient symptoms preceding the onset of a completed deficit, zzso zzso and early zzso Despite lower initial severity, zzso justify early management in stroke unit, often followed by carotid surgery, leading to an overall good zzso
