To compare, in terms of their demonstration of tears of the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso obtained with the patient's shoulder in the abduction and external rotation zzso position, with conventional zzso MR zzso obtained with the patient's arm in the neutral zzso 

MR zzso of the shoulder, including additional zzso zzso sequences with the patient in the zzso position, was performed in 30 patients with a clinical history of zzso anterior shoulder zzso The degree of anterior zzso zzso tear or zzso was evaluated in both the conventional zzso and the zzso position by two zzso zzso were reached by consensus, and a zzso scale was zzso grade zzso grade zzso zzso diagnosed when subtle increased signal intensity in the zzso was zzso grade zzso zzso when a contrast zzso gap between the zzso and the zzso rim or deficient zzso was zzso The scores for each imaging sequence were averaged and to compare conventional zzso and zzso position scans, zzso zzso test was zzso 

In 21 zzso of 30 patients, the same degree of anterior instability was revealed by both imaging zzso Eight zzso had a lower grade in the zzso position than in the zzso position, while one zzso had a higher grade in the zzso zzso Three whose zzso scan was grade 1 showed only zzso evidence of zzso but their zzso zzso in which a contrast zzso gap between the zzso and the zzso rim was present, was grade zzso The average grade was zzso zzso for zzso scans and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The difference between zzso and zzso scans was statistically significant zzso 

MR zzso with the patient's shoulder in the zzso position is more efficient than conventional zzso scanning in revealing the degree of tear or zzso of the anterior zzso zzso When zzso features are seen at conventional zzso MR zzso zzso zzso imaging in the zzso position is zzso
