zzso to zzso magnetic stimulation zzso of the motor zzso depend on the direction of the induced current with an optimum perpendicular to the orientation of the zzso zzso Little is known about zzso in other cortical zzso We measured zzso thresholds in the visual zzso using a zzso zzso zzso Comparing horizontal and vertical current orientation as well as zzso and zzso zzso in 7 subjects, we found lower thresholds with zzso zzso and a tendency for lower thresholds with horizontal zzso When varying current directions in steps of 45 degrees centered on a hot spot over the zzso cortex, in 10 out of 12 zzso optimal current orientation ran perpendicular to the underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso current orientation was determined as the orientation of the second zzso from the zzso zzso of the stimulation sites that had been shifted along the respective current direction by the amount of the measured zzso Individual cortical architecture was obtained by zzso of a zzso anatomical MR zzso with large zzso differences among the zzso of the zzso zzso As with the motor system, the optimum threshold with zzso zzso was flipped about 180 degrees compared to the optimum with zzso zzso zzso throughout subjects, suggesting both similar zzso properties of networks in the visual and motor zzso and the existence of zzso zzso in any cortical zzso As a consequence, optimal zzso application should always take into account the individual orientation of the zzso to be zzso
