This study was aimed at investigating the quantitative relationship between regional brain volumes zzso amygdala, as well as zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and performance on zzso and retrograde memory tests in zzso zzso We used high-resolution zzso to measure brain volumes in 13 zzso zzso zzso testing was conducted zzso with zzso To control for age and sex, zzso volume zzso were calculated using zzso equations derived from a group of 87 healthy comparison zzso We found that zzso patients with severe zzso had zzso volumes that were zzso smaller than normal, whereas patients with mild or no zzso had normal zzso zzso Regional gray matter volumes in severe zzso zzso were substantially smaller than zzso Performances on zzso memory tests were significantly correlated with zzso and regional gray matter volume zzso There was a significant correlation between white matter volume (but not zzso zzso and performance on the Visual zzso zzso a zzso test of cognitive zzso There were no significant correlations between zzso measures and performance on a retrograde memory zzso Our results indicate a strong quantitative relationship between performance on zzso memory tests and zzso and regional gray matter volume zzso zzso between white matter volume zzso and performance on the zzso were found to be independent of zzso zzso Given the strong correlation between zzso volume and total gray matter volume zzso a zzso zzso measure of total gray matter volume may provide a good indication of clinical outcome in zzso
