Gene targeting techniques are a revolutionary tool in determining gene zzso The mouse is the only zzso in which these methods can be zzso For zzso and zzso zzso a broad zzso is available for the zzso However, for functional studies, the zzso to zzso mouse provides unique zzso We have successfully established zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure and heart rate zzso for the zzso We have also succeeded in measuring zzso blood flow, cortical and zzso blood flow, and zzso zzso rate under various zzso We have been able to make sophisticated assessments of zzso performance by using direct zzso zzso of pressure and zzso Other investigators have established zzso and zzso techniques for the zzso Imaging techniques for the mouse including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are currently zzso Thus, we will be able to characterize the physiology of any zzso mouse model that may become zzso
