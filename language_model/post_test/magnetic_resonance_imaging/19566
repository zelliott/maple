To evaluate the zzso zzso and technical quality of a dynamic contrast zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso 

Fifty patients underwent zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso time zzso time zzso flip angle, 12 zzso zzso in three zzso intermittent fat zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso in all zzso before and zzso after administration of zzso zzso with the first enhanced acquisition timed for zzso zzso dominance by using a test zzso of contrast zzso zzso and quantitative measures of image quality were zzso zzso of zzso and zzso anatomy were zzso Ten patients zzso underwent repeat imaging within 6 months, and zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso ratios for zzso and zzso portal zzso and equilibrium phase studies averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso phase, the liver enhanced a mean of zzso of the zzso enhancement as measured during portal zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso were comparable in distribution to those cited in published zzso Repeat studies were not significantly different in image quality when compared with original zzso 

zzso zzso phase zzso zzso zzso zzso images can be obtained reliably and zzso when timed by using a test dose of contrast zzso
