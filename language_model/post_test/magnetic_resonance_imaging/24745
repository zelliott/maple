Both cognitive and physical exercise have been discussed as promising interventions for healthy cognitive zzso The present study assessed the effects of cognitive training zzso zzso zzso zzso and physical training zzso training zzso zzso zzso on spatial learning and associated brain zzso in 33 adults zzso zzso zzso learning was assessed with a virtual maze task, and at the same time neural zzso were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Only the spatial training improved performance in the maze zzso These behavioral gains were accompanied by a decrease in frontal and zzso lobe zzso At zzso participants of the spatial training group showed lower activity than participants of the zzso training group in a network of brain regions associated with spatial learning, including the zzso and zzso zzso No significant differences were observed between the two physical intervention zzso 

zzso changes in neural systems associated with spatial navigation can be induced by cognitive interventions and seem to be stronger than effects of physical exercise in middle-aged zzso
