zzso acid, an zzso is reduced in multiple sclerosis zzso Patients with zzso have a reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso often the first manifestation of zzso is not known to be associated with reduced zzso zzso Patients with recent onset of ON were investigated to determine whether zzso acid levels were reduced at zzso zzso patients with ON were included, 17 females and 4 zzso The mean zzso serum zzso acid in the ON female group was zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whilst in the control group it was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the small male zzso mean zzso serum zzso acid was zzso zzso zzso zzso whilst in the control group it was zzso zzso zzso zzso These differences were not statistically zzso zzso zzso reserve is possibly an early zzso mechanism in inflammatory zzso and raises the possibility that low zzso acid levels could be an indicator of disease zzso Since zzso zzso of other causes were not investigated, future research needs to determine whether low zzso acid represents a unique feature of zzso zzso or is seen in other zzso zzso
