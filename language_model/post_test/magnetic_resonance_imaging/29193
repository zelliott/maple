The nature of the zzso in surgery for intractable zzso zzso lobe zzso is likely to be a principal factor determining seizure and zzso zzso However, there is no universally accepted system for describing the characteristics of individual zzso to allow comparison between patients and patient groups treated at different zzso We therefore developed a technique of zzso analysis of zzso lobe zzso 

With comparison of zzso zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans in 10 subjects, the volumes of six zzso lobe zzso were determined by manual zzso in the zzso and zzso images for each case, allowing the extent of zzso to be zzso 

The zzso and their extent of zzso were measured with acceptable zzso in each zzso 

We developed a reliable method for the quantitative description of zzso lobe zzso This will be of application in determining the relation between the zzso nature of the zzso in intractable zzso and the seizure and zzso zzso
