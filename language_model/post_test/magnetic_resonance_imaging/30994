Spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most common spinal vascular zzso It mainly affects men after the fifth decade and is usually an acquired zzso with an unknown zzso We report on a patient with the unusual finding of two separate zzso at the level of zzso on the right and zzso on the left zzso zzso selective spinal digital zzso zzso zzso was terminated with demonstration of a zzso at the level of zzso but incomplete demonstration of all zzso zzso Due to a zzso deterioration of the patient's neurological status, and persistent pathological vessels seen on zzso a second spinal zzso was performed 6 years later, demonstrating the second zzso at the level of zzso on the left side with a separate zzso drainage zzso A retrospective analysis of the zzso films suggested that both zzso had already been present 6 years zzso This conclusion is justified because of a transient and faint zzso of the left zzso zzso demonstrated on the films after injection of the right zzso zzso zzso We conclude that in the case of incomplete zzso and persistent clinical and MR findings not only reopening of the treated zzso has to be taken into account but also the existence of a second zzso Since this is the first case of a double zzso in our series of 129 zzso and given the few reported cases of double zzso we do not think that completion of selective spinal zzso has to be zzso routinely after a zzso has been zzso However, repeat zzso should be performed in patients who continue to zzso fail to improve with zzso zzso zzso or demonstrate delayed deterioration after a period of zzso
