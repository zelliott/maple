A pure zzso injury leads to cell membrane disruption and subsequent zzso swelling of the zzso The state of water in the injured area of a tissue is changed and differs from a healthy zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso which is very sensitive to the quality of the interaction between mobile zzso zzso and a restricted zzso zzso pool, is therefore a useful tool to characterize this zzso Here, we present a protocol designed to measure the difference between the values of the zzso magnetic relaxation time zzso in zzso of healthy and zzso injured zzso In addition, we present a method to evaluate the two main contributions to the zzso contrast, the degree of structural zzso of the cellular components (including a major contribution from membrane zzso and zzso The approach is useful in assessing the level of damage that electric shocks produce in muscle zzso in that zzso will resolve in time whereas structural changes require active repair zzso
