This study investigated whether dynamic zzso could determine microscopic zzso invasion in zzso 

Six patients with zzso who underwent total zzso of the tumor after chemotherapy were zzso 

The zzso slope value of the zzso curve was calculated on the basis of the zzso method on dynamic zzso performed after zzso Slope value modified log zzso zzso - zzso - zzso where zzso and zzso represent the signal intensity at time points zzso and zzso when the zzso slope started and ended, zzso The slope value was correlated with the zzso findings of the surgical zzso The findings on conventional zzso were also zzso 

In five of six patients microscopic tumor invasion ranging from 1 to zzso zzso in depth was zzso zzso The slope value within the microscopic invasion zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and less than that in areas showing zzso tumor invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso examination disclosed the zzso of small vessels within the zzso and microscopic zzso zzso on conventional zzso varied among zzso microscopic invasion was not detected in one, underestimated in two, and overestimated in zzso It is concluded that calculation of the slope value on dynamic zzso can discriminate regions of microscopic invasion from zzso zzso in patients with zzso after zzso
