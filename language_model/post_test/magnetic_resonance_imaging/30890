The response of patients with zzso to zzso procedures is not well zzso In this study, we assessed the zzso outcome of patients with primary and secondary zzso undergoing zzso or zzso deep brain zzso 

Fifteen patients with zzso had zzso surgery zzso or deep brain zzso These included nine patients with primary zzso zzso and cervical zzso and six with secondary zzso zzso zzso and zzso There were nine male patients and six female zzso The mean age at onset was 21 years for primary zzso and 18 years for secondary zzso The primary outcome measure was a Global zzso zzso score for zzso at 6 months after zzso Other outcome measures were the zzso zzso zzso zzso and Toronto Western zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The mean Global zzso zzso score at 6 months for patients with primary zzso was 3 zzso in both movement disorder and zzso In contrast, patients with secondary zzso had a mean score of zzso zzso or no improvement in movement disorder with no functional zzso All patients with primary zzso had normal brains by magnetic resonance imaging, whereas five of six patients with secondary zzso had zzso zzso abnormalities on their magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

This study indicates that primary zzso responds much better than secondary zzso to zzso zzso We could not distinguish a difference in efficacy between zzso and zzso deep brain zzso The presence of zzso zzso abnormalities on the zzso magnetic resonance imaging scan is an indicator of a lesser response to zzso interventions for zzso
