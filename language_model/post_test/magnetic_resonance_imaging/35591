zzso the mechanism of zzso between zzso events and zzso responses is important in zzso functional imaging of the zzso The stimulus frequency dependence of zzso responses has been studied using a rat zzso zzso zzso most results for short stimulus zzso reveal peak zzso at which the zzso response is zzso However, such peak zzso have not been observed in studies using blood zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso signals with long stimulus zzso To clarify whether the stimulus frequency dependence of zzso signals depends on the stimulus zzso we measured zzso signals at 7 T with zzso and zzso zzso for stimulating rat zzso at zzso zzso using zzso zzso imaging to enhance changes in zzso zzso For both these zzso zzso signals were significantly higher at stimulus zzso of 3 or 5 zzso in agreement with the results of previous studies using optical zzso Our results show that stimulus duration has little influence on the stimulus frequency dependence of zzso signals in the rat zzso zzso The zzso results of most previous zzso studies using zzso sequence may be ascribed to the difference of imaging to enhance zzso focus or draining zzso
