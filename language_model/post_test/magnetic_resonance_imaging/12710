zzso influencing the zzso zzso features of absence zzso in newly presenting children with idiopathic generalized zzso zzso have not been rigorously zzso We examined how specific factors such as state, zzso age, and zzso syndrome affect the zzso features of absence zzso 

Children with zzso absence zzso were studied using zzso zzso The influence of state of zzso provocation zzso zzso zzso age, and zzso syndrome on specific zzso features was zzso 

Five hundred nine zzso were evaluated in 70 children with the following zzso childhood absence zzso zzso 37, zzso zzso response zzso 10, juvenile absence zzso zzso 8, juvenile zzso zzso zzso 6, and zzso zzso zzso occurred in all syndromes but were more common in zzso They were brought out by zzso and sleep in fragments of generalized spike and wave zzso zzso were more likely to occur during zzso zzso but were not influenced by age zzso zzso was more likely to be zzso in zzso than zzso and in zzso than zzso zzso age and levels of zzso were more likely to result in organized zzso zzso specific to each child independently influenced zzso zzso the nature of these factors has not been zzso 

The zzso features of absence zzso are influenced by a complex interaction of age, zzso syndrome, level of zzso provoking factors, and other intrinsic zzso zzso syndrome alone cannot predict specific features of zzso however, zzso is more frequently associated with zzso and disorganization of the zzso
