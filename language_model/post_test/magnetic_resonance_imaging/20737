The startle zzso provides a unique tool for the investigation of zzso gating and information zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso online stimulation and recording in the MR zzso allows for the quantitative assessment of the zzso zzso of the startle zzso and its zzso on a single trial zzso This serves as the backbone for a startle response informed zzso analysis, which is fed by data acquired in the same brain at the same zzso We here present the first MR study using a single trial approach with simultaneous acquired zzso and zzso data on the human startle response in 15 healthy young zzso It investigates the neural zzso for isolated air puff startle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We identified a common core network engaged by all three conditions zzso zzso and zzso consisting of bilateral primary and secondary zzso zzso right zzso right thalamus, right zzso pole, middle zzso cortex, and zzso The zzso zzso exhibits distinct zzso patterns between the startle zzso It is zzso activated with the highest zzso for zzso a lower zzso for zzso and lowest for zzso The zzso frontal zzso exhibits a differential zzso pattern, not for the type of startle response but for the zzso zzso For pulse alone it is close to zzso for zzso it is zzso This is in contrast to zzso where it shows zzso In addition, the thalamus, the zzso and the anterior zzso zzso add to the zzso of the startle zzso
