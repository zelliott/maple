zzso of the zzso spine on zzso can be tedious if C2 and zzso are not included and may lead to errors in zzso zzso 

To determine whether zzso landmarks or external markers are reliable as an aid for accurate zzso of zzso zzso on zzso 

zzso zzso spine MR studies of 67 patients (30 zzso 37 zzso age range zzso zzso were zzso composed of 52 consecutive MR studies and an additional 15 zzso in which vitamin E markers were placed over the zzso In the 52 zzso MR examinations potential zzso aids such as the level of the zzso zzso pulmonary artery, zzso arch, and zzso or disc abnormalities were numbered on both cervical zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The additional 15 examinations in which vitamin E markers were placed over the skin were evaluated for consistency in the level of the markers on different sequences in the same zzso 

The zzso zzso level ranged from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso arch level ranged from zzso to T4 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in 17 zzso Pulmonary artery level ranged from T4 to zzso disc zzso in zzso patients zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In 3 of 12 patients who had abnormalities in a zzso body or disc as zzso point reference, the zzso image zzso the zzso In zzso zzso patients with vitamin E markers that were placed over the upper zzso spine, the results showed consistency in the level of the markers in relation to the reference points or consistent zzso gap between the zzso 

There are only two reliable ways to accurately define the levels if no landmarking feature is available on the zzso The first is by including C2 in the zzso sequence of a diagnostic quality, and the second is by using an zzso in the discs or zzso bodies as a point of zzso
