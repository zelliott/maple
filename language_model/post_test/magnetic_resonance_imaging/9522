The diagnosis of zzso zzso is considered if patients with zzso zzso disease present with zzso zzso However, cognitive deficits may occur in patients with chronic kidney disease zzso long before any overt neurological symptoms can be zzso We hypothesized that cognitive dysfunction in patients with zzso both, treated and zzso by zzso may zzso to zzso changes in distinct brain zzso 

We performed magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso of the brain in 23 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso and in 15 zzso zzso Healthy controls zzso zzso zzso adjusted for age and education were recruited from the social environment of the patients' zzso zzso learning and memory were assessed by zzso zzso 

MRS zzso were predominantly found in the white zzso zzso of zzso compounds zzso were decreased in zzso and zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso and combined zzso and zzso concentration zzso were reduced only in zzso zzso Disturbance in memory and learning ability as well as attention deficits were observed in both patient zzso Of note, attention deficits were more severe in zzso zzso MRS results correlated with attention deficits in zzso zzso 

zzso patients without clinical signs of zzso zzso showed zzso disturbances in distinct brain regions as well as cognitive zzso zzso was accompanied with more severe cognitive dysfunction and zzso zzso than zzso zzso Although the small sample size limits the interpretation of the data, a negative impact of zzso on cognitive function must be zzso
