To evaluate the technical feasibility and the clinical effectiveness of zzso for the treatment of zzso inclusion zzso zzso 

Between June 1996 and February 2001, eight zzso in seven female patients aged zzso zzso zzso years were instilled with zzso zzso in three, ethanol in three, both zzso and ethanol in zzso All seven patients subsequently experienced less abdominal zzso After drainage via an zzso zzso zzso inserted in the zzso zzso in six cases, zzso in one), zzso equivalent in volume to about one-third that of drained fluid was introduced daily until the drained volume was less than zzso zzso by means of clinical procedures and ultrasound was performed every three months, at which time the success rate, possible complications and recurrence were zzso 

zzso was technically successful in all seven patients, though immediately after the zzso minor complications were noted in three patients zzso pain in two, mild fever in zzso During the follow-up of zzso zzso zzso months, zzso proved successful and without long-term complications in all seven zzso lower abdominal pain disappeared and the diameter of the zzso decreased more than zzso with complete zzso in four zzso During the follow-up period there was no zzso 

zzso following zzso zzso is technically feasible and effective for the treatment of zzso
