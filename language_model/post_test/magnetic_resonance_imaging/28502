zzso Monkeys with large unilateral surgical zzso of zzso cortex, sustained either in adulthood or at 5-6 zzso of age, were trained on an zzso detection and zzso task and tested with visual stimuli in the zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso Monkeys with zzso sustained in adulthood were largely unable to detect stimuli in the zzso zzso to the zzso with only one monkey showing recovery toward the end of zzso Monkeys with zzso of zzso zzso made in zzso however, each showed residual detection capacity at the beginning of testing and improved to near normal by the end of zzso zzso Each of the monkeys showing a residual ability to detect within the zzso zzso was also able to zzso visual targets with eye zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that the vision surviving zzso zzso damage in primates is more robust after early damage as has been shown to be the case for primary zzso zzso and association zzso
