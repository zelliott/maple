To investigate whether rice pads can eliminate lingering fat signals of the complex surface shape of both hands that occur with chemical shift selective zzso at zzso and zzso 

zzso images were obtained with zzso using zzso and zzso zzso The same imaging parameters were used with and without rice pads on the zzso plane of both hands in 10 healthy zzso The zzso effects were classified into four categories and scored for images, and visual evaluations were performed by one zzso and one zzso zzso 

At zzso the mean evaluation score was zzso for images obtained without rice pads and zzso for images obtained with rice zzso At zzso the mean evaluation score was zzso for images obtained without rice pads and zzso for images obtained with rice zzso With both systems, images obtained with the rice pads showed significantly better fat suppression effects than images obtained without rice pads zzso zzso 

It was confirmed that lingering fat signals are eliminated and good zzso images are obtained with the use of rice pads at zzso and zzso Rice pads are therefore useful with at zzso and zzso which are currently becoming more widely zzso
