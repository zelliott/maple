We report four consecutive cases of zzso aneurysm of an zzso left zzso artery in patients with a zzso zzso arch and the results of a systematic review of the zzso In our cohort of patients, three had an aneurysm limited to the origin of the zzso zzso artery, causing zzso and zzso and one had an aneurysm involving also the zzso arch and the entire descending zzso zzso causing zzso of the right zzso zzso A left zzso zzso was performed in association with the zzso zzso and a right zzso was used in all zzso One of the patients underwent surgery with deep zzso and circulatory arrest, and the others with the adjunct of a zzso zzso The repair was accomplished with an zzso graft in two patients and with zzso in the zzso The zzso course was complicated by respiratory failure and prolonged ventilation in one patient, and one patient died because of severe pulmonary zzso The survivors are alive and well at a follow-up of 1 to 3 zzso Only 32 cases of zzso zzso arch with an aneurysm of the zzso zzso artery have been reported: 12 were associated with zzso zzso and 2 presented with zzso zzso repair was accomplished in 29 zzso A number of operative strategies were zzso right zzso bilateral zzso left zzso with zzso zzso with right zzso and left zzso In only 12 cases was the zzso artery zzso We believe that a right zzso provides good exposure and avoids the morbidity associated with bilateral zzso or zzso and zzso We feel that a left zzso zzso completed before the zzso approach zzso the zzso distribution without increasing the complexity of the zzso zzso
