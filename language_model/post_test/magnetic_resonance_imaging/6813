In this work, the dependence of parallel zzso performance on main magnetic field strength is zzso zzso Using the general framework of zzso zzso the zzso behavior of the relevant zzso fields at a single physical field strength of 7 T is zzso In the chosen zzso this is accomplished by adjusting the zzso and zzso of a homogeneous zzso zzso With different mixing ratios of zzso ethanol, zzso water, zzso and sodium zzso field strengths in the range of zzso to zzso T are zzso Based on sensitivity maps of an zzso receiver zzso the zzso performance of parallel imaging is assessed in terms of the geometry factor zzso which reflects noise enhancement in parallel imaging zzso At low field strengths the zzso penalty was nearly independent of zzso and favorably low for zzso reduction factors up to between 3 and zzso At higher field strengths the transition between favorable and prohibitive parallel imaging conditions was found to shift toward higher feasible reduction zzso These findings are in good agreement with previous theoretical zzso From this agreement it is concluded that parallel zzso at high zzso benefits specifically from zzso zzso behavior of the involved zzso zzso
