zzso zzso of the right-handers has left zzso language zzso Within the language dominant zzso zzso area is of crucial importance for a variety of linguistic zzso As a result, zzso zzso in and around zzso area is zzso However, studies showed that by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in this region can be safely zzso We report unexpected zzso findings in a right-handed patient who underwent zzso zzso in the left prefrontal zzso 

Language functions in this right-handed patient were extensively examined in the zzso zzso and zzso phase by means of a zzso battery of zzso and zzso zzso zzso obtained in the zzso and zzso phase are zzso In addition, zzso zzso findings and zzso functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso and zzso zzso Imaging zzso results are zzso 

zzso zzso near zzso area was safely performed since no positive language sites were found during zzso zzso Since no linguistic deficits occurred in the zzso zzso or zzso phase, zzso language dominance was zzso zzso zzso however, disclosed permanent executive zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed right cerebral language dominance as well as a crossed zzso functional link with the left zzso zzso 

zzso right zzso language dominance in this right-handed patient is reflected zzso zzso the total absence of language problems in the zzso zzso and zzso phase, zzso absence of positive stimulation sites during zzso zzso a clearly more pronounced zzso zzso in the right cerebral zzso zzso zzso a crossed functional connection between the right zzso and the left zzso zzso Two hypothetical explanations for the pattern of crossed cerebral language dominance are put zzso zzso zzso brain plasticity mechanisms inducing a shift of language functions to the right zzso or zzso right zzso language dominance as a zzso zzso This case with zzso cerebral language dominance shows that although zzso is the zzso zzso to identify eloquent language regions and their zzso zzso and zzso are important zzso to guide surgery, to identify language zzso and to study zzso zzso
