In this study we sought to evaluate the effects of multiple freezing and zzso cycles on two MR parameters to study Achilles tendon, zzso and zzso 

Four fresh Achilles zzso were zzso on a zzso clinical scanner and again after 1, 2, 4, and 5 zzso cycles with zzso zzso and zzso echo time zzso zzso zzso of interest were manually drawn over the entire Achilles zzso and zzso zzso were used to determine zzso and zzso relaxation zzso 

There was no statistically significant difference in mean zzso or zzso values between the fresh specimens and after subsequent cycles of zzso treatment zzso Linear zzso between zzso zzso values at baseline and after successive zzso cycles demonstrated moderate agreement zzso whereas zzso zzso values at baseline and after zzso zzso cycles demonstrated strong agreement zzso 

These findings suggest that changes between specimens seen in zzso are due to factors other than frozen zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that there is stronger agreement between baseline zzso and successive zzso zzso values of zzso obtained with the zzso technique in comparison to zzso values obtained with a conventional clinical zzso zzso
