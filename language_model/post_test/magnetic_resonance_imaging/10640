The effects of type 1 diabetes and key zzso variables on brain structure are not well zzso Sensitive methods of assessing brain structure, such as zzso zzso zzso have not previously been used to investigate central nervous system changes in a diabetic zzso Using zzso we compared type 1 diabetic patients aged zzso years with disease duration of zzso years and minimal diabetes complications with an zzso zzso control zzso We investigated whether lower than expected gray matter zzso were present, and if so, whether they were associated with zzso control and history of severe zzso zzso In comparison with control subjects, diabetic patients showed lower density of gray matter in several brain zzso Moreover, in the patient group, higher zzso levels and severe zzso events were associated with lower density of gray matter in brain regions responsible for language processing and zzso Our study represents the first comprehensive study of gray matter density changes in type 1 diabetes and suggests that persistent zzso and acute severe zzso have an impact on brain zzso
