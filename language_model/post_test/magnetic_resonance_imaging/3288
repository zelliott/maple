The human zzso is densely populated with zzso and zzso repetitive zzso Although the impact of these zzso and elements on human zzso evolution is zzso the significance of subtle variations in their sequence remains mostly zzso Here we report zzso mapping of an infantile neurodegenerative disease locus in a genetic zzso Complete DNA sequencing of the zzso linkage locus revealed a point zzso in a zzso zzso that was transcribed as part of a unique zzso zzso which was expressed in the zzso In zzso zzso of this zzso increased zzso zzso consistent with the inappropriate dosage of this zzso in zzso and with the zzso Moreover, structural analysis of the sequence revealed a small zzso hairpin that was consistent with the putative gain of a functional site when zzso We show here that a zzso in a unique zzso zzso zzso is associated with lethal zzso and we suggest that zzso that harbor zzso recent repetitive elements may play important roles in human brain zzso
