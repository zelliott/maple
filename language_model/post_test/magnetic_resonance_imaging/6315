Five zzso and zzso derivatives have been zzso and their zzso stability zzso have been measured using a simple zzso zzso These results are compared to stability zzso measured for zzso binding to two different zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso for zzso binding to zzso and zzso relative to zzso decrease by log K zzso zzso and zzso respectively, the blood pH conditional zzso differ from zzso only by log K zzso zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding zzso and zzso zzso of zzso show considerably lower zzso and conditional zzso This has important implications in the zzso attachment of zzso to zzso for use in magnetic resonance zzso The measured binding zzso for zzso and zzso suggest that many of the zzso molecules in these systems, prepared under our experimental conditions, are zzso The model compound results indicate that it is important to use methods in attaching zzso to zzso which zzso zzso of the zzso Otherwise, their affinity for zzso and consequently their usefulness as zzso contrast agents may be severely zzso
