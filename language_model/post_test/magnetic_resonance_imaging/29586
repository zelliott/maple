A novel and automated technique is described for removing zzso image artifacts resulting from motion outside of the imaging field of zzso The technique is based on the zzso transform zzso a mathematical operation that provides the frequency content at each time point within a zzso zzso Using this technique, zzso zzso zzso zzso are performed on raw image data to obtain phase zzso The time series of phase magnitude for each and every point in the phase profile is then subjected to the ST to obtain a zzso zzso The zzso location of an artifact is identified based on the magnitude of a frequency component relative to the median magnitude of that zzso occurrence over all time zzso After each artifact frequency is removed by replacing its magnitude with the median zzso an inverse ST is applied to regain the MR zzso Brain activity detection within zzso zzso is improved by significantly reducing image artifacts that overlap anatomical regions of zzso The major advantage of zzso is that artifact zzso may be removed within a narrow zzso while preserving the frequency information at all other time zzso
