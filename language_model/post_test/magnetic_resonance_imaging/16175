The aim of the study described here was to examine the relationship between memory function, zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso discharge zzso zzso in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso related to unilateral zzso zzso zzso 

We assessed performance on tests of memory function and intelligence zzso zzso in 29 right-handed zzso and 24 zzso zzso were assessed on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Patients had zzso at zzso zzso 

There was a negative correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Learning Test results zzso and zzso zzso zzso findings and zzso duration zzso and between zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso structures in the left zzso zzso zzso findings, zzso and verbal function were zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso and zzso ratios reflecting neural metabolism are closely related to verbal memory function in zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso activity on the zzso was associated with a decline in total zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
