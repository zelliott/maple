To describe a sign in magnetic resonance zzso imaging that could reflect the state of the cochlear nerve before zzso surgery in small zzso zzso 

Thirty-one patients with serviceable hearing underwent zzso MR imaging before zzso zzso The presence of cochlear zzso enhancement on zzso zzso images obtained after the administration of contrast material was compared with the results of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso enhancement was present in 13 patients, and all of them had total hearing loss after zzso There was no cochlear zzso enhancement in 18 zzso 15 maintained serviceable hearing after surgery, and three had zzso hearing loss with no serviceable hearing zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso enhancement on zzso zzso images seems to be a reliable sign for analyzing the state of the cochlear zzso The absence of cochlear zzso enhancement could become an additional criterion for selecting the surgical approach in zzso zzso
