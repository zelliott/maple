zzso is a unique zzso period when regions of the brain most able to assess risk and reward are still in zzso zzso use during adolescence has been associated with persistent negative zzso Although measures of resting brain activity are useful in assessing functional zzso such measures have not been broadly applied in adolescent zzso 

The goal of the present study was to analyze the associations between zzso use and resting brain activity in a sample of high-risk zzso 

zzso high-risk youth between zzso years old were recruited from a juvenile justice day zzso Youth completed a brief zzso battery including assessments of zzso use and a zzso resting functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso connectivity networks were extracted using the GIFT zzso Brain activity in a zzso network was compared in youth with high zzso use zzso low zzso use using an zzso zzso with alcohol use entered as a zzso 

Analysis revealed two elements within the zzso network related to zzso zzso one in middle frontal zzso related to high zzso use, and one in middle zzso zzso related to low zzso zzso Only the frontal source survived application of a cluster size threshold and was significant at p zzso zzso 

These results are consistent with patterns of activity in adult zzso The observed effect may reflect either pre-existing risk factors or zzso consequences of zzso zzso Prevention and intervention strategies that address zzso functioning may be particularly helpful in this zzso
