To prove the usefulness of zzso zzso Imaging zzso in determining the invasion of zzso cervical cancer with imaging planes, we evaluated 44 patients with zzso proved cervical zzso zzso was performed with a zzso zzso T zzso zzso and a zzso image was zzso In zzso planes, the accuracy was zzso for zzso zzso It was impossible to diagnose in zzso zzso and zzso the invasion of the zzso body, zzso and zzso zzso In zzso planes, the accuracy was zzso zzso and zzso for the invasion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was impossible to diagnose in zzso the invasion of the zzso zzso In zzso planes, the accuracy was zzso zzso and zzso for invasion of the zzso body, zzso and zzso zzso In all 39 cases it was impossible to diagnose zzso zzso In five cases, zzso failed to detect the tumor in any of the three planes, but in three cases it was able to detect the tumor in at least one of the zzso We conclude as zzso 1) zzso is a useful method in determining the invasion of cervical zzso 2) zzso planes are recommended for the determination of zzso invasion, zzso planes for the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso planes for the zzso body, zzso and zzso 3) All three planes are needed to determine cervical zzso
