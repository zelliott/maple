There have been few zzso studies of pediatric zzso a common often fatal tropical zzso We undertook a prospective study of pediatric CM to better characterize the zzso features of this syndrome, comparing findings in children meeting a stringent definition of CM with those in a control group who were infected with malaria but who were likely to have a zzso cause of zzso 

zzso children admitted with traditionally defined CM zzso coma, and no other coma zzso zzso were eligible for this zzso The presence or absence of malaria zzso was zzso zzso findings in children with zzso CM zzso were compared with those with zzso CM zzso Two zzso blinded to zzso status jointly developed a scoring procedure for image interpretation and provided independent zzso zzso findings were compared between patients with and without zzso to assess the specificity of changes for patients with very strictly defined zzso 

Of 152 children with clinically defined zzso 120 were zzso and 32 were zzso zzso much more common in the patients with zzso CM were markedly increased brain zzso abnormal zzso signal zzso and zzso abnormalities in the zzso deep gray, and white matter zzso zzso abnormalities rarely respected zzso vascular zzso Most of the findings in the more clinically zzso zzso group were normal, and none of the abnormalities noted were more prevalent in zzso 

zzso zzso findings present in patients meeting a stringent definition of CM may offer insights into disease zzso and zzso
