The purpose of this study was to evaluate dynamic MR imaging in assessing the depth of zzso invasion by zzso of the zzso and to compare dynamic MR imaging with zzso and zzso zzso MR zzso 

zzso patients with zzso that was clinically considered to be confined to the zzso were examined with zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging before zzso We evaluated enhancement patterns of the zzso and tumor and assessed the degree of zzso invasion with MR zzso The degree of zzso invasion was divided into two groups: superficial disease (no zzso invasion or invasion of zzso or zzso 3 zzso and deep invasion zzso 3 zzso of zzso zzso Then we compared these MR findings with zzso results for the depth of zzso zzso 

With dynamic MR imaging, cervical zzso with deep invasion was seen as a focal enhanced area in the early dynamic zzso The cervical zzso and zzso enhanced less zzso In distinguishing deep invasion from superficial disease, we found the accuracy of zzso MR images, dynamic MR images, and zzso zzso MR images to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso In particular, the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso invasion with dynamic MR images was significantly higher than that with the other zzso with zzso MR images, we saw zzso zzso of zzso invasion in zzso of zzso with dynamic MR images, in zzso and with zzso zzso MR images, in zzso zzso disease was not revealed with any of the three MR zzso 

We believe that dynamic MR imaging is superior to zzso MR imaging and zzso zzso MR imaging when assessing the depth of invasion of cervical zzso
