With the goal to minimize the risk of zzso in zzso and spinal zzso surgery, methods of zzso mapping using direct electrical zzso were developed in the last zzso However, the current was delivered with a zzso zzso with risk of a zzso or using a bipolar probe or silicone strip with 5 zzso of zzso To improve the accuracy and zzso of the zzso the authors describe in this work a new device with the following zzso bipolar probe without current zzso reduction of the space tips to 2 zzso building of a bent handle, improving the field of view and zzso under the zzso This device has been used successfully in 6 consecutive patients, 4 harboring a zzso zzso and 2 with a spinal zzso zzso This new device allows the surgeon to perform repetitive zzso zzso and spinal zzso electrical mapping under the microscope in a very simple, quick and accurate way all along the zzso Improvement of such a mapping first zzso the risk of zzso second zzso the quality of zzso and third may also give a zzso value concerning the changes of zzso recovery in case of a zzso zzso
