The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using the zzso PET images zzso as a means for the zzso of PET zzso 

A three-step zzso zzso process is zzso In step 1, a patient's body zzso is segmented from the zzso using an active zzso zzso zzso inside the zzso are then assigned a value of zzso zzso to represent the zzso zzso of soft tissue at zzso zzso This segmented zzso map is then used to correct for zzso the raw PET data and the resulting PET images are used as the input to Step 2 of the zzso In step 2, the lung region is segmented using an optimal zzso approach and the corresponding zzso are assigned a value of zzso zzso representing the zzso zzso of lung tissue at zzso zzso The updated zzso map is then used for a second time to correct for zzso the raw PET data, and the resulting PET images are used as the input to step zzso The purpose of Step 3 is to delineate parts of the heart and liver in the lung zzso using a region growing approach since these parts were unavoidably excluded in the lung zzso in step zzso These parts are then corrected by using a value of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Finally the zzso zzso of the bed are included based on CT images to eliminate the impact of the couch on the accuracy of zzso The final zzso map is then used to zzso the raw PET data and generates the final PET image, which we name zzso zzso PET zzso To assess the proposed zzso approach, a phantom and 14 patients (with a total of 55 zzso including zzso were scanned on a GE zzso zzso zzso zzso images were generated using the proposed process and compared to those of zzso PET zzso Visual inspection, zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso between zzso and zzso for phantom and patient studies were performed to assess the accuracy of image zzso 

Visual inspection showed a small difference in lung zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso based on zzso were on average different by zzso zzso compared to the zzso from the zzso in the phantom zzso zzso For bone zzso only, the average difference was zzso The zzso comparing zzso and zzso resulted in an average zzso line of zzso with zzso 

zzso results suggest that zzso for the zzso of PET images is zzso Such an approach can potentially be used for dedicated PET or zzso hybrid systems while minimizing scan time or potential image artifacts, zzso
