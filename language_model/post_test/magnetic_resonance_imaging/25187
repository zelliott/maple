zzso disease zzso cell zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso disorder affecting the central and peripheral nervous zzso The authors performed MRS to characterize zzso zzso and their regional variation in brain tissue in zzso in zzso 

zzso of cerebral zzso zzso were assessed in seven patients with zzso proven zzso with zzso two with zzso and one with adult zzso quantitative localized zzso MRS of standardized brain zzso 

In infantile zzso pronounced zzso of both zzso and zzso compounds in affected white matter reflected zzso and zzso zzso The accompanying decrease of zzso pointed to zzso zzso Gray matter showed similar, albeit much milder zzso In juvenile zzso MRS indicated zzso with minor zzso damage in white zzso In a patient with adult zzso results of MRS of affected white matter were close to zzso MRS data are in agreement with zzso features of zzso 

zzso MRS provides a powerful tool for assessing zzso disturbances and the extent of brain damage zzso in zzso
