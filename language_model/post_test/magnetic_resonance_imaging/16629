The primary visual zzso zzso when zzso is characterized by an easily identifiable anatomical zzso the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso However, the origin and function of the zzso stripe is so far zzso In order to shed some light on this question, we acquired zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso brain scans of zzso blind zzso people, who have never had visual zzso If the zzso of zzso requires visual input to develop or to maintain its zzso such subjects should lack this zzso If it is reliably zzso in the zzso it must form and persist independently of visual zzso This question has never previously been explored in living zzso For the first time, the use of zzso high-resolution zzso enables such investigations because of the excellent zzso ratio at this magnetic field zzso For comparison, we scanned sighted subjects using the same experimental zzso We detected the zzso of zzso reliably in both sighted and blind subjects, showing that this anatomical feature is not a zzso result of visual zzso and it does not zzso in the absence of visual zzso
