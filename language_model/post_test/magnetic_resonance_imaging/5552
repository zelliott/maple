zzso cerebrovascular responses to zzso and zzso is important for investigating zzso regulation of cerebral zzso We characterized zzso vascular changes in the brains of zzso healthy rats using magnetic resonance imaging zzso while the rats zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We used echo zzso imaging zzso zzso spin labeling zzso and zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso to zzso vascular responses as measured by blood zzso level dependence zzso cerebral blood flow zzso cerebral blood volume zzso zzso volume zzso and vessel size index zzso in multiple brain zzso zzso resulted in a statistically significant increase in zzso zzso signal and significant decrease in zzso and zzso zzso During zzso we observed significant increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite the regional zzso general trends of zzso and zzso were reflected in zzso changes during zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, there was an evident spatial disparity between the zzso and zzso zzso functional zzso zzso that is, cortical and zzso regions of the brain exhibited notable differences in response to the two zzso zzso parameters measured in the cortical regions showed greater zzso to zzso whereas these same parameters measured in zzso regions showed greater zzso to zzso Our results demonstrate significant changes of zzso zzso parameters during systemic zzso and zzso in normal cerebral zzso These zzso changes are zzso distinctive, suggesting important feasibility for zzso controlling local cerebral zzso
