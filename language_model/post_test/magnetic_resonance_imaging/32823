Object recognition occurs even when environmental information is zzso zzso contours zzso in which a zzso is perceived though the zzso edges are incomplete, have been extensively studied as an example of such a visual completion zzso Despite the neural activity in response to zzso in visual cortical areas from low zzso and zzso to high zzso the lateral zzso zzso levels, the details of the neural processing underlying zzso perception are largely not zzso For example, how do the visual areas function in zzso perception and how do they interact to archive the coherent zzso zzso zzso perception involves the process of completing the local discrete zzso edges zzso zzso and the process of representing the global completed zzso information zzso zzso Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to zzso zzso completion and zzso representation by varying each in opposite zzso The results show that the neural activity was stronger to stimuli with more zzso completion than to stimuli with more zzso representation in zzso and zzso which was the reverse of that in the zzso When inspecting the neural activity change across the visual pathway, the zzso remained high for the stimuli with more zzso completion and increased for the stimuli with more zzso zzso These results suggest distinct neural zzso of zzso completion and zzso zzso and the possible collaboration between the two processes during zzso perception, indicating a neural connection between the discrete retinal input and the coherent visual zzso
