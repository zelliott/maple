To evaluate the zzso zzso method for diagnosis of breast zzso detected on zzso MR zzso 

MR imaging was performed in 40 women with 120 suspected breast zzso in zzso and/or zzso The contrast zzso was converted by zzso software on a zzso basis into color-coded zzso zzso diagnosis was made by analysis of color intensity and color zzso The zzso results were compared with the results of the zzso zzso zzso In 16 patients, we were able to correlate the results with zzso zzso 

The zzso method could successfully be performed in all MR zzso Forty zzso zzso had a diameter of less than 5 zzso 56 zzso zzso between 5 and 10 zzso and 24 zzso zzso were greater than 1 zzso Of all 120 zzso 65 zzso showed zzso contrast zzso In 117 zzso of all 120 zzso the results of zzso and the automated zzso method were considered zzso However, in three zzso the manual zzso differed from the zzso zzso After a second, repeated manual zzso placement, we were able to confirm equivalent results with the zzso images as zzso 

The zzso method automatically and reliably converts contrast kinetic information of the entire breast into a color-coded zzso The zzso method presents kinetic information of the entire dynamic series in an zzso format and this automated method may allow to zzso time-consuming and sometimes zzso manual zzso zzso This method displays the zzso of the contrast enhancement pattern often observed in zzso zzso and makes it usable as diagnostic zzso
