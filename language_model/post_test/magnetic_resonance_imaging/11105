In the macaque, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensory information for planning and zzso complex zzso In particular, the areas around the zzso zzso zzso serve as an interface between the sensory and motor systems to allow for coordinated movements in zzso Because recent imaging studies suggest a comparable functional and anatomical organization of human and monkey zzso we hypothesized that in humans, as in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, changes of neural activity were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while healthy subjects performed a zzso paradigm similar to the ones previously employed in zzso for studying area zzso As hypothesized, zzso coordinate transformation zzso zzso hand movements activated superior zzso zzso with the local maximum of increased neural activity lying in the zzso wall of zzso Compared to the respective zzso control conditions, zzso hand movements under predominantly zzso control activated a more anterior part of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was more responsive to visually guided hand zzso zzso the two coordinate transformation conditions, changing the zzso of movement guidance zzso did not significantly alter the zzso signal within zzso but demonstrated differential recruitment of zzso specific areas such as zzso and zzso zzso 5, zzso The data suggest that the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transformation processes to control zzso hand movements independently from the zzso processing of visual or zzso zzso
