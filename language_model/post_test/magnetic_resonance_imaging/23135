zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in auditory experiments is a challenge, because the scanning procedure produces considerable noise that can interfere with the auditory zzso The noise might either mask the auditory material zzso or interfere with stimuli designed to evoke emotions because it sounds loud and rather zzso zzso scanning zzso that allow zzso auditory stimulation and image acquisition appear to be zzso The sparse zzso sampling zzso technique uses a very long repetition time in order to achieve a stimulus presentation in the absence of scanner zzso Although only relatively few volumes are acquired for the resulting data sets, there have been recent studies where this method has furthered remarkable zzso A new development is the zzso silent steady state zzso zzso Compared with zzso this method is capable of acquiring several volumes in the time frame between the auditory trials zzso the zzso is kept in a steady state during stimulus zzso In order to draw conclusions about the optimum zzso procedure with auditory zzso different zzso imaging zzso acquisition schemes were zzso Continuous zzso zzso and zzso The total acquisition time of each sequence was adjusted to about zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso approach exhibits the highest sensitivity in detecting subtle activity in zzso brain zzso
