We previously reported large-scale reorganization of visual processing zzso zzso of zzso zzso by peripheral zzso in two individuals with loss of zzso input from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Reorganization of visual processing in zzso zzso Journal of zzso zzso zzso Here, we replicate this result in three new zzso Further, we test the hypothesis that this reorganization is dependent on complete loss of zzso zzso In two other individuals with extensive retinal zzso but some zzso sparing we found no evidence for zzso We conclude that large-scale reorganization of visual processing in MD occurs only in the complete absence of functional zzso zzso
