We sought to evaluate an zzso method for zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso using zzso and a zzso for simultaneous cardiac and respiratory zzso 

Five series of zzso images zzso time zzso zzso zzso inversion time zzso 1,200 zzso were obtained in 6 volunteers during the zzso zzso series 1, zzso series 2, zzso series 3, zzso and zzso using the signal of the zzso zzso series 4, zzso and zzso using the external signal of the zzso and series 5, not zzso and zzso using the signal of the zzso Standard zzso of the lung zzso and zzso mismatch zzso were zzso The relative zzso change zzso was zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso maps were obtained from zzso analysis of the ventilation zzso Mean correlation zzso zzso and the percentage of activated zzso over the lung zzso were calculated from these zzso All 5 parameters were compared among the 5 series zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In series 4, zzso and zzso were significantly lower than in respiratory and zzso series zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 and zzso In the same series zzso and zzso also were significantly higher than in series 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was not significantly different among all zzso 

zzso respiratory and cardiac synchronization can be achieved in zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso using a zzso for real-time targeting of zzso
