zzso is a systematic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and zzso deterioration of bone zzso This leads to diminished zzso competence of the skeleton and is associated with zzso or zzso zzso In the past decade, considerable progress has been made in the development of methods for assessing the skeleton zzso so that osteoporosis can be better zzso While dual X-ray zzso zzso is still the preferred methodology, several limitations will be zzso Another zzso technique which is widely accepted for diagnosis of spinal osteoporosis is single energy zzso zzso of zzso zzso bone mineral density zzso demonstrate larger percentage zzso between zzso subjects and normal controls, and zzso higher relative risks for zzso fracture than either zzso or lateral zzso zzso As an emerging alternative to zzso zzso techniques, there is a growing interest in the use of quantitative ultrasound zzso zzso for the zzso assessment of zzso fracture risk in the management of zzso The attractiveness of zzso lies in the fact that indirect and in zzso experience has suggested that ultrasound may give information not only about zzso but also about architecture and zzso Whether or not combining zzso and zzso improve fracture prediction is still unclear and needs further zzso Due to the growing evidence supporting the use of zzso in osteoporosis and the large number of zzso devices already on the market, a general clinical consensus on the application of zzso is urgently zzso Other techniques that are less widely used for the management of zzso For example, peripheral quantitative zzso zzso quantitative magnetic resonance zzso and magnetic resonance zzso are promising tools for the evaluation of the zzso For example, the ability of zzso and high resolution magnetic resonance imaging has been explored and shows promise as a technique for assessing zzso bone structure in zzso
