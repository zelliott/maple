In this paper we aim to lay down and demonstrate the use of multiple zzso imaging zzso as a tool for capturing and characterizing zzso MR signals and repetitive disturbances zzso with high zzso zzso To achieve this goal, various zzso zzso sequences were derived from the nearest standard zzso imaging sequences by zzso replacing the zzso of a zzso slab by the zzso of a zzso slice zzso to the read zzso zzso setting the zzso zzso to zero, and zzso leaving out the inverse zzso transform in the read zzso The thus created zzso zzso albeit slow with regard to the spatial zzso part, were shown to result into a series of densely spaced zzso zzso images in the time domain enabling monitoring of the evolution of the zzso with a high zzso resolution and without interference from any zzso zzso The high-speed capabilities of zzso were demonstrated by capturing and characterizing the free induction zzso and spin echoes of substances with long zzso zzso zzso and long and short zzso (4 - zzso zzso and by monitoring the zzso of the zzso zzso by, respectively, a titanium cylinder, representing a zzso zzso a zzso magnetic field zzso representing a stimulus inherent to a conventional zzso zzso and a zzso electric zzso representing an external zzso The results of the study indicate the potential of zzso for assessing the evolution of the zzso and, when properly synchronized with the zzso zzso disturbances zzso with a zzso resolution that is ultimately limited by the bandwidth of the receiver, but in practice governed by the zzso of the experiment and the magnitude of the zzso Potential applications of zzso can be zzso in research areas that are concerned with MR signal behavior, MR system performance and MR evaluation of zzso evoked zzso
