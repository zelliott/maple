Studies have zzso in their findings of relatively less gray matter volume zzso in zzso zzso in bilateral zzso and left zzso cortical zzso However, the interpretation of these results has been zzso The reported zzso differences in zzso may be zzso to the reading problems, following from, for example, neural migration errors that occurred during early human development and before learning to zzso zzso less zzso may represent the consequence of an impoverished reading experience, akin to the zzso zzso differences attributed to illiterate compared with literate zzso Most zzso a combination of these factors is driving these zzso Here we attempt to zzso these influences by using a reading zzso design, where dyslexic children were contrasted not only with zzso controls, but also with younger controls who read at the same level as the zzso zzso with previous reports, zzso showed less zzso in multiple left and right zzso regions, including left superior zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso However, not all of these differences emerged when zzso were compared with controls matched on reading abilities, with only right zzso zzso zzso surviving this second zzso When similar analyses were performed for white matter volume, no regions emerged from both zzso These results indicate that the zzso differences in zzso reported here and in prior studies are in large part the outcome of experience zzso zzso reading zzso compared with controls, with only a fraction of the differences being driven by zzso per zzso
