This pilot study investigated the feasibility of using zzso based on zzso zzso contrast to detect zzso effects of locally induced zzso in a zzso tumor zzso zzso mice bearing zzso zzso prostate tumors zzso in the hind leg were zzso using a zzso T scanner using a zzso echo pulse sequence to acquire high spectral and spatial resolution zzso zzso zzso increases of approximately 6 zzso were produced in tumor tissue using zzso light from a 250 W zzso zzso zzso data were acquired over three slices through the tumor and leg both prior to and during zzso Water zzso were produced from these zzso for each zzso at each time zzso zzso changes in water resonance peak zzso were measured during 15 zzso of localized tumor zzso The results demonstrated that zzso produced both significant increases and decreases in water resonance peak zzso Average decreases in peak zzso were significantly larger in the tumor rim than in normal muscle zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso in tumor was zzso heterogeneous, zzso the standard zzso of the change in peak zzso was significantly larger in the tumor rim than in normal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso mild zzso produces zzso zzso changes in water peak zzso in both tumor and zzso This may reflect zzso effects of zzso on local zzso The peak zzso changes in tumor and muscle were significantly different, perhaps due to abnormal tumor zzso and zzso Response to zzso measured by zzso may be useful for identifying and/or characterizing suspicious zzso as well as guiding the development of new zzso zzso
