The current role of zzso ultrasound zzso is questioned because of recent progress in medical zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the accuracy of zzso in the detection of a zzso zzso zzso compared with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scan and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

This retrospective study included zzso patients evaluated using an zzso zzso scan zzso zzso zzso scan zzso and zzso alone or combined with a zzso zzso zzso zzso The pathological result was used as a gold zzso 

zzso rates for the number of detected zzso compared with pathology results were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Compared with pathology, the rate of zzso was significantly higher with zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was responsible for a change in operative strategy in zzso of zzso Surgery was extended in zzso limited in zzso and abandoned in zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso imaging, zzso is still superior for the detection of zzso and the planning of zzso zzso remains recommended as a routine procedure in patients having a zzso zzso in the era of modern zzso zzso
