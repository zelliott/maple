zzso has become increasingly used in the acute setting to manage patients with zzso There has been concern that zzso may not be sensitive in the detection of acute zzso zzso We assessed whether strongly zzso zzso would be sensitive to zzso zzso in the first few zzso 

In the course of our ongoing studies of zzso of acute zzso stroke in more than 200 patients, 35 patients had MR studies within 6 zzso Six of these patients who presented with acute focal symptoms with zzso time of clinical onset zzso to 5 zzso were found to have evidence of zzso zzso Standard zzso and zzso MR scans were zzso In 5 of the patients, zzso imaging and zzso sequences were performed to increase the sensitivity of magnetic zzso effects of the pulse zzso Four of the cases were of zzso zzso and 2 were zzso zzso The zzso was most evident as zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the more zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can detect zzso within zzso to 5 hours of onset of clinical symptoms as regions of marked signal loss due to zzso effects, whereas conventional MR scans of zzso stroke may appear zzso These results demonstrate that MR zzso sequences may be sensitive to zzso zzso and suggest that MR may be an adequate screen for primary zzso zzso
