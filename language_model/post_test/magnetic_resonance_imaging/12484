The zzso of zzso formation in real time is one potential benefit of carrying out zzso zzso under magnetic resonance zzso guidance in the treatment of zzso zzso MR zzso has the potential to detect such zzso However, performing MR zzso during cardiac zzso zzso requires high zzso and spatial resolution and a high zzso zzso In this study, a local MR zzso zzso zzso was developed to investigate the feasibility of performing limited field of view MR zzso with high accuracy and zzso The local MR zzso allowed high-resolution (1 zzso 1 zzso 3 zzso image acquisitions in zzso zzso with a field of view 64 zzso 32 zzso during an zzso animal zzso This represents a zzso image acquisition acceleration and an zzso field of view reduction compared to that achieved using external MR zzso The signal sensitivity achieved using the local zzso was over 20 times greater than that achievable using external coils with the same scan zzso The local zzso zzso provided fewer artifacts and sharper and more stable zzso These results demonstrate that MR zzso can be performed in the heart wall and that zzso formation can be observed during zzso zzso procedures in a canine zzso
