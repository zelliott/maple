This study examined the cognitive and neural development of attention switching using a simple zzso attention task and functional magnetic resonance imaging Fourteen children and adults made zzso among stimuli based on either shape or zzso Performance on these trials was compared to performance during blocked trials requiring all color or all shape zzso zzso resonance echo zzso images were acquired during performance of the zzso Both children and adults showed robust bilateral activity of the zzso nucleus when switching attention between color and shape zzso that correlated zzso with mean response zzso on these zzso However, neither switching costs nor zzso activity correlated with age, suggesting early development of the underlying neural zzso involved in switching between salient stimulus zzso Overall, children and adults differed in performance and patterns of brain activity on the task, with adults responding more accurately and faster than children, and recruiting more prefrontal and zzso zzso These results suggest an important role of zzso regions zzso zzso zzso in zzso attention zzso with increasing recruitment of cortical regions with zzso
