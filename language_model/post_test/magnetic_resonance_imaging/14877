To evaluate zzso quality and diagnostic differences between magnetic resonance zzso compatible 16 G and 18 G biopsy needles in zzso biopsy zzso of the zzso 

zzso MR compatible biopsy needles with a diameter of 16 G zzso zzso or 18 G zzso zzso were used to perform zzso in 88 patients with suspected prostate zzso After embedding and zzso length and zzso of all specimens zzso zzso in Group A, 143 in Group zzso were zzso zzso squeezing artifacts, and overall zzso were evaluated using a quality score from 0 (no zzso to 3 zzso tissue zzso Groups were statistically zzso zzso zzso were regarded as zzso 

zzso data were not significantly different between Group A and B with a mean age of 63 zzso zzso and 67 zzso zzso years; and a mean zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso Area of zzso zzso zzso specimens was significantly larger in Group A than in Group B with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso However, there were significantly more zzso without prostate tissue with 18 zzso zzso versus 3 zzso zzso in Groups A and B, respectively zzso zzso squeezing artifacts, and overall zzso were not statistically different between the two zzso The rate of prostate cancer in the zzso was also not significantly different between Groups A and B zzso and zzso zzso 

16 G biopsy needles do not provide a relevant diagnostic advantage over 18 G needles in zzso zzso use of 18 G needles is not discouraged and may even be preferred as it is not expected to result in a relevant degradation of zzso quality or compromise in prostate cancer detection zzso
