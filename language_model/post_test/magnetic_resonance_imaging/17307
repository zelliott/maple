This paper describes the construction of three zzso zzso zzso devices in large numbers, using a novel zzso strategy characterized by high mechanical stability, controlled zzso extreme zzso high zzso and the possibility of zzso sensing and zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated zzso of zzso and cells within the zzso thereby demonstrating one possible application in cell zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso images of the containers in zzso media suggest radio frequency zzso shielding and a zzso effect, providing characteristic zzso within the container, thereby allowing the containers to be easily zzso This demonstration is the first step toward the design of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
