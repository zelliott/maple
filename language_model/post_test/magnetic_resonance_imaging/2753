zzso attenuated inversion recovery zzso sequences produce selective zzso fluid zzso suppression by employing a very long inversion time zzso We used the zzso sequence to study patients with multiple sclerosis zzso at zzso zzso So far, a very long zzso (and long acquisition zzso has been used in a fully relaxed zzso zzso To speed up the zzso zzso we used a shorter zzso and demonstrated that complete zzso suppression can be maintained with partial zzso zzso by reducing zzso at the same zzso The introduction of partial zzso however, reduced the contrast between zzso and normal appearing white matter zzso zzso zzso suppression therefore had to be accepted to maintain sufficient zzso to zzso zzso Using a TE of 60 zzso the zzso and zzso performed equally well in the detection of zzso although the former provided poorer zzso zzso Both zzso zzso however, provided poorer zzso between zzso and zzso compared to conventional zzso zzso Although the long acquisition time of the zzso sequence can be reduced by using partial zzso complete zzso suppression and good zzso to zzso contrast are incompatible at short zzso Using a TE of 60 zzso conventional zzso sequences detect more zzso and provide better contrast between zzso and zzso than zzso sequences in zzso zzso
