Despite intense research on the blood zzso zzso zzso signal underlying functional magnetic resonance imaging, our understanding of its zzso basis is far from zzso In this study, it was investigated whether the so-called zzso zzso signal zzso is solely a passive vascular effect or actively induced by neural zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulation with zzso zzso screen as baseline condition were employed on eight human zzso Within the same region of interest, the positive zzso time courses for zzso and zzso stimuli were identical over the entire stimulus zzso In contrast, the zzso stimuli exhibited no zzso zzso signal zzso whereas the zzso stimuli caused a strong zzso zzso zzso To ease the zzso we performed an additional study measuring both zzso signal and cerebral blood flow zzso using zzso spin zzso Also for zzso a difference in the zzso period was found for the two zzso Thus, a passive blood volume effect as the only contributor to the zzso zzso comes short in explaining the zzso zzso zzso phenomenon for this particular zzso Rather, an additional active zzso zzso or zzso can strongly zzso the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso time course of zzso signal could potentially be used to differentiate zzso activity patterns that are otherwise indistinguishable using the positive evoked zzso
