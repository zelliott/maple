The aim of the current study was to characterize the MR appearance of solitary zzso tumor of the zzso zzso 

Twenty-two consecutive patients with zzso confirmed zzso were zzso evaluated with zzso 

zzso demonstrated low signal intensity zzso zzso 18, zzso iso signal intensity zzso zzso 2, zzso and high signal intensity zzso zzso 2, zzso on zzso zzso On zzso images, tumors were observed as low signal intensity zzso zzso 10, zzso high signal intensity zzso zzso 2, zzso and mixed signal intensity zzso zzso 10, zzso Solid component in the proliferation of tumor cells corresponded to low signal intensity in 12 tumors zzso on zzso zzso On zzso zzso images, zzso enhancement zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso enhancement zzso zzso 6, zzso and homogeneous enhancement zzso zzso 4, zzso were zzso The enhanced zzso within the tumors had dense tumor tissue and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso shows variable appearance and enhancement pattern on zzso according to zzso tumor zzso
