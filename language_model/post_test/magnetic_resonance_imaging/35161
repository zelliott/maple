Speech comprehension in noisy environments is greatly improved by the availability of visual information, zzso lip and facial zzso This suggests that the brain is in possession of an audiovisual integration mechanism supplementing speech zzso To reveal the respective brain areas, we used a zzso functional zzso approach in healthy German speaking zzso First, a functional zzso session using a block design with auditory speech, visual speech zzso movements, no zzso and audiovisual speech zzso and zzso in zzso was used to identify areas activated by auditory and visual speech, which showed in addition further increased activity in the audiovisual zzso This procedure revealed two clusters of brain activity in the zzso part of the superior zzso zzso zzso In a second session using zzso imaging in conjunction with sparse zzso these functionally defined volumes were further examined in a design crossing audiovisual zzso and zzso zzso added zzso Within these areas, regions showing an interaction of audiovisual zzso and zzso were found with the greatest activity for zzso speech stimuli with added zzso This underscores their role in audiovisual zzso We propose that the zzso approach introduced here allows a finer analysis of audiovisual speech integration than previous zzso
