To describe a severe form of zzso zzso zzso in AIDS patients failing highly active zzso therapy zzso its relationship to clinical and zzso findings, and suggest hypotheses regarding zzso 

AIDS patients who failed zzso and displayed severe zzso were zzso All cases had detailed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed to determine brain zzso levels and to exclude other zzso 

Seven recent autopsy cases of zzso in zzso patients with AIDS were zzso zzso all were severely zzso six zzso had poorly controlled zzso replication despite combination zzso therapy, and five zzso had zzso zzso zzso all seven had intense zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso widespread zzso loss, zzso injury, zzso and zzso The extent of damage exceeds that described prior to the use of zzso Brain tissue demonstrated high levels of zzso zzso but evidence of other zzso such as zzso virus, zzso virus, zzso human zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso virus types 1 and 2, was zzso zzso of the stages of pathology suggests a zzso sequence of zzso In this model, white matter damage begins with zzso zzso by zzso zzso which may occur as a consequence of zzso immune zzso zzso zzso by immune cells zzso brain zzso cells and is followed by zzso loss, zzso damage, and finally, zzso 

Taken together, our findings provide evidence for the emergence of a severe form of zzso zzso This condition warrants further study and increased vigilance among those who provide care for zzso zzso
