The zzso organization has been hypothesized to reflect a balance between local processing and global integration in the human zzso Previous zzso imaging studies have consistently demonstrated that the zzso architecture of the brain network is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease zzso However, these studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the zzso properties of brain zzso in zzso One potential explanation for these inconsistent results lies with the diverse zzso and distinct progressive stages of the zzso involved in these studies, which are thought to be critical factors that might affect the zzso We investigated the zzso properties of brain functional networks derived from resting functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of carefully selected moderate zzso patients and normal controls zzso Our results showed that the zzso properties were found to be disrupted in zzso patients, which showing increased local efficiency but decreased global zzso We found that the altered brain regions are mainly located in the default mode network, the zzso lobe and certain zzso regions that are closely associated with the zzso changes in zzso Of note, our exploratory study revealed that the zzso zzso zzso brain network properties, especially in zzso zzso
