To evaluate differences in zzso and flow zzso in the zzso between accelerated zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso using zzso and zzso zzso and in peak zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso perpendicular to the ascending and descending zzso was performed in 11 volunteers using zzso (R zzso 2) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Peak zzso mean zzso and stroke volume of the accelerated zzso experiments were zzso Peak zzso were compared to zzso zzso 

All acceleration techniques showed significant correlations for peak zzso with zzso zzso However, zzso zzso 6 and 8 showed a significant zzso Strong correlations between zzso and zzso zzso were found for all three zzso zzso differences in peak zzso were found between zzso and all zzso zzso experiments, but not for zzso zzso zzso in the ascending zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the descending zzso For mean zzso no significant differences were zzso Stroke volume showed significant differences for all zzso zzso experiments in the ascending and for 6- and zzso zzso zzso in the descending zzso 

Peak zzso of accelerated zzso correlated with CW zzso zzso but high zzso zzso acceleration factors lead to a significant zzso zzso with R zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso are most highly correlated in zzso flow zzso
