zzso artifacts and transmission radio frequency zzso field zzso zzso zzso are major limitations in zzso zzso echo zzso Previously proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to be promising for reducing the zzso signal loss zzso artifact by incorporating a zzso zzso phase zzso This method has recently been extended to zzso zzso zzso pulse designs for reducing zzso + zzso as well as the signal zzso In this zzso we present simple zzso pulse designs for constructing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as an alternative to the zzso zzso The zzso pulse capable of exciting slices with reduced signal loss and is zzso zzso The zzso pulse simultaneously zzso signal loss as well as the zzso + zzso from a body zzso zzso The zzso are demonstrated with simulations and with zzso echo phantom and brain images at zzso using a standard zzso body zzso The zzso were observed to work well for multiple slices and several zzso
