The zzso zzso of zzso has been the subject of detailed zzso Because previous studies have not demonstrated consistent and specific zzso findings in zzso and most such studies have been performed in adults and zzso children, we performed a retrospective review in young children in search of common functional and anatomical abnormalities with brain zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso The patient population was composed of 23 children aged zzso months zzso 54 zzso who met the diagnostic criteria of zzso as defined in the zzso and zzso Brain zzso was performed after intravenous injection of zzso zzso of zzso using a zzso zzso crystal gamma zzso zzso was performed in all patients, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data were assessed zzso Twenty patients had abnormal zzso scans revealing focal areas of decreased zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso areas were noted on brain zzso By contrast all patients had normal zzso findings without evidence of abnormalities of the zzso zzso zzso hemisphere, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In conclusion, extensive zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found in this zzso zzso may be more sensitive in reflecting the zzso of zzso than zzso However, further studies are necessary to determine the significance of zzso and zzso zzso impairment in zzso
