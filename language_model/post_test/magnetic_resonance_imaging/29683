The sequence of neural responses to zzso zzso pressure manipulation remains zzso especially for zzso zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging procedures to zzso neural responses during zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso challenges in seven zzso adult zzso zzso challenges produced zzso declines in multiple zzso sites in the zzso including the nucleus zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Signal decreases also emerged in the zzso zzso inferior olive, zzso zzso and right zzso zzso sites, such as the zzso and zzso increased signal intensity as zzso pressure zzso In contrast, zzso pressure zzso zzso smaller signal increases in zzso regions, the zzso zzso and the right zzso and signal declines in regions of the zzso with no change in deep zzso zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso challenges were typically zzso In a subset of animals, zzso resulted in rises and falls of blood pressure that were comparable to these resulting from the pharmacological challenges but different regional neural responses, indicating that the regional signal intensity responses did not derive from global zzso effects but from zzso mediation of central zzso The findings demonstrate widespread zzso distribution of neural sites responsive to blood pressure zzso The distribution and time course of neural responses follow patterns associated with early and late zzso zzso
