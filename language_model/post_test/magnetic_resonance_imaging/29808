A cognitive bias task zzso zzso two different cognitive selection mechanisms in the prefrontal zzso To identify functional anatomy of zzso reasoning, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and statistical zzso zzso Twelve right-handed men zzso years old were instructed to look at a target card and then select the choice card (among zzso that they preferred zzso zzso zzso They also selected a choice card 2 weeks later without prior presentation of a target card zzso zzso In both tasks, zzso zzso was injected zzso about 15 s after initiation of the zzso or control zzso Brain images were obtained using a gamma camera and reconstructed by a zzso zzso zzso analysis compared all activated images to control zzso zzso associated with P values of less than zzso zzso score zzso zzso were depicted on zzso magnetic resonance zzso All subjects preferred choices more similar to the zzso zzso zzso occurred zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso and middle zzso zzso during performance of the zzso Additionally, the left inferior prefrontal zzso and left zzso zzso showed significant zzso compared with the control zzso A neural network linking the zzso and prefrontal zzso prominently seen in the left zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of such neural systems is essential for understanding prefrontal lobe function and zzso
