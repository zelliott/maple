We aimed to determine the precision of the zzso approach for cortical thickness measurement due to changes in zzso and acquisition zzso We compared these results to two other methods widely used in clinical research using brain zzso zzso 

Brain zzso scans were obtained in 10 healthy adults using three different sets of acquisition zzso The first and the second acquisitions used different slice thickness but the same head zzso The third scan was performed after head zzso We measured cerebral cortical thickness in all brain zzso using three thickness zzso zzso nearest distance, and the zzso zzso 

The zzso method demonstrated the least zzso with regard to the effect of interchange of zzso slice zzso and repositioning of the head, compared with the other two zzso 

The zzso method is the most precise and reliable tool for in zzso cortical thickness measurement using brain zzso zzso
