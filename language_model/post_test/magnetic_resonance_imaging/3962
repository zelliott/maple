To investigate the contribution of vascular compliance to essential hypertension zzso we developed magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques to directly measure zzso zzso zzso in the ascending and descending zzso and abdominal zzso of zzso normal zzso 10) and zzso zzso zzso These results were compared with concurrent zzso zzso of left zzso mass index zzso and abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat and with zzso zzso measurement of in zzso zzso free zzso levels zzso in brain and skeletal zzso zzso zzso in zzso was consistently and significantly reduced at all measured sites zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as was zzso in the brain zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and skeletal muscle zzso versus zzso zzso zzso For all subjects, zzso blood pressure zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso related to zzso zzso and brain zzso were zzso related to age zzso zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso related to zzso blood zzso zzso zzso and to abdominal visceral fat zzso zzso but not to body mass index zzso zzso zzso or subcutaneous fat zzso zzso zzso was also significantly and positively related to in zzso zzso both in the brain and skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso skeletal zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso MR techniques can be used to zzso and zzso assess zzso zzso zzso and zzso aspects of zzso disease in zzso zzso increased zzso blood pressure and zzso in zzso may at least in part result from decreased zzso zzso decreased zzso contributes to zzso zzso in hypertension and may help to explain the characteristic age-related decreases in zzso and zzso decreased zzso may be one mechanism by which abdominal visceral fat contributes to cardiovascular zzso
