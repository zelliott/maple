Previous work has implicated prefrontal zzso in selecting among and retrieving conceptual information stored zzso However, recent zzso work in monkeys suggests that prefrontal zzso may play a more direct role in representing conceptual information in a flexible zzso zzso Here, we investigate the nature of visual object representations from zzso to conceptual levels in an unbiased zzso manner using a functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation paradigm with pictures of zzso Throughout much of zzso cortex, activity was highly sensitive to changes in zzso stimulus form, consistent with tuning to form and position within zzso coordinates and matching an automated measure of shape zzso Broad zzso conceptual information was represented as early as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These regions were not completely zzso to form, suggesting that form similarity remains an important organizational constraint into the zzso zzso Separate sites within prefrontal zzso represented broad and narrow conceptual zzso with more anterior sites tuned narrowly to close conceptual associates in a manner that was zzso to stimulus zzso and that matched independent similarity ratings of the zzso The combination of broad and narrow conceptual tuning within prefrontal zzso may support flexible selection, zzso and zzso of objects at different levels of zzso zzso
