In this zzso study, we looked for the regions supporting interaction between cortical zzso and attention during three conditions: zzso zzso and zzso Arousal zzso were obtained from the zzso zzso zzso power zzso zzso recorded continuously together with zzso Whatever the condition, zzso was positively correlated with the zzso signal of the right zzso prefrontal and superior zzso zzso closely overlapping regions involved in the maintenance of zzso Although the inferior zzso areas also presented a correlation with zzso during zzso path analysis suggests that this influence may be zzso through the zzso influence of the previously mentioned zzso However, those zzso areas could account for the correlation between zzso and zzso Lastly, the zzso frontal cortex, frontal zzso and zzso were zzso correlated with zzso but only during detection and observation so that they could account for the control of zzso
