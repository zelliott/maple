zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in Europe and zzso in the zzso is a zzso magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent that has up to 50% zzso zzso in the normal zzso After intravenous injection, zzso distributes into the vascular and zzso spaces during the zzso portal zzso and late dynamic zzso and progressively into the zzso and zzso ducts during the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso mainly occurs via the organic zzso zzso zzso zzso and B3 located at the zzso membrane and zzso zzso via the zzso zzso proteins zzso at the zzso zzso Because of these zzso zzso behaves similarly to zzso zzso zzso during the dynamic zzso and adds substantial information during the zzso phase, improving the detection and characterization of focal liver zzso and diffuse liver zzso This information is particularly relevant for the detection of zzso and for the detection and characterization of zzso zzso in liver zzso including early zzso zzso Finally, zzso magnetic resonance imaging may provide quantitative assessment regarding liver zzso and zzso function in diffuse liver zzso The full potential of zzso magnetic resonance imaging has to be established zzso It is already clear that zzso magnetic resonance imaging provides zzso and functional information in the setting of focal and diffuse liver disease that is unattainable with magnetic resonance imaging enhanced with zzso contrast zzso
