The objectives are to report the zzso analysis, preliminary clinical outcome, and comparison with published data of zzso magnetic zzso high dose rate zzso zzso in cervical zzso 

The data set of 24 patients with cervical cancer treated with high zzso zzso applications was zzso All patients received radiation with or without chemotherapy (10 patients received zzso zzso Point A, International Commission on zzso Units and zzso zzso point doses, and Groupe zzso de zzso Society for zzso zzso and Oncology dose volume zzso zzso high-risk clinical target volume zzso zzso and zzso doses, and dose to zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were calculated and zzso 

Mean zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso point A dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total biologically equivalent dose in 2 zzso per fraction zzso whereas mean zzso zzso zzso doses were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso points were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso for zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With a median follow-up of 24 months, 3 patients had local zzso failure, 1 had right external zzso zzso failure, and 1 had left zzso zzso zzso 

The 3-D magnetic resonance zzso high zzso zzso approach in cervical zzso is zzso In our experience, the zzso volumes are large, and zzso and zzso doses to zzso and zzso are higher than published literature so zzso
