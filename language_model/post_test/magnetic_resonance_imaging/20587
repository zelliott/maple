It is well accepted that recognition memory reflects the contribution of two zzso memory retrieval zzso namely recollection and zzso However, fundamental questions remain regarding the functional nature and neural zzso of these zzso In this article, we describe a simple quantitative model of recognition memory zzso the zzso signal detection zzso that has been useful in zzso findings from a broad range of cognitive studies, and that is now being applied in a growing number of zzso investigations of zzso The model makes several strong assumptions about the behavioral nature and neural zzso of recollection and zzso A review of the literature indicates that these assumptions are generally well supported, but that there are clear boundary conditions in which these assumptions break zzso We argue that these findings provide important insights into the operation of the processes underlying zzso Finally, we consider how the zzso approach relates to recent zzso and zzso models and how it might be integrated with recent findings concerning the role of zzso zzso lobe regions in other cognitive functions such as novelty zzso perception, implicit memory and short-term zzso
