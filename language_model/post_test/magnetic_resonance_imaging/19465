The current trend in zzso zzso is to employ realistic models derived from ex zzso or in zzso zzso Such studies typically produce a series of images from which the zzso boundaries must first be individually extracted zzso two-dimensional zzso and then serially reconstructed to produce the three-dimensional zzso surface zzso In this paper, we present a rapid three-dimensional zzso technique that combines these two steps, based on the idea of an expanding virtual zzso This three-dimensional technique is demonstrated in application to finite element meshing and zzso modeling of flow in the carotid zzso of a normal volunteer zzso with black blood zzso Wall zzso stress patterns zzso using a mesh generated with the three-dimensional technique agree well with those zzso using a mesh generated from conventional two-dimensional zzso and serial zzso In addition to reducing the time required to extract the zzso surface from hours to minutes, our approach is easy to learn and use and requires minimal user intervention, which can potentially increase the accuracy and precision of quantitative and zzso studies of zzso and vascular zzso
