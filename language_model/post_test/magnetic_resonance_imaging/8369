The current article examined the relationships among aging, intelligence, zzso volume, and brain shrinkage in zzso and zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to measure zzso and cerebral volumes in 146 subjects with alcohol use disorders and 42 comparison subjects who were not zzso The zzso findings show that performance on Block Design decreases as zzso age, and this decrease is predicted by brain zzso This is consistent with a process of cumulative brain damage related to alcohol zzso However, the zzso data also show that vocabulary does not decrease with age and is correlated with zzso brain size as measured by zzso volume, suggesting that lower verbal ability precedes heavy alcohol use and may be a risk factor for zzso
