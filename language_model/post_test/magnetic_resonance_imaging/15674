To assess the relationship between the severity of zzso zzso zzso tears and the development of zzso zzso 

Fifty-one magnetic resonance imaging zzso shoulder examination reports with zzso zzso tears were zzso identified and reviewed by two dedicated musculoskeletal zzso The appearances of the rotator cuff muscles, biceps zzso and the lesser zzso were zzso The zzso distance and the zzso zzso distance were zzso The data were recorded and zzso zzso 

The zzso values for zzso agreement were: zzso for zzso distance and zzso for zzso distance zzso Twenty-six patients had significant zzso of the zzso tendon, zzso zzso zzso of this group had imaging evidence of tear or zzso of the zzso zzso Twenty-five patients had no significant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this group had imaging evidence of a zzso tear or zzso The zzso distance was significantly less in patients with zzso tears and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was significantly more likely to be abnormal if the zzso was zzso than if no zzso was present zzso There were no significant differences in zzso distances between the zzso 

zzso zzso signal and structural changes are frequently associated with zzso zzso zzso tears, particularly if the zzso is significantly zzso In this zzso zzso series, the data do not support the occurrence of classical zzso zzso as an zzso however, they may support the possibility of a dynamic zzso to which future studies could be zzso
