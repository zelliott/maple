In zzso seizures, zzso zzso is conveyed from the zzso zzso directly to zzso and zzso zzso This phenomenon is associated with a reduced ability of zzso to respond to zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a zzso that destroys the zzso path in zzso after status zzso zzso induced by zzso injection in zzso zzso Using magnetic resonance imaging, zzso and zzso zzso we determined that this zzso develops after 30 minutes of zzso and is characterized by zzso and zzso After a longer period of SE, the zzso invariably involves the upper blade of the zzso zzso Adult rats treated with subcutaneous zzso (20 zzso zzso for 3 zzso did not develop the zzso zzso zzso and had less frequent spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Young zzso rats rarely zzso developed the zzso zzso and their spontaneous zzso were delayed zzso zzso zzso To investigate the role of the damaged zzso in seizure activity, we zzso zzso in adult and young zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we found induction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of young but not in adult zzso These experiments indicate that zzso can produce a focal zzso in the zzso path that may affect the roles of the zzso in zzso zzso
