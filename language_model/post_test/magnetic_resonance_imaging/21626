A zzso zzso lacking the conventional zzso or zzso zzso was constructed for magnetic imaging of the human wrist at zzso zzso As is characteristic of zzso zzso this zzso geometry zzso was found to have a high filling factor and quality factor, as well as produce images with a favorable zzso zzso The radio frequency zzso zzso power required to produce a 90 degrees pulse in the zzso was 130 zzso The zzso zzso had a small variation in the intensity of the zzso field across its volume, which is characteristic of symmetrical zzso zzso The combination of these four properties of the zzso resulted in the production of excellent zzso thick anatomical images of the zzso
