To investigate zzso zzso in zzso syndrome zzso using MR zzso imaging zzso and zzso zzso imaging zzso and their association with neurological zzso 

Six consecutive patients with a clinically established diagnosis of zzso underwent zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The protocol consisted of conventional zzso scans, dynamic zzso and zzso zzso A pediatric neurologist evaluated the neurological scores, and the imaging results were correlated with neurological scores using zzso correlation zzso 

Two patients had classic zzso findings of unilateral cerebral zzso with corresponding zzso enhancement and zzso zzso mean transit zzso Two patients had bilateral disease, and two had normal zzso zzso Among clinical measures, the highest correlation was between zzso index and zzso tissue volume zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was also a trend of zzso although not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso between the zzso score and the zzso ratio in the mid to zzso zzso zzso lateral gray matter zzso and zzso 

In zzso zzso indicates cerebral zzso predominantly due to impaired zzso zzso with only the most severely affected regions in some patients also showing zzso zzso zzso The extent and severity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso reflect the severity of neurological symptoms and zzso and the highest correlation is found with the degree of zzso These parameters may be useful as quantitative measures of disease zzso however, further studies in larger number of patients (and with a more homogeneous age zzso are required to confirm the preliminary findings reported zzso
