To perform a quantitative zzso and retrospective zzso study to investigate whether persistent zzso zzso may be due to brain structural and functional abnormalities in zzso lobe zzso beyond the margins of zzso and/or bilateral abnormalities in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso 

In 22 patients with left zzso and zzso evidence of zzso zzso we compared zzso brain zzso between patients surgically zzso zzso I) and patients with persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and invasive and zzso zzso investigations were additionally compared between patient zzso 

zzso indicated widespread structural and functional abnormalities in patients with zzso relative to surgically zzso zzso In particular, patients with zzso had significantly reduced volume of the zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe and zzso zzso zzso lobe relative to surgically zzso zzso Furthermore, successful surgery was associated with clear anterior zzso and unilateral zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso whilst zzso were associated with widespread zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso lobe zzso 

We suggest that these preliminary data support the hypothesis that zzso after zzso lobe surgery are due to functionally connected zzso zzso remaining in the zzso zzso zzso lobe and/or in zzso lobe zzso to zzso
