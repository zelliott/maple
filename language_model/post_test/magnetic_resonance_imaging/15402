To demonstrate the feasibility of registering zzso zzso magnetic resonance images zzso to X-ray zzso zzso zzso for functionally weighted zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Six patients with zzso lung cancer underwent zzso ventilation zzso which was fused with zzso planning CT using rigid zzso Registration accuracy was assessed using an overlap zzso calculated as the proportion of the segmented zzso volume zzso that zzso the segmented CT lung volume expressed as a percentage of zzso For each patient, an zzso plan that minimized the volume of total lung receiving a dose zzso or zzso 20 zzso zzso was compared with a plan that minimized the zzso to zzso lung defined by the registered zzso 

The zzso and CT were registered with sufficient accuracy to enable functionally guided zzso planning zzso zzso zzso range, zzso In comparison with the total lung zzso plans, zzso constrained with zzso reduced the zzso not only for the zzso lung zzso reduction, zzso range, zzso p zzso zzso but also for the total lung volume zzso reduction, zzso range, zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso significant improvements to zzso plans are possible using functional information provided by zzso that has been registered to zzso planning zzso
