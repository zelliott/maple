In a zzso patient intermittent zzso stimulation zzso accidentally provoked a generalized zzso seizure during simultaneous recordings of zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Before seizure zzso zzso consistently induced generalized zzso responses zzso These zzso were associated with increases in blood oxygen level dependent zzso signal in the visual cortex, the thalamus, and both superior zzso and a decrease in zzso signal in the zzso zzso The zzso signal in the visual zzso increased in magnitude during consecutive epochs of zzso associated with zzso We propose that repeated zzso led to an excessive amount of zzso activity in the visual zzso that evoked zzso and finally exceeded a critical threshold and triggered a generalized zzso
