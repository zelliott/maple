When the conventional lateral zzso zzso nerve zzso block is performed, the needle angle required to zzso and the level of the zzso zzso are highly zzso The aim of our magnetic resonance imaging zzso study was to determine the most common range of zzso angles and the relationship between zzso distance and zzso We also evaluated the zzso of the zzso zzso level and the relationship between patient height and nerve zzso zzso 

Using zzso thigh zzso to simulate a lateral approach in the zzso position, we measured and analyzed with simple linear zzso the level of zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso and the angle at which the needle must be directed zzso to intersect the zzso at 9 zzso zzso to the lateral joint zzso 

The mean zzso angle was 30 zzso 8) zzso In zzso of cases, angles ranged from 15 to 45 degrees, and the larger the zzso the smaller the zzso The zzso divided at a mean distance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the lateral joint zzso In zzso of cases, the zzso level was 10 zzso or zzso 

Our simulated lateral zzso zzso block on zzso shows a zzso to zzso range of zzso zzso As the zzso distance was greater than zzso zzso the angles were progressively smaller than 30 zzso Although this was an zzso study, it does provide some evidence that indicates the conventional clinically recommended zzso to zzso ranges may need to be zzso zzso zzso of 10 zzso or greater zzso to the zzso zzso may increase the chance of placement at or zzso to the zzso zzso
