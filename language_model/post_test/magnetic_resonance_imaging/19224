To introduce dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso as an indicator of inflammatory activity in the zzso zzso zzso of patients with zzso arthritis zzso or early zzso zzso and to compare the results with a healthy control zzso 

We examined 42 zzso and 23 early zzso zzso patients, and 12 healthy controls in a zzso zzso Dynamic zzso zzso zzso images after injection of a contrast zzso was performed through the 2nd to the 5th zzso zzso Two methods for identification of the enhancing zzso membrane were zzso 1) outlining of enhancing zzso membrane on zzso images and 2) automated recognition by principal component analysis zzso The early enhancement zzso rate was calculated on the basis of the first zzso 

zzso 1) and 2) were closely associated zzso From the healthy control group, an upper limit zzso of normal enhancement was established for the 2nd to 5th zzso zzso which served to identify abnormal zzso rates in the corresponding zzso of zzso The patients had higher zzso rates in the 2nd to 5th zzso zzso than had the healthy controls zzso There were no significant differences between the two patient groups zzso 

zzso seems to be a promising method for automated identification of enhancing zzso zzso rates of the finger zzso may be useful in the assessment of the inflammatory activity in the zzso of patients with zzso and early zzso zzso and may reflect other aspects of disease activity than clinical zzso
