zzso zzso are highly zzso tumors both in their clinical manifestation and in their zzso Despite significant advances in the surgery for zzso zzso many aspects of this pathology are still zzso 

To evaluate the clinical, zzso and surgical outcome of 40 focal zzso zzso zzso and propose a surgical zzso zzso 

A total of 40 focal zzso zzso zzso tumors have been operated over a period of zzso (January zzso zzso Our criteria included patients with zzso zzso zzso enhancing zzso zzso relatively long duration of symptoms zzso six zzso and zzso good neurological functional status and independent for all activities of daily zzso The zzso size of 2 zzso was not zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso tumors were classified into three zzso zzso diffuse zzso and pure zzso zzso Only patients with expanding variety of zzso zzso were subjected to surgery, mean age zzso years zzso zzso zzso and male to female zzso zzso zzso The tumor location included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso approaches included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cases with zzso zzso and zzso zzso variety were given zzso zzso zzso pathology revealed zzso variety zzso Grade II zzso and Grade III zzso There was one death in the surgical series zzso to zzso zzso included meningitis zzso wound infection zzso chest infection zzso and transient zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso Overall, 36 improved zzso same and three worsened in their clinical status at the time of zzso 

The surgical management of intrinsic zzso tumors presents a surgical challenge; radical zzso yielded a good outcome in the majority of zzso The authors propose a zzso system for zzso zzso tumors for defining surgical zzso
