zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the neural zzso of depth of processing during zzso and retrieval of photographs in older normal volunteers zzso zzso zzso Separate scans were run during deep zzso zzso man-made zzso and shallow zzso zzso black-and-white zzso zzso and during zzso recognition of pictures initially presented in one of the two zzso zzso A baseline condition consisting of a zzso color photograph was used as a contrast in each zzso zzso accuracy was greater for the pictures on which semantic decisions were made at zzso consistent with the expected levels of processing zzso A zzso model was used to compare zzso differences between conditions zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso For zzso this contrast revealed greater zzso associated with deep zzso in several areas, including the left zzso zzso zzso left middle zzso zzso and left anterior zzso Increased left zzso right zzso and inferior frontal zzso were found for recognition of items that had been presented in the deep relative to the shallow zzso zzso We speculate that the zzso of activity in these regions by the depth of processing manipulation shows that these regions support effective zzso and successful zzso A direct comparison between zzso and retrieval revealed greater zzso during retrieval in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and bilateral zzso anterior cingulate, and bilateral prefrontal zzso and zzso Most notably, greater right zzso zzso was found during zzso compared to zzso Focusing on the zzso zzso lobe zzso region, our results suggest a greater involvement of both anterior zzso and prefrontal regions in retrieval compared to zzso
