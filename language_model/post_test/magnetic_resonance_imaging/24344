zzso zzso of muscles may be seen in many zzso disorders, including zzso storage disease zzso muscular dystrophy, and zzso lateral zzso Recording zzso involvement of zzso in these patients is zzso given marked disease zzso within each zzso We describe a novel method for simplifying this process and present its application in a patient with zzso type zzso 

A color-coded visual mapping tool was developed based on a commonly used spreadsheet zzso 

This tool depicts individual muscle groups as shapes linked to data cells corresponding to quantitative zzso measures of fatty zzso and weakness assessed by physical zzso It allows for rapid evaluation and zzso comparison of all mapped muscle groups on a single zzso sheet, as well as assessment of response to zzso 

This approach can be applied in any zzso disorder where muscle function is assessed by clinical or imaging zzso
