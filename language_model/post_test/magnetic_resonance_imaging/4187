Dynamic zzso has been implemented in three pulse sequences on a commercial GE zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso field maps are acquired before the imaging zzso and linear zzso terms and center zzso are calculated for each zzso During the imaging zzso the linear zzso terms and center frequency are set before each pulse sequence repetition according to the current zzso Acquisition of zzso field maps and calculation of zzso terms and center frequency for each slice are accomplished in a matter of zzso Pulse sequences require only minimal modification to add dynamic zzso zzso zzso are shown for a fat zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso echo zzso and a spiral acquisition zzso echo zzso In all cases, dynamic zzso with zzso currents and center frequency zzso for each slice is shown to give better results than constant zzso currents and a single center frequency zzso for the entire volume of zzso
