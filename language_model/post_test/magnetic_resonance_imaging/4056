During zzso zzso zzso valve replacement, zzso time may be decreased by the zzso prediction of zzso size, allowing earlier zzso of zzso zzso In this study we examine whether the addition of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso aids in the prediction of zzso zzso zzso valve zzso We also report our preliminary experience with the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso valve size zzso 

Eight patients in whom zzso zzso valve replacement with a Toronto zzso valve was planned underwent zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

In all cases the combination of zzso and zzso correctly predicted the size of Toronto zzso valve zzso In three cases, zzso led to a revision of the zzso zzso The need for zzso in two patients was correctly predicted by both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso correctly predicted valve size in three of four cases, but could not reliably identify the zzso zzso 

In zzso valve replacement the accuracy of prediction of zzso zzso size is improved by the addition of zzso to zzso
