zzso disease zzso and zzso burden are the most frequent zzso in subjects with cognitive zzso However, the relationship between zzso zzso burden, and zzso are largely zzso We aimed to evaluate whether zzso zzso white matter zzso and zzso and zzso burden zzso compound B zzso retention zzso contribute to cognitive impairment independently or zzso We recruited 136 patients with zzso vascular cognitive impairment who underwent magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The number of zzso was associated with memory, frontal zzso and disease zzso The volume of white matter zzso and the zzso retention ratio were associated only with memory zzso There was no direct correlation between zzso markers and zzso retention ratio except that the number of zzso was zzso correlated with the zzso retention zzso In addition, there were no interactive effects of zzso and zzso retention ratio on zzso Our findings suggest that zzso and zzso burden contribute independently and not zzso to specific patterns of cognitive dysfunction in patients with zzso vascular cognitive zzso
