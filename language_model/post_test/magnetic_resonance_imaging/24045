The effects of stimulation through zzso implanted in the zzso nucleus zzso were studied in 14 patients with zzso Single stimuli delivered directly to the zzso zzso with an external zzso modulated voluntary zzso zzso of zzso muscles in most zzso A zzso zzso zzso was attributed to the zzso of the zzso zzso A longer zzso zzso zzso often preceded or followed by zzso appeared to arise from the zzso of zzso zzso running parallel to the zzso and to be transmitted through the motor zzso It is possible that the dip could result from the zzso of zzso zzso With zzso stimulation ( approximately 100 zzso the zzso occurred at the stimulus zzso the dips became zzso and outlasted the duration of the stimulus zzso There was no evidence that zzso stimulation produced zzso The studies were repeated in 12 patients a mean of zzso months after zzso of the zzso The same zzso effects were zzso They were present on 7 out of 23 sides at the settings in use and on the majority of sides if the stimulus intensity was slightly zzso There was no clear relationship between these zzso effects and the patients' overall clinical zzso the effects may result from the spread of current to zzso systems near the zzso In five patients, zzso stimulation on one side immediately reduced zzso in the zzso zzso This effect arose from the zzso of zzso zzso and, like the zzso had about the same threshold at each of the zzso zzso as low as 70 zzso were zzso We conclude that the control of zzso by zzso stimulation is due to the zzso of a zzso zzso
