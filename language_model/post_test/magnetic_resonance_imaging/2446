To correlate the MR appearance of the zzso zzso zzso with clinical and blood zzso 

The proportion of the zzso neck surface area occupied by red zzso was determined on zzso magnetic resonance zzso images of the hip in a series of 120 subjects, aged from 15 to 75 years, with ten females and ten males per decade, and correlated with clinical zzso This zzso and the bulk zzso values of zzso red zzso were determined in 30 other subjects zzso years of age and correlated with their blood zzso 

In the series of 120 subjects, the proportion of red zzso surface area decreased with age zzso zzso zzso and was higher in female than male subjects zzso zzso zzso Within each decade, the proportion of red zzso surface area was higher in females than in males between 25 and 65 years but neither before 25 nor after 65 zzso In the series of 30 subjects, the proportion of red zzso surface area and bulk zzso values of zzso red zzso were significantly zzso correlated with zzso blood levels but not with blood cell zzso 

The MR appearance of zzso zzso red zzso is influenced by age and zzso A relationship with zzso blood level is zzso
