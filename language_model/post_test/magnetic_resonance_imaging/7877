Integrated zzso zzso hybrid imaging combines excellent soft tissue contrast and various functional imaging parameters provided by MR with high sensitivity and zzso of zzso metabolism provided by zzso zzso zzso zzso While clinical evaluation now is under way, integrated zzso demands for new technologies and innovative solutions, currently subject to interdisciplinary zzso zzso correction of human soft zzso and of hardware components has to be zzso to maintain zzso of PET imaging because zzso zzso zzso zzso information is zzso This brings up the question of how to provide bone information with MR zzso The limited zzso in MR imaging leads to zzso in body imaging and zzso zzso zzso Another research field is the zzso of motion correction technologies to correct for breathing and cardiac motion in view of the relatively long PET data acquisition zzso zzso clinical applications of integrated zzso in zzso zzso pediatric zzso and cardiovascular disease are zzso The hybrid imaging zzso here has to be tailored to the clinical indication to maximize diagnostic information while minimizing acquisition zzso zzso introduces new artifacts that need special observation and innovative solutions for zzso Finally, the rising need for appropriate zzso and zzso efforts in zzso hybrid imaging is zzso
