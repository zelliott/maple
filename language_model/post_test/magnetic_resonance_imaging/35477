The authors sought to map gray matter changes in zzso schizophrenia and to compare these with the changes in chronic zzso They zzso that the data would show a progression of changes from zzso deficits in zzso schizophrenia to include volume reductions in the zzso and cortical gray matter in chronic zzso 

A systematic search was conducted for zzso structural zzso studies of patients with zzso schizophrenia and chronic schizophrenia in relation to comparison zzso zzso of the coordinates of gray matter differences were carried out using anatomical likelihood zzso zzso of gray matter changes were constructed, and zzso zzso was used to compare zzso 

A total of 27 articles were identified for inclusion in the zzso A marked correspondence was observed in regions affected by both zzso schizophrenia and chronic zzso including gray matter decreases in the thalamus, the left zzso region, the zzso zzso and the anterior zzso In the comparison of zzso schizophrenia and chronic zzso decreases in gray matter volume were detected in zzso schizophrenia but not in chronic schizophrenia in the zzso head zzso decreases were more widespread in cortical regions in chronic zzso 

zzso changes in zzso schizophrenia broadly coincide with a zzso zzso zzso These changes include bilateral reductions in zzso head gray matter, which are absent in chronic zzso Comparing zzso schizophrenia and chronic zzso the authors did not find evidence for the zzso progression of pathology from zzso to amygdala, but there was evidence for progression of cortical zzso
