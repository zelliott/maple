To evaluate the outcome of children with different degrees of zzso invasion, to compare different systems for grading the extent of zzso invasion, and to assess the role of zzso zzso zzso nerve and anterior segment invasion as zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of children included in 4 prospective protocols (January 1, 1989, through June 31, zzso Children with zzso zzso nerve or zzso involvement and overt zzso disease were zzso zzso chemotherapy was not zzso All slides were zzso and massive involvement was classified according to 3 zzso zzso extending at least 3 zzso in any dimension, zzso through the zzso whole zzso and zzso more than 50% of the thickness and/or more than 1 zzso 

One hundred zzso children (35 with massive zzso were studied zzso did not receive zzso zzso The probability of zzso zzso survival was zzso and the probability of overall survival was zzso because 1 patient zzso Children with massive invasion had a significantly lower zzso survival probability zzso compared with those with focal invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no significant difference was found in overall survival probability zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso No significant effect of other risk factors was zzso 

Survival was excellent without zzso therapy, and no other factors correlated with zzso Children with massive invasion have a higher zzso rate but comparable survival to those with focal invasion provided that aggressive therapy for zzso zzso is available with adequate safety zzso
