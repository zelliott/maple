Based on zzso zzso and zzso studies in animals, a functional zzso of the zzso complex has been zzso However, this has not been convincingly demonstrated in human zzso Most functions ascribed to the zzso have been linked to its dense zzso zzso from motor control to zzso brain functions zzso zzso making the zzso system a suitable probe for zzso zzso zzso zzso a region involved in reward processing, has recently been implicated also in episodic memory zzso Here we examined zzso zzso zzso binding in 16 healthy subjects using PET and the zzso zzso in relation to cognitive zzso zzso availability in zzso zzso was related to performance in tests of episodic memory, but not to tests of verbal zzso and general zzso By contrast, zzso binding in zzso and zzso zzso was less strongly related to episodic memory, but showed associations to the zzso zzso These findings provide zzso evidence for a functional zzso of human zzso and serve as a starting point for a more detailed investigation of zzso zzso in the normal brain as well as in neurodegenerative zzso
