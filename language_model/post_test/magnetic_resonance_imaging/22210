zzso zzso models are being used increasingly to explore the molecular basis of heart zzso Until recently, there were no means for zzso assessment of changes in mass and function of the zzso heart because of its very small size and high heart zzso zzso zzso has now been zzso to obtain zzso estimates of zzso left zzso zzso wall zzso internal dimension, and zzso However, this approach is based on one-dimensional zzso zzso of the zzso at its zzso that take no account of variations in zzso chamber and wall dimensions along other minor axes and at other zzso zzso Thus zzso in zzso zzso which can affect zzso mass estimates, may be zzso In this study, gated zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was zzso to obtain two-dimensional images of the zzso at four zzso levels in intact, zzso zzso In 17 normal zzso mice zzso mass, zzso zzso zzso zzso mass, zzso zzso zzso mass estimates produced from the zzso data correlated well zzso zzso zzso with zzso mass determined zzso In addition, this approach identified changes in zzso mass and wall zzso diameter ratio in a group of seven zzso mice zzso mass, zzso zzso zzso zzso mass, zzso zzso with compensated and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that utility of zzso for serial, zzso assessment of zzso induced zzso in mass and geometry of the zzso zzso
