We studied zzso zzso of cortical processing of faces and houses with functional zzso and zzso zzso zzso detected an early, transient zzso zzso Directing attention to houses in zzso pictures of superimposed faces and houses strongly suppressed the zzso zzso functional zzso response in the zzso zzso By contrast, attention had no effect on the zzso the early, zzso response detected with zzso Late zzso zzso zzso zzso responses zzso by faces and houses, however, were strongly modulated by zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso measures of zzso cortical processing complement each zzso The zzso signals reflect primarily late responses that can be modulated by feedback zzso By contrast, the early, zzso zzso that was not modulated by attention likely reflects a zzso zzso phase of zzso zzso
