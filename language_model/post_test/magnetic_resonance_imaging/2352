We developed a new model of zzso cerebral zzso in the rat which provides a zzso and predictable zzso volume within the territory supplied by the middle cerebral artery zzso The zzso was zzso by an zzso in zzso rats zzso zzso zzso An additional three zzso rats were used as a zzso zzso blood flow zzso was measured by means of laser zzso zzso zzso and zzso weighted imaging zzso before and after zzso The evolution of the zzso was monitored by diffusion weighted imaging zzso zzso vascular zzso patterns were examined using laser scanning zzso zzso zzso volumes were measured on zzso and zzso zzso stained zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso at the origin of the zzso and the zzso cell damage were examined using light zzso Regional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso decreased to 43 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic examination revealed a reduction of cerebral plasma zzso in the zzso zzso territory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a reduction in zzso and a zzso zzso encompassing the territory supplied by the zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso was found in all rats at 24 h after zzso The zzso volume as a percentage of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso at 24 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 48 h zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso h zzso zzso zzso after zzso This model of zzso focal cerebral zzso results in zzso cell damage and provides a zzso and predictable zzso zzso This model is relevant to zzso stroke in humans and may be useful in documenting the safety and efficacy of zzso intervention and in investigating therapies complementary to zzso zzso
