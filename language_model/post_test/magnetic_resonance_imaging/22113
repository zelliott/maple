The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the potential usefulness of the combination of zzso and zzso to enhance the different between normal and zzso liver zzso Small regions of acute necrosis were induced by injecting zzso zzso of zzso alcohol into the liver of 26 zzso zzso was performed 24 hours after necrosis zzso before and immediately after injection of one or both contrast zzso Using a mixed zzso zzso the signal intensity of zzso of the normal liver was reduced by zzso whereas the zzso regions had more than a 50% increase in zzso after double zzso The region that was enhanced corresponded largely with the region of necrosis as observed zzso The zzso size, when identified, was largely underestimated using either of the agents along, albeit using the common pulse zzso The double contrast effect of simultaneous administration of zzso and zzso allows accurate zzso of liver zzso
