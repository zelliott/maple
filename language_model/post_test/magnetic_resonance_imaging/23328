The present study examined the coding of spatial position in object selective zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and pattern zzso analysis, we find that three areas in object selective cortex, the lateral zzso zzso area zzso the zzso face area zzso and the zzso place area zzso robustly code the spatial position of zzso The analysis further revealed several zzso zzso zzso zzso in the representation of visual space in these zzso Finally, we show that the representation of information in these areas permits object category information to be extracted across varying locations in the visual field; a finding that suggests a potential neural solution to accomplishing translation zzso
