One hundred and zzso patients with recent joint zzso aged zzso years, were zzso on a zzso dedicated zzso system and evaluated for bone zzso The most beneficial sequences were zzso 

The diagnosis of post-traumatic bone zzso abnormalities was established in 20 of 141 patients on the basis of decreased signal intensity on zzso zzso and zzso sequences and increased signal intensity on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Signal changes within the bone zzso were evaluated and statistically correlated with normal zzso 

The highest signal zzso was found on zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso which detected smaller differences in signal zzso zzso zzso imaging showed the least zzso The areas with bone zzso changes were approximately equal in size on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The same areas depicted on zzso and zzso sequences proved to be significantly larger zzso zzso zzso 

Using a zzso dedicated system zzso SE, zzso zzso and zzso sequences were most effective in detecting conspicuous bone zzso zzso while the zzso zzso sequence was zzso zzso and zzso imaging showed areas about 4 times larger depicting bone zzso zzso On suspicion of bone zzso a protocol including zzso and zzso pulse sequences could be most zzso
