Blood zzso level dependent zzso signal changes occurring during execution of a simple motor task were measured at field strengths of zzso 3 and 7 T using zzso zzso zzso echo zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso to zzso the benefits offered by zzso magnetic field for functional zzso Using four different echo times at each field strength allowed zzso of the relaxation rate, zzso and the change in relaxation rate on zzso zzso This work adds to previous studies of the field strength dependence of zzso signal zzso through zzso zzso focus on motor rather than visual zzso zzso use of zzso zzso zzso echo zzso for data zzso zzso zzso of images acquired at different field strengths to allow assessment of the zzso signal changes in the same region at each field zzso zzso was found to increase zzso with field strength zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso zzso at 7 zzso while the ratio of zzso which dictates the accessible zzso contrast was also found to increase zzso at zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso at 7 zzso The number of zzso classified as active, the zzso calculated over a common region of interest and the percentage signal change in the same region were all found to peak at TE approximately zzso and increase significantly with field zzso An earlier onset of the zzso response at higher field provides some evidence for a reduced zzso contribution to the zzso signal at 7 zzso
