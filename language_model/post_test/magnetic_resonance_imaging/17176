Although cocaine dependence zzso involves abnormalities in zzso reward-based decision making, it is not well understood whether these abnormalities zzso to zzso cues and rewards and how neural functions underlying reward processing in cocaine abusers relate to treatment zzso 

Twenty CD patients before treatment and 20 matched healthy control zzso subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a monetary incentive delay zzso Outcomes through 8 weeks were assessed via percent zzso urine zzso zzso cocaine zzso and treatment zzso 

Among the whole sample, anticipation of working for monetary reward zzso reward zzso was associated with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso thalamus, right zzso zzso right zzso and left zzso zzso dependence compared with HC participants exhibited greater zzso during notification of rewarding outcome zzso reward zzso in left and right zzso right zzso and right zzso In CD participants during reward zzso zzso in left and right zzso and right zzso correlated zzso with percent zzso urine zzso zzso in zzso zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso measures, and zzso in left zzso and zzso zzso correlated zzso with treatment zzso During reward zzso zzso in right thalamus, right zzso and left zzso correlated zzso with zzso and with urine zzso 

These findings suggest that in zzso CD participants, zzso reward zzso is relatively zzso during monetary incentive delay task performance and specific regional zzso related to reward processing may predict aspects of treatment outcome and represent important targets for treatment development in zzso
