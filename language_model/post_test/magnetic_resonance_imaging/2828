The purpose of our study was to assess the ability of MR imaging to detect partial tears of the anterior cruciate ligament zzso as these injuries, if extensive enough, may result in zzso zzso or zzso to subsequent acquired knee zzso 

A review of all zzso reports from two institutions during the periods zzso and zzso respectively, revealed 13 patients with partial tears of the zzso Thirteen cases each of intact and completely zzso anterior cruciate ligaments on zzso were randomly selected as controls from the same report zzso zzso MR images for all cases selected were zzso zzso for diagnosis included the absence of findings of complete zzso tear in conjunction with abnormal zzso zzso bowing of the zzso or zzso of the zzso on one MR imaging sequence with zzso of intact fibers on other zzso zzso and zzso agreement was assessed using the zzso zzso 

The sensitivity of MR imaging for detecting partial zzso tears ranged from zzso to zzso and the specificity ranged from zzso to zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso interpretations was greater than zzso zzso in all but one zzso comparing the diagnostic consistency of each of three readers both with himself, using two readings on separate days, and with each separate interpretation by the other two zzso 

Our results show that MR evaluation of partial zzso tears is not sufficiently sensitive to establish the diagnosis without zzso This study was zzso however, by its small size and by the zzso of the MR imaging zzso
