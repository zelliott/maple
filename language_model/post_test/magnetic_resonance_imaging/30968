We describe a diabetic patient with zzso and zzso who developed central zzso zzso zzso after a very rapid correction of serum zzso In diabetic zzso the marked shifts in zzso make these patients more susceptible to the development of zzso The dramatic early zzso findings (after three weeks) should raise awareness of the risk of permanent damage to the brain associated with zzso therapy in this susceptible zzso zzso resonance imaging might be a useful investigation at presentation and follow-up of diabetic patients with extreme zzso zzso
