Early zzso is one of the best zzso of good outcome after acute middle cerebral artery zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to analyze the frequency and relevance of incomplete zzso for tissue and clinical zzso 

From a larger acute stroke database zzso zzso zzso all patients zzso with zzso main stem zzso zzso carotid zzso were zzso These patients had received a zzso stroke zzso protocol including zzso and zzso imaging zzso zzso and MR zzso zzso within 6 hours after symptom zzso at day 1 and after 1 zzso zzso status was determined with zzso on day 1 zzso to zzso In zzso zzso flow zzso and used to group patients into those with persistent zzso zzso or minimal zzso partial zzso or complete zzso zzso 

zzso zzso according to zzso criteria was found in 39 patients zzso 1: zzso grade zzso zzso complete zzso in 10, and persistent zzso in zzso There was no statistically significant difference in any of the clinical (National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso or zzso baseline parameters zzso zzso zzso deficit, mismatch volume, mismatch zzso However, zzso growth was smaller in patients with zzso (even in patients with only minimal zzso and outcome was related to the degree of zzso zzso modified Rankin score at 90 days: zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the groups with no, zzso zzso and complete zzso zzso Both incomplete and complete zzso was more frequent in patients receiving zzso 

zzso zzso on day 1 is a frequent MR finding after zzso main stem zzso indicating a more favorable clinical course than persistent zzso MR indicators of early zzso could be useful surrogates of efficacy in zzso zzso
