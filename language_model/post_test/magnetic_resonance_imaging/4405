267 normal controls of different ages underwent zzso zzso thickness zzso by zzso zzso for zzso 96 recruits and 10 young women additionally underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso zzso and calves for more systematic evaluation of the factors influencing zzso zzso Children under 10 had a zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and over 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Women had slightly thinner zzso than men, but the difference was statistically significant only in the oldest age zzso zzso variation in shape of the zzso caused up to a zzso variation in the measured thickness zzso In the large sample of recruits a statistically significant correlation was found between the zzso thickness and body zzso zzso in population height could account for the measured differences in normal zzso zzso thickness found in studies on Japanese subjects compared with studies on European and American zzso
