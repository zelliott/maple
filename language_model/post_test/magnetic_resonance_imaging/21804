To determine the peripheral zzso pathways that influence the activities of the motor zzso by examining the effects of peripheral nerve stimulation on motor cortical zzso 

We examined 12 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with localized brain zzso caused by cerebrovascular zzso Of the 4 patients, 1 patient had zzso zzso including zzso zzso and severe sensory deficit and 3 had small localized zzso in the lateral part of the zzso and neither sensory impairment nor abnormal zzso waves on zzso evoked potential zzso Central motor tract zzso was examined by measuring a change in the motor evoked potential zzso using zzso magnetic stimulation of the motor zzso after peripheral nerve stimulation at the wrist significantly increased zzso response in the controls at long zzso intervals of 28 to 60 zzso as well as at short intervals of 0 to 6 zzso A late zzso zzso was not observed on the affected side in all zzso 

The loss of late zzso zzso in patients with zzso and zzso zzso indicates that this zzso is caused by the zzso of the motor cortical zzso Furthermore, the results in the patients with zzso zzso suggest that the lateral zzso of the thalamus, other than the zzso zzso nucleus and probably including the zzso nucleus, have an important function in the processing of peripheral sensory input for tuning motor cortical zzso
