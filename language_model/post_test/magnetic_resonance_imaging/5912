The significance of detecting zzso zzso virus zzso DNA in the zzso fluid zzso of infants with zzso encephalitis after zzso of prolonged therapy with high-dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso We report the clinical and laboratory zzso zzso studies and outcomes of four zzso with zzso encephalitis who had persistence of zzso zzso DNA, by zzso chain reaction zzso after 15 to 21 days of high-dose zzso zzso 

zzso chart zzso 

All four infants had abnormal zzso studies and subsequently experienced severe zzso delay or zzso 

A persistently positive zzso zzso zzso in zzso may be another risk factor for worse zzso zzso Prospective studies are needed to document how often zzso DNA persists in zzso zzso whether it represents an initially high zzso viral load, ongoing viral replication or viral resistance, and determine its possible association with zzso zzso
