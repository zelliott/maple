In this paper, we report a new method to prepare and characterize a contrast agent based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso complex of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The method involves zzso the zzso zzso in alcohol prior to zzso to the zzso The zzso agent was zzso by a zzso zzso column and characterized by zzso zzso The analysis and zzso data gave a zzso to zzso ratio of zzso suggesting zzso at approximately every other zzso terminal on the zzso zzso zzso of the agent measured at pH zzso displayed a higher value than that of the analogous zzso zzso based agent prepared by the zzso incorporation method zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso at 3 T and 22 degrees zzso This is hypothesized to be due to the higher zzso of this zzso and the lack of available charged zzso groups from zzso free zzso that might coordinate to the metal and thus also reduce water exchange zzso Additionally, the distribution populations of compounds that result from the zzso incorporation route are eliminated from the current product simplifying characterization as quality control issues pertaining to the production of such agents for clinical use as MR contrast zzso In zzso imaging in mice showed a reasonably fast clearance zzso zzso 24 zzso suggesting a viable agent for use in clinical zzso
