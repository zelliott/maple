zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso in a merged device requires shielding of the PET detector zzso The authors demonstrate that a multiple shell setup exhibits advantages over a single shell shielding zzso 

A zzso shell model is used to derive zzso zzso zzso zzso of the electromagnetic fields with a commercial software package zzso and experiments are used to confirm our zzso 

zzso a single shell zzso by a zzso approach barely changes its behavior toward low frequency magnetic fields zzso zzso zzso while improving shielding at high zzso zzso resonant zzso by orders of zzso 

For a given required shielding factor at the zzso resonant frequency, the zzso currents induced by the MR zzso fields may be reduced by employing a multiple shell zzso
