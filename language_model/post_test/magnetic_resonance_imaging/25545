This study was undertaken to determine the natural history of zzso skull base zzso Although there are reports on the natural history of zzso most series contain only a few cases of zzso involving the skull zzso Natural history information is important when recommending treatment and evaluating zzso 

The case records and imaging studies of 40 patients with skull base zzso from a single practice were zzso These patients either did not receive treatment or there was a long delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of zzso 

Skull base zzso may be very zzso zzso Patients with these tumors have lived long, comfortable, and relatively productive lives without treatment or with delayed zzso zzso may be much less than imaging studies would zzso 

The authors are not advocating that skull base zzso not receive zzso However, their unique experience with this group of patients provides convincing evidence that the zzso behavior of some skull base zzso must be considered when recommending various surgical and radiation procedures and interpreting their results in relationship to the functional outcome of the zzso
