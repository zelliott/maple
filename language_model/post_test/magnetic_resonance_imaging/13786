In this study, three-dimensional zzso transformation constructive interference in steady state zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to zzso the distance between the vertical part of the zzso semicircular canal and the zzso zzso as a measure of the zzso zzso and duct in patients with zzso zzso zzso in this distance between affected and unaffected zzso as well as differences between unilaterally and zzso affected patients, were studied and compared with a control zzso Also, possible correlations between the measured distance and the duration and severity of symptoms, patient age, and average hearing loss were investigated in the group of patients with zzso zzso 

zzso clinical zzso 

zzso referral center (University zzso as part of a large, diagnostic research project on zzso zzso 

Of the 111 patients with zzso disease initially included, 90 patients underwent zzso zzso Eighty-six of these patients were analyzed in this zzso zzso zzso patients had unilateral zzso disease, and 30 patients had bilateral zzso disease zzso affected and 56 unaffected zzso zzso ears in patients without zzso disease were studied as zzso 

The distance between the vertical part of the zzso semicircular canal and the zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso slices of zzso to zzso zzso were made by a zzso according to a strict zzso zzso of the distance between the vertical part of the zzso semicircular canal and the zzso zzso were taken by two zzso zzso and an zzso a ruler and the original zzso 

A significantly smaller distance zzso zzso between the vertical part of the zzso semicircular canal and the zzso zzso as zzso on zzso scans was found in the ears of patients with zzso disease than in the ears of patients in the control group zzso zzso p zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso affected patients zzso zzso 56 and zzso zzso 30, respectively), no significant difference between ears was found zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso In zzso affected patients, however, this distance zzso zzso was significantly greater than the distance in unilaterally affected patients zzso zzso p zzso zzso There was no relationship between the zzso distance between the vertical part of the zzso semicircular canal and the zzso zzso and the duration of disease, average hearing loss, or severity of symptoms in zzso and zzso affected zzso 

The difference in zzso distances between the vertical part of the zzso semicircular canal and the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso affected patients strongly suggests that unilateral and bilateral hearing loss are two different entities in patients with zzso zzso The size of the zzso zzso seems not to be the only factor in the zzso of zzso zzso That the zzso distance between the vertical part of the zzso semicircular canal and the zzso zzso does not have any relationship to the duration of the disease or to patient age indicates that this distance is a zzso zzso
