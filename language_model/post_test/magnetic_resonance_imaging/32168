The aim of this prospective study was the evaluation of zzso three-dimensional ultrasound in detecting zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso 

A total of 34 patients with clinical signs of zzso zzso were examined preoperatively zzso zzso linear zzso using the 3-D zzso Before zzso zzso was performed, the results of which were unknown to the ultrasound zzso The basis of the zzso result was the zzso written zzso zzso the zzso situation was noted and taken as zzso 

At zzso there were 10 lateral zzso zzso at different locations and 47 zzso zzso zzso at different zzso The sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso of both imaging methods were overall zzso 

zzso with the three-dimensional technique and high-resolution zzso in the hands of an experienced operator gives results comparable to the zzso interpretation by a general zzso in detecting zzso zzso
