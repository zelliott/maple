We offer a new method for characterizing the magnitude and dynamics of the vascular response to changes in zzso gas tensions using zzso blood zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso appropriate for clinical zzso A novel respiratory task, zzso Deep zzso zzso consisting of two consecutive cycles of cued zzso has been developed to cause transient zzso and consequently a strong, short-lived zzso signal zzso Data from zzso zzso zzso and traditional zzso zzso zzso were analyzed on a zzso basis to map regional zzso in magnitude and timing zzso The tasks caused comparable absolute zzso percent signal changes zzso zzso in gray zzso and both zzso suggested consistent regional zzso in the response zzso parts of the zzso zzso particularly the zzso and bilateral areas of zzso zzso reached their maximum signal change several seconds earlier than remaining cortical gray matter zzso This phenomenon and a slightly delayed response in zzso cortical regions were present in zzso of ten healthy zzso An auxiliary experiment in different subjects measured zzso CO2 changes associated with the new zzso task and zzso compared the resulting zzso maps with those acquired using a traditional zzso challenge of zzso CO2 gas zzso The zzso task caused average zzso CO2 decreases between zzso and zzso zzso zzso with levels returning to baseline after approximately three zzso giving evidence that the task indeed causes transient mild zzso zzso between resulting zzso maps suggest zzso offers an alternative method for mapping cerebrovascular zzso
