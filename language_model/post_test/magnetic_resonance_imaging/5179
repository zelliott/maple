Little is known about the zzso dynamics of cortical responses that integrate slightly zzso zzso zzso from both zzso This study aimed to clarify the timing and magnitude of zzso interactions during early integration of zzso zzso information in different zzso regions and their relevance for zzso object manipulation and zzso Using zzso zzso diffusion zzso and zzso source analysis of zzso zzso median nerve zzso evoked fields in healthy human subjects, we sought to extract measures of structural and effective zzso connectivity between different zzso cortical regions and correlated them with zzso tactile task zzso zzso responses were found in major zzso regions, zzso primary zzso zzso zzso secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso zzso to the test zzso zzso activity was zzso suppressed by 51% at zzso intervals of 40 and 60 zzso This zzso zzso of the zzso zzso source activity correlated directly and zzso specifically with the fractional zzso of zzso fibers zzso zzso Thus, the putative zzso that zzso zzso zzso interactions in zzso was a zzso route from zzso to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso source activity correlated directly with zzso tactile task zzso These findings were exclusive to zzso Our data suggest that early zzso zzso integration primarily occurs in zzso is zzso by zzso fibers that zzso zzso zzso areas, and has behavioral importance for zzso object manipulation and zzso
