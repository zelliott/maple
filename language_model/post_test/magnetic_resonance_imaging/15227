zzso has revolutionized the diagnostic accuracy of multiple sclerosis zzso in adults, and is now used extensively to evaluate efficacy of zzso zzso Although zzso has also been used to aid in the diagnosis and care of children with zzso the zzso features of zzso in children are less well zzso 

The present review summarizes the available literature on zzso in pediatric zzso outlines the specific features of other disorders affecting the zzso white matter in children, compares the zzso appearance of zzso in children to seminal zzso studies in zzso zzso and discusses the potential role of advanced zzso technologies in zzso the underlying zzso of acquired zzso disease in zzso 

Although the zzso features of zzso in children have similarity to zzso zzso children tend to have fewer zzso and a lower propensity for zzso to enhance with zzso The zzso findings in children presenting with a clinical zzso of acute zzso zzso may be indistinguishable from the first attack of zzso 

zzso criteria specific for zzso multiple sclerosis zzso and criteria zzso of zzso outcome in children experiencing a first zzso event will be challenged by the overlap in zzso features between acute zzso zzso syndromes and zzso particularly in younger zzso zzso of new clinically silent zzso on zzso scans separated by at least 3 months is characteristic of zzso Newer zzso techniques evaluating white matter zzso and integrity in the youngest zzso patients may provide new insights into the relative contributions of inflammation and zzso in zzso
