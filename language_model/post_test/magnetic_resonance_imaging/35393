zzso zzso zzso zzso can occur in isolation or in association with zzso but the genetic causes and zzso mechanisms are still poorly zzso We performed a clinical evaluation and genetic analysis in a zzso family with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this combination represents a clinical zzso Based on a whole zzso linkage analysis we screened zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso segregating in this and three other nuclear families with a similar zzso zzso was characterized by zzso zzso or both, affecting mainly the zzso zzso zzso seizure types were primary zzso A median zzso zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso in the patients and a reduced zzso zzso by zzso zzso compared with the zzso as determined in zzso zzso confirmed a zzso role of these zzso zzso imaging studies implicated zzso in zzso metabolism in the zzso pathways in the zzso of zzso and in the frontal lobe zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso Three patients were successfully treated with a zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso and zzso can be due to zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso expanding the zzso spectrum associated with zzso zzso and providing a potential new treatment option for this clinical zzso
