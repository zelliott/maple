To correlate and assess the utility of dynamic zzso three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and fine needle aspiration biopsy zzso findings in patients with suspected breast zzso 

Beginning in 1993, all patients who underwent zzso zzso of the breast and had concurrent zzso evaluation of the breast were selected for this zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso into two categories, positive and zzso zzso clinical management decisions, which included surgical intervention and/or clinical zzso were recorded for all zzso 

There were 69 zzso in 59 patients with corresponding zzso zzso A positive result by both zzso and zzso was found in 15 of 18 zzso zzso zzso missed one case, and zzso missed two, and each of these was thought to be zzso Combining the methods yielded zzso zzso False positive results on zzso (17 zzso were all confirmed to be benign by zzso and subsequent tissue zzso All 32 cases with combined negative results by zzso and zzso demonstrated a benign process, yielding a specificity of zzso zzso 

Our combined testing zzso showed a high degree of specificity and good zzso zzso used with dynamic zzso zzso can contribute valuable information for physicians treating patients with suspected breast zzso
