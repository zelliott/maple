To evaluate the radiation dose received by procedural personnel and patients from an X-ray volume imaging zzso system during zzso zzso 

Forty patients were examined using zzso zzso zzso zzso digital zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso CT zzso group zzso zzso to procedural personnel zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients were zzso Image quality and zzso zzso were assessed using objective and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tests were used to test statistical zzso 

zzso zzso measured in the hands and left knee of the zzso were higher than those in an assistant physician zzso zzso zzso product and skin entry zzso were lower in group A and higher in C compared with other zzso moreover, comparison among the groups were significant (all zzso zzso and objective zzso zzso showed significant results (all zzso among the zzso types zzso Image quality zzso showed the opposite results for objective and zzso zzso 

More doses were obtained for hands of the procedural personnel compared to other anatomical regions zzso zzso zzso showed lower dose compared with other imaging groups zzso zzso zzso was clearly possible using zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed the opposite results regarding image quality because of higher noise levels and zzso
