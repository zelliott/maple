We tested smooth pursuit and zzso to targets within the zzso zzso visual field defects of 10 patients with unilateral cerebral zzso zzso Four patients had zzso zzso zzso that spared the putative motion area in lateral zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to this zzso The other six had zzso involving this area or the zzso zzso zzso From current zzso that surviving zzso zzso is responsible for zzso we expected that the patients with zzso restricted to zzso zzso zzso would be more likely to have residual zzso motor responses to moving zzso We found, however, that these patients with sparing of the lateral motion area did not show significantly better correlations of either zzso eye zzso with target zzso or initial zzso zzso with the position of the moving target, compared with the other six zzso With increased target zzso against a background of darkness, two patients had zzso positive zzso motor zzso However, in one patient this finding was zzso by a normal control stimulating the patient's zzso and, in the other patient, the correlation disappeared when the eye with a residual zzso zzso zzso was zzso These features indicate an artifact from light zzso Only one other patient demonstrated a consistent, but weak, correlation of zzso tracking with target motion in the blind zzso zzso this patient had a lateral zzso zzso We conclude that sparing of the lateral motion area is not sufficient condition for residual tracking of moving targets in zzso visual field zzso and may not even be zzso
