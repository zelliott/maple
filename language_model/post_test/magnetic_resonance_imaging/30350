zzso with chronically elevated zzso levels are usually associated with zzso memory zzso zzso evidence suggests that long-term zzso exposure may cause cognitive impairment via cumulative and long-lasting influences on zzso function and zzso However, because elevated zzso levels at the time of retention testing are also known to have direct zzso effects on memory zzso it is possible that such acute hormonal influences on retrieval processes contribute to the memory deficits found with chronic zzso zzso To investigate this issue, we examined memory functions and zzso volume in 24 patients with zzso arthritis who were treated either chronically zzso zzso zzso years, mean zzso zzso with low to moderate doses of prednisone zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso or without zzso In both groups, delayed recall of words learned 24 h earlier was assessed under conditions of either elevated or zzso zzso levels in a zzso zzso crossover zzso Although the findings in this patient population did not provide evidence for harmful effects of a history of chronic prednisone treatment on memory performance or zzso volume per se, acute prednisone administration 1 h before retention testing to either the steroid or zzso group impaired word zzso Thus, these findings indicate that memory deficits observed under chronically elevated zzso levels result, at least in part, from acute and zzso zzso effects on memory zzso
