zzso rotator cuff repair produces equally good clinical results compared with open or zzso zzso However, there are concerns about whether the same repair integrity can be zzso The purpose of our study was to compare clinical and structural results of zzso and zzso rotator cuff zzso 

zzso patients who had zzso rotator cuff repair zzso zzso zzso zzso were matched for age, zzso and duration of symptoms with zzso patients who had zzso repair zzso zzso zzso zzso We compared zzso and follow-up zzso scores, as well as early range of motion after 6 weeks and 3 zzso All patients were examined with the same magnetic resonance imaging system at follow-up to evaluate cuff zzso 

There was no difference in clinical and structural zzso The overall zzso score improved from zzso to zzso in the zzso group and from zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso Early range of motion did not differ significantly at 6 weeks or 3 months zzso The number of zzso was 6 zzso in the zzso group and 7 zzso in the zzso zzso This difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Although smaller zzso had no influence on the clinical result, more zzso zzso correlated with lower abduction strength regardless of the repair zzso 

In isolated zzso tears zzso rotator cuff repair produces excellent clinical results and equivalent zzso integrity compared with zzso zzso
