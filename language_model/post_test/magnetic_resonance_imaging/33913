We studied the frequency of various features of the appearances on zzso zzso in symptomatic patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso The ability to predict recurrence after treatment with one zzso procedure using zzso was zzso A total of 40 patients with symptomatic zzso underwent zzso at zzso zzso All zzso were evacuated within a few days of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were divided into five groups according to the zzso findings: group A (11 zzso zzso or low signal on zzso and low signal on zzso zzso group B (18 zzso high signal on zzso and low signal on zzso zzso group C (5 zzso high signal on both zzso and zzso group D (1 zzso low signal on zzso and high signal on zzso zzso group E (5 zzso zzso intensity on zzso and zzso throughout the zzso zzso The mean zzso between onset of symptoms and zzso for group A was zzso zzso zzso days, which was significantly shorter than that for group B zzso zzso zzso days, P zzso zzso group C zzso zzso 20 days, P zzso zzso or group E zzso zzso zzso days, P zzso zzso zzso was seen in three zzso of group A and one of group zzso zzso was most closely correlated with diffuse low signal on zzso images but not with a zzso zzso Low signal on zzso weighting was surprisingly high zzso and the age of the zzso as estimated on the zzso correlated well with the zzso between the onset of symptoms and zzso Our findings support the zzso role of zzso bleeding in the enlargement of zzso
