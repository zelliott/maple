Various MR techniques have been used to assess zzso flow and to image the zzso spaces and zzso zzso reports describe the use of zzso and zzso zzso contrast agents in humans and zzso We sought to determine the clinical usefulness of zzso MR zzso for assessing zzso flow in patients with various zzso zzso 

Five patients (three female and two male patients aged 6 months to 65 zzso were included in the zzso After performing zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging of the brain, zzso zzso of zzso was injected into the lateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging was repeated soon after the zzso We were specifically looking for the site of obstruction to zzso flow in those patients with zzso communication between zzso and zzso zzso of suspicious zzso zzso and zzso of third zzso 

MR zzso showed good zzso of the zzso system in all zzso In one patient with zzso and zzso a block to contrast material flow was detected at the right zzso of zzso In another patient with zzso partial block to the flow of contrast material was demonstrated at the right zzso of zzso In a patient with zzso and a zzso zzso cyst, flow of contrast material was blocked between the third zzso and the cyst, with a thin streak of contrast material in the zzso As an assessment of the zzso of a third zzso MR zzso showed flow of contrast material into the zzso zzso from the third zzso in one patient and absence of flow in zzso 

MR zzso is a safe technique for assessing zzso flow, with application in determining the site of obstruction in zzso in assessing communication between zzso and the zzso and in determining the functioning status of zzso third zzso
