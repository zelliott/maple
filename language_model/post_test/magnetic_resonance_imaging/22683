At present, fracture risk prediction in the individual patient relies chiefly on bone mineral density zzso zzso However, many lines of evidence indicate that the decreased bone strength characteristic of osteoporosis is dependent not only on zzso but also on other factors, most notably bone zzso Here, we review available tools for characterizing zzso zzso (in terms of zzso zzso and zzso and for obtaining zzso and zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso Bone zzso imaging is a zzso method that may improve fracture risk prediction in the individual patient, shed light on the zzso of zzso and help to monitor the effects of zzso Among the various methods available to date, magnetic resonance imaging has the advantage of involving no radiation exposure, although its limited availability restricts its usefulness for studying vast zzso Regardless of the methods selected to assess bone zzso there is a need for validated standardized parameters capable of improving fracture risk prediction in zzso zzso
