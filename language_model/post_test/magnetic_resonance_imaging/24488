A combination of magnetic resonance imaging zzso images with real time high-resolution ultrasound known as fusion imaging may improve prenatal zzso This study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of using fusion of zzso and ultrasound zzso in prenatal zzso 

This study was conducted in a zzso referral zzso All patients referred for prenatal zzso were offered to undergo fusion of zzso and US zzso All cases underwent zzso zzso zzso protocol including at least 3 zzso zzso The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine volume zzso was then loaded into the US system for manual registration of the live US image and fusion imaging zzso 

Over the study period, 24 patients underwent fusion imaging at a median zzso age of 31 zzso zzso zzso Data zzso matching and then volume navigation was feasible in all zzso Fusion imaging allowed zzso zzso and US images therefore providing with real time imaging capabilities and high tissue zzso It also allowed adding a real time zzso signal on zzso zzso zzso fetal movement required zzso in 15 zzso zzso The average duration of the overall additional scan with fusion imaging was 10 zzso 5 zzso 

The combination of fetal real time zzso and US image fusion and navigation is zzso zzso fusion imaging may enable easier and more extensive prenatal zzso
