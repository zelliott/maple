Brain images contain information suitable for automatically sorting subjects into categories such as healthy controls and zzso We sought to identify zzso criteria for distinguishing controls zzso from patients with unilateral zzso lobe zzso zzso 60 with and 20 without zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and for determining the presumed side of seizure zzso The framework employs zzso zzso to estimate the volumes of 83 brain zzso A zzso zzso criterion was then used to identify structures whose volumes discriminate between the zzso Next, we applied support zzso machines zzso to the selected set for zzso on the basis of zzso We also zzso zzso similarities between all subjects and used spectral analysis to convert these into zzso zzso zzso was again applied to these feature zzso After training on a zzso all zzso patients were correctly distinguished from controls, achieving an accuracy of 96 zzso zzso in both zzso zzso For zzso patients, the accuracy was 86 zzso zzso based on structural volumes and 91 zzso zzso using spectral zzso zzso discriminating between patients and controls were mainly localized zzso to the presumed seizure zzso For the zzso group, they were mainly in the zzso zzso for the zzso group they included zzso regions, as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the presumed seizure onset zone was achieved using zzso and zzso zzso in all zzso patients using either zzso zzso in the zzso patients, zzso was accurate based on structural volumes in 86 zzso zzso and in 94 zzso zzso with the spectral analysis zzso zzso zzso has imaging features that can be identified automatically, even when they are invisible to human zzso Such zzso image features may serve as zzso and zzso zzso The technique also detects zzso distinguishing features like the zzso zzso zzso further zzso
