The fusion of functional zzso zzso zzso zzso data with anatomical magnetic resonance zzso or zzso zzso images, using a variety of interactive and automated techniques, is becoming zzso with the technique of choice dependent on the specific zzso The case of zzso image fusion in soft tissue is complicated by a lack of conspicuous anatomical features and zzso from the zzso zzso Here we compare a zzso external marker technique with an automated mutual information zzso and discuss the zzso reliability and accuracy of each when applied to the study of soft tissue zzso Ten subjects with suspected zzso in the knee, zzso zzso flank or back underwent MR and PET scanning after the attachment of nine external zzso zzso In the assessment of the zzso technique, three error measures were zzso zzso zzso error zzso zzso registration error zzso and target registration error zzso zzso which represents the accuracy with which the zzso points can be located, is related to the zzso zzso by the registration zzso The registration accuracy is best zzso by the zzso which is the distance between corresponding points in each image space after zzso In the absence of salient features within the target volume, the zzso can be measured at zzso excluded from the registration zzso To assess the mutual information technique, PET data, acquired after physically removing the zzso were reconstructed in a variety of ways and registered with zzso Having applied the transform suggested by the zzso to the PET scan acquired before the markers were removed, the residual distance between PET and MR zzso could be zzso The manual zzso technique yielded the best results zzso zzso zzso zzso max zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performing better than the automated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso max zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when registering filtered zzso PET images to zzso Image reconstruction with an zzso zzso or registration of a composite zzso image did not improve the overall accuracy of the registration zzso We have demonstrated that, in this application, zzso zzso registration using external markers is practical, reliable and accurate to within approximately 5 zzso towards the zzso zzso The automated zzso did not perform as reliably or as zzso
