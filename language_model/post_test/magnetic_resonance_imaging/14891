To evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of the diffusion parameters measured by conventional zzso imaging zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso for discrimination of zzso breast zzso from benign zzso and the normal zzso 

The study included 52 women with 55 breast zzso (30 zzso 25 zzso zzso and zzso were performed complementary to dynamic contrast zzso at zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso of zzso mean zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso values of zzso were measured for zzso and zzso breast zzso in each zzso We used b factors of 0, 50, zzso 1000 and 1500 zzso for zzso and b 0 and 1000 zzso for zzso zzso MD and zzso values were compared between zzso and benign zzso and the normal zzso by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso parameters showed no difference according to zzso status in the normal zzso zzso and MD values of the zzso zzso were significantly lower than benign zzso and normal zzso zzso The zzso showed no statistical zzso With the zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso With a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso MD was zzso sensitive with a zzso of zzso Comparing the diagnostic performance of the parameters in zzso with zzso we obtained similar efficiency of zzso with b values of zzso and zzso zzso and MD with a b value of 0, 1000 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and MD of zzso values provide significant zzso factors for benign and zzso breast zzso zzso measurement was not zzso zzso with clinical and dynamic contrast zzso findings, zzso and zzso findings provide significant contribution to the final zzso zzso
