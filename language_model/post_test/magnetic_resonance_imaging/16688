It remains unclear whether direct interpersonal contact is processed differently from similar soft touch applied through inanimate zzso We performed a functional zzso experiment in healthy volunteers, zzso activity during gentle zzso or tapping was compared between stimuli delivered using the zzso hand or a velvet zzso zzso with a hand zzso larger responses than the other three conditions in the zzso primary and secondary zzso areas and in the zzso zzso The observed effects likely originate from a combination of zzso differences and cognitive and emotional zzso of contact with another zzso This empirical observation indicates that, to ensure ecological zzso studies of affective touch processing should be performed with stimuli delivered with direct interpersonal contact rather than inanimate zzso
