Parkinson's disease zzso patients have difficulty in initiating zzso Previous studies have suggested that the abnormal brain activity may happen not only during performance of zzso movements but also in the before movement zzso or zzso zzso In the current study, we investigated the functional connectivity of brain networks in the resting state in zzso We chose the zzso supplementary motor area zzso and bilateral primary motor zzso zzso as zzso regions, because the zzso is important in motor preparation, whereas the zzso is critical in motor zzso zzso were acquired in 18 patients and 18 matched zzso We found that in the resting state, the pattern of connectivity with both the zzso or the zzso was changed in zzso zzso with the zzso in patients with zzso compared to normal subjects was increased connectivity to the right zzso and decreased to the left zzso right zzso right zzso cortex, and left inferior zzso zzso We only found stronger connectivity in the zzso with its own local region in patients with zzso compared to zzso Our findings demonstrate that the interactions of brain networks are abnormal in zzso in the resting zzso There are more connectivity changes of networks related to motor preparation and initiation than to networks of motor execution in zzso We zzso that these disrupted connections indicate a lack of readiness for movement and may be partly responsible for difficulty in initiating movements in zzso
