zzso zzso due to tumors located in highly eloquent brain regions is often considered surgically zzso because of a high risk of zzso neurological zzso zzso zzso and functional navigation contribute to overcome this zzso 

To zzso investigate the long-term results and impact of functional zzso and zzso zzso zzso on patients who underwent surgery of tumors associated with zzso located close to or within eloquent brain zzso 

zzso patients (9 female, 10 male, mean age zzso zzso zzso years, 11 zzso and 8 high-grade zzso zzso were evaluated preoperatively using zzso imaging, zzso imaging zzso and zzso zzso data were implemented into zzso in this zzso zzso 

In 14 of 19 patients zzso complete zzso was zzso and in 5 patients significant tumor volume reduction was zzso Eight of 14 zzso complete zzso were achieved only by performing an zzso image zzso Neurological deterioration was found permanently in 2 zzso After a mean follow-up of zzso zzso zzso months, 15 patients zzso became seizure free zzso class zzso 

Despite the highly eloquent location of tumors causing intractable zzso our zzso approach led to complete zzso in more than two-thirds of patients with an acceptable neurological morbidity and excellent long-term seizure zzso
