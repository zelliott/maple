We studied the natural history of zzso enhancement on magnetic resonance zzso scans in patients with zzso zzso to determine the zzso zzso when a zzso MR scan most accurately shows residual enhancing zzso and zzso whether repeated doses of the contrast agent zzso zzso zzso were well zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso underwent tumor zzso four zzso had zzso tumors zzso zzso MR scans were performed on zzso days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 and were analyzed zzso and zzso The evolution of enhancement and zzso zzso were described and zzso A uniform schedule of zzso zzso administration was used in all but four patients zzso (each required higher doses to maintain zzso zzso 

zzso marginal zzso zzso enhancement, potentially mimicking residual zzso developed in eight patients zzso including tumors that were zzso zzso and was zzso from days 5 to zzso zzso enhancement was zzso zzso on zzso days 3 to zzso Nine of 10 patients zzso with gross residual enhancing tumor showed an increase of enhancing tumor size during the zzso zzso was detected at some time in all patients zzso and was usually minor, but in six zzso it zzso with residual tumor zzso The 97 doses of zzso administered in 17 patients, were well zzso 

When accurate assessment of residual enhancing tumor is needed in patients with zzso zzso an MR scan performed on zzso days 3 to 5 should minimize the zzso effects of zzso enhancement and zzso The repeated administration of zzso over several weeks is well zzso
