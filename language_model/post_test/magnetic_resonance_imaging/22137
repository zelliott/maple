zzso findings of zzso zzso zzso zzso brain distribution have been reported when brain tissue is supplied by excess blood zzso We evaluated changes in zzso brain activity in the opposing pathological state, in which cerebral blood flow zzso is more profoundly impaired than zzso and analyzed the relationship of zzso activity with zzso and metabolism to investigate the dominant regulating factor on zzso zzso 

Twelve patients with unilateral zzso zzso diseases were evaluated using dynamic and zzso zzso zzso Relative zzso activities and the retention ratio of the affected and unaffected zzso were compared with zzso and oxygen metabolism obtained by zzso Change in the relationships until 1 zzso after zzso injection were also zzso 

Relative zzso activity was significantly correlated with zzso and the highest correlation was obtained for the first minute of imaging zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Fifteen minutes after injection, the correlation zzso with zzso zzso whereas higher correlation was observed with the zzso of oxygen metabolism zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Changes in the retention ratio were dependent on changes in oxygen zzso and the retention ratio for the high oxygen extraction fraction zzso area was the same as that for the normal zzso zzso 

In addition to zzso brain distribution on zzso zzso images is affected by brain zzso especially on delayed images after zzso The degree of zzso between zzso and metabolism should be considered when interpreting images of the misery zzso zzso
