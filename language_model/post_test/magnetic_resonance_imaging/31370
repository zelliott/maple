To describe our newly devised method of viewing zzso zzso for the purpose of minimizing bone drilling during cochlear zzso for partially ossified zzso and to evaluate its zzso 

zzso study that compares 1) conventional zzso zzso zzso films with the newly devised CT movie and 2) zzso evaluation using the CT movie with the findings during zzso 

University zzso 

Four cochlear zzso with partial zzso of zzso due to zzso 

zzso 

Reconstruction of high-resolution CT images of the zzso bone was performed using a zzso zzso zzso By rotating the cochlear cross plane from the round window niche in the direction of the inferior segment by 5 degrees, 72 images were obtained for zzso zzso which were converted to a movie using zzso Pro zzso The zzso evaluation and zzso findings were zzso 

The advantage of CT movie over sequential CT films was facility in understanding the zzso space in the zzso zzso of the extent of the ossified region on CT movie corresponded to the zzso findings in all 4 zzso In 1 patient, the CT movie corrected an erroneous evaluation based on conventional CT zzso However, additional drilling over the extent of zzso was necessitated in another patient because of zzso tissue zzso 

zzso zzso movie is considered an innovative new method for zzso evaluation of ossified zzso and is able to reduce human zzso However, additional drilling beyond ossified part can become necessary during zzso
