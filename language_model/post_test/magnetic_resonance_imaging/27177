The synthesis of two zzso complexes that exhibit an increase in zzso zzso in the presence of added zzso or zzso zzso is zzso The complexes increase their zzso state from zero to one following zzso zzso confirmed by spectral zzso on the corresponding zzso zzso At a field of zzso T and 310 K, zzso of zzso of the order of zzso was observed in mouse serum in each zzso The zzso zzso for zzso and zzso binding were sensitive to the presence of added zzso and were 450 zzso zzso and 200 zzso zzso in zzso Such systems may, therefore, be considered for use as magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agents to track the restoration of changes in zzso concentration in the zzso fluid of the brain, following neural zzso
