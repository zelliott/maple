Driving a vehicle is an indispensable daily zzso for many people, yet we know little about how it is supported by the zzso Given that driving in the real world involves the engagement of many cognitive systems that rapidly change to meet varying environmental demands, identifying its neural basis presents substantial zzso By employing a unique combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso an accurate interactive virtual simulation of a bustling central London zzso and a retrospective verbal report zzso we zzso these zzso We identified different events that zzso the driving process on a second by second basis and the brain regions that zzso zzso zzso actions such as zzso zzso reversing and stopping were associated with a common network comprised of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each prepared action also recruited additional brain zzso We also observed unexpected hazardous events such as zzso and avoiding zzso that were associated with zzso of lateral zzso and zzso regions, zzso as well as a more zzso region in the zzso zzso zzso than prepared zzso By contrast, planning future actions and monitoring fellow road users were associated with activity in superior zzso lateral zzso zzso and the zzso The anterior zzso was also recruited during action zzso The right lateral prefrontal zzso was specifically engaged during the processing of road traffic zzso By systematically zzso the brain dynamics underlying zzso driving zzso in a real city, our findings may have implications for how driving competence is considered in the context of neurological zzso
