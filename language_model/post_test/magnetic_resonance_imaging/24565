In ordinary conversations, literal zzso of an zzso are often quite different from implicated zzso and the zzso about implicated zzso is essentially required for successful comprehension of the speaker's zzso zzso of finding implicated zzso is based on the zzso assumption that the conversational partner says only relevant matters according to the maxim of relevance in zzso theory of conversational zzso To investigate the neural zzso of zzso implicated zzso under the maxim of zzso a total of 23 participants underwent an zzso task with a series of conversational pairs, each consisting of a question and an zzso The experimental paradigm was composed of three conditions: explicit answers, moderately implicit answers, and highly implicit zzso Participants were asked to decide whether the answer to the zzso question meant zzso or zzso zzso reaction time was required for the highly implicit answers than for the moderately implicit answers without affecting the zzso The zzso results show that the left anterior zzso zzso left angular zzso and left zzso middle zzso zzso had stronger zzso in both moderately and highly implicit conditions than in the explicit zzso zzso of highly implicit answers had increased zzso in additional regions including the left inferior frontal zzso left zzso prefrontal cortex, left zzso zzso zzso and right anterior zzso zzso The zzso results indicate involvement of these regions in the zzso process to build zzso between literally irrelevant but zzso associated zzso under the maxim of zzso zzso the left anterior zzso lobe showed high sensitivity to the level of zzso and showed increased zzso for highly versus moderately implicit conditions, which imply its central role in zzso such as semantic zzso The right zzso zzso uniquely found in the anterior zzso lobe for highly implicit zzso suggests its competence for zzso distant concepts in implied zzso under the relevance zzso
