The increased blood zzso zzso zzso ratio at zzso field zzso has been exploited in a comparison of the spatial location and strength of zzso in high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso echo zzso and spin echo zzso echo zzso imaging data acquired during the execution of a simple motor task in five zzso zzso data were acquired at six echo times from 30 to 55 zzso Excellent fat suppression was achieved in the zzso echo zzso images using zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster enhancement was used to define regions of interest zzso containing zzso showing significant zzso signal changes from the GE and average zzso zzso These were used to compare the signal changes and spatial locations of activated regions in zzso and GE zzso zzso and zzso values were measured, with means of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, we identified a dark band in zzso images of the motor zzso corresponding to a region in which zzso and zzso were significantly lower than in the surrounding zzso zzso The fractional zzso signal change in the zzso was found to vary zzso as a function of zzso with a slope that was dependent on the particular zzso zzso the mean zzso value was found to be zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the GE zzso The fractional signal change relative to the shortest TE revealed that the largest signal change occurred at a TE of 45 zzso outside of the dark zzso At this zzso the ratio of the fractional signal change in GE and zzso data was found to be zzso Phase maps produced from high-resolution GE images spanning the right motor zzso were used to identify zzso The GE zzso was found to contain zzso more zzso zzso the zzso mask than the zzso zzso
