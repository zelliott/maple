We compared two methods of zzso the volume of 10 zzso brains using zzso zzso was performed and total brain volume was then assessed using two distinct zzso a zzso zzso technique based on the zzso principle, and an zzso zzso The total brain volumes obtained using these two techniques were similar and correlated closely with each other zzso zzso zzso Both methods could be zzso to a similar degree while maintaining the zzso of error at an zzso low zzso However, the zzso assessment of brain volume required between 20 zzso and 30 zzso per brain, depending on the number of points per sampling grid, compared with 1 h per brain using the zzso zzso Thus, while zzso and zzso approaches yield very similar results, the zzso method has the advantage of greater speed and, therefore, zzso
