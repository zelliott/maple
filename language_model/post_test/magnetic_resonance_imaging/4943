Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso repetition suppression, we explored the selectivity of the human action perception system zzso which consists of zzso zzso and frontal areas, for the appearance and/or motion of the perceived zzso Participants watched body movements of a human zzso appearance and zzso a robot zzso appearance and zzso or an zzso zzso appearance, mechanical zzso With the exception of zzso body area, which showed more suppression for human like appearance, the zzso was not selective for appearance or motion per zzso Instead, distinctive responses were found to the mismatch between appearance and zzso whereas suppression effects for the human and robot were similar to each other, they were stronger for the zzso notably in bilateral anterior zzso zzso a key zzso in the zzso These results could reflect increased prediction error as the brain negotiates an agent that appears human, but does not move biologically, and help explain the zzso zzso zzso
