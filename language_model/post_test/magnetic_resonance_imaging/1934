To assess whether a single three-dimensional zzso steady state zzso sequence can produce equivalent results when compared to a zzso free induction with steady zzso zzso sequence for the evaluation of the neural zzso diameter and zzso 

Five zzso were zzso on CT with zzso zzso slices followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso sequences of 20 healthy subjects were compared with regard to image quality, differentiation between zzso and discs, differentiation between discs and neural zzso and differentiation between zzso and neural zzso 

Compared with CT, zzso and zzso sequences consistently underestimated the diameters of the neural zzso The mean difference values for the zzso was zzso compared to zzso for the zzso zzso zzso the in zzso studies, the zzso sequence was superior but not statistical significant to the zzso sequence with regard to image quality, differentiation between zzso and discs, differentiation between discs and neural zzso and identification of the nerve zzso 

The zzso sequence is moderately accurate in the evaluation of the neural zzso zzso Compared to the zzso zzso the zzso sequence is compatible concerning the image quality, differentiation between the cervical zzso and discs, and between the discs and neural zzso
