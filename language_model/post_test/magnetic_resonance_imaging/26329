The zzso is a site of previously reported structural and functional abnormalities in zzso We used magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso to measure gray matter volumes, the zzso marker zzso zzso and the combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso designated zzso zzso were obtained of the zzso zzso zzso centered on the zzso in 10 male patients with schizophrenia (3 zzso and 7 zzso and 10 matched normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and MRS data obtained with short echo time zzso zzso one-dimensional zzso chemical shift imaging zzso on a GE zzso zzso zzso system were zzso A zzso index zzso was generated from the ratio of zzso to zzso compounds zzso to test asymmetry zzso zzso of the MRS measures was assessed with five zzso studies of healthy volunteers and showed zzso of variation zzso in the range of zzso for the MRS ratios and standard zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso index showed a relative zzso excess in this region in the patients zzso compared to the controls zzso which was not zzso by tissue composition or placement zzso of the MRS zzso zzso volume deficit and asymmetry were not zzso and other MRS measures showed no differences between patients and zzso The preliminary finding of a zzso zzso in zzso is consistent with zzso findings of zzso zzso zzso lobe abnormalities in zzso
