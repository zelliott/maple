Surgery is a cornerstone in the treatment of zzso but its efficacy in large, invasive tumors is zzso 

The objective of this study was to investigate whether partial surgical removal of zzso zzso tumors enhances the response rate to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

This was a zzso open, retrospective zzso 

The study was performed at university zzso 

Eighty-six patients zzso women and 44 zzso age, 42 zzso 14 zzso with zzso were zzso 

Patients underwent two courses of zzso zzso or zzso zzso treatments before and after surgery of at least 6 zzso 

The main outcome measure was normal zzso levels for zzso 

zzso zzso treatment significantly decreased zzso and zzso levels in all zzso zzso levels were less than zzso zzso in 12 patients zzso zzso levels zzso in nine zzso After surgery, zzso and zzso levels further decreased in all zzso tumor removal was greater than zzso in 50 zzso zzso in 21 zzso zzso in 10 zzso and less than zzso in five patients zzso zzso zzso function was impaired in 12 patients zzso zzso zzso treatment lowered zzso levels to less than zzso zzso in 49 zzso and zzso zzso levels in 48 patients zzso The success rate was significantly increased compared with that before surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso after zzso zzso treatment correlated with the amount of tumor surgically zzso After surgery, zzso function was impaired in 28 patients zzso and was improved in 12 patients zzso The cumulative prevalence of zzso zzso did not change during the study zzso function from 40 to zzso zzso from 60 to zzso 

zzso tumor removal zzso enhances the response to zzso without zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that surgical zzso has a significant place in the treatment zzso of zzso
