To improve the drug concentration in liver zzso zzso was zzso in zzso and administered regionally with zzso starch zzso zzso 

A zzso model of solitary zzso zzso zzso was zzso The animals were zzso into six groups and treated with 15 zzso zzso I: intravenous zzso II: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso V: zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso + zzso The zzso concentration in the serum, liver and liver tumor at defined times zzso 15, 30, zzso 240 zzso and 24 zzso was measured using zzso 

The area under the concentration zzso versus time zzso showed an zzso higher concentration in the tumor tissue when comparing the zzso zzso + zzso group to the zzso group zzso 

Compared to intravenous therapy, zzso therapy with zzso + zzso results in higher tumor tissue zzso
