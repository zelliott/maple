In noisy zzso listeners tend to hear a speaker's voice yet struggle to understand what is zzso The most effective way to improve zzso in such conditions is to watch the speaker's mouth zzso Here we identify the neural networks that distinguish understanding from merely hearing speech, and determine how the brain applies visual information to improve zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that understanding zzso is supported by a network of brain areas including the left superior zzso zzso the zzso cortex, and the left anterior superior zzso zzso zzso a likely zzso of the acoustic processing zzso zzso integration likely improves comprehension through improved communication between the left zzso boundary, the left zzso zzso and the left zzso This demonstrates how the brain uses information from multiple zzso to improve speech comprehension in zzso zzso adverse zzso
