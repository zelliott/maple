zzso vomiting represents a rare clinical manifestation during zzso originating from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The precise zzso structures responsible for generation of zzso vomiting remain to be zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which allows one to zzso the three-dimensional dynamic changes of regional cerebral blood flow zzso associated with the ongoing zzso activity, should be useful to study the brain areas activated during zzso zzso 

We performed zzso zzso zzso scans in two patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso whose zzso were characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso was documented by typical clinical seizure zzso zzso and zzso zzso findings, zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and a zzso outcome after selective zzso In both patients, zzso originated in the zzso zzso zzso We obtained accurate zzso reference of zzso changes visible on zzso by a special zzso technique of zzso and zzso We used zzso zzso studies in 10 patients with zzso who had zzso without zzso vomiting as zzso 

In the two patients with zzso zzso we found a significant zzso of the zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso and lateral zzso and of the zzso region on zzso zzso In patients without zzso zzso on the contrary, these brain regions never were zzso zzso 

zzso zzso provides further evidence that zzso of a complex cortical network, including the zzso and lateral superior aspects of the zzso zzso and maybe the zzso zzso is responsible for the generation of zzso zzso
