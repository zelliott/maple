zzso brain volumes and associations between volumes and zzso outcomes have been reported in prematurely born zzso 

To assess which regional brain volumes are different in very low birth weight zzso children without zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso hearing loss, zzso and significantly delayed cognitive zzso compared with zzso children with zzso and to evaluate the association between regional brain volumes at zzso age and cognitive development and neurological performance at a corrected age of 2 zzso 

The study group consisted of a regional cohort of zzso zzso children, divided into one group of children without zzso zzso and one group of children with zzso zzso Brain zzso was performed at zzso age, from which brain volumes were manually zzso zzso development was assessed with the zzso zzso of zzso Development II zzso and neurological performance with the zzso zzso Neurological zzso at the corrected age of 2 zzso 

The volumes of total brain zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were significantly smaller, and the volume of the zzso significantly larger, in the children with zzso than in those without zzso Even in children without zzso a smaller zzso volume was significantly correlated with poor neurological performance at 2 years of corrected zzso 

zzso analysis at brain zzso can provide an additional zzso for early prediction of outcome in zzso zzso
