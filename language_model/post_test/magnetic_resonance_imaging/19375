To investigate zzso abnormalities of brain zzso zzso in relation to major or minor zzso symptoms in systemic lupus zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso was performed in 28 patients with zzso Patients were classified as having severe zzso manifestations zzso focal neurological deficits, acute zzso states, mood zzso zzso or mild zzso manifestations zzso zzso depression, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety zzso zzso and five patients without signs of central nervous system zzso zzso Ten clinically and zzso healthy volunteers served as zzso In 26 patients magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed and zzso against zzso zzso zzso P protein and zzso were zzso In 14 patients follow up PET scans were performed after a mean zzso period of zzso zzso zzso 

PET scans showed zzso in at least one brain region in all patients with severe or mild zzso symptoms zzso as compared with patients without cerebral symptoms zzso zzso zzso regions were most commonly affected zzso followed by zzso regions zzso In contrast, zzso images were abnormal in only 11 of 22 patients zzso with zzso symptoms and in one of four patients zzso without zzso In 12 of 14 patients examined in follow up PET scans zzso improvement or worsening of cerebral symptoms were associated with zzso decreased or increased brain zzso zzso No significant correlation was found between PET or zzso findings and zzso zzso 

PET imaging represents a sensitive tool to detect manifest or zzso zzso involvement in zzso and PET findings correlate well with the clinical course of zzso
