zzso planning for zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso relies on seizure zzso by zzso zzso zzso Multiple factors impact the number of zzso zzso We evaluated whether seizure freedom correlated to the number of zzso recorded, and the related zzso 

We collected data for 32 patients with zzso who underwent anterior zzso zzso zzso analysis evaluated number of zzso captured as a predictor of surgical zzso zzso analyses explored factors that may seizure zzso 

Number of zzso recorded did not predict seizure zzso More zzso were recorded with more days of seizure occurrence zzso seizure clusters zzso and poorly localized zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling showed a trend for subjects with fewer recorded poorly localized zzso to have better surgical outcome zzso 

Total number of recorded zzso does not predict surgical zzso Patients with more zzso may have worse zzso
