To compare the efficacy of two quantitative methods for discrimination between benign and zzso focal liver zzso zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso values and zzso relaxation zzso 

zzso patients with 215 confirmed zzso zzso benign, 100 zzso underwent zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 400, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values and zzso relaxation times of zzso were zzso zzso specificity and accuracy of both techniques in diagnosing zzso were zzso 

The mean zzso value of zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower zzso than that of benign zzso zzso zzso however, with the use of the optimal zzso value of zzso 20 false positive zzso and 20 false negative zzso diagnoses of zzso were noted, generating zzso sensitivity, zzso specificity and zzso zzso The mean zzso relaxation time of zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower zzso than that of benign zzso zzso At the threshold of zzso 22 zzso and 1 zzso diagnoses were zzso the sensitivity was zzso specificity zzso and accuracy zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso relaxation times yielded significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy in diagnosing zzso liver zzso than zzso zzso 

zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly used for liver zzso zzso But zzso values demonstrated only moderate accuracy for differentiation of liver zzso zzso zzso relaxation times yielded higher accuracy in diagnosing zzso liver zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso values overlapped between focal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver mapping could be valuable for evaluating focal liver zzso
