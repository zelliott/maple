Most zzso studies of resting state networks have concentrated on functional connectivity zzso based on instantaneous correlation in a single zzso In this study we investigated both zzso and effective connectivity zzso based on zzso causality of four important networks at resting state derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging data - default mode network zzso zzso cortical memory network zzso zzso attention network zzso and zzso control network zzso 

A method called zzso zzso causality analysis was used, not only enabling the simultaneous evaluation of zzso and zzso of all networks using a single zzso model, but also accounting for the interaction between them resulting from the smoothing of zzso activity by zzso zzso was zzso using a zzso layout upon which zzso interactions were zzso zzso results revealed that DAN is very tightly coupled compared to the other networks while the zzso forms the backbone around which the other networks zzso The pattern of zzso zzso interactions indicates that zzso zzso and zzso inferior zzso zzso of zzso act as major zzso The pattern of zzso zzso paths revealed that zzso and anterior prefrontal zzso zzso receive major zzso likely reflecting memory zzso and cognitive integration, zzso Major zzso emanating from anterior zzso and middle zzso area, which are directed at zzso may carry information about zzso awareness and external environment, respectively, into zzso for integration, supporting the hypothesis that zzso zzso acts as a control zzso 

Our findings indicate the zzso First, regions whose activities are not synchronized interact via zzso zzso zzso Second, the zzso interactions are organized such that zzso regions act as zzso Finally, segregation of different resting state networks is not clear cut but only by soft zzso
