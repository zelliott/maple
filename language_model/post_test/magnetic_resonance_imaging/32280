zzso resonance imaging zzso is an important diagnostic zzso currently unavailable for millions of patients because of the presence of zzso cardiac zzso We sought to evaluate the diagnostic utility and safety of zzso and cardiac zzso at zzso using a protocol that incorporates device selection and programming and limits the estimated specific zzso rate of zzso zzso 

Patients with no imaging alternative and with devices shown to be zzso safe by in zzso phantom and in zzso animal testing were zzso Of 55 patients who underwent 68 zzso studies, 31 had a zzso and 24 had an zzso zzso zzso mode was changed to zzso for zzso patients and to zzso for zzso zzso response and zzso functions were zzso Blood pressure, zzso zzso and symptoms were zzso Efforts were made to limit the zzso zzso average specific zzso rate to zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso while maintaining the diagnostic capability of zzso No episodes of inappropriate zzso or zzso of pacing were zzso There were no significant differences between baseline and immediate or long-term zzso 99 days after zzso sensing zzso lead zzso or pacing zzso zzso questions were answered in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Clinical findings included diagnosis of vascular abnormalities (9 zzso diagnosis or staging of zzso (9 zzso and assessment of cardiac viability (13 zzso 

Given appropriate zzso zzso and cardiac zzso can potentially be safely performed in patients with selected zzso zzso and zzso zzso
