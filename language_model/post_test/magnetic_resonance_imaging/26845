Dynamic contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a promising tool for the clinical diagnosis of tumors, whose zzso may be improved through the use of suitable zzso zzso If one prefers to avoid assumptions about the tumor zzso empirical fitting functions may be zzso For this purpose, in this paper we discuss the exploitation of a recently proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso In fact, we show that a novel zzso class may be used to describe the zzso intensity zzso in both healthy and zzso zzso discriminating between the two cases and thus potentially providing a convenient diagnostic zzso The proposed approach is applied to analysis of the zzso data relative to a study group composed of ten patients with spine zzso
