The experiments presented in this report were designed to test the hypothesis that visual working memory for spatial stimuli and for object stimuli recruits separate zzso networks in prefrontal zzso We acquired zzso zzso data from subjects while they compared each serially presented stimulus to the one that had appeared two or three stimuli zzso Three experiments failed to reject the zzso hypothesis that prefrontal cortical activity associated with spatial working memory performance cannot be zzso from prefrontal cortical activity associated with zzso working memory zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso as well as zzso surrounding the superior frontal zzso (and encompassing the frontal eye zzso also demonstrated equivalent levels of zzso in the spatial and object zzso zzso cortical regions associated with the zzso visual processing stream (portions of zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso however, demonstrated greater object than spatial working zzso activity, particularly when stimuli varied only along spatial or zzso zzso These experiments, representing zzso studies of spatial and object working memory in which the testing procedure and the stimuli were identical in the two conditions, suggest that zzso visual working memory processing may be zzso by zzso regions associated with zzso sensory zzso
