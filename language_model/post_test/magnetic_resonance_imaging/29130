zzso and zzso MR imaging have been reported to be valuable in the diagnosis of acute zzso Our purpose was to ascertain the value of these techniques in the prediction of zzso injury and zzso of zzso size, as determined on follow-up zzso 

We studied 18 patients with acute zzso stroke who underwent zzso zzso and diffusion imaging within 72 hours of symptom zzso zzso volume zzso of zzso zzso were derived from relative mean transit time zzso zzso relative cerebral blood volume zzso zzso and/or apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso examinations were performed to verify clinical suspicion of zzso and to calculate the true zzso zzso 

Twenty-five zzso zzso were detected during the acute phase, and 14 of these were confirmed as zzso on follow-up zzso Both zzso and zzso maps had a higher sensitivity zzso than the zzso map zzso and the zzso map had the highest specificity zzso for detection of zzso as judged on follow-up zzso The zzso and zzso maps tended to overestimate zzso size (by zzso and zzso respectively), whereas the zzso map appeared to be more precise zzso zzso differences were found between zzso and zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that all three techniques are sensitive in detecting early zzso injury within 72 hours of symptom onset but tend to overestimate the true zzso zzso The best methods for detecting zzso injury and for zzso zzso size appear to be the zzso map and the zzso map, respectively, and the diffusion zzso may indicate early changes of both zzso and irreversible zzso
