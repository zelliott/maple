zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso cell zzso with locally aggressive zzso Only few studies on the epidemiology of zzso in Asians have been zzso 

: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the zzso and clinical characteristics of zzso in Korean patients and determine the zzso factors that affect zzso zzso 

We conducted a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with primary or zzso zzso between 2000 and 2009 at three Seoul National University zzso zzso zzso and treatment factors were zzso for local recurrence-free zzso 

We zzso data for 65 patients, of whom 36 zzso were zzso The mean age at disease onset was zzso years with 50% aged between 20 and 40 zzso Involved sites were most often on the trunk zzso Among the 65 patients, 60 patients underwent wide zzso seven patients zzso experienced local recurrence during zzso years of zzso The recurrence-free survival was significantly related to the microscopic zzso margins zzso zzso zzso clinical presentation zzso zzso zzso and frequency of recurrence zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso There were three cases with zzso two of whom died because of progression of the disease despite continuous chemotherapy with zzso zzso 

We report the zzso and clinical characteristics of zzso in zzso Patients with zzso disease at presentation and frequent recurrence have a high risk of recurrence and zzso and therefore close observation is needed in these zzso
