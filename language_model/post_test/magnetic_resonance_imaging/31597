zzso growth factors zzso play a major role in zzso recruitment in tumor zzso zzso are required for proper vessel development, and contribute to tumor zzso by promoting stabilization and maturation of newly formed zzso To investigate the effects of zzso coverage on tumor vessel zzso and function in zzso tumors derived from zzso melanoma cells zzso with either control zzso zzso or zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso the latter previously shown to have enhanced blood vessel zzso coverage and an increased tumor growth rate, were assessed using zzso methods, zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporating the use of zzso zzso iron oxide zzso revealed a significant zzso zzso zzso reduction in vessel size index zzso of zzso tumors, and which was validated zzso by the presence of significantly smaller zzso zzso zzso more zzso blood vessels identified by zzso zzso of the zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure the zzso zzso relaxation rate zzso sensitive to changes in zzso zzso zzso and used to probe for vascular maturation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a negligible Delta zzso response in the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a significantly greater zzso reduction in the zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso Together the zzso zzso zzso reveal novel zzso changes in the zzso and function of the zzso tumor zzso in zzso
