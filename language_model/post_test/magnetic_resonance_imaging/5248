zzso the molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate zzso in zzso is a formidable scientific zzso One hypothesis is that magnetic information is zzso into zzso impulses by using a zzso zzso Previous studies claim to have identified a magnetic sense system in the zzso common to avian species, which consists of zzso zzso zzso located at six specific zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso These studies have been widely accepted in the field and heavily relied upon by both zzso biologists and zzso Here we show that clusters of zzso cells in the zzso upper beak of the pigeon Columbia zzso are zzso not zzso zzso Our systematic characterization of the pigeon upper beak identified zzso cells in the stratum zzso of the zzso the zzso region of the respiratory zzso and the zzso of feather zzso Using a three-dimensional blueprint of the pigeon beak created by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso we mapped the location of zzso cells, revealing unexpected variation in their distribution and zzso observation that is inconsistent with a role in magnetic zzso zzso analysis of these cells, which are not unique to the zzso showed that their zzso architecture includes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of zzso zzso Our conclusion that these cells are zzso and not zzso zzso is supported by zzso studies showing zzso with the zzso zzso major zzso complex class zzso Our work zzso a renewed search for the true zzso zzso in zzso
