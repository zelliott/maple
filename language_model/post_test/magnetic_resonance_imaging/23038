zzso review of case notes and zzso 

To show the advantage of zzso loaded magnetic resonance imaging zzso for identification of dynamic degenerative zzso as a suspected cause of spinal zzso 

zzso zzso typically occurs at zzso and is usually evident on plain zzso However, dynamic degenerative zzso may become evident on erect zzso when not shown on zzso zzso or zzso 

The case notes and imaging zzso conventional zzso and zzso loaded zzso in 2 patients with symptoms of spinal zzso were zzso 

A 44-year-old female presented with a zzso history of intermittent low back pain and right leg zzso after a zzso A 52-year-old female presented with a zzso history of low back pain, bilateral leg zzso and right leg zzso In both cases, conventional zzso studies showed zzso degenerative disc disease only with no evidence of abnormal spinal alignment or nerve root zzso zzso loaded zzso clearly showed the development of a degenerative zzso with central canal zzso and facet zzso formation in 1 zzso 

zzso loaded zzso identified zzso dynamic degenerative zzso which correlated with the clinical picture but was not shown on initial conventional zzso or plain zzso
