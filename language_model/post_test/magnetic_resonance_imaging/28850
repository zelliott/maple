This study aimed to clarify the zzso involved in the cause of hearing impairment due to acoustic zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

The study design was a retrospective case zzso 

This study was conducted in a zzso referral zzso 

Thirty-four patients diagnosed as having AN by magnetic resonance imaging between 1988 and zzso 

zzso 

The authors made a comparison between the patients' zzso findings and the size of their tumors as determined by magnetic resonance imaging and a zzso zzso zzso The disparity between the threshold of zzso and the detective threshold of compound action potential zzso or that of the cochlear zzso zzso was zzso When the threshold of the zzso was worse than the detective threshold of the zzso or the zzso the disparity was regarded as indicating a hearing loss of zzso zzso 

There was no correlation found between tumor size and the detective threshold of zzso or zzso zzso was found to correlate with tumor zzso 

These findings seem to indicate that zzso damage in AN increases parallel to the growth of the tumor and that zzso damage can be detected by the zzso before zzso
