zzso data on the range of in zzso zzso motion is critical to enhance our understanding of spinal pathology and to improve the current surgical treatment methods for spinal zzso Little data have been reported on the range of zzso zzso motion during functional body zzso In this study, we measured in zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso motion during unrestricted zzso functional body activities using a combined MR and dual zzso imaging zzso Eight zzso living subjects were recruited and underwent zzso scans in order to create zzso zzso models from zzso to zzso for each zzso The zzso spine was then zzso using two zzso while the subject performed primary zzso zzso bending, and zzso zzso The range of zzso motion during each activity was determined through a previously described zzso matching technique at zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our data revealed that the upper zzso had a higher range of zzso than the lower zzso during zzso of the body zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees , zzso During zzso activity, the zzso had a higher (but not zzso range of zzso zzso motion zzso zzso zzso degrees ) than both zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees ) and zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees ), while no statistical difference was observed in zzso twisting among the three zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees ; and zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees , zzso Besides the primary zzso reported, coupled motions were zzso in all zzso The coupled translation in zzso and zzso directions, on average, reached greater than 1 zzso while in the zzso direction this was less than 1 zzso Overall, each zzso level responds differently to zzso and zzso bending, but similarly to the zzso zzso This data may provide new insight into the in zzso function of human spines and can be used as baseline data for investigation of pathological spine zzso
