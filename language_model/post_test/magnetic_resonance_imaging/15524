To compare the zzso zzso dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso CT zzso scanning for detection of small zzso zzso zzso 

zzso scanning and baseline zzso with zzso zzso and zzso sequence combined with zzso sequence were performed in 37 patients with 43 small zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso were plotted to analyze the results for zzso 

The areas below zzso curve zzso were zzso There was no statistical difference in dynamic enhancement zzso and zzso The detection rate of small zzso was zzso on zzso zzso scanning and zzso on zzso zzso The sensitivity of detection for small zzso on zzso scanning was higher than that on dynamic enhancement zzso The sensitivity of detection for minute zzso zzso diameter zzso or zzso 1 zzso was zzso on zzso scanning and zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso scanning should be performed for early detection and effective treatment of small zzso in patients with chronic zzso and zzso during zzso
