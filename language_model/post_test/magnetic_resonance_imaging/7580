In zzso blind individuals, many regions of the brain that are typically heavily involved in visual processing are recruited for a variety of zzso sensory and cognitive tasks zzso 1995; zzso et zzso zzso This zzso zzso been widely zzso but the principles that determine where and how zzso changes occur remain poorly understood zzso and Neville zzso Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that zzso plasticity respects the type of zzso performed by a region, even as it changes the zzso of the zzso over which they are carried out zzso and Hamilton zzso We compared the zzso signal in sighted and zzso blind participants during zzso guided zzso We show that zzso zzso regions retain their functional zzso of the spatial position of the reach zzso as the dominant zzso in this region changes from visual to zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso role of a region, independently of the processing zzso zzso its potential zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that preservation of functional properties can serve as a guiding principle for zzso plasticity even in zzso cortical regions, zzso beyond the early visual zzso and other traditional visual zzso
