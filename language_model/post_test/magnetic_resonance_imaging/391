Our objectives were to assess age differences in zzso repetition zzso and zzso skill learning and to determine whether they are zzso by cognitive resources and regional cerebral volume zzso zzso picture identification paradigm allows the study of both zzso and learning within the same zzso The authors presented this task to 169 adults zzso zzso assessed working memory and fluid intelligence, and measured brain volumes of regions that were deemed relevant to those cognitive zzso The data were analyzed within a zzso path modeling zzso In addition to finding age-related decrease in both zzso zzso and learning, the authors observed several zzso with regards to their neural and cognitive zzso zzso visual zzso volume was associated with greater repetition zzso but not zzso skill learning, and neither process depended upon zzso zzso In contrast, the volumes of the prefrontal gray and white matter were zzso related to both processes via direct and indirect effects of cognitive zzso The results indicate that age-related differences in zzso zzso and skill learning have zzso cognitive and neural zzso
