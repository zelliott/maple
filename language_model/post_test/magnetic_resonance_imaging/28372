Eight zzso zzso (five zzso zzso and three zzso zzso were examined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso The purpose was to further investigate the relationship between the zzso of the different zzso and the clinical zzso The imaging findings were reviewed in light of a recent theory on the development of the corpus zzso zzso zzso should be considered as one entity with a variable expression depending on the severity and/or the time of the zzso zzso zzso can be either small or extensive and are usually not zzso zzso zzso can be either predominantly anterior or zzso in zzso The anterior zzso appears to be a more severe form of zzso zzso The associated structural abnormalities are most likely responsible for the symptoms, rather than the zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging allows a more precise timing of the zzso resulting in the development of a zzso The knowledge of the zzso between the 6th and the 20th week is important to explain these zzso Until now it has been accepted that the corpus zzso develops in an orderly zzso A recent theory has demonstrated that this is not necessarily true, and that fibers can cross the zzso at any place irrespective of the normal zzso This theory explains the sometimes zzso appearance of the remnant of the corpus zzso if a zzso is zzso
