For a number of zzso systems, for example fatty foods in direct contact with plastic zzso the migration of substances from the zzso is governed by the amount of zzso entering the zzso For food packaging this means that the rate of migration of substances into the food can be governed by the zzso of food into the packaging zzso To develop zzso models of migration under various conditions there is therefore a need to understand the mechanism of the penetration of the food into the zzso In this paper a summary of recent zzso zzso Imaging zzso studies is zzso zzso of zzso as measured by zzso is quantitative and agrees well with zzso zzso zzso Data are shown for a comparison of olive oil and zzso penetration into low density zzso at various zzso Further, the rate of zzso of zzso into a variety of commercial zzso plaques has been shown to differ zzso These data also allow us to probe the molecular interactions between zzso and zzso Finally zzso is combined with a zzso zzso Spin Echo zzso technique to provide zzso resolved zzso of zzso zzso within a zzso zzso as a function of volume fraction of zzso can also be zzso These data provide invaluable insights into diffusion in zzso which will aid development of more accurate models of zzso interactions and small zzso zzso
