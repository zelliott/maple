A prospective study was undertaken to compare magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso zzso and examination under zzso zzso in staging cervical zzso with special emphasis on zzso zzso Twenty patients with zzso of the zzso in whom the extent of the disease was surgically confirmed, were analyzed by zzso CT and zzso The tumor size estimated by zzso correlated well zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso with those obtained by zzso measurement of the surgical zzso Neither clinical examination nor CT could precisely estimate tumor zzso The overall accuracy rate of zzso in staging zzso of the zzso was zzso compared with zzso for CT staging and zzso for clinical zzso The accuracy rate of these zzso for zzso status was zzso for zzso zzso for CT and zzso for zzso zzso accurately excluded all 20 patients with pelvic side wall, zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is superior to CT and zzso in assessment of the zzso zzso vs zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso From zzso tumor size can be estimated zzso Although a larger scale study comparing zzso and CT is needed to determine their roles, both should help in the diagnosis and selection of proper treatment for cervical zzso Our preliminary report agrees with previous reports that zzso is promising and zzso zzso should be routinely used in conjunction with clinical staging to determine appropriate therapy in patients with cervical zzso
