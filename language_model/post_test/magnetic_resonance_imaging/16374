zzso resonance imaging zzso is a correlate to physical examination in various zzso and a predictor of functional zzso 

To describe associations among zzso features, neurological dysfunction before zzso and functional outcome in dogs with disk zzso 

One hundred and zzso dogs with acute zzso disk zzso 

zzso case zzso zzso initial neurological function as assessed by a modified Frankel score zzso and ambulatory outcome at hospital discharge and zzso months zzso follow-up were recorded from medical records and telephone interview of zzso zzso were estimated between these parameters and zzso signal and zzso zzso 

Dogs with zzso zzso zzso had more severe zzso MFS zzso 2, range zzso and lower ambulatory proportion at long-term follow-up zzso than those dogs lacking zzso zzso MFS 3, range zzso ambulatory proportion, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each unit of zzso length ratio was associated with a zzso times lower odds of long-term zzso when adjusted for zzso MFS zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso Dogs with a zzso length ratio zzso (which was the median ratio within this zzso had more severe zzso MFS zzso 3, range zzso compared with those with ratios zzso or zzso zzso MFS 3, range zzso zzso 

zzso features were associated with initial injury severity in dogs with zzso disk zzso Based on results of this study, the zzso length ratio and presence of zzso zzso zzso appear to be zzso of long-term ambulatory zzso
