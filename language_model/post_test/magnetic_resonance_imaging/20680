The diagnosis of zzso syndrome zzso is defined by a combination of major and minor criteria, related to the different systems involved, according to the zzso zzso of the zzso Spinal imaging can detect both skeletal (including zzso and zzso and neurological involvement zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to assess the interest of screening the zzso by conventional zzso zzso and complementary imaging zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients suspected of zzso and to zzso the most relevant imaging procedure to diagnose zzso 

zzso of the sensitivity and specificity of zzso of the zzso spine versus zzso imaging for the detection of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso of 92 patients suspected of zzso zzso analysis of the contribution of zzso to the diagnosis of MFS in 1992 patients referred to our zzso 

DE was detected by zzso in 12 of the 92 patients zzso and was always confirmed by CT or zzso zzso imaging alone detected 33 DE zzso All patients with DE detected by zzso were diagnosed with zzso Among the 1992 patients, 591 were confirmed zzso 117 patients had DE detected by zzso zzso while 12 zzso were detected by complementary zzso In MFS patients, 98 zzso had significant zzso and 14 zzso had zzso The positive zzso value of DE detected by zzso for the diagnosis of MFS was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the negative zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that spinal imaging is useful for the diagnosis of zzso
