Although the interaction of brain volume with zzso stimulants (ATS) and cocaine has been investigated in chronically dependent individuals, little is known about structural differences that might exist in individuals who consume ATS and cocaine occasionally but are not dependent on these zzso 

Regional brain volumes in 165 college aged occasional users of ATS zzso zzso methamphetamine, zzso and zzso zzso and cocaine were compared by zzso zzso with 48 zzso zzso 

Grey matter volume was significantly higher in the left zzso anterior zzso of occasional users, and lower in the right zzso zzso and right inferior zzso zzso A zzso in users alone on lifetime consumption of combined ATS zzso zzso methamphetamine, zzso and zzso and cocaine use revealed that individuals who used more zzso had greater volume in the right zzso frontal zzso A second zzso on lifetime consumption of ATS with cocaine as a zzso revealed that individuals with a greater history of ATS use alone had more zzso matter volume in the left zzso Interestingly, structural changes in the zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso and zzso have been consistently observed in zzso studies of chronic ATS and cocaine zzso 

The present results suggest that these three brain regions may play a role in stimulant use even in early occasional zzso
