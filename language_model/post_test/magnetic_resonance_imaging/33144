Research has demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso represents complex zzso feature zzso and zzso in familiarity versus novelty zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that, in addition, the zzso zzso part familiarity responses in zzso visual zzso We used zzso to measure zzso in the zzso and V2 in response to zzso presented peripherally while participants maintained central fixation and performed an object recognition zzso There were three types of zzso Familiar zzso portrayed real-world objects; zzso Novel zzso created by zzso rearranging the parts of the familiar zzso and Control Novel zzso in which both the zzso and the ensemble of parts zzso it were zzso For right visual field zzso zzso zzso responses revealed a significant linear trend in bilateral BA 35 of the zzso zzso zzso for Familiar zzso lowest for zzso Novel zzso with Control Novel zzso in zzso For left visual field zzso zzso a significant linear trend was found in a different area zzso BA 38, zzso zzso in the opposite direction zzso Novel zzso zzso Familiar zzso zzso These data confirm that the zzso is sensitive to the agreement in familiarity between the zzso level and the part zzso As predicted, V2 zzso zzso that of the zzso for zzso zzso activity in V2 was significantly higher in the left zzso for Familiar zzso than for zzso Novel zzso and for zzso zzso the opposite effect was found in right zzso zzso We attribute these patterns in V2 to feedback from the zzso because receptive fields in V2 zzso parts but not zzso These results reveal two new aspects of zzso zzso zzso it is sensitive to the zzso between the familiarity of object zzso and the parts zzso those zzso and zzso it likely zzso familiarity responses in visual area zzso
