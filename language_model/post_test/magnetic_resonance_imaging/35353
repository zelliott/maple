Currently zzso zzso zzso are defined by US and are measured from the zzso zzso These zzso landmarks cannot be seen by zzso and therefore these zzso cannot be directly zzso 

To define zzso of normal growth of the fetal eyes using zzso 

zzso views were analyzed in 198 fetal MR zzso The zzso diameter zzso and zzso and zzso distances zzso and zzso were measured and were plotted against zzso zzso zzso with abnormalities affecting the eyes were evaluated zzso 

Of 198 scans, 146 had suitable images, 35 of which were zzso zzso growth of zzso zzso and zzso were determined, and compared with the respective already established US zzso 

zzso growth charts were derived from a cohort of 111 normal zzso Because the margins of the zzso are inside the zzso orbit, at the same zzso age zzso of the zzso and zzso are always less than the corresponding zzso by zzso and those of the zzso are always zzso zzso growth charts for zzso can now be used to support suspected diagnoses of zzso and zzso zzso and the syndromes that give rise to them, and many examples are zzso
