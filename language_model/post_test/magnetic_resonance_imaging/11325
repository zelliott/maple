The challenge for zzso of zzso zzso zzso biopsy is to develop a reliable minimally invasive technique that identifies all possible zzso zzso with high zzso and spatial zzso This study evaluated the use of a magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agent zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso pigs received zzso or zzso injections of ultra small zzso of iron oxide zzso zzso or 5 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso tongue and zzso (knee) zzso zzso was done before, during injection and at zzso zzso 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 zzso after which zzso blue zzso zzso mapping was zzso 

In the zzso both doses of zzso identified the zzso zzso in the early zzso No additional zzso were detected by MR at 24 or 48 zzso In the hind zzso zzso zzso identified on the early MR images were also identified by the zzso zzso In both locations, the higher dose also identified secondary zzso some of which were also identified by the zzso zzso All zzso zzso that were identified by zzso on zzso were noted to be stained brown at the time of zzso 

zzso MR zzso is a useful technique for the detection of zzso zzso zzso This method provides excellent simultaneous zzso and spatial resolution, is minimally zzso and can be performed zzso
