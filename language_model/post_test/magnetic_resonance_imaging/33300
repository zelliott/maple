To determine if zzso precursor cells can be targeted to inflamed brain through zzso of very late zzso zzso and whether this zzso process can be monitored with magnetic resonance zzso cell tracking after zzso zzso 

All experimental procedures were performed between August 2010 and February 2012 and were approved by the institutional animal care and use zzso Human zzso precursor cells zzso were zzso with zzso and labeled with zzso iron oxide that contained zzso A zzso zzso zzso was used for assessing zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso A rat model of global zzso zzso brain inflammation was used to induce global vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were infused into the carotid artery in four animal zzso zzso of three rats zzso rats that received zzso zzso but did not receive zzso rats that received zzso zzso but not zzso rats that received zzso zzso and zzso and rats that received zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging was performed at zzso T before and 1, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after zzso Brain tissue was processed for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was performed with zzso analysis for MR images obtained before and after cell zzso 

With use of the zzso zzso zzso cell binding to activated brain zzso significantly increased compared with zzso control cells zzso cells per field of zzso vs zzso cells per field of zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative in zzso MR cell tracking revealed that zzso cells zzso exclusively within the vascular bed of the zzso carotid artery and that zzso cells exhibited significantly enhanced zzso as compared with zzso cells zzso significant zzso vs zzso significant zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, MR cell tracking was crucial for correct cell delivery and proper zzso of specific zzso 

zzso zzso delivery and zzso of zzso zzso to inflamed zzso is feasible and can be monitored in real time by using MR imaging in a zzso dynamic zzso
