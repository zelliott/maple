We report the performance of zzso a deep zzso We investigated extensively her errors according to serial cognitive zzso models of oral zzso zzso evaluation of her reading suggested impaired access to the zzso output lexicon zzso zzso zzso conversion zzso and semantic errors in reading suggested that zzso read via an impoverished semantic zzso However, a serial model of oral reading could not explain error differences in reading, picture naming, spontaneous speech, and zzso zzso occurred in oral reading but not in spontaneous speech and zzso zzso errors in naming exceeded those in oral zzso To account for these different error patterns we propose that the semantic route, the direct route from the zzso input lexicon to the zzso and zzso activate simultaneously during reading, zzso at the zzso to zzso zzso zzso These routes are modular but not functionally zzso For zzso the zzso receives ambiguous information due to degradation of all routes, causing reading zzso
