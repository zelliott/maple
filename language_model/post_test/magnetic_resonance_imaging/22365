In view of the potential of global resting blood flow level to confound the interpretation of blood zzso zzso zzso zzso studies, we investigated the effect of pronounced zzso in baseline cerebral blood flow zzso on zzso and zzso responses to functional zzso Twelve healthy volunteers performed bilateral finger zzso while attending to a zzso zzso zzso Three levels of global zzso increase were achieved by inhaling 5, zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals were simultaneously zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso spin labeling zzso and zzso zzso echo zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a significant decrease in the zzso zzso response, with the slope of the optimal linear fit of zzso versus zzso zzso signal changes of zzso zzso zzso for motor and visual zzso regions of interest zzso While the zzso in zzso flow level also produced a statistically significant effect on the zzso zzso change, the degree of relative zzso of the flow response was slight, with a slope of zzso zzso zzso in the motor and zzso zzso zzso in the visual zzso zzso The current findings describe a strong zzso of the zzso response at significantly elevated zzso flow levels and call for independent zzso of resting zzso in zzso zzso studies that involve subjects and/or conditions with markedly elevated global zzso
