We reviewed zzso consecutive cases zzso zzso of zzso examinations for lateral zzso zzso during the last 10 zzso We classified lateral zzso zzso into four types by zzso appearance, into six tear patterns by zzso O'Connor's zzso and compared magnetic resonance images zzso with zzso zzso Regarding the four types, 131 cases were complete, 25 cases were incomplete, 4 cases were zzso and 4 cases were zzso zzso The six tear patterns were as zzso 33 simple zzso 21 combined zzso 37 zzso 27 central, 14 complex, and 12 zzso zzso Among the 31 knees with a central tear or zzso zzso we reviewed 25 MR zzso Fifteen zzso zzso findings were interpreted to represent a zzso zzso tear of the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso findings, a zzso zzso zzso and the remaining zzso zzso findings, a simple zzso zzso Moreover, all zzso zzso were interpreted as a displaced lateral zzso tear on the zzso zzso Twelve patients (13 knees, zzso had zzso zzso Nine patients (10 knees) of them had a central zzso two patients (2 knees) of them had a simple horizontal tear of the zzso zzso and one patient (1 zzso had a zzso zzso Twenty three patients zzso with a central tear of the zzso zzso did not have any traumatic zzso For the differential diagnosis of a central tear or a zzso zzso from a zzso tear of the normal zzso zzso we should take a careful history, in particular any traumatic events, we should also consider the possibility of zzso the MR images though these images can provide additional information about associated abnormalities and probe carefully in the zzso zzso
