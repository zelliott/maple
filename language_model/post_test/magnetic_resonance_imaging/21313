zzso is known to comprise zzso zzso and affective zzso Despite numerous previous zzso studies, however, it remains open which spatial distribution of activity is sufficient to zzso whether a stimulus is perceived as painful or zzso In this study, we analyzed zzso data from a zzso decision-making task in which participants were exposed to zzso laser zzso Using zzso analyses on different spatial zzso we investigated the zzso capacity of zzso data for decoding whether a stimulus had been perceived as zzso Our analysis yielded a rank order of brain zzso during pain zzso activity in the zzso gray zzso and zzso zzso zzso afforded the most accurate zzso discrimination between painful and zzso zzso whereas during the actual zzso primary and secondary zzso cortex, anterior zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal cortex, and zzso were most zzso The most accurate prediction of pain perception from the stimulation period, however, was enabled by the combined activity in pain regions commonly referred to as the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the neural representation of zzso pain is zzso distributed and can be best described at an intermediate spatial zzso In addition to its utility in establishing zzso zzso our approach zzso zzso predictions and thus represents a step towards the goal of establishing an objective zzso marker of pain zzso
