To determine whether zzso ratios in zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso is different between zzso and high-grade zzso and may be useful for zzso zzso 

Thirty-nine patients zzso male and 16 zzso zzso years old; mean age, zzso zzso suspected of having zzso underwent zzso zzso MRS zzso zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso grade was determined by using the zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis of zzso ratios was performed, and optimum thresholds for tumor grading were zzso The resulting sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso for identifying high-grade zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso MRS with readily quantifiable zzso zzso and zzso zzso was obtained in zzso of the zzso The zzso and zzso ratios were significantly higher in high-grade than in zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso ratios were significantly lower in high-grade than in zzso zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis demonstrated a threshold value of zzso for zzso ratio to provide sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso value of zzso for zzso ratio resulted in sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso diagnostic accuracy was not statistically significantly different between zzso and zzso ratios zzso zzso 

zzso ratios of zzso zzso were significantly different from high-grade zzso zzso and zzso ratios could have the superior diagnostic performance in predicting the zzso zzso
