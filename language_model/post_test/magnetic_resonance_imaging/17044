Recent zzso studies characterized the neural zzso of slow waves and zzso during human zzso eye movement zzso zzso They showed that significant activity was consistently associated with slow zzso 140 zzso and delta waves zzso zzso during zzso sleep in several cortical areas including inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso slow waves were also associated with transient responses in the zzso zzso and in the zzso On the other hand, zzso were associated with a transient activity in the zzso zzso areas zzso zzso and insular zzso and superior zzso zzso Moreover, slow zzso zzso zzso were associated with increased activity in the superior frontal zzso In contrast, fast zzso zzso zzso recruited a set of cortical regions involved in zzso processing, as well as the zzso frontal zzso and zzso These findings indicate that human zzso sleep is an active state during which brain activity is temporally organized by spontaneous zzso zzso and slow zzso in a regionally specific zzso The functional significance of these zzso sleep zzso is currently interpreted in terms of synaptic zzso and memory zzso
