The spontaneously zzso zzso rat zzso is an animal model for a complex form of cerebrovascular zzso zzso provides an efficient and zzso tool for studying the time course of brain zzso The aim of this study was to gain new insights into the pathological phenomena responsible for the occurrence of brain injury in zzso with the use of the apparent diffusion zzso of water zzso one of the most efficient zzso parameters for detecting brain zzso To this end, the pattern of zzso variation observed in zzso was compared with that of focal zzso induced in both zzso and zzso zzso 

Four groups of animals were zzso zzso developing spontaneous brain zzso fed with a zzso zzso group 1) or standard diet zzso group 2) and zzso rats zzso group 3) and zzso zzso group 4) with permanent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso maps and zzso images of brains were performed by zzso After the rats were killed, the brains were removed and zzso zzso 

There was no decrease in zzso during spontaneous stroke in the zzso fed with a normal or zzso diet, while both the zzso and zzso rats with middle cerebral artery zzso showed a marked decrease that lasted for 24 to 48 zzso 

zzso zzso cannot be considered a major factor in the onset of spontaneous brain zzso in zzso which show only zzso zzso after the beginning of the damage with no evidence of zzso zzso
