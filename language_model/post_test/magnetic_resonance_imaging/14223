To assess the ability of zzso phase sensitive magnetic resonance zzso zzso to zzso the zzso vascular segment, and to determine the effects of triggering and timing of data acquisition zzso image quality, we studied 18 healthy volunteers, mean age zzso zzso 11 years, by color zzso imaging and by MR zzso MR zzso was performed at zzso T using a zzso zzso zzso sequence operated in both zzso and zzso acquisition zzso The images were graded in a blinded fashion by two independent zzso The data were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso and 17 zzso zzso MR zzso consisting of 252 and 17 zzso images, zzso respectively, were zzso In the triggered mode 69 zzso zzso and in the zzso mode 2 zzso zzso were zzso At least one triggered diagnostic zzso was obtained in each zzso The image grades were not statistically different between observers zzso zzso zzso In the triggered mode diagnostic images were acquired within zzso 90 zzso of the peak zzso flow zzso determined by zzso The proportion of diagnostic images in the triggered mode was highest zzso within a zzso zzso before the peak zzso In healthy subjects the zzso segment is reliably zzso by zzso MR zzso The optimum results are achieved using the triggered acquisition mode and timing acquisition to the initial 180 zzso of the abdominal zzso zzso flow zzso
