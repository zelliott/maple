The techniques of in zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso have been established over the past two zzso Recent applications of these methods to study human brain function have become a rapidly growing area of zzso The development of methods using standard MR contrast agents within the cerebral zzso has allowed zzso of regional cerebral blood volume zzso which are activity zzso zzso investigations linked the MR relaxation properties of brain tissue to blood zzso levels which are also modulated by consumption and blood flow zzso These methods have allowed mapping of brain activity in human visual and motor zzso as well as in areas of the frontal lobe involved in zzso The methods have high enough spatial and zzso sensitivity to be used in individual zzso MR zzso of zzso and zzso zzso has been used to measure rates of zzso transport and metabolism in the human zzso The zzso zzso of brain zzso zzso can be used to monitor the zzso zzso whereas subsequent zzso zzso the flux into the cerebral zzso zzso be used to measure zzso acid cycle zzso Under visual stimulation the concentration of zzso in the visual zzso has been shown to increase by MR zzso This increase is compatible with an increase of zzso zzso under these conditions as earlier proposed from zzso zzso zzso zzso It is shown how MR zzso can extend this understanding of brain zzso
