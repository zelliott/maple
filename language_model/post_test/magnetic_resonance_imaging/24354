Various imaging techniques have been employed to evaluate zzso zzso in brain tumors, as higher tumor vascular zzso is known to be associated with higher grade and zzso potential of the zzso and hence can help provide additional diagnostic and zzso zzso These imaging techniques range from routine zzso zzso zzso images that highlight degree of contrast enhancement to absolute measurement of quantitative metrics of vascular zzso employing complex zzso zzso The purpose of this article is to discuss the clinical applications of available imaging techniques, and in particular dynamic zzso zzso zzso MR imaging zzso to evaluate tumor vascular zzso
