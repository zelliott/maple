This study aims to zzso and zzso the population that is zzso exposed to electromagnetic fields zzso from magnetic resonance imaging zzso devices and to identify factors that determine the probability and type of zzso 

A questionnaire survey was used to collect information about zzso procedures, historical developments and employees working with or near zzso scanners in clinical and research zzso departments in the zzso 

Data were obtained from 145 zzso zzso A rapid increase in the use of zzso and field strength of the scanners was observed and zzso The strongest magnets were employed by academic hospitals and research zzso zzso zzso individuals were reported to be working inside an zzso scanner room and were thus considered to have high probability of occupational exposure to zzso magnetic fields zzso zzso per cent was exposed to zzso at least one day per zzso The largest zzso exposed group were zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine per cent of the zzso involved workers were regularly present inside a scanner room during image zzso when exposure to additional types of zzso is considered a zzso This practice was most prevalent among workers involved in scanning zzso 

The data illustrate recent trends and historical developments in magnetic resonance imaging and provide an extensive zzso of the zzso exposed zzso A considerable number of workers are potentially exposed to zzso zzso Type and frequency of potential exposure depend on the job performed, as well as the type of zzso
