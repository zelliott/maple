A zzso zzso zzso is one potential cause of zzso zzso The zzso zzso groove zzso distance using CT is a reliable measure and considered the gold zzso Using zzso for this purpose has increased, although the reliability of doing so is not well zzso 

We sought to zzso determine zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso and whether this affects the measurement on zzso of the traditional zzso distance versus the functional zzso zzso groove zzso distance, zzso determine the reliability of measuring the zzso zzso distance, zzso determine the reliability of measuring the soft tissue zzso distance, and zzso compare the zzso of using zzso zzso versus soft tissue zzso zzso 

Four observers measured the zzso and the zzso distances of 50 MR images of knees obtained for any zzso Each observer repeated these zzso 30 days zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso per observer that varied from the group mean by greater than 2 zzso and the limit of agreement were zzso 

The zzso and zzso differed by as little as zzso zzso and by as much as zzso zzso with an average difference of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were greater than zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso distance was less variable in that this measurement showed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, versus zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso resulted in a lower average difference to the mean for each observer, less number of knees per observer where the difference to the mean was greater than 2 zzso and improved limit of zzso 

The zzso and the zzso distances were not identical and differed by as much as zzso zzso as such they are not interchangeable when measuring this zzso Both methods are reliable for measuring lateral offset of the zzso zzso but the use of soft tissue landmarks is less variable and thus would provide a more reliable measurement for surgical zzso
