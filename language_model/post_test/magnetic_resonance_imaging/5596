Iron oxide zzso are effective contrast agents for enhancement of magnetic resonance imaging at zzso cellular or even molecular zzso In this study, zzso doped zzso iron oxide zzso zzso were used to form zzso zzso contrast agents for liver zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso in organic phase and then transferred into water with the help of block zzso zzso These zzso zzso are zzso into small clusters zzso diameter approximately zzso inside zzso as revealed by transmission electron zzso zzso zzso inside zzso decrease zzso zzso temperatures, as verified from differential scanning zzso and zzso transform infrared zzso The zzso based zzso are zzso at room zzso At the magnetic field of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have a zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is much higher than single zzso zzso containing zzso zzso This clustered zzso has brought significant liver contrast with signal intensity changes of zzso at zzso after intravenous zzso The time window for zzso can last about zzso with obvious contrast on liver zzso This sensitive zzso contrast agent may find applications in identification of small liver zzso evaluation of the degree of liver zzso and differential diagnosis of other liver zzso
