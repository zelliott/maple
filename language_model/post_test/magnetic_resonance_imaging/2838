To establish changes on MR of the brain in a zzso model of zzso disease in order to develop standards by which this model may be used in future zzso zzso 

Five affected zzso and six zzso zzso controls were zzso zzso and zzso images were obtained once or twice for each of four affected and five control animals at 4 1/2 to 12 weeks of age, for a total of 15 MR zzso Images were evaluated zzso for the pattern of zzso and the size of the zzso zzso After the animals were killed, zzso specimens of the brain were examined with light and electron zzso and zzso changes were correlated with zzso 

Compared with control animals, affected animals showed MR evidence of delayed zzso zzso by white matter signal zzso on zzso images and signal zzso on zzso zzso This finding was zzso by zzso findings of decreased zzso in the zzso and internal capsule zzso White matter abnormalities were not detected zzso in the animals zzso 

Although zzso zzso is primarily a zzso disease, MR imaging can show changes in zzso of white matter tracts that may be secondary to the zzso zzso This provides a zzso method of in zzso monitoring as therapeutic strategies are developed in this animal zzso
