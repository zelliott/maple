To compare brain involvement in zzso zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso disease with many features in common with zzso 

Twenty patients with zzso zzso 20 patients with zzso and 20 normal control subjects were zzso zzso testing was performed in 12 patients with zzso and in 18 patients with zzso brain zzso was performed in 17 of 20 zzso patients and 15 of 20 zzso zzso Ten patients with zzso and 11 patients with zzso were subjected to zzso zzso 

zzso of the patients with zzso and one-half of those with zzso were impaired on zzso recall, whereas one-third of the patients with zzso and less than half of those with zzso showed an impairment in zzso zzso Brain zzso was normal, or showed only zzso white matter abnormalities in both zzso and zzso zzso PET studies in zzso patients showed a bilateral decrease in regional cerebral blood flow zzso of the zzso and zzso frontal cortex, whereas zzso patients had more widespread zzso that extended to the zzso frontal zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso function may be present in zzso zzso zzso This zzso best with a reduction in regional cerebral blood flow observed in zzso PET brain scans rather than with specific structural abnormalities observed on brain zzso
