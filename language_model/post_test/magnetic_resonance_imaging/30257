To evaluate whether zzso bands zzso add information to zzso in predicting both a second attack and development of disability in patients with clinically isolated syndromes zzso 

From 1995 to 2006, zzso patients with zzso were included in a prospective zzso Patients underwent brain zzso and determination of zzso within 3 months of first zzso The number and location of zzso and presence of zzso were zzso We analyzed time to second attack and to Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso according to number of zzso criteria zzso and the presence or absence of zzso 

We studied 415 zzso patients with zzso with both baseline zzso and determination of zzso Patients were followed for a mean of 50 months zzso zzso Compared to the reference group with 0 BC at baseline zzso patients with one to two BC showed a hazard ratio zzso for conversion to zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and patients with three to four BC of zzso zzso to zzso Of the total zzso zzso were positive in zzso of the zzso However, broken down by zzso group, zzso were positive in zzso of those with no zzso zzso of those with one to two zzso and zzso of those with three or four zzso The presence of zzso increased the risk of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso independently of baseline zzso but did not modify the development of zzso 

zzso of zzso bands doubles the risk for having a second attack, independently of zzso but does not seem to influence the development of zzso
