zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso zzso with a good prognosis of seizure freedom, if totally zzso However, their accurate zzso and zzso can be difficult, and depend on the extent of pathology and zzso zzso zzso zzso assessments are valuable in these zzso We present an illustrative case of intractable zzso where judicious use of zzso zzso guided zzso of zzso CD, under general zzso and in the absence of zzso zzso mapping zzso zzso onset was accurately delineated using zzso zzso Phase reversal of the median zzso zzso zzso localized the central zzso zzso Motor evoked zzso zzso triggered by zzso zzso zzso electrical cortical stimulation at the primary motor zzso zzso threshold delineated the zzso Using this technique, zzso and the zzso tract zzso were continuously monitored during zzso No changes in zzso from the zzso baseline were zzso no residual abnormal activity was present in the zzso zzso The patient emerged from surgery without deficits and has been seizure free during a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used successfully under general zzso to guide zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso as an zzso or, in certain situations, as a viable alternative to zzso zzso zzso
