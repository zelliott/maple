To determine the spatial variation of in zzso cartilage zzso in young zzso zzso 

zzso zzso maps of seven zzso young male adults and one male volunteer with a history of previous zzso zzso fragments were calculated by using a zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging sequence at zzso zzso The zzso maps were zzso zzso to generate zzso profiles across the thickness of zzso 

All seven zzso volunteers demonstrated a zzso increase in zzso which increased from 32 zzso zzso 1 in the deep zzso zone and 48 zzso zzso 1 in the deep transitional zone to 67 zzso zzso 2 in the outer transitional superficial zzso The zzso profile of the volunteer with superficial zzso observed at zzso demonstrated marked spatial zzso and a statistically significant increase in cartilage zzso 

There is a zzso pattern of increasing zzso that is zzso to the known spatial variation in cartilage water and is zzso zzso to the distribution of zzso The authors zzso that these regional zzso differences are secondary to the restricted mobility of cartilage water within an zzso solid zzso
