An image reconstruction technique that reduces zzso artifacts by zzso image reconstruction in magnetic resonance imaging zzso is zzso The signal obtained by the zzso zzso transform zzso imaging technique can be transformed to the signal described in the zzso transform equation of the zzso zzso image reconstruction can be performed not only by inverse zzso but also by inverse zzso zzso When a zzso zzso is given in a certain range, image reconstruction by inverse zzso transform allows shrinking of images over rather wide zzso Thus, reduced zzso images can be reconstructed even from signals that produce serious zzso artifacts by standard inverse zzso zzso zzso and experimental studies reveal that the proposed method can be used to produce reduced zzso zzso
