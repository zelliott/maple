The literature suggests that pediatric zzso surgery cases that present in status zzso zzso are an unusual zzso However, this concept is based on case reports, and the zzso and clinical characteristics of these patients have not been systematically zzso 

The cohort consisted of zzso zzso surgery cases from 2000 to 2005 zzso zzso zzso and they were classified as presenting with continuous zzso requiring medical suppression therapy zzso zzso 6) or intermittent zzso zzso than 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso categories were compared with zzso surgery patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for differences in clinical variables zzso from the medical zzso 

Continuous zzso was noted in zzso and intermittent zzso in zzso of zzso surgery cases, and all had zzso cortical zzso Compared with continuous zzso and zzso cases, intermittent zzso patients were younger at surgery with shorter duration of seizures, and had an increased zzso of active infantile spasms during video scalp zzso zzso Compared with zzso cases, the continuous and intermittent zzso groups required a larger number of zzso medications zzso and zzso zzso underwent zzso more zzso and had an increased zzso of zzso and Rasmussen encephalitis and a lower occurrence of zzso and infectious zzso zzso control was over zzso up to 2 years zzso and there were no differences between patient zzso Finally, seizure frequency per hour was greater in continuous zzso cases compared with the intermittent zzso zzso 

Children presenting with continuous or intermittent zzso are not rare in pediatric zzso surgery centers, and such cases are more commonly associated with infantile spasms, zzso syndrome, and zzso zzso zzso outcome after surgery was not altered in pediatric patients because they had presented with continuous or intermittent zzso
