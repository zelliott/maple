The feasibility of using a zzso form of zzso zzso model within a 3-D finite element based Kalman filter zzso zzso is critically evaluated for the ability to provide temperature field estimates in the event of magnetic resonance temperature imaging zzso data loss during laser induced zzso therapy zzso The ability to recover missing zzso data was analyzed by systematically removing zzso information from a clinical zzso zzso procedure in human brain and comparing predictions in these regions to the original zzso Performance was zzso evaluated in terms of a zzso zzso zzso norm of the temperature error weighted by acquisition zzso During periods of no data corruption, observed error histories demonstrate that the Kalman zzso does not alter the high quality temperature measurement provided by MR zzso zzso The zzso zzso considered is seen to predict the zzso transfer with zzso error zzso 4 for a short period of time, zzso zzso 10 zzso until the data corruption zzso In its present form, the zzso method currently fails to compensate for consecutive for consecutive time periods of data loss zzso zzso 10 zzso
