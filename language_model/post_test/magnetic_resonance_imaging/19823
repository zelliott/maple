zzso techniques are among the most important tools for investigating the function of the human nervous system and for improving the clinical diagnosis of neurological zzso However, most commonly used techniques are limited by their zzso or their inability to accurately zzso neural activity in space or zzso Previous attempts at using zzso to directly image zzso activity in zzso through the detection of magnetic field changes induced by zzso currents have been challenging because of the extremely small signal changes and zzso factors such as zzso zzso Here we describe an zzso technique that uses zzso magnetic field zzso to significantly amplify and detect the zzso effect induced by zzso activity, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in imaging sensory nerve zzso in zzso in the human median nerve during electrical stimulation of the zzso This zzso zzso and zzso zzso technique may potentially find broad applications in zzso
