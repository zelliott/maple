zzso zzso navigation devices require zzso application of skin markers zzso and planning zzso which limits their even wider zzso zzso we zzso studied the zzso and accuracy of zzso zzso markers zzso for image zzso 

The accuracy of zzso was evaluated in 26 patients operated on in the zzso zzso or sitting zzso position, either by comparison to our standard navigation protocol using zzso and planning zzso or by the zzso of zzso landmarks using a routine diagnostic zzso In 21 cases, zzso were compared to zzso with planning zzso zzso zzso or CT, in nine cases and magnetic resonance imaging, or zzso in zzso The root mean square error zzso of the registered volume was calculated by the Philips zzso zzso zzso zzso navigation system and compared between the two registration zzso 

The mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso standard zzso using zzso vs zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was slightly more accurate than zzso planning zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso In three cases, diagnostic zzso zzso was used with a mean zzso of zzso zzso but acceptable zzso landmark zzso 

Our pilot study demonstrates insignificant loss of registration accuracy using zzso compared to zzso Additionally, the zzso planning investigation and accuracy loss due to zzso movement may be zzso
