To assess the zzso and potential zzso of using zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso landmarks, for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso images in the radiation treatment planning of localized prostate zzso 

All men treated with zzso therapy for localized prostate cancer underwent routine zzso zzso of zzso zzso markers to assist with gross target volume zzso zzso and to identify prostate positioning during zzso Six of these men were selected for zzso Phantom zzso zzso were obtained to zzso image zzso to determine the most suitable gold zzso marker zzso and to identify the zzso sequences that zzso both marker identification and the contrast between the prostate and the surrounding zzso The zzso for each patient was contoured independently by three radiation zzso on zzso planning CT zzso and on zzso zzso slices fused to the CT slices by matching the implanted zzso zzso From each set of contours the scan common volume zzso and the scan encompassing volume zzso were zzso The ratio zzso for a given scan is a measure of zzso variation in zzso For each of the 18 zzso combinations the observer common volume zzso and the observer encompassing volume zzso was zzso The ratio zzso for a given zzso combination is a measure of the zzso variation in zzso The distance from the treatment planning zzso to the prostate contours was measured and the zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The discrepancies between the zzso and zzso contours of the zzso prostate were recorded in the zzso plane at zzso intervals above and below the zzso 

Phantom zzso demonstrated trivial image distortion within the required field of view, and an zzso zzso zzso to be the marker composition most suitable for zzso image fusion zzso zzso variation in prostate zzso was significantly less for MR compared to zzso The mean zzso ratio was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for CT scans and zzso zzso zzso for MR scans zzso zzso zzso The overall magnitude of contoured zzso was similar for MR and CT; however, there were spatial discrepancies in zzso between the two zzso The greatest systematic zzso was at the zzso zzso prostate border, which was defined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso more zzso on zzso than zzso zzso 

zzso zzso on MR is associated with less zzso variation than on zzso In addition, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso landmarks, for the zzso of CT and MR images in the radiation treatment planning of localized prostate zzso This technique, together with zzso correction of treatment zzso according to the zzso marker position on electronic portal imaging, may enable a reduction in the planning target volume zzso margin needed to account for zzso error in target zzso and for prostate zzso
