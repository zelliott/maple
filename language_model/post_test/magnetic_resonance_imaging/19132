zzso is a novel, zzso bone zzso zzso which possesses zzso zzso Previously, we established an zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso model and reported accurate documentation of the presence and the extent of zzso involvement of zzso tumor implants using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso we investigated the activity of zzso administered zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso administration of zzso zzso with and following zzso tumor cell zzso was performed and zzso tumor response was assessed at several time points post tumor zzso 

zzso zzso scans of zzso mice at days 14 to 33 post tumor transplant revealed significant zzso of zzso tumor growth with no significant tumor growth observed by zzso on day 33 zzso The corresponding zzso examination of the whole mount zzso sections revealed similar zzso effects of zzso with respect to the topography and depth of zzso tumor zzso In contrast, control, zzso zzso revealed extensive zzso tumors with deeply invasive transitional cell zzso 

These studies demonstrate the zzso effect of zzso and highlight its importance as a potential therapy for zzso
