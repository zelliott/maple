This study was designed to determine whether zzso function in zzso persons is correlated with loss of brain volume (as measured by percentage of brain zzso volume zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso volume might correlate with zzso performance, even before overt clinical dysfunction is zzso 

A zzso zzso technique with thin section MR imaging was used for 15 patients with zzso infection zzso zzso eight zzso and for five zzso control participants to zzso whole brain and zzso zzso To determine the degree of brain zzso the zzso relative to that of zzso content was zzso zzso performance was assessed by using a standard battery of eight tests zzso test zzso 

zzso patients had significantly lower zzso scores zzso zzso zzso P zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso than those of healthy control zzso With the zzso rank order correlation zzso data analyzed for all 20 study participants (15 zzso patients and five zzso control zzso showed a significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso negative correlation between zzso and zzso test battery zzso In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between zzso score of motor impairment and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and between AIDS zzso complex score zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

These correlations suggest that zzso of zzso may offer an objective, easily acquired surrogate predictor of zzso impairment and clinically apparent zzso dysfunction among zzso zzso
