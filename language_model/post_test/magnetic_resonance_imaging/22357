The present zzso study examined effective connectivity within an emotional network composed of three brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in processing fearful zzso Two tasks: an incidental perception zzso zzso and an intentional detection zzso zzso task were performed by 14 and 10 young healthy volunteers, zzso Participants were scanned while viewing fearful, neutral and ambiguous facial zzso zzso connectivity was assessed using zzso zzso Modeling zzso zzso show that the hypothetical network fits the experimental data for both tasks and in both zzso The comparison between zzso 1 and 2 reveals significant differences in strength and direction of the connectivity patterns for the left and to a less stringent threshold for the right zzso The path zzso analysis suggests that the fearful information generated in zzso reaches the zzso through the zzso in incidental perception, while in intentional perception, the route followed is in a reverse direction from zzso to zzso Our findings confirm a differential brain connectivity between incidental and intentional processing of fearful zzso
