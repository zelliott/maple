We conducted this study to compare the strong zzso gap zzso with base excess zzso and zzso for predicting zzso outcome measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in newborns with zzso zzso zzso In a retrospective cohort of 39 newborns with zzso treated with zzso surface cooling zzso zzso 17) and no cooling zzso zzso zzso we measured blood zzso zzso and zzso at 4, 24, and 48 hours after birth, and determined cerebral injury severity by zzso zzso and zzso zzso scores at age 5 zzso Lower zzso levels correlated with better zzso zzso The highest correlation zzso zzso was in the zzso zzso zzso between zzso scores and zzso levels at 24 hours; the latter also had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso with positive and negative zzso values of 84 and zzso zzso outperformed zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso All BE zzso were zzso Overall, the zzso is similar to zzso as a zzso zzso BE levels at 4, 24, and 48 hours after birth do not predict zzso zzso While not zzso zzso the zzso is an additional zzso zzso for newborns in the first 2 days after zzso
