The zzso system zzso is implicated as a regulator of zzso of several cerebral functions and is a novel target for drug treatment of zzso zzso So far, the cerebral zzso 1 zzso zzso has only been studied using in zzso animal model, zzso and zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess the in zzso cerebral zzso distribution and its variation with healthy aging and zzso Fifty healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso binding maps were constructed, corrected for partial volume effects and analyzed using statistical zzso mapping in a combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso binding to zzso increased with aging but only in women zzso corrected for multiple zzso this was most pronounced in the zzso zzso lateral zzso zzso and zzso system, especially in the zzso Men showed higher zzso binding then women zzso zzso in clusters of the zzso system and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso binding with aging is in line with ex zzso findings in zzso studies and may be associated with a changing zzso capacity or compensation mechanisms in the zzso that is modulated by sex zzso In zzso PET of the zzso will likely improve our understanding of the zzso in several neurological and psychiatric zzso
