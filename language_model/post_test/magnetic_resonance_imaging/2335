zzso zzso of medical images poses one of the major challenges in computer zzso zzso that rely solely on intensity information frequently fail because similar intensity values appear in multiple zzso This paper presents a method for using shape knowledge to guide the zzso process, applying it to the task of finding the surface of the zzso A 3-D model that includes local shape constraints is fitted to an MR volume zzso The resulting zzso surface is used to mask out regions far from the cortical surface, enabling an zzso extraction zzso to isolate a more detailed surface zzso The surfaces generated by this technique are comparable to those achieved by other methods, without requiring user adjustment of a large number of ad hoc zzso
