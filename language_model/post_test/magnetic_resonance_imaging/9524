zzso blood flow zzso can be zzso using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in combination with a zzso model, like zzso This procedure requires the knowledge of an zzso input function which is usually estimated from the left zzso zzso zzso of the contrast agent zzso may occur between the zzso and the tissue of zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso under conditions of zzso zzso blood flow, and to simulate its effect on zzso zzso The zzso was simulated in coronary arteries using a zzso fluid dynamics zzso zzso zzso were accomplished on straight vessels with zzso of different degrees and zzso The results show that zzso is more pronounced under resting conditions than during zzso zzso leads to a reduction of zzso In consequence, zzso results in a systematic zzso zzso between zzso and zzso The relative zzso error depends not only on the zzso but also on the actual zzso zzso Since zzso under rest is more underestimated than under stress, zzso zzso reserve is overestimated between zzso and zzso Considering other sources of errors in zzso zzso zzso systematic errors of zzso by zzso zzso are relatively zzso
