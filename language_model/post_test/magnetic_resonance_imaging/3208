To assess lung zzso in young patients with zzso zzso zzso using an zzso spin labeling zzso zzso 

zzso imaging was performed in 5 healthy volunteers and 33 pediatric patients (13 zzso zzso with zzso using an zzso zzso Image quality was evaluated on a zzso scale (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were calculated based on the modified Bloch zzso zzso differences between volunteers and zzso patients and regional differences between zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso The association of zzso values and forced zzso volume in zzso zzso was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso 

Mean lung zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in volunteers and 526 zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Median image quality was 2 in volunteers and 3 in zzso zzso In zzso patients, significantly lower zzso was observed in the upper zzso compared to healthy zzso Mean zzso values significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging provides lung zzso assessment in young zzso zzso This zzso functional imaging technique is worth being evaluated in the clinical monitoring of zzso zzso
