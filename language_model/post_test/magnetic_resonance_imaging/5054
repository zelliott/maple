The purpose was to validate zzso imaging zzso in the assessment of zzso zzso compared with zzso iron oxide zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

For 21 consecutive patients with 160 zzso from zzso zzso and 25 benign focal zzso two zzso evaluated four separate review sessions zzso zzso zzso zzso II, zzso zzso III, zzso zzso images and zzso zzso IV, zzso zzso images plus zzso and zzso zzso and assigned confidence levels using a zzso scale for each zzso zzso 

The zzso values after receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for Reader 1 and Reader 2 were zzso and zzso on session I, zzso and zzso on session II, zzso and zzso on session III and zzso and zzso on session IV, zzso The zzso value of session II was significantly higher than that of session I zzso 1, zzso Reader 2, zzso and that of session III was significantly higher than that of session I zzso for each zzso or session II zzso 1, zzso Reader 2, zzso Although there was no significant difference of zzso value between session III and session IV zzso 1, zzso Reader 2, zzso the sensitivity improved for session IV compared with that for session III zzso 1, zzso Reader 2, zzso 

In the assessment of zzso zzso zzso can provide more accurate information than can zzso zzso zzso accuracy can be increased even more through the combination of both zzso
