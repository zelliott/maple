A 63 year old man developed an zzso syndrome coupled with an array of zzso zzso signs after bilateral small zzso zzso His zzso was zzso by severe difficulty in voluntary recall of recently zzso verbal and zzso materials, while his recognition for the same materials was less zzso The symptoms remained zzso at a follow up evaluation eight months after zzso zzso resonance imaging showed two small circumscribed zzso one in the zzso nucleus of the left zzso and the other in a region of the right zzso zzso and anterior limb of the right internal zzso The zzso tracts and anterior zzso of the zzso were clearly spared zzso The left zzso nucleus zzso disrupted the zzso circuit, while the anterior limb zzso of the right internal capsule disconnected the same circuit by damaging part of the anterior zzso zzso Thus the zzso in this patient may have been caused by disruption of the bilateral zzso zzso This type of zzso pathology should be separated from more conventional types of zzso that are produced by disruption of the so called zzso circuit or the zzso memory zzso
