To describe benign zzso encephalitis in a case of Sweet syndrome that also showed clinical features of zzso zzso 

A 37-year-old Japanese man developed zzso and zzso encephalitis and zzso symptoms mimicking zzso zzso zzso resonance images showed at least 5 episodes of transient abnormal signal intensity in various cerebral regions over a period of 5 zzso A skin biopsy zzso of the zzso zzso zzso plaques revealed zzso zzso compatible with Sweet zzso zzso typing showed zzso which is frequent in Sweet syndrome but rare in zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso zzso was remarkably effective for the encephalitis as well as for the zzso zzso 

We propose that there is an entity that is like Sweet disease, but with zzso encephalitis characterized by an association with zzso and a high responsiveness to zzso therapy, which we have tentatively named zzso disease, that is distinct from the classic central nervous system involvement of zzso zzso
