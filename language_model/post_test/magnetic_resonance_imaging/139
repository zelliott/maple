zzso resonance imaging zzso temperature mapping very close to the surface of an ultrasound zzso is not possible due to the large magnetic zzso induced image artifacts that arise from the materials used in zzso zzso Here, it is shown in zzso that zzso zzso sequences can be used to measure zzso increases approximately 1 zzso from the surface of a zzso zzso array zzso which has been used widely for zzso zzso drug zzso The estimated temperatures agree well with those measured using zzso
