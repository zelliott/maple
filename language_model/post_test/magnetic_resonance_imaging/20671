zzso zzso zzso which is the most common zzso of zzso stroke, may be accompanied by other cardiac sources of zzso The zzso and zzso of the cardiac sources of embolism may influence stroke severity via formation of zzso with zzso compositions, ages, and zzso We investigated among stroke patients with zzso whether stroke severity is different between patients with zzso potential cardiac sources of embolism and those zzso 

The subjects for this study were consecutive patients with cerebral zzso and zzso who underwent zzso zzso during a 10-year zzso The definitions and determination of zzso and zzso potential cardiac sources of embolism were based on the Trial of zzso zzso in Acute Stroke Treatment zzso zzso stroke severity and zzso sizes were compared between patients with zzso potential cardiac sources of embolism and those zzso 

Of the zzso patients zzso 181 zzso had one or more zzso potential cardiac sources of zzso Left zzso zzso and spontaneous echo contrast were most zzso Patients with zzso potential cardiac sources of embolism had a higher median score on the initial National Institute of Health Stroke zzso (6 zzso 3, zzso and a larger zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than those zzso zzso of the symptomatic arteries was more frequently detected in patients with zzso potential cardiac sources of zzso 

Stroke patients with zzso frequently had zzso potential cardiac sources of zzso and strokes were more severe in zzso
