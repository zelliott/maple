The aim of imaging zzso is to describe the functional organization of human brain at the level of large zzso zzso networks and zzso The systems level of description addresses how integrated brain functions are embodied in the physical structure of the zzso zzso resonance imaging is currently the technique of choice for the study of cerebral zzso relationships and the analysis of structural and functional brain images can now be carried out automatically using statistical zzso zzso The zzso ability to perform zzso zzso studies with complete objectivity and unparalleled sensitivity is providing powerful new opportunities for studying the relationship between structure and function, and how these parameters interact with zzso One of the most exciting and dramatic observations to come from human brain mapping has been the dynamic plasticity of function in both normal brains and the brains of patients with neurological and zzso zzso Recent zzso studies have provided interesting information about the zzso capacity to reorganize after injury and in association with practice and zzso The emerging studies of brain plasticity and its zzso by drugs and other therapies indicate potentially useful approaches to the rehabilitation of adults with brain damage, including damage resulting from cerebral zzso Brain maps must therefore be viewed as zzso changing with development, disease zzso normal learning and in parallel with the recovery of function after acute zzso The dynamic plasticity of functional brain maps provides an exciting opportunity to study these zzso
