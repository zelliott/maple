Patients with deficit schizophrenia zzso differ from patients with the zzso form of schizophrenia zzso in several aspects such as risk factors, zzso zzso treatment response and clinical zzso It has been debated if brain zzso could differentiate zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region regulates cognitive and emotional processing and past studies reported structural changes in this region in patients with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso scans were obtained from 18 zzso patients, 30 zzso patients and 82 healthy controls zzso We used zzso labeled cortical distance mapping zzso to measure zzso gray matter volume, cortical zzso and area of the zzso zzso Furthermore, cortical thickness was compared among the 3 groups using the pooled labeled cortical distance mapping zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of the zzso group was thinner than the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso was zzso thinner in both the zzso group and the zzso group compared with the control zzso The right zzso gray matter volume was significantly reduced in zzso patients as compared with healthy controls zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso differences in zzso may distinguish between deficit and zzso zzso of zzso
