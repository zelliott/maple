To evaluate the zzso implication of the negative conversion of predicted zzso zzso margin status before surgery in patients with locally advanced zzso cancer with predicted zzso zzso margin zzso 

zzso patients zzso men, 10 zzso median age, 61 years; age range, zzso zzso with locally advanced zzso cancer with predicted zzso zzso margin involvement who underwent zzso zzso followed by radical surgery were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso margin was predicted on the basis of zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso The primary zzso were zzso local recurrence-free survival and overall zzso 

The median follow-up time was zzso months zzso zzso zzso The negative conversion rate of predicted zzso zzso margin status after zzso zzso was zzso Patients who experienced negative conversion of predicted zzso zzso margin status had a significantly higher zzso local recurrence-free survival rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso survival rate zzso zzso zzso zzso and overall survival rate zzso zzso zzso zzso than those who had persistent zzso zzso margin zzso 

The negative conversion of the predicted zzso zzso margin status as predicted by magnetic resonance imaging will assist in individual risk zzso as a zzso factor for treatment response and survival before zzso These findings may help physicians determine whether to administer more intense zzso chemotherapy or change the surgical plan for patients displaying resistance to zzso zzso
