Few attempts have been made to examine the relationship between zzso abnormalities and specific symptoms in zzso The present study explored the relationship between zzso zzso and mood zzso and mood zzso delusional zzso 

zzso volumes were measured in 43 patients presenting with delusional beliefs in the context of their first episode of psychosis and 43 healthy volunteers matched for age and zzso 

zzso of the zzso varied as a function of gender and mood zzso of delusional beliefs, due to zzso enlargement of the left zzso in women presenting with predominantly mood zzso zzso However, there was no difference in zzso volumes across zzso 

zzso abnormalities in women may be associated with zzso emotional processing that could contribute to the development of mood zzso delusional zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso may contribute to differential zzso illness expression in men and zzso
