We examined whether distinct zzso zzso contribute in specific ways to zzso salvage in patients with acute zzso zzso zzso 

Recent studies have shown that zzso in human peripheral blood are zzso 

We studied 36 patients with primary zzso zzso blood sampling was performed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 12 days after zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by flow zzso The extent of zzso salvage 7 days after zzso was evaluated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging as the difference between zzso at risk zzso zzso zzso and zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was also performed 6 months after zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased in zzso patients, zzso on days 3 and 5 after zzso zzso zzso the peak levels of zzso zzso but not those of zzso zzso were significantly zzso associated with the extent of zzso zzso We also found that the peak levels of zzso zzso but not those of zzso zzso were zzso correlated with recovery of left zzso ejection fraction 6 months after zzso 

The peak levels of zzso zzso affect both the extent of zzso salvage and the recovery of left zzso function after zzso indicating that the manipulation of zzso zzso could be a novel therapeutic target for salvaging zzso zzso
