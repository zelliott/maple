We describe our zzso experience in the prospective examination of patients with suspected zzso zzso disease to show the diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging and the spectrum of appearances on MR zzso 

All patients who underwent MR examination for suspected zzso zzso disease from January 1990 to January 1997 in three university institutions were included in the zzso Patients presented with persistent fever or no response to zzso zzso Patients were grouped as zzso zzso treated, and chronic treated, according to the duration of their zzso Patients with 2 weeks or fewer of possible infection were acute zzso patients on zzso therapy longer than 2 weeks but shorter than 3 months were zzso treated zzso and patients on zzso therapy for 3 months or longer or who had completed zzso therapy and had a history of zzso zzso disease were chronic treated zzso MR studies were zzso interpreted for the presence of zzso zzso zzso The appearances of zzso zzso in patients in each category were zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, negative zzso value, and accuracy for detecting zzso in patients with acute presentation were also zzso 

zzso patients were included in the zzso MR imaging revealed signs consistent with zzso zzso zzso in 22 zzso of 69 patients and no demonstration of zzso zzso in 47 zzso of 69 zzso In the 60 patients with acute zzso MR imaging in 13 patients revealed zzso zzso that were interpreted as zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in 11 of these 13 zzso These zzso measured less than 1 zzso in diameter and were best shown as zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso The remaining two of the 13 patients had zzso zzso one was shown to have zzso and the other had zzso zzso For acute zzso MR sensitivity was zzso specificity was zzso positive zzso value was zzso negative zzso value was zzso and accuracy was zzso In the five patients with zzso zzso zzso were present that measured less than 1 zzso in diameter and were best shown as mildly zzso on zzso zzso A zzso ring nearly void of signal intensity was seen on zzso and zzso zzso images in all five zzso The four patients with chronic healed zzso all had zzso that were 1-3 zzso in diameter with zzso angular zzso zzso These zzso which were best shown on images obtained immediately after zzso administration, appeared as regions of diminished enhancement with no zzso zzso 

MR imaging has high diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of acute zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso treated, and chronic healed presentations may have zzso that can be distinguished by their MR zzso
