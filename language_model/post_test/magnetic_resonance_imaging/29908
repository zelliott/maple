The aim of our study was to compare the findings of high-resolution zzso of the triangular zzso with those of zzso and zzso zzso AND zzso Thirteen patients with clinically suspected triangular zzso tears zzso underwent zzso followed by zzso of their zzso zzso zzso tears were classified as predominantly zzso or predominantly zzso Only the surgeon was aware of the results of both studies, and eight patients subsequently underwent zzso The findings of the different techniques were zzso 

For the presence or absence of a zzso seven zzso of eight zzso examinations correlated with zzso and 11 zzso of 13 zzso examinations correlated with zzso zzso missed one small zzso tear that was detected at zzso and zzso but zzso showed an zzso tear in triangular zzso that appeared normal on zzso 

zzso zzso shows good correlation with zzso and zzso for the evaluation of triangular zzso zzso zzso has the potential to be a rapid and cost-effective means of diagnosing tears of the triangular zzso particularly those involving the zzso aspect of the zzso
