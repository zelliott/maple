The aim of this work was to determine the potential of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging zzso for identifying prostate cancer by comparing apparent diffusion zzso zzso from zzso peripheral zone zzso zzso with values from the zzso zzso and the predominantly benign central zzso zzso 33 patients with elevated prostate specific zzso zzso aged zzso years (30 patients with biopsy proven prostate zzso underwent zzso zzso with zzso weighted and echo zzso diffusion weighting zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso 300 zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso and 800 zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured from 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and positive zzso median region of interest zzso size 41 zzso 33 zzso regions zzso benign zzso median zzso size 218 zzso and 18 zzso zzso regions zzso zzso all zzso median zzso size zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso between all three groups were statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso Using receiver operating characteristic curves, zzso values of zzso zzso zzso differentiated zzso zzso zzso from predominantly benign zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso and of zzso zzso zzso identified zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso These results suggest that zzso has the potential to increase the specificity of prostate cancer detection because zzso are significantly lower in zzso compared with zzso prostate zzso
