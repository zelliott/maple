Growing evidence from the functional zzso field suggests that human brain functions are realized via dynamic functional interactions on large-scale structural zzso Even in resting state, functional brain networks exhibit remarkable zzso zzso However, it has been rarely explored to zzso model such dynamic functional information flows on large-scale brain zzso In this paper, we present a novel zzso framework to explore this problem using zzso resting state zzso zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso Basically, recent literature reports including our own studies have demonstrated that the resting state brain networks zzso undergo a set of distinct brain zzso Within each zzso state, functional information flows from one set of structural brain zzso to other sets of zzso which is analogous to the message package zzso on the Internet from the source zzso to the zzso zzso based on the large-scale structural brain networks constructed from zzso data, we employ a dynamic programming strategy to zzso functional information transition routines on structural networks, based on which hub routers that most frequently participate in these routines are zzso It is interesting that a majority of those hub routers are located within the default mode network zzso revealing a possible mechanism of the critical functional hub roles played by the zzso in resting zzso Also, application of this framework on a post trauma stress disorder zzso zzso demonstrated interesting difference in hub router zzso between zzso patients and healthy zzso
