A series of 110 consecutive patients with partial zzso who had undergone zzso zzso evaluation (by zzso strip, zzso grid, and/or depth zzso between February 1992 and October 1998 was zzso zzso Of these, failed zzso of seizure origin was thought to be due to sampling error in 13 zzso Nine of these 13 patients underwent a second zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso resulted in satisfactory zzso zzso in seven of nine patients, and these seven had zzso zzso Three zzso two zzso and one zzso zzso as well as one multiple zzso zzso were zzso Six patients have become seizure free, and one was not significantly zzso The mean follow-up is zzso zzso There was no permanent zzso
