zzso of verbal zzso may correlate with deficits of gray matter volume and zzso zzso of language brain regions like the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso individuals at high genetic risk zzso for schizophrenia may clarify if these deficits represent zzso trait markers or state dependent zzso We assessed adolescent and young adult zzso subjects zzso and healthy controls zzso zzso using verbal zzso tests and zzso to process zzso zzso We hypothesized zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and their correlation with verbal zzso zzso zzso subjects had letter verbal zzso deficits zzso for zzso left zzso deficits zzso zzso zzso and reversal of the zzso zzso asymmetry noted in zzso Right zzso zzso left zzso zzso and right angular zzso zzso were also reduced in zzso zzso The zzso asymmetry of the zzso zzso seen in HC was exaggerated and zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso of angular zzso seen in HC were attenuated in zzso zzso zzso asymmetry of the zzso predicted better verbal zzso across the pooled zzso and HC zzso Young relatives of schizophrenia patients have verbal zzso deficits, gray matter volume deficits and reversed asymmetry of the zzso zzso A reversed structural asymmetry of the zzso in zzso subjects may impair expressive language abilities leading to verbal zzso zzso zzso deficits and altered asymmetry in inferior zzso and zzso zzso may accompany genetic liability to zzso
