To explore the zzso performance, the characteristics of volume, and the largest signal zzso of blood zzso level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in brain tumors located in or closed to the central zzso 

We recruited 13 normal volunteers and zzso benign tumors and 18 zzso zzso patients with brain tumor located in or closed to the central area, to examine both side hand motor and tactile function by zzso and obtained the zzso map and its zzso image with zzso imaging, the volume, and the largest signal zzso of the functional area by zzso software which manipulated the raw data in the zzso work zzso The volume and the largest signal zzso data of the functional area were statistically analyzed by zzso zzso 

The volume and the largest signal zzso of the zzso map in the normal functional area had zzso zzso There was difference in the activated signal zzso number and the largest signal zzso of the functional area between the benign brain tumors, zzso brain tumors, and the normal volunteers zzso zzso zzso The shape, zzso location, the volume, and the largest signal zzso of the functional area were changed in the patients with brain zzso 

zzso is a valid method to assess the zzso risk of patients with brain tumors, which can get the volume, the largest signal zzso the basic zzso the zzso location of the functional zzso
