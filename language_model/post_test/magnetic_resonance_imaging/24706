To zzso the MR imaging protocol for coronary zzso wall depiction in zzso and characterize the coronary zzso zzso 

zzso examination was zzso performed in ten zzso hearts in order to zzso the MR imaging zzso Various surface coils were used for coronary zzso wall imaging with the same zzso Then, the image parameters were further zzso for high-resolution coronary wall zzso The zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso of images were zzso Finally, 8 human zzso hearts with coronary zzso plaques were zzso performed with zzso examination using zzso protocol in order to characterize the coronary zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso of MR image with zzso zzso were the highest of various surface zzso zzso and high zzso and zzso for ex zzso coronary artery wall depiction can be achieved using zzso zzso with 512 zzso 512 in zzso Compared with zzso the sensitivity and specificity of zzso for identifying advanced plaques were: type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso type VI zzso zzso and zzso type zzso zzso zzso and zzso and type VIII zzso without zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso appears to be dramatically superior to zzso head zzso and knee zzso for ex zzso coronary artery wall imaging, providing higher spatial resolution and improved the zzso zzso zzso high-resolution zzso has capability to distinguish human coronary zzso plaque compositions and accurately zzso advanced zzso
