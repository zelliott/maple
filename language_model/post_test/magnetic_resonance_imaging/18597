A zzso stimulation method for rapidly obtaining zzso maps in human zzso zzso using functional zzso was compared to conventional zzso zzso While maintaining central zzso each participant viewed the conventional display, consisting of a single rotating zzso wedge and, in a separate run, the zzso display, consisting of two zzso placed rotating zzso wedges (a zzso zzso Both stimulus zzso used wedges with 30 degree polar angle zzso zzso degrees visual angle extension from zzso and zzso zzso contrast polarity reversal zzso zzso maps in each condition were projected onto a distortion corrected zzso flattened cortical surface representation obtained from a high-resolution structural zzso An automated procedure to zzso borders between early visual areas revealed, as expected, that map precision increased with duration of data acquisition for both zzso zzso stimulation required zzso less time to yield maps with similar precision to those obtained using conventional zzso zzso
