There is growing interest in the human zzso zzso zzso gene both as a molecular imaging reporter gene and as a therapeutic zzso Here, we show the feasibility of zzso therapy of neuroendocrine zzso As a separate application of zzso gene transfer, we image zzso tumors with pinhole zzso in living zzso 

zzso studies and in zzso therapy experiments were performed in nude mice carrying zzso zzso neuroendocrine tumor zzso following zzso injection of zzso and zzso zzso To show the usefulness of zzso as an imaging reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso using a clinical gamma camera in combination with a custom-made single pinhole zzso followed by zzso animal zzso data zzso 

zzso neuroendocrine tumors strongly accumulated zzso and zzso zzso as did zzso stomach, and zzso zzso The volume of zzso neuroendocrine tumors decreased significantly after therapeutic administration of zzso or zzso zzso whereas control tumors continued to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso could be zzso in zzso at high resolution with a clinical gamma camera equipped with a custom-made single pinhole zzso zzso functional and zzso information could be combined in a single three-dimensional data set by zzso of zzso and small animal zzso zzso Lastly, we demonstrated a therapeutic effect of zzso zzso on zzso neuroendocrine tumors in cell culture and, for the first time, in zzso thought to be due to zzso zzso and conversion zzso 

zzso neuroendocrine tumors efficiently concentrate zzso allowing for in zzso high-resolution small animal zzso imaging as well as rendering possible successful zzso therapy of neuroendocrine zzso
