zzso to similarity in both zzso size and zzso zzso zzso is known to behave in a comparable way to calcium zzso and its role in bone metabolism has been well documented as both zzso and bone zzso In this study, novel zzso zzso zzso glasses, containing 1, 3 and 5 zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso magic angle spinning zzso nuclear magnetic resonance results showed that, as the zzso content is increased in the glasses, there is a slight increase in zzso of zzso zzso environments into zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and strengthening of the zzso to bridging oxygen distance occurred as obtained from zzso The general broadening of the spectral features with zzso content is most probably due to the increased variation of the zzso bonding interactions caused by the introduction of the third zzso This increased disorder may be the cause of the increased degradation of the zzso glasses relative to the zzso zzso As confirmed from zzso analysis, all zzso glasses showed higher zzso than expected and this also could be accounted for by the higher degradation of these glasses compared with zzso zzso zzso of surface free energy zzso showed that incorporation of zzso had no effect on zzso and samples had relatively higher fractional zzso which is not expected to promote high cell zzso From viability studies, however, the incorporation of zzso showed better cellular response than zzso glasses, but still lower than the positive zzso This zzso cellular response could be due to the high degradation nature of these glasses and not due to the presence of zzso
