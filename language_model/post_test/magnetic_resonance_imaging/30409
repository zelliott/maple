To zzso compare different magnetic resonance zzso imaging techniques and pulse sequences for the depiction of brain injury in zzso zzso zzso 

The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and zzso informed zzso zzso zzso underwent MR imaging within 10 days after birth because of zzso zzso Two investigators separately and zzso evaluated zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso and zzso contrast zzso MR images for presence of zzso injury zzso zzso agreement between the zzso for visualizing abnormalities on images obtained with the individual pulse sequences was zzso Individual assessments were compared with the consensus reading zzso zzso to determine which techniques were best for visualizing zzso zzso zzso which combination of pulse sequences had the best performance for visualizing certain injury patterns was zzso All analyses were repeated for infants zzso within 4 days after birth and those zzso between 4 and 10 days after zzso 

Forty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age, 37 weeks to 42 weeks 2 zzso were zzso zzso agreement was moderate for all pulse sequences zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso As compared with the reference standard, zzso imaging performed best in both groups zzso zzso zzso or zzso 4 days and those zzso zzso 4 days after zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso limb of the internal capsule zzso zzso as well as for zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso images were scored best in both groups zzso zzso For zzso white matter zzso zzso images were scored as good in both groups zzso zzso Adding zzso and zzso imaging to the combination of zzso and zzso imaging and zzso imaging did not contribute to detection of zzso brain zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso MR imaging and zzso imaging is best for detecting zzso brain zzso in the early zzso period in zzso zzso
