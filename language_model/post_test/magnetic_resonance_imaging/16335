The new definition of a transient zzso attack zzso makes it more difficult to distinguish it from an zzso seizure zzso 

The present study compares the characteristics of patients with an IS to those with a zzso taking into account the old and the new definition of a zzso 

The clinical characteristics and the electroencephalogram zzso findings of 25 patients with an IS were compared to 252 patients with a zzso according to the old zzso zzso of 10 patients with an IS without structural zzso and 195 zzso patients according to the new definition were also zzso The differential diagnostic clues were zzso 

zzso in age, gender distribution and vascular risk factors were observed only when comparing the overall patient zzso However, these differences disappeared when the zzso were zzso Temporary speech zzso associated with some partial zzso for the event, was the most common clinical presentation of an zzso Additionally, specific and zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were observed in the majority of the IS patients, while the zzso was normal in more than zzso of the zzso zzso 

An IS must be suspected in a patient with a short temporary speech zzso and partial zzso for the zzso In view of the new definition of a zzso urgent zzso becomes mandatory in each patient with a brief episode of neurological zzso
