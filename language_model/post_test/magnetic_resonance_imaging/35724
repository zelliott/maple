The use of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the detection and staging of zzso zzso was investigated in 104 patients with 106 zzso cell zzso confirmed at surgery or zzso Overall, MR imaging demonstrated 101 of 106 zzso zzso including all 93 tumors that were larger than 3 zzso in diameter but only eight of the 13 smaller tumors zzso MR imaging enabled accurate staging of zzso of all detected zzso but led to the zzso of nine zzso and the zzso of zzso At present, MR imaging cannot be used as a screening zzso for zzso zzso However, its negative zzso values of zzso and zzso respectively, for the evaluation of tumor vascular extension and tumor spread to adjacent structures makes it an excellent staging zzso that should be used when the CT findings are zzso MR imaging is not accurate in indicating zzso and zzso involvement, but rapid technical advances and the introduction of zzso contrast medium may improve this present zzso
