The neural mechanisms for the perception of face and motion were studied using zzso threshold zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was recorded over the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso components of the face altered the perception of familiar faces significantly, and familiarity can facilitate the zzso processing of facial zzso Similarly, the zzso components of the face seemed to be crucial for the recognition of facial zzso Aging and zzso zzso affected motion perception zzso Two distinct components of motion zzso zzso and zzso were recorded over the zzso zzso The former was related to horizontal motion perception while the latter reflected the perception of zzso zzso flow zzso The results of zzso showed that horizontal movements of objects and zzso zzso flow motion were perceived differently in the zzso and superior zzso zzso We conclude that an integrated approach can provide useful information on spatial and zzso processing of face and motion zzso
