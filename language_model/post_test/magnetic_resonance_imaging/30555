The goal in this study was to examine the zzso and zzso anatomy of the zzso and its projection zzso and to analyze the functional and surgical implications of the zzso 

Fifteen zzso human brain zzso were dissected using the zzso fiber dissection technique, with the aid of an operating microscope at zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging studies of 5 normal brains were analyzed using diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Both the zzso and external capsule have 2 zzso zzso and zzso The zzso part of the external capsule is mainly composed of the zzso fibers that zzso into the gray matter of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso studies coincided with the fiber dissection findings and showed that the zzso fibers connect the zzso with the superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and are zzso zzso The zzso part of the external capsule is formed by the zzso and inferior zzso zzso which traverse the zzso part of the zzso connecting the zzso and prefrontal zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The relationship between the insular surface and the underlying fiber zzso and between the zzso lower surface of the zzso and the lateral zzso arteries is zzso 

The combination of the fiber dissection technique and zzso zzso zzso supports the presence of the zzso system as an zzso network in humans and offers the potential to aid in understanding the diffusion of zzso in the zzso and other areas of the zzso
