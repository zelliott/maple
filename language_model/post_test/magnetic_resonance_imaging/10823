zzso learning theory assumes that prediction error is a driving force in zzso A competing view, zzso contrast zzso theory, is that learning and prediction error are zzso We tested a learning phenomenon that has proved troublesome for zzso zzso zzso evaluate these two zzso We previously showed that zzso in right lateral prefrontal zzso zzso provides a reliable signature for the presence of prediction zzso Thus, if the zzso view is correct, retrospective zzso should be accompanied by right lateral zzso zzso PC theory would be supported by the absence of this zzso Right zzso and zzso zzso zzso occurred during retrospective zzso supporting the zzso zzso zzso appeared to reflect the degree of zzso predicting later brain responses to zzso zzso Our results support a modified zzso account of retrospective zzso and demonstrate the potential of functional zzso as a tool for evaluating competing learning zzso
