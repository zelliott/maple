The study aims to evaluate and compare zzso and parent zzso quality of life zzso in pediatric patients with repaired zzso of zzso zzso and determine relationships with residual zzso 

zzso was zzso evaluated in zzso with repaired zzso and parents' proxy report using the zzso Quality of Life zzso zzso Core and zzso zzso zzso The scores were compared with published self and parent zzso zzso data for children considered healthy, chronically ill, and with zzso heart zzso Recent clinical data were reviewed for correlations between zzso and residual disease zzso 

Twenty zzso pairs were assessed at median age of zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher than parent proxy zzso Compared with peers, zzso zzso was higher than for chronically ill children zzso zzso 85 zzso 77, zzso zzso and similar to healthy children (85 zzso 83, zzso zzso while proxy report by parent was similar to parents of chronically ill children zzso zzso 77 zzso 74, zzso zzso Despite moderate pulmonary zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso 114 zzso ), zzso had a New York Heart Association class of 1, normal zzso zzso (24 zzso reasonable exercise tolerance zzso zzso predicted zzso zzso and preserved right zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso positively correlated with child's zzso zzso predicted, when reported by child zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and parent proxy zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso with repaired zzso is not zzso to the severity of their residual zzso zzso zzso appears similar to healthy peers while parent proxy reported lower zzso For both children and parents, zzso positively correlated with the child's exercise zzso zzso comprehensive follow-up should include cardiac rehabilitation and zzso evaluation to ensure an active lifestyle, improve health perception, and prevent later acquired heart zzso
