Although zzso zzso therapy zzso is an effective treatment option for panic disorder with zzso the neural zzso of treatment response remain zzso Evidence suggests that panic disorder with zzso is characterized by dysfunctional safety signal zzso Using fear conditioning as a zzso probe, the authors investigated neural baseline characteristics and zzso changes after zzso that were associated with treatment outcome in patients with panic disorder with zzso 

zzso zzso of fear conditioning and extinction were measured using functional zzso before and after a zzso zzso program focusing on behavioral exposure in 49 zzso patients with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder with zzso Treatment response was defined as a reduction exceeding 50% in Hamilton zzso zzso zzso zzso 

At zzso zzso exhibited enhanced zzso in the right zzso anterior zzso cortex, the zzso and the zzso in response to a safety zzso While this zzso pattern partly resolved in zzso after zzso successful treatment was characterized by increased right zzso zzso when processing stimulus zzso Treatment response was associated with an zzso functional zzso between the anterior zzso zzso and the zzso that did not change over zzso 

This study identified brain zzso patterns associated with treatment response in patients with panic disorder with zzso zzso safety signal processing and anterior zzso zzso zzso may indicate individual differences among these patients that determine the effectiveness of zzso zzso and associated zzso zzso zzso point to brain networks by which successful zzso in this patient population is zzso
