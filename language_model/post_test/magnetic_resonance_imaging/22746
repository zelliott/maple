zzso resonance imaging zzso is based on a wide variety of physical zzso which, in principle, can all influence the image contrast zzso As these diverse variables are validated by independent zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques, a zzso zzso zzso This imaging zzso has been successfully applied to experimental stroke studies, covering a broad range of raised zzso In the present review, we present an overview of possible zzso criteria to be studied by in zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso and critically analyze the present limits and future potential of the imaging technique for experimental stroke zzso The documented applications cover the spectrum from zzso details of the zzso to zzso and zzso zzso inflammatory reaction, evaluation of zzso treatment, studies on recovery of functional brain zzso by functional zzso and, finally, the most recent applications of exploring stem cells for zzso zzso
