To assess absolute zzso in the skeletal muscle of mice in zzso with spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging zzso under normal and stress zzso 

Absolute zzso in the skeletal muscle of 27 zzso mice was assessed in zzso zzso by spin labeling zzso at zzso zzso This technique was based on the acquisition of zzso maps with global and zzso spin inversion in separate zzso zzso mapping was performed by inversion recovery snapshot fast low angle shot zzso To guarantee proper spin inversion within the whole zzso a dedicated zzso zzso zzso combination was zzso A zzso zzso was used for transmission, while detection of the zzso signal was achieved by a surface zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso was determined to be 94 zzso 10 zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso standard error of the mean zzso N zzso zzso This value is in good agreement with zzso values determined by invasive techniques such as zzso A zzso of six animals received a constant dose of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by an zzso zzso In this case, zzso was significantly increased to 179 zzso 56 zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso 6, P zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso in this zzso was 96 zzso 26 zzso zzso g zzso zzso 

Spin labeling zzso is a zzso technique for the in zzso assessment of absolute zzso in the zzso skeletal zzso
