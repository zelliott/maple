To investigate the zzso pattern in patients with benign adult familial zzso zzso zzso an inherited form of zzso zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso 

Eleven zzso patients from three families showing linkage to zzso were compared with 11 zzso healthy control zzso 

MR imaging of all the patients and healthy subjects exhibited no structural abnormalities on detailed visual zzso However, compared with healthy subjects, patients with zzso displayed elevated zzso ratio in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas there was no significant difference for the other zzso No zzso values in the frontal and zzso zzso differed significantly in the patients compared with the healthy zzso No correlation was detected between zzso values and disease duration zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso severity zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that the zzso is a prominent site of dysfunction in zzso The abnormal zzso zzso could reflect changes in the chemical and functional nature of cell zzso zzso was able to detect brain changes also in patients with recent disease onset and may be a useful tool supporting the diagnosis based on familial and zzso zzso The relationship between cortical zzso and the zzso is also zzso
