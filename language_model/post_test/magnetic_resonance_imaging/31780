Conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is sensitive in detecting abnormalities in multiple sclerosis zzso but these tend not to be zzso zzso The visible zzso zzso are zzso valuable and may allow earlier diagnosis of the disease and more accurate zzso zzso MR techniques such as volume measurement can reveal pathology in zzso tissue with some clinical zzso however, accurate pathological interpretation at a cellular level is problematic given the current resolution of zzso In this update, recent studies using conventional and quantitative MR techniques are discussed and new, promising zzso zzso zzso including retinal nerve fiber layer zzso The role of zzso in measuring zzso function, such as functional measures and investigating zzso symptoms such as zzso is also discussed as are future improvements to the techniques currently employed in research zzso With increased sophistication and improved analysis of these techniques, understanding of the pathology underlying zzso may increase, and objective zzso of the natural history of zzso is zzso
