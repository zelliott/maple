In the present zzso study the issue of the specific zzso zzso during imagery generation in different sensory zzso is zzso In particular, we tested whether the zzso zzso of imagery was reflected in the zzso signal within specific sensory zzso zzso were asked to generate a mental image for each auditory presented zzso Each imagery zzso was contrasted with an abstract sentence zzso In addition, subjects were asked to fill the Italian version of the zzso Upon Mental zzso zzso prior to each zzso zzso In general, greater involvement of sensory specific zzso in zzso versus zzso subjects was found for visual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tactile and for zzso zzso zzso imagery zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso is related to image zzso zzso subjects would create more zzso representations relying on the same specific neural zzso active during perception with respect to zzso zzso zzso are also discussed according to the simulation zzso
