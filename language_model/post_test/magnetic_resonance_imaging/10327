Progressive zzso zzso zzso is a neurodegenerative disease presenting with voluntary gaze difficulties, early falls, and zzso zzso loss, associated with zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso is found targeting the zzso zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso zzso PET is a marker of peripheral zzso binding sites zzso expressed by activated zzso We have used zzso PET to demonstrate in zzso the degree and distribution of the zzso response to the degenerative process in four patients with zzso Compared to normal zzso controls, the zzso patient group showed significantly increased mean zzso binding in the zzso zzso zzso the frontal zzso and the zzso Two of the patients were zzso after 6 to 10 months and during that time the level of zzso zzso remained zzso zzso PET reveals a pattern of increased zzso zzso in zzso patients involving cortical and zzso regions that zzso well with the known distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, may help in characterizing in zzso the underlying disease activity in zzso
