zzso measures of zzso volume have been used to distinguish subjects with and without probable zzso disease zzso However, relatively little information is available about how well such zzso measures correlate with zzso measures of disease in zzso zzso In this study, zzso magnetic resonance scans were collected from 10 subjects with probable zzso and 3 zzso controls who later came to zzso zzso correlations were observed between zzso zzso volumes and both zzso severity and the density of zzso zzso zzso at zzso Total cerebral volumes, in contrast, were significantly correlated with the density of zzso senile zzso The data suggest that zzso volume assessed in living subjects with probable zzso is both a good marker of zzso severity and of an underlying element of the zzso disease zzso
