zzso theories of how people regulate their thoughts have suggested the involvement of two control processes that occur over different time zzso These cognitive accounts parallel recent neural models of executive control, which suggest that the prefrontal zzso zzso mediates sustained changes in the allocation of control zzso whereas the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso a transient need for additional zzso Combining these cognitive and neural models of control, we used recently developed analysis techniques to distinguish transient from sustained changes in brain zzso while subjects attempted to suppress an unwanted zzso zzso were consistent with both models: zzso zzso demonstrated sustained increases in zzso during attempts at thought suppression, whereas bilateral zzso demonstrated transient increases associated with zzso of unwanted zzso These data support proposals regarding the different contributions made by the zzso and zzso to executive control and provide initial zzso support for zzso models of how individuals regulate their zzso
