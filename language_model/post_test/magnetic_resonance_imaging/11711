Studies of zzso in zzso fluid zzso of patients with active multiple sclerosis zzso have indicated that specific zzso may have important roles in disease zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso of zzso zzso known as zzso were elevated in zzso patients in zzso whilst levels of zzso zzso were zzso Here, we report a serial analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 22 patients with attacks of zzso or acute zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso and 26 patients treated with zzso in two zzso controlled zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso linked zzso zzso zzso in zzso obtained at baseline and after 3 weeks, and were compared with other measures of zzso zzso At baseline zzso zzso of zzso were significantly lower in the patient group than in zzso The levels of zzso were higher in the patient group than in controls but two zzso in the control group also had high zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso did not change over time or after zzso The zzso concentration of zzso was positively correlated with the zzso zzso count, the zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The concentration of zzso increased between baseline for 3 weeks in both groups, more distinctly so in patients treated with zzso zzso correlated zzso with zzso and zzso synthesis zzso zzso may be involved in the maintenance of zzso inflammation whereas zzso zzso zzso with measures of zzso suggesting differential involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
