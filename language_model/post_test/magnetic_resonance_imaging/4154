The zzso and other zzso zzso structures support long-term memory and also are common zzso for zzso Recently it was shown that these brain structures may zzso the short-term storage and rehearsal processes called working memory in zzso We determined the accuracy of verbal and zzso working memory in the presence and in the absence of zzso zzso spikes in eight patients who had bilateral depth zzso implanted to evaluate intractable zzso Six of eight patients had declines in working memory performance during zzso zzso zzso with the greatest disruption in spatial and verbal recall zzso with left zzso spikes zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy of working memory for all patients declined an average of zzso on spike zzso The two patients who did not have decreased accuracy during spike trials also had the best overall working memory zzso zzso zzso spikes were not detected on zzso recordings and yet may be associated with declines in working memory in some patients with zzso
