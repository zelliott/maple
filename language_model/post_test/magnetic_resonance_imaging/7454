With the progression of substance zzso drug zzso brain zzso is thought to shift from motivational towards habit zzso However, a direct association between zzso brain zzso and dependence duration has not yet been zzso We therefore examined the relationship between alcohol zzso in the brain, zzso zzso craving and alcohol dependence duration and zzso Since alcohol dependence is highly zzso with zzso which may zzso brain responses to alcohol cues, we also examined the relation between zzso zzso and zzso 

We compared 30 alcohol dependent patients with 15 healthy controls and 15 zzso patients during a visual alcohol zzso task using functional magnetic resonance imaging blood zzso zzso responses and zzso craving as zzso Within the alcohol dependent group we correlated zzso with alcohol dependence severity and zzso with zzso craving and with zzso zzso 

Alcohol dependent patients showed greater zzso in motivational brain pathways and stronger zzso craving than zzso patients and healthy zzso zzso was not associated with zzso but depression severity in alcohol dependent patients was positively associated with zzso Within alcohol zzso longer duration of alcohol dependence was associated with stronger zzso zzso of the zzso zzso a structure involved in habits, whereas higher alcohol dependence severity was associated with lower zzso in the anterior zzso an area implicated in zzso behavior preceding habit zzso 

zzso in alcohol dependence is not modulated by zzso depression or zzso More importantly, the current data confirm the hypothesis of a zzso to zzso zzso shift of learning processes with longer dependence zzso which could zzso increasingly habitual substance use with progressing substance zzso
