zzso resonance imaging zzso of the breast has been shown to be useful as an additional imaging test in patients suspected of having zzso disease, when clinical examination or zzso are zzso This study examines the utility of zzso as a routine test in the follow-up of treated breast cancer patients without zzso clinical or imaging zzso 

zzso breast zzso was performed as part of routine breast cancer follow-up in 26 patients with zzso clinical or zzso findings and 33 control patients in whom clinical and imaging findings were consistent with zzso changes zzso Clinical outcome was assessed at 3 years post zzso 

Four patients with zzso clinical or zzso findings had abnormal zzso all zzso abnormalities were subsequently shown to represent benign zzso None of the zzso group developed local zzso although two of 26 developed distant zzso One of the control group had zzso distant zzso detected by zzso the other 32 patients had no significant zzso on zzso Three patients subsequently developed local zzso zzso 

A single normal breast zzso examination during follow-up is a poor predictor of subsequent local zzso
