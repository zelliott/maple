We modeled four different zzso zzso of a zzso zzso to examine their effects on field zzso and zzso ratio zzso at 64 zzso and 125 zzso The zzso are defined zzso 1) zzso a conventional zzso zzso 2) surrounding zzso a shield with zzso extensions to closely shield the end zzso 3) solid connection: a shield with zzso extensions connected to the zzso and 4) thin wire connection: a shield with thin wires connected to the zzso At both zzso the zzso with conventional zzso zzso produces the most homogeneous zzso magnetic zzso field when the zzso is empty, but produces the least homogeneous B1 field when the zzso is loaded with a human zzso The surrounding shield zzso results in the most homogeneous B1 and highest zzso in the zzso loaded with the human head at both zzso followed closely by the solid connection zzso
