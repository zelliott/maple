Early diagnosis and treatment of spinal zzso zzso zzso is of the utmost importance to prevent neurological deficit due to spinal zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso has become the final tool in that diagnostic zzso However, access to zzso is still limited in The Netherlands, requiring cost-effective zzso It is generally acknowledged that patients with systemic cancer who present with a zzso or zzso should undergo an zzso However, the diagnostic policy in patients with systemic cancer who present with recently developed back pain is still a matter of zzso 

To identify the patients with back pain in whom zzso can safely be omitted because of a low risk of zzso 

In a prospective series of 170 consecutive patients with cancer with recently developed back pain, prediction of spinal zzso disease zzso and especially zzso was studied by means of a zzso risk analysis of the parameters of the standard neurological evaluation zzso history, neurological examination, and plain films of the whole zzso zzso resonance imaging was used as the criterion zzso We calculated the risk implications of omitting zzso in patients with an estimated risk below different zzso zzso 

Spinal zzso disease was diagnosed in 80 patients zzso of these, 31 had zzso A zzso zzso on plain films was the strongest independent predictor for zzso Other important zzso were night pain, progressive pain, and zzso zzso Advanced age, zzso of pain during zzso and zzso fracture imply a low risk of zzso Night pain and the zzso score proved to be the main zzso for zzso A plain film showing an zzso fracture strongly decreased the risk of zzso The discriminating value of the zzso analysis was too low, and too few patients can be excluded from undergoing zzso on the basis of the standard neurological zzso To identify all the patients with zzso zzso zzso would be excluded in only 7 zzso Identification of all patients with zzso zzso reduced the number of zzso by 21 at the expense of plain films of the whole spine for any zzso 

zzso of patients with cancer with back pain at risk of zzso was not possible with the standard neurological zzso After intake by the zzso the next step should be zzso of the whole zzso
