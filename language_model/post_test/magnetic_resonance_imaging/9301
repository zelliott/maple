zzso spin labeling zzso is a safe, zzso imaging method for evaluating cerebral blood flow zzso The purpose of this article is to present zzso imaging features of 38 elderly cognitively zzso zzso with their zzso values and an averaged profile of targeted zzso regions zzso zzso 

zzso zzso underwent MR imaging especially zzso with zzso zzso techniques fusing the MR anatomical and zzso images to a standard reference brain zzso The zzso images were fused to echo zzso images, which were then zzso to high-resolution anatomical zzso zzso zzso was calculated per region of interest using a modified continuous zzso spin labeling zzso zzso zzso zzso regions were selected and identified by the zzso zzso in zzso 

We identified areas of decreased and increased zzso zzso to the averaged zzso of all 38 zzso corresponding to decreased and increased zzso zzso The most common sites for decreased zzso were zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for increased zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

There are regional variations in zzso both increased and decreased with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso showing the highest averaged values and signal intensity zzso zzso These variations represent the normal profile of a zzso elderly brain, with higher zzso in areas associated with zzso memory, and zzso It is necessary to understand these normal variations in order to determine if there are zzso changes in zzso detected in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's zzso
