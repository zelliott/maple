The conditions of everyday life are such that people often hear speech that has been zzso zzso by background noise or electronic zzso or when they are distracted by other zzso However, it remains unclear what role attention plays in processing speech that is difficult to zzso In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree to which spoken sentences were processed under zzso and whether this depended on the acoustic quality zzso of the zzso On every trial, adult human participants attended to one of three simultaneously presented zzso a sentence (at one of four acoustic clarity zzso an auditory zzso or a visual zzso A zzso recognition test showed that clear speech was processed even when not attended, but that attention greatly enhanced the processing of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso could be zzso according to how zzso responses were modulated by zzso zzso in auditory zzso and areas along the superior zzso zzso zzso took the same form regardless of attention, although responses to distorted speech in portions of both zzso and anterior zzso were enhanced under directed zzso In contrast, frontal regions, including left inferior frontal zzso were only engaged when listeners were attending to speech and these regions exhibited elevated responses to zzso compared with clear, zzso We suggest this response is a neural marker of zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that attention enhances the processing of zzso speech by engaging zzso mechanisms that zzso zzso auditory zzso
