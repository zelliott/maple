The zzso of focal spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with cervical zzso is zzso This study was undertaken to determine the frequency and cause of zzso The authors reviewed serial cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging zzso reports and reviewed scans with zzso and zzso zzso or zzso The authors noted the location, shape, and extent of zzso and severity of zzso zzso as a zzso score zzso The authors recorded the age and vascular risk factors for each zzso zzso of 273 scans zzso with cervical zzso and 19 of 36 scans zzso with zzso zzso had zzso The zzso extended for one zzso level from the zzso in 12 patients and for three zzso levels in 5 patients, and were distant from the zzso in 2 zzso The zzso had a zzso symmetrical, anterior spinal artery terminal zone location in 16 of 19 scans zzso A rim zzso with normal zzso separated all zzso from the zzso zzso Patients with zzso were older zzso years zzso zzso years versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and had a higher SS zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than patients without zzso The zzso relates to the severity of cervical zzso The anterior spinal artery territory location, the normal zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso and the presence of zzso at a distance from the zzso level all suggest an zzso basis for zzso
