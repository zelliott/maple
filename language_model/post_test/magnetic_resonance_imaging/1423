The combined acquisition of zzso images and localized zzso is considered essential to the practical application of zzso techniques to human and animal zzso zzso surface coils which have been introduced to the literature are intended to address the problem; however, a careful evaluation of available designs is zzso The zzso method, the loop gap zzso design, and the zzso zzso design are evaluated here using bench tests of signal intensity and Q as well as zzso zzso on a zzso zzso Comparisons are made relative to zzso zzso circuits of the same size for both zzso at 85 zzso and zzso at 34 zzso The results suggest that the zzso design and the zzso coupled design are very efficient zzso in the zzso mode zzso zzso while the loop gap zzso is relatively inefficient zzso In the zzso mode (85 zzso the loop gap zzso is zzso efficient while the zzso design and the zzso coupled zzso are closer to 50% zzso
