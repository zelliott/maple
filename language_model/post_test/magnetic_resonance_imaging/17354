zzso syndrome is a zzso disorder with vascular zzso of the skin, brain, and zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether cortical zzso in patients with zzso syndrome zzso with clinical zzso zzso subjects (age 4 zzso zzso with unilateral zzso syndrome received a zzso examination and submitted previous magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso A blinded investigator assigned clinical severity scores based on seizures, zzso visual field cut, and cognitive zzso zzso analysis of zzso produced zzso scores for cortical volume zzso A significant relationship existed between clinical severity and zzso scores zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso scores also correlated well with zzso zzso and zzso with cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Using this simple, zzso analysis, cortical volume asymmetry correlated with clinical zzso This method offers the advantages of relative zzso objectivity, and wide zzso to films from outside institutions, as would be encountered in clinical zzso
