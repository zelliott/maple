zzso of the cavernous zzso remain a technical zzso The most common surgical approaches involve some variation of the standard zzso zzso Here, the authors describe a surgical approach to access the cavernous zzso that involves the removal of the lateral zzso zzso 

To achieve exposure of the cavernous zzso a lateral zzso incision is performed, and the lateral zzso rim and anterior lateral wall are removed, for later replacement at zzso The zzso lateral zzso wall is removed to the region of the superior and inferior zzso zzso With reflection of the zzso covering of the lateral cavernous zzso and removal of the anterior zzso process, the cavernous zzso is zzso 

Exposure and details of the procedure were derived from anatomical study in zzso After the approach, with removal of the anterior zzso process, the entire cavernous zzso from the superior zzso zzso zzso to the zzso cave zzso is zzso More exposure to the lateral middle zzso zzso zzso and zzso carotid artery is obtained by further removal of the lateral zzso zzso An illustrative case example for approaching a cavernous zzso zzso is zzso 

The zzso zzso wall approach provides a simple, rapid approach for zzso with primary or secondary involvement of the cavernous zzso zzso of this simple, zzso approach include the lack of brain zzso and no interruption of the zzso zzso
