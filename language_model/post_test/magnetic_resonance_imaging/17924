To examine the relative and combined value of late zzso enhancement zzso and zzso zzso zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso to predict zzso zzso zzso following acute zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso were zzso zzso was performed 2-4 days after presentation and at 6 zzso zzso wall motion and volume were recorded at rest and following zzso zzso zzso of first pass zzso persistent zzso obstruction zzso and zzso were obtained following contrast zzso zzso was performed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was employed to determine the zzso and zzso models most zzso of zzso at 6 zzso The incremental and relative value of zzso over zzso was zzso The most zzso zzso was zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The optimal zzso zzso model, utilizing data from all zzso was highly zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The optimal model using parameters only from the zzso component also predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but with less zzso In contrast, the optimal model using variables from the zzso component alone predicted zzso with a similar accuracy to the optimal combined model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

A comprehensive zzso examination accurately predicts zzso following zzso zzso is superior to zzso zzso in this zzso These data suggest that zzso not only adds incremental value to zzso in the prediction of zzso zzso but also may be zzso alone with the same zzso zzso
