Assessment of left zzso wall motion during zzso magnetic resonance zzso is well established for the identification of zzso zzso However, the integration of zzso into the process of clinical decision-making in patients with suspected zzso is not well zzso The aim of this study was to assess the value of zzso used for clinical decision-making and to zzso the prognosis following this zzso 

Medical records of 123 consecutive patients suspected of having zzso who underwent high-dose zzso were reviewed and followed for a median of zzso zzso zzso results were used for decision-making, for example in favor of zzso by the referring zzso 

Thirty-four zzso patients had zzso zzso of whom 31 zzso underwent invasive zzso 25 zzso having zzso of zzso in a vessel of zzso or zzso zzso in zzso Fifteen of these patients received zzso zzso only two events zzso zzso were observed during follow-up in this zzso zzso zzso patients had no zzso zzso 21 of them zzso had invasive zzso resulting in 0 zzso significant zzso In the remaining 68 zzso patients with negative zzso and who were not zzso an annual event rate of zzso was zzso 

zzso can be used for clinical decision-making in patients suspected of having zzso This strategy results in a high prevalence of zzso in patients referred for invasive zzso due to a positive zzso and an excellent prognosis in all patients with a negative zzso
