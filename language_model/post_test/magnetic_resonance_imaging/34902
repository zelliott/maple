We investigated the zzso evoked magnetic fields zzso in 14 normal zzso zzso of zzso air containing zzso zzso or zzso alcohol, and zzso air were administered to the subject through a zzso zzso A clear and consistent zzso zzso zzso was identified in all subjects, and a second zzso zzso was detected in seven subjects, but no consistent component was identified in response to the zzso zzso The peak zzso of the zzso and zzso components were approximately 320 and 630 zzso zzso The zzso produced by the zzso air were zzso from the zzso produced by the zzso air to obtain the zzso zzso which indicated the zzso and zzso component more zzso Their equivalent current zzso zzso were estimated in the regions around the zzso zzso zzso in both zzso zzso these areas are proposed to be involved in zzso perception in zzso
