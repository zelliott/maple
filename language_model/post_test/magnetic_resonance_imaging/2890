To determine whether the zzso zzso muscle zzso which consists of muscle fibers in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso 24) and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 10) appearances of the TIM were zzso examined in 34 patients with known zzso The severity of GO was assessed by applying a scoring system from 0 to 3 zzso normal zzso mild zzso moderate zzso and severe zzso to each of the zzso muscles and superior zzso zzso The severity of zzso enlargement of the superior zzso zzso and displacement of the zzso zzso were also zzso 

The TIM appeared as zzso of the zzso immediately behind the globe, and it was best seen on zzso magnetic resonance zzso There was enlargement of the TIM in 19 of the 34 patients, and it was bilateral in zzso Enlargement was present only in patients with moderate or severe involvement of other muscles zzso index, zzso zzso and it was significantly correlated with the muscle index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enlargement of the superior zzso vein zzso zzso zzso and anterior displacement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Severe enlargement of the TIM was seen in only five of the 34 patients, and it showed a close correlation with the muscle index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enlargement of the superior zzso vein zzso zzso zzso and anterior displacement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Enlargement of the TIM in GO can be identified on zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso It is invariably associated with moderate or severe involvement of other zzso muscles, and it zzso closely with other zzso imaging features of severe zzso
