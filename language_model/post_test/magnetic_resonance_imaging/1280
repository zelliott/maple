zzso zzso acid zzso is the first of a new class of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso contrast agents zzso zzso to be used in clinical zzso zzso possesses relaxation properties similar to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso We report our initial clinical experience in 38 patients with zzso zzso studied with MR before and after injection of zzso Diseases included primary and zzso brain zzso cerebral zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso in a dosage of zzso zzso body zzso All studies were performed on a zzso zzso T zzso As compared to zzso zzso and zzso images zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso were useful in defining the anatomy of zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso and in tumor versus zzso zzso zzso zzso did not zzso in these cases the zzso zzso sequence was found to be more zzso In zzso patients, zzso allowed us to demonstrate residual tumor or tumor zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso presumably reflecting tumor zzso In our experience, the use of zzso improves the zzso definition of cerebral zzso and in some cases increases both MR sensitivity and zzso We found zzso to be a well tolerated and effective zzso contrast zzso zzso can be considered as an alternative zzso MR contrast agent to zzso
