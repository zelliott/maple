Bone zzso derived zzso cells zzso have the advantage of promoting both zzso and zzso In this report, zzso were transplanted into the affected area of one hip using interconnected porous calcium zzso zzso in two patients, while the other hip was simultaneously treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso This case report documents the potential of zzso with zzso for bone repair at the zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso 

Two patients whose progression of zzso was stage 3 at one hip and stage 2 at the other zzso zzso zzso was performed on the collapsed zzso Bone zzso zzso were obtained from the zzso crest and were zzso with a cell zzso during the procedure of zzso zzso were seeded into the zzso and were transplanted to the zzso of zzso Bone consolidation of transition zone on the zzso zzso head was observed zzso at three or six zzso The zzso more than 22 months after surgery demonstrated shrinking of the extent of zzso and no progression of collapse was zzso 

We described two case reports of simultaneous surgical treatment for zzso of the bilateral zzso head using zzso for one hip in combination with transplantation of zzso for the other zzso Short term results of this procedure are satisfactory without progression of zzso zzso of zzso may be a beneficial treatment for bone repair in the condition of zzso
