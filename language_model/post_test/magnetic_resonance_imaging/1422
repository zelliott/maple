The effects of different pulse sequences and timing parameters on the increase in zzso relaxation rate produced by zzso iron oxide particles have been zzso zzso single zzso and zzso images recorded at zzso T were used to evaluate the reduction in signal intensity per unit concentration of iron oxide for different echo times and in different zzso For the same echo time, zzso sequences were found to be more than twice as sensitive to the effects of the agent as single zzso imaging zzso while zzso sequences were much less affected than zzso Using zzso of the relative effects on different zzso the contributions of different relaxation mechanisms have been zzso
