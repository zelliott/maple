To assess the value of zzso a zzso zzso with slow zzso diffusion and high zzso for magnetic resonance zzso imaging of acute zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso MR imaging and zzso MR imaging were performed with zzso and then with zzso zzso in eight pigs with zzso acute zzso zzso zzso signal intensity enhancement and clearance were compared with those of zzso zzso 

The zzso enhancement ratio of zzso in normal zzso was higher than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso first pass showed a blood zzso curve for zzso The blood pool enhancement ratio 40 seconds after injection was higher for zzso than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso MR imaging showed improved contrast between normal and zzso zzso after zzso administration: The ratio before contrast material administration was zzso zzso zzso that at 15 minutes was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that at 25 minutes was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is an MR imaging contrast agent characterized by low zzso a blood pool effect soon after zzso administration, and fast zzso This agent is useful for improved zzso zzso MR imaging of acute zzso zzso
