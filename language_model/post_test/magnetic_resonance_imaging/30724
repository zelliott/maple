We studied zzso T cell zzso in patients with clinically isolated syndromes zzso suggesting an initial attack of multiple zzso The percentage of blood zzso zzso T cells was increased in these patients, and correlated with magnetic resonance imaging disease activity and clinical disease zzso In contrast, the percentage of zzso zzso T cells in zzso fluid correlated zzso with the zzso fluid concentration of zzso basic protein and the presence of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that distinct systemic and zzso T cell zzso states correlate with disease activity and risk of subsequently developing zzso in zzso zzso
