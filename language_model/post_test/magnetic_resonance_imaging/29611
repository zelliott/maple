zzso disturbances in methamphetamine zzso abusers likely influence drug use, but the zzso bases for these problems are poorly zzso 

To assess regional brain function and its possible relationships with negative affect in newly zzso MA zzso 

Two groups were compared by measures of mood and cerebral zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso zzso during performance of a vigilance zzso 

Participants were recruited from the general community to a research zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso MA abusers (6 zzso were compared with 18 control subjects (8 zzso 

zzso of depressive symptoms and anxiety were measured, as were global and relative zzso metabolism in the zzso cingulate, lateral zzso and insular zzso and the amygdala, zzso and zzso 

Abusers of MA provided higher zzso of depression and anxiety than control subjects and differed significantly in relative regional zzso zzso lower in the anterior zzso and zzso and higher in the lateral zzso area, middle and zzso cingulate, amygdala, zzso zzso and zzso In MA zzso self-reports of depressive symptoms zzso positively with relative zzso metabolism in zzso regions zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso and ratings of state and trait anxiety zzso zzso with relative activity in the anterior zzso zzso and left zzso zzso anxiety also zzso zzso with relative activity in the zzso zzso and positively with zzso zzso 

Abusers of MA have abnormalities in brain regions implicated in mood zzso zzso between relative zzso metabolism in zzso and zzso regions and self-reports of depression and anxiety in MA abusers suggest that these regions are involved in affective zzso and may be an important target of intervention for MA zzso
