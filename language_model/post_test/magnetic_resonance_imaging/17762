The corpus zzso zzso is commonly affected in multiple sclerosis zzso however, sensitive behavioral measures of zzso zzso pathology are zzso The zzso is considered a key structure in the mediation of a type of zzso movement known as motor zzso In this study, we sought to characterize the impact of zzso damage on motor overflow in zzso Twenty zzso participants and 20 controls performed a unilateral force production zzso Motor overflow zzso zzso in the zzso hand was measured while the active hand performed the zzso zzso volume and zzso load were calculated for zzso participants using zzso zzso We found no group differences in motor zzso however, motor overflow correlated significantly with zzso disease severity zzso disability status scale zzso zzso damage zzso and decreased zzso did not correlate with motor zzso This study suggests that zzso damage may not directly lead to changes in the regulation of motor zzso Rather, findings support the notion that a wider network of structures may mediate the production and suppression of motor zzso
