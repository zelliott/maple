zzso stem cells zzso transplantation provides a new approach for zzso zzso However, many important fundamental questions about zzso transplantation remain zzso There is an urgent need to identify zzso from the beating heart and analyze the efficacy of this new zzso This study aimed to zzso the zzso labeled zzso zzso and monitor the zzso effects of zzso with magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

Acute zzso zzso zzso was created in zzso by a balloon zzso of the left anterior descending coronary zzso zzso were delivered via zzso infusion after zzso zzso zzso size change and cardiac function were assessed with zzso MR zzso The results were then confirmed by zzso and western zzso zzso All statistical procedures were performed with zzso zzso version zzso 

A total of 26 zzso were divided into four groups zzso group, zzso zzso group with PBS zzso zzso labeled zzso group, zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or PBS were delivered by zzso injection after zzso and serial cardiac MR imaging studies were performed at 0, 4 and 8 weeks after zzso MR imaging demonstrated zzso size decreased after zzso transplantation in labeled and zzso groups, however, increases were seen in the zzso group at 8 weeks after zzso The left zzso ejection fraction zzso was slightly increased in the zzso group zzso vs zzso zzso but significantly improved in the zzso group zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso group zzso vs zzso zzso at 8 weeks after zzso zzso were further confirmed by zzso blue and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that there was an increased expression of zzso markers such as zzso heavy chain and zzso T in the zzso treatment groups and the ratio of zzso zzso 2 to tissue inhibitor of zzso 1 decreased in the labeled group and zzso group compared with the zzso group and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can zzso new zzso and prevent zzso in an zzso model at zzso follow-up and represent a preferred method to better understand the mechanisms of stem cell therapy in future clinical zzso
