White matter zzso zzso detected by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging zzso are zzso a consequence of cerebral zzso or zzso We investigated the zzso severity and zzso of zzso in a zzso sample of zzso African-American and zzso men and women aged zzso years, during the second follow-up examination of the zzso zzso in Communities zzso The spin density images from zzso zzso scans were used to define zzso using a zzso scale with 0 for normal and 9 for most severe zzso Age was positively associated with the prevalence zzso and severity of zzso African-Americans had lower overall prevalence of zzso but a higher prevalence of relatively more severe zzso than zzso After adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, zzso were significantly associated with smoking, lower education, hypertension, zzso blood pressure, and pulse pressure, and zzso associated with zzso blood zzso The associations of smoking, alcohol zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, pulse, pressure, and hypertension were stronger in African-Americans than in zzso zzso zzso zzso for interactions by zzso This zzso zzso study documents significant relationships between several cardiovascular disease risk factors and zzso The findings suggest that such factors play a role in the zzso of zzso an elements linked to zzso and/or fluid zzso which presumably lead to zzso African-Americans exhibited both a higher proportion of normal white matter and a higher proportion of relatively more severe zzso than zzso
