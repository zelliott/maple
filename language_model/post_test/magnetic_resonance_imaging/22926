The aim of this study was to use magnetic resonance zzso techniques to zzso compare the effects of the three leading vascular zzso agents, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso A zzso mouse zzso zzso grown in the right rear foot of female zzso mice was used and treatments performed when zzso had reached 200 zzso in zzso Drugs were prepared fresh before each experiment and zzso injected into restrained zzso zzso zzso response was evaluated using zzso zzso and zzso and zzso weighted imaging with a zzso horizontal bore zzso before and up to 24 hours after zzso All three drugs significantly decreased zzso status and zzso and did so in a time and dose dependent fashion, but there were zzso the decrease by zzso occurred more rapidly than for zzso or zzso while zzso had a narrow window of activity compared to zzso and zzso Changes in zzso weighted images for all three agents suggested a dose dependent increase in zzso zzso within three hours after treatment, consistent with an increase in vessel zzso Using zzso weighted images there was some evidence of zzso necrosis by zzso but such necrosis was limited following treatment with zzso or zzso
