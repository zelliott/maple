We report on the in zzso assessment of zzso zzso in adoptive transfer experimental zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso disorder of the peripheral nervous system zzso Lewis rats received systemic injections of zzso iron oxide zzso particles at days 2, 3, 4, 5, or 9 after adoptive transfer of zzso zzso and were scanned by standard zzso T magnetic resonance imaging zzso always 24 h zzso zzso revealed focal signal loss of the zzso zzso indicating iron zzso in spinal nerves already at the zzso stage zzso zzso Signal loss peaked at day 4, when first clinical signs zzso At the maximum of clinical disease, signal loss already declined and disappeared on days 6 and zzso In spinal nerve zzso zzso iron stain showed focal cellular zzso of zzso at days 3, 4, and 5 in zzso zzso Spinal nerves at days 6 and 10 exhibited massive zzso zzso but no more iron zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso provides a novel in zzso tool to assess the timing of zzso entry into target zzso during an zzso attack and holds promise to monitor zzso zzso
