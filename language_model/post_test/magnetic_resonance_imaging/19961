zzso precursor cell zzso transplantation is a promising strategy for treatment of zzso injuries and neurodegenerative disorders because of potential for cell zzso An important element of future clinical applications is development of a zzso procedure to follow zzso zzso We show that zzso precursors zzso and zzso precursors zzso zzso with lineage restrictions for zzso and zzso respectively, can be labeled in zzso with the zzso iron oxide contrast agent zzso Following zzso into intact adult spinal cord, labeled cells robustly survived in white and gray matter and migrated selectively along white matter tracts up to 5 zzso zzso of cells was reliably established using ex zzso magnetic resonance imaging of spinal zzso Imaging coincided with zzso detection of iron and the human alkaline zzso zzso in most zzso sites, including the stream of zzso zzso Following zzso zzso labeled cells exhibited mature zzso and differentiated into zzso zzso and zzso similar to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso cells, but not zzso cells, induced influx of zzso zzso Small numbers of these zzso cells took up iron from grafted cells, while the majority of zzso label was found in transplanted zzso We conclude that zzso labeling does not inhibit zzso differentiation and can be used to reliably zzso zzso by zzso following zzso into adult zzso with the possible exception of areas of rapidly zzso zzso The present results are relevant for zzso clinical application of transplantation strategies in treatment of spinal zzso injury and other zzso zzso
