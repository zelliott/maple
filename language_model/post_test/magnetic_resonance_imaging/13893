Signal abnormalities within the zzso in zzso have been related to tissue zzso in the zzso zzso of multiple system zzso zzso While previous work demonstrated the high specificity of these MR findings, sensitivity rates were zzso We evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of an acquisition protocol using thin section zzso to differentiate zzso from Parkinson disease zzso 

zzso zzso conventional zzso and zzso density spin echo images at the level of zzso zzso were acquired at zzso T in 24 patients with zzso and 27 patients with zzso 

We found an abnormal zzso zzso zzso in 21 of 24 zzso patients zzso zzso and a zzso density zzso in 20 of 24 zzso patients zzso zzso Three among 27 zzso patients had an abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and there were no zzso density abnormalities zzso zzso 

Our thin section conventional spin echo protocol showed a substantial increase in MR sensitivity compared with previous zzso We believe that a better depiction of even mild signs of zzso in the zzso may allow a more widespread use of this technique in the differential diagnosis of zzso
