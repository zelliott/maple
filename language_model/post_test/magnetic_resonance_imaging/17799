zzso of the seizure focus leads to sustained zzso in intractable focal zzso in up to zzso of selected zzso However, surgery fails to help in a considerable proportion of zzso zzso and zzso may be considered in a selected group of patients with an zzso zzso zzso Here, we reviewed 15 case series on zzso after failed zzso zzso surgery in adults in order to identify factors associated with a good chance of zzso from a second zzso 

Literature review of case series describing the outcome of zzso surgical zzso 

Overall, zzso of all patients who had zzso zzso surgery underwent a second zzso A total of 402 zzso patients were zzso zzso was performed in average between 2 and zzso years after the first zzso zzso of all patients were zzso with a minimal follow-up of 6 months to 4 years after the second zzso zzso complications were observed in zzso and mainly consisted of visual field defects and, less zzso of zzso The causes of failed first zzso surgery were zzso and included incorrect zzso or incomplete zzso of the seizure focus, presence of additional seizure zzso or progression of the underlying zzso Some features appear to indicate successful zzso such as zzso of zzso imaging and zzso findings as well as absence of brain trauma and cerebral infection prior to zzso zzso 

zzso after thorough assessment of all available clinical, imaging and zzso findings can be an zzso and reasonably safe treatment option which can achieve sustained seizure control after failed zzso zzso zzso
