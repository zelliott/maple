The inherent limitations of zzso coronary zzso have led to the development for both zzso and minimally invasive techniques for imaging the coronary arteries to assist in the diagnosis and management of patients with zzso heart zzso zzso advances in zzso zzso electron beam zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging now permit imaging of the zzso to zzso zzso Moreover, results of initial studies demonstrate the promise of these methods to detect coronary artery zzso In addition, each of these methods provides zzso or zzso data about the zzso that are not zzso through zzso zzso zzso of coronary zzso via electron beam zzso zzso has shown promise as a surrogate marker of coronary zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging appear useful in evaluating the zzso significance of zzso zzso coronary artery zzso via assessment of coronary blood zzso However, it should be noted that significant improvements in technology or acquisition parameters must occur before these techniques can be used on a routine clinical basis for coronary artery zzso The relative merits and ultimate clinical potential of each of these techniques are discussed in this zzso
