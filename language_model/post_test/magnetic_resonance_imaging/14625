We propose a new approach to stabilizing the inverse zzso transform of a zzso zzso zzso a classically zzso problem, in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The method is based on extension to a second, indirectly zzso dimension, that is, use of the established framework of two-dimensional zzso followed by projection onto the desired zzso zzso results for signals comprised of discrete zzso and zzso relaxation components and experiments performed on zzso gel zzso are zzso We find markedly improved zzso and stability with respect to noise, as well as zzso to zzso in zzso underlying relaxation components through use of the two-dimensional as compared to the one-dimensional inverse zzso zzso This improvement is demonstrated separately for two different inversion zzso zzso least squares and zzso least squares, to indicate the zzso of this zzso These results may have wide zzso in approaches to the zzso integral equation of the first zzso
