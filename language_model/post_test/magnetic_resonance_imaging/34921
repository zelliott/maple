Working memory is responsible for the short-term storage and online manipulation of information necessary for higher cognitive functions, such as language, planning and zzso Traditionally, working memory has been divided into two types of zzso executive control zzso the zzso manipulation and retrieval of information in working zzso and active maintenance zzso information available zzso It has also been proposed that these two types of processes may be zzso by distinct cortical structures, with the prefrontal zzso housing the executive control zzso and more zzso regions housing the zzso buffers (for example verbal versus zzso responsible for active zzso However, studies in zzso primates suggest that zzso regions of the prefrontal zzso may also be involved in active zzso We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain zzso in human subjects during performance of a working memory zzso We used the zzso resolution of this technique to examine the dynamics of regional zzso and to show that prefrontal zzso along with zzso zzso appears to play a role in active zzso
