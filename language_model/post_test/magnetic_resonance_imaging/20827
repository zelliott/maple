zzso studies in nonhuman species indicated that zzso in the superior zzso zzso are involved in the control of upper limb zzso These findings suggested that the SC represents a crucial hub in a general zzso network, including zzso as much as zzso zzso In contrast to the SC in the various animal models, the human SC is largely unknown zzso In particular, it is unknown whether findings of zzso activity in the nonhuman SC can be zzso to zzso Using zzso we found signal increases at zzso and deep locations at the SC during the execution of arm zzso In contrast, signals related to zzso execution were confined to the superficial and intermediate zzso Although targets for reaching were presented in the left and right zzso under central zzso we found a zzso of zzso signals with respect to the active zzso In contrast, zzso activity was zzso in agreement with the bilateral target presentation and the resulting directions of zzso Our results suggest that the human SC not only contributes to the coordination of eye movements and spatial shifts of attentions but also to the zzso control of arm zzso
