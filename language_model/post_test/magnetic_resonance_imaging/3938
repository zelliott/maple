zzso of the 11th nerve disclosed by zzso bleeding is a very rare zzso Clinical diagnosis is almost impossible, but previous episodes of muscle zzso and mild signs of zzso zzso with a zzso in the zzso magna should suggest magnetic resonance imaging as well as zzso 

We present a case of an 11th nerve zzso disclosed by zzso zzso Previous episodes of muscle zzso and neck pain treated with zzso zzso drugs had been zzso preventing the zzso from being diagnosed at that zzso The zzso zzso scan showed an zzso zzso spreading into the zzso zzso The zzso appeared zzso on the magnetic resonance image, and a tumor mass growing into the zzso magna against the brain stem was also zzso 

The tumor was totally removed by a zzso zzso and C1 zzso It originated from the spinal root of the 11th zzso from which it was able to be dissected without damage to the zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an 11th nerve zzso disclosed by a zzso zzso Furthermore, this is the seventh documented case of an 11th nerve zzso developing in the zzso zzso We emphasize the importance of a high index of suspicion for the rare instances of zzso density limited to the zzso zzso especially if associated with recurring episodes of localized neck pain and muscle zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso
