zzso zzso therapy is still not used in daily clinical zzso A reason for this might be the modest effect on relevant global clinical zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso in zzso zzso To introduce proper improvement strategies, it is important to extend the focus from clinical zzso to more detailed local measures of cardiac zzso In this review, we discuss the measurement principles of all invasive and zzso techniques that are used to assess the local effects of cardiac zzso therapy in order to improve feedback to researchers zzso the dominant pathways that lead to effective cardiac zzso Generally adopted mechanisms of cardiac zzso therapy are: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Since direct in zzso measures of these mechanisms do not exist, we discuss the measurement techniques of local zzso resistance, zzso zzso zzso fibrosis, and deformation zzso The ability of these techniques to reflect the mechanism of cardiac zzso therapy, and the results of applications in stem cell studies are discussed, and critically commented zzso Special attention is given to applications of deformation imaging, since this has recently been suggested and used as a potential new technique to assess local changes of cardiac zzso which requires special knowledge about cardiac zzso We conclude that besides the clinically relevant zzso zzso detailed measures of local cardiac function provide information about the local changes induced by cardiac zzso zzso In particular, combination of deformation imaging, by ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, with simultaneously measured local geometry and pressure zzso is a promising approach to assess the effects of cardiac zzso therapy on local cardiac zzso This approach provides information about local tissue zzso zzso and thereby zzso We recommend that researchers use this comprehensive approach in future zzso
