We investigated whether zzso zzso zzso controls zzso switching when the tasks involve neither spatial nor visual zzso zzso volunteers were scanned using functional zzso zzso In all conditions, subjects were required to covertly produce words in verbal zzso zzso They did so at a rate of one every 2 s (with eyes zzso in response to an auditory zzso In the zzso zzso trials, subjects responded with a series of items from a zzso semantic category zzso zzso fruits or zzso and from zzso sequences zzso zzso of the week, months of the year or letters of the zzso zzso as to which category items should be drawn from on a given run of trials were presented over zzso earphones prior to each zzso In the switching zzso trials, subjects produced a series of word zzso from three zzso for example, zzso cars and furniture zzso zzso Mercedes, zzso and from three zzso days of the week, months of the year and letters of the alphabet zzso Monday, January, zzso This design is zzso with the factors verbal class zzso or zzso and switching conditions zzso or zzso zzso in neural activity zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple zzso were observed only in superior zzso zzso zzso zzso as a main effect of the S conditions compared with the zzso zzso When SC zzso was compared with zzso zzso significant zzso were found in anterior zzso zzso zzso the left inferior frontal zzso the middle frontal zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that superior zzso zzso zzso is a zzso area implicated in task zzso even when no visual or spatial component is implicated in the zzso Task zzso frequently used to examine zzso executive functions, may also be clinically relevant to the assessment of patients with superior zzso zzso zzso
