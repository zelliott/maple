While neural signatures of zzso of expectancy and their immediate effects have been investigated, thus far, temporally more remote effects have been zzso The present zzso study explored neural zzso of temporally remote zzso of prediction following rare zzso of expectancy with a mean delay of 14 zzso We hypothesized temporally remote zzso to be reflected either in an zzso of areas related to long-term memory or in an increase of lateral zzso zzso related to the zzso of new zzso Monitoring a deterministic zzso zzso subjects were asked to indicate occasional sequential zzso by key zzso zzso remote zzso of prediction was expected to be revealed by contrasting sequential events whose equivalent was omitted in the preceding sequential run zzso zzso zzso with sequential events without such history zzso zzso zzso remote zzso of prediction was reflected in an zzso of activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Area zzso 9) zzso Moreover, zzso of the left zzso BA 9 was enhanced by contrasting zzso events with zzso The decrease of zzso zzso zzso in the case of zzso events might be interpreted as a zzso zzso on perception causing a less zzso zzso of the current stimulus and hence enabling the adaptation of expectation and prediction in the long zzso
