This study examined the functionality of the zzso zzso lobe zzso and zzso zzso zzso in mild cognitive impairment zzso type zzso a syndrome that puts patients at greater risk for developing zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify regions normally active during zzso of novel items and recognition of previously learned items in a reference group of 77 healthy young and middle-aged zzso The pattern of zzso in this group guided further comparisons between 14 zzso subjects and 14 zzso zzso The zzso patients exhibited less activity in the PC during recognition of previously learned items, and in the right zzso during zzso of novel items, despite comparable task performance to the zzso zzso zzso signal change in the zzso supports prior studies implicating the zzso for zzso new zzso zzso signal change in the PC zzso with recent research on its role in recognition in normal adults as well as zzso decline in people with genetic or cognitive risk for zzso Our results suggest that a change in function in the PC may account, in part, for memory recollection failure in zzso
