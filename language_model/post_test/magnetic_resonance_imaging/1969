The value of zzso in the diagnosis of acute zzso floor fractures has not been clearly zzso We therefore compared MR findings with CT findings in patients with zzso zzso In 30 patients with isolated zzso trauma both zzso CT and zzso zzso were used to examine the orbits and the adjacent zzso zzso zzso of anatomical landmarks, the kind and extent of traumatic zzso as well as artifacts were zzso The scores were compared using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement between the two methods was calculated using a zzso zzso All examinations had diagnostic zzso 30 fractures of the zzso floor (9 right and 21 left zzso floor zzso were zzso In addition, CT showed fractures of the zzso zzso wall in 19 patients zzso of the lateral wall in 10 patients zzso of the zzso arch in 2 patients zzso and of the zzso zzso in 4 patients zzso Soft tissue zzso was shown in 13 patients zzso zzso muscle twice, zzso fat in 11 zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated soft tissue zzso in 21 zzso muscle in 4, zzso fat in 17 zzso zzso resonance imaging is able to demonstrate zzso floor fractures as sensitively as CT, but CT is superior to zzso in showing small and associated zzso therefore, CT remains in zzso fractures the imaging zzso of zzso zzso resonance imaging is superior to CT in showing soft tissue zzso therefore, zzso may have a role as an adjunct to CT if soft tissue zzso remains zzso
