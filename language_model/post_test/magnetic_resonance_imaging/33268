We used functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate changes in zzso brain connectivity in 11 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease zzso following eight weeks of treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso We examined functional connectivity between four zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These regions were selected to represent sites of zzso zzso sites of zzso brain zzso change in prior studies, and sites that are minimally affected by the zzso changes of zzso Based on previous findings of selective, localized frontal responses to zzso we predicted that frontal connectivity would be most strongly impacted by zzso Of the areas zzso we found that treatment had a significant effect only on functional connectivity between right and left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso for understanding the impact of zzso treatment on brain functioning and behavior in patients with zzso are zzso This preliminary report suggests that zzso may provide a useful index of treatment outcome in diseases affecting brain zzso Future research should investigate these zzso changes in larger samples of patients and zzso zzso
