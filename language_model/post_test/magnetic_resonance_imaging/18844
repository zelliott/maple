zzso resonance imaging zzso is widely used for the diagnosis of zzso anomalies of the zzso Its reliability is controversial mainly in the pediatric population, and its results may vary from one center to the zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the zzso of zzso in detecting zzso abnormalities in patients who sustained an injury of their knee, by comparing its findings to those of zzso 

Two hundred and zzso traumatic knees underwent zzso followed by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were statistically zzso 

zzso of zzso was zzso and zzso for anterior and zzso cruciate ligament zzso respectively, zzso and zzso for zzso and lateral zzso tears respectively, and zzso for injury of the zzso zzso There was not a significant difference between the pediatric and the adult zzso except for a greater sensitivity to detect lateral zzso tears and a better specificity and accuracy to identify zzso zzso in the first zzso zzso between centers was significant for the diagnosis of zzso zzso 

The good zzso reliability in detecting zzso abnormalities as demonstrated in this report, zzso its importance in the assessment of the injured knee before zzso
