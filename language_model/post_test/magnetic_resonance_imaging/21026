zzso sensitivity of incentive zzso to zzso rewards has been suggested as either a risk factor for or consequence of drug zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested whether zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 29) showed altered recruitment of zzso zzso zzso incentive zzso compared to controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cues to respond for monetary zzso zzso zzso anticipation of zzso or zzso delivery of zzso Using an instrumental task with zzso presentation of zzso information, subjects saw cues signaling opportunities to win zzso $1, or $10 for responding to a zzso Following this response, subjects were notified whether their success would be indicated by a zzso notification zzso or by delivery of a monetary reward zzso After a variable zzso subjects then viewed the trial zzso We found no significant group differences in zzso zzso by task zzso or in signal change extracted from zzso Both zzso and controls showed significant VS and other zzso recruitment by zzso reward zzso In addition, controls also showed VS recruitment by zzso zzso and zzso had appreciable zzso VS zzso Both groups also showed similar zzso responses to reward zzso Across all subjects, a questionnaire measure of zzso zzso correlated with VS recruitment by zzso anticipation of low rewards and with VS recruitment by delivery of low zzso These findings indicate that zzso processing of zzso rewards is substantially maintained in recovering zzso and that zzso VS recruitment zzso more with individual differences in trait zzso irrespective of zzso
