A fast and robust methodology for in zzso zzso mapping is zzso The approach is based on the partially zzso steady state free zzso technique recently proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of this method was demonstrated in simulations and phantom zzso Variations in skeletal muscle zzso relaxation time have been correlated with cell damage and inflammatory zzso Nonetheless, the lack of easily zzso fast, accurate and zzso methods has hampered the adoption of zzso measurement as a zzso tool for skeletal muscle zzso The zzso of the partially zzso steady state free zzso method for tissue characterization in muscle disease is illustrated in this work by several zzso zzso zzso in particular zzso mapping based on partially zzso steady state free zzso acquisitions, might provide objective markers of muscle damage and degenerative changes, and an alternative to serial muscle zzso
