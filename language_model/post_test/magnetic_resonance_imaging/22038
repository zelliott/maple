The purpose of this study was to determine whether women with zzso severe schizophrenia manifest a widespread deficit in cortical gray matter and zzso enlargement similar to that seen in men with schizophrenia and whether this deficit is related to age at onset of illness, length of illness, or current illness zzso 

zzso measures of head size, cortical gray matter, white matter and zzso and lateral and third zzso were obtained from magnetic resonance images of chronic zzso schizophrenic women (N zzso zzso and men (N zzso zzso and healthy comparison women (N zzso zzso and men (N zzso zzso Sex and group differences were assessed by using a zzso analysis of zzso of brain zzso Age was entered as a zzso in assessments of associations between brain measures and age at onset and length of zzso 

The schizophrenic patients as a group had less cortical gray matter but comparable white matter and significantly more lateral and third zzso zzso than the comparison zzso Compared to the combined groups of men, women, regardless of diagnosis, had smaller heads, less cortical gray and white matter, and less zzso zzso and third zzso zzso There were no zzso zzso suggesting that in schizophrenia these aspects of gross zzso zzso in male and female brains are affected zzso There was no relationship between cortical gray matter deficit or zzso zzso and age at symptom onset or length of illness in either men or women with zzso when zzso due to age was accounted for zzso 

The process that contributes to cortical gray matter deficit in schizophrenia appears to affect men and women to a similar zzso
