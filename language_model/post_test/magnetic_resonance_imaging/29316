To determine whether neurological deficits are associated with structural anomalies of the brain in very low zzso zzso infants with subsequent learning disorders but without cerebral zzso or whether other factors, such as poor early growth, are zzso 

Eighty seven zzso infants and eight term controls who had been examined at school between the ages of 12 and 13 years, had zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans at 15-17 years of zzso 

Thirty seven zzso of the zzso children had abnormalities reported on their scans zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso and 15 thinning of the corpus zzso No significant differences in intelligence quotient, motor zzso or frequency of attention deficit zzso zzso disorder were observed between those children with zzso zzso and those with normal zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso infants had smaller zzso and a relatively smaller corpus zzso compared with zzso No association between brain zzso and school performance was observed among the zzso zzso 

The difficulties experienced by zzso children at school are unlikely to be the result of zzso brain injury, but they might to be attributable to the effects of poor zzso zzso
