We zzso that a smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso space may be a risk factor for zzso zzso zzso 

We conducted a zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso study in patients with zzso and determined the clinical zzso factors of zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with clinically diagnosed zzso and controls matched for age, sex, race, and hypertension underwent zzso resonance zzso zzso The zzso zzso space was segmented and zzso on a heavily zzso high-resolution zzso MR volume zzso centered over the zzso zzso 

zzso study subjects (41 patients and 41 zzso were zzso The mean zzso zzso volume in patients with zzso and controls was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean volume in patients with zzso was zzso smaller than in controls zzso zzso zzso Analysis of differences between individually matched pairs and controls also revealed that zzso zzso for controls was larger than that for patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso linear zzso analysis revealed that a small zzso zzso volume was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso and female gender zzso zzso zzso but not hypertension zzso zzso zzso were also found to be zzso of a low zzso zzso zzso 

Our results showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso volume was lower in patients with zzso compared with matched zzso zzso female zzso and younger age were associated with smaller zzso zzso zzso These observations could explain the strong female preponderance in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso
