The aim of this study was to zzso the relation between zzso zzso at term and zzso outcome at 2 years corrected age in infants of very low zzso zzso or very low zzso age zzso 

A total of 225 zzso or zzso infants zzso zzso 104 zzso mean zzso 1133 zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso age 29 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso born in zzso University Hospital were zzso zzso ratio and the zzso of each lateral zzso horn were determined using zzso and the volume of the zzso was measured by magnetic resonance imaging at zzso The zzso outcome measures included scores for the zzso zzso Neurological zzso the presence of cerebral zzso zzso the Mental zzso Index zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso Development zzso zzso and the presence of severe hearing or vision zzso or any zzso impairment zzso 

zzso was diagnosed in 15 participants zzso and severe hearing deficit in 12 participants zzso No severe vision impairment was zzso zzso and severe cognitive delay was found in 24 zzso and 8 zzso of the zzso or zzso infants zzso zzso zzso zzso did not increase the risk for zzso zzso However, zzso zzso with additional brain pathology was significantly associated with zzso zzso score below 70, and zzso A zzso ratio above zzso was a sensitive measure of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso at term increases the risk of poor zzso outcome only when associated with other brain zzso The zzso ratio is a useful clinical tool for determining the prognosis in zzso and zzso zzso
