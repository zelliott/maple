In zzso zzso zzso it is important to distinguish acute inflammation at an early stage, responsive to zzso treatment, from inactive zzso end stage disease, unresponsive to the same zzso The purpose of this study was to identify the most relevant signal zzso on zzso MR imaging with contrast administration both to zzso patients according to their clinical activity score zzso by a zzso value of 3) and to make a prediction of patient's zzso Such threshold was considered as widely used in zzso Sixteen consecutive patients with a diagnosis of GO in different zzso of zzso disease based on clinical and zzso MR imaging signs, and six normal volunteers were zzso zzso MR imaging was performed on a zzso zzso MR zzso MR scans were assessed by an experienced zzso blinded to the clinical zzso We found a statistical correlation between zzso and both STIR and contrast enhanced zzso zzso There was also a statistically significant correlation between STIR and zzso zzso images disclosing the possibility of avoiding the injection of contrast zzso Our study proved that signal intensity values on STIR sequence increase in the inflammatory zzso phase of zzso We confirmed the correlation between signal zzso on this sequence and zzso showing an increase in signal intensity zzso to the zzso zzso So we validated zzso use to establish the activity phase of disease more sensitively than zzso zzso
