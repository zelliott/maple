We present a new approach to the electromagnetic inverse problem that explicitly addresses the ambiguity associated with its zzso zzso Rather than calculating a single zzso solution according to some zzso our approach produces a large number of likely solutions that both fit the data and any prior information that is zzso Whereas the range of the different likely results is representative of the ambiguity in the inverse problem even with prior information present, features that are common across a large number of the different solutions can be identified and are associated with a high degree of zzso This approach is implemented and zzso within the zzso of zzso zzso which combines prior information with that of measurement in a common framework using a single zzso To demonstrate this approach, a general neural zzso model is constructed that includes a variable number of extended regions of zzso and can incorporate a great deal of prior information on neural current such as information on location, orientation, strength, and spatial zzso Taken together, this zzso model and the zzso zzso approach yield estimates of the probability zzso for the number, location, and extent of active zzso Both simulated zzso data and data from a visual evoked response experiment are used to demonstrate the capabilities of this zzso
