Thin zzso gaps and large imaging volumes are zzso to MR signal and contrast, especially when the body zzso is zzso To show the influence of these two factors on fat and water signal and contrast, we performed a series of in zzso zzso A cylinder filled with water and another filled with oil were zzso zzso zzso zzso 2000 zzso TE zzso 20 and 70 zzso with different zzso gaps zzso slice zzso A series of images was obtained to cover a zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso gap thickness increased water signal without affecting fat zzso resulting in a decrease in zzso contrast on TE zzso 20 zzso (less zzso and increasing contrast on TE zzso 70 zzso (more zzso zzso nearly doubled when the zzso gap was increased from zzso to zzso As slices moved away from the central zzso fat and water signals decreased slowly to zzso zzso off zzso Signal loss was significant with zzso greater than zzso zzso These results emphasize that to obtain proper contrast on zzso images, the optimal zzso gap should be used and the region of interest should be near the central zzso Otherwise, images should be interpreted with zzso
