zzso zzso zzso is a zzso complex designed for use as a zzso zzso Test procedures included zzso zzso toxicity zzso zzso and experiments for animal MR zzso The dose of zzso in acute toxicity test of zzso in mice was zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the activities were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the liver at time intervals of 10, 30 and 60 minutes after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The results of image enhancement correlated well to the zzso Analysis of the MR images showed degrees of zzso zzso % increase of signal to noise ratio zzso was zzso zzso zzso for normal liver at 30 minutes zzso which exceeded the value of zzso liver with zzso duct obstruction 16 hours zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 week zzso zzso zzso and 4 weeks zzso zzso zzso respectively, and acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement plateau was documented up to 60 minutes after injection and zzso to zzso value within 22 zzso The common duct was zzso at zzso minutes after injection of contrast zzso These results indicated that the zzso could be rapidly extracted from the blood stream by the zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso The initial evaluation of zzso demonstrated that zzso was well suited for enhancement of normal liver zzso and was compromised with deterioration of liver zzso However, the increase of the liver zzso in the animal model of the total zzso obstruction group zzso to zzso value within 22 hours, which indicated that zzso clearance as an effective alternative zzso for zzso zzso In conclusion, these results indicate that zzso has the potential of becoming a safe and reliable zzso for the zzso zzso
