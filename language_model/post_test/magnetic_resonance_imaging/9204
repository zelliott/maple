Bone has the ability to adapt its shape and size in response to mechanical loads via a process known as zzso in which bones are shaped or reshaped by the independent action of zzso and zzso zzso is a process that maintains mechanical integrity of the zzso allowing it to selectively repair and replace damaged zzso During adulthood, bone zzso is the dominant process; after the age of 40 years, the age-related decline in bone mass increases the risk of zzso especially in zzso zzso is defined as a reduction in bone mass and an impairment of bone architecture resulting in thinning and increased cortical zzso bone fragility and fracture zzso As new products and methods have been developed, focusing on bone zzso effective and sensitive zzso means able to detect early changes in bone fragility process have also been zzso Due to limitations in assessing fracture risk and response to therapy, the evaluation of bone mineral contents by bone zzso is progressively replaced by new zzso and/or zzso techniques able to estimate bone strength, providing structural information about the zzso of bone fragility by quantitative assessments of zzso and zzso bone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bone zzso whereas high-resolution CT, zzso high-resolution MR and zzso assess bone zzso zzso of bone zzso is a clue for understanding osteoporosis zzso and improving its diagnosis and zzso the response of zzso parameters to treatment should allow assessment of the real efficacy of the osteoporosis zzso
