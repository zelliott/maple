The magnetic fields of zzso systems modify the path of contaminant electrons in zzso beams, which alters patient skin zzso To accurately zzso the magnitude of changes in skin dose, the authors use zzso Carlo calculations that incorporate realistic zzso magnetic field models of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso element method zzso is used to generate complete zzso magnetic field maps for zzso T zzso and zzso zzso magnet zzso as well as for representative zzso and zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations implementing these zzso magnetic fields are zzso The geometry for the zzso simulations incorporates the zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso magnet zzso the zzso and the magnetic shields of the zzso zzso zzso files are used to calculate the central axis percent zzso in a water phantom and zzso skin dose zzso for 70 zzso entrance and exit layers using zzso For comparison, skin doses are also calculated in the absence of magnetic field, and using a zzso magnetic field with an zzso large fringe zzso The effects of zzso field size, air gap zzso zzso and angle of zzso zzso zzso are also zzso 

zzso modeling of the zzso magnetic fields shows that fringe fields zzso rapidly and have a very small magnitude at the zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso systems mostly zzso contaminant electrons that are generated in the air gap and have an insignificant effect on electrons produced further zzso The increase in the skin dose for the zzso zzso compared to the zero zzso case varies from zzso to zzso for air gaps of zzso zzso zzso (All dose changes are reported as a % of zzso The increase is also zzso dependent, ranging from zzso at zzso zzso to zzso at zzso zzso The small changes in skin dose are in contrast to significant increases that are calculated for the unrealistic zzso magnetic zzso For the zzso zzso the entrance skin dose is equal or smaller than that of the zero zzso case for perpendicular zzso For a zzso zzso zzso beam the zzso magnetic field decreases the entry skin dose for zzso angles less than zzso and increases it by no more than zzso for larger angles up to zzso The exit skin dose is increased by zzso for a zzso zzso perpendicular zzso but appreciably drops and approaches the zero zzso case for large zzso angles of zzso 

For zzso zzso systems only a small increase in the entrance skin dose is predicted, due to the rapid zzso of the realistic magnetic fringe zzso For zzso zzso systems, changes to the entrance skin dose are small for most zzso For the same zzso on the exit side a fairly large increase is observed for perpendicular beams, but significantly drops for large zzso angles of zzso The observed effects on skin dose are not expected to limit the application of zzso systems in either the zzso or zzso zzso
