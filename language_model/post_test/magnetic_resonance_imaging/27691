zzso resonance imaging provides important zzso information on deep zzso that cannot be zzso by other zzso Although we had previously developed an zzso switching zzso zzso probe to monitor reporter zzso activity on the basis of the zzso relaxation enhancement effect, it was difficult to monitor biological events in living cells because the zzso zzso probe did not zzso living cell zzso In this study, we have developed a new zzso zzso system for monitoring gene expression in living cells by exploiting zzso zzso and the specifically designed zzso zzso zzso By using this system, cellular gene expression was successfully detected by zzso zzso without cell zzso This imaging strategy shows promise for monitoring in zzso gene zzso and therefore it could lead to useful technologies for the diagnosis and therapy of various zzso
