The purpose of the study was to assess whether zzso adjacent cortical signal intensity zzso detected on zzso inversion recovery zzso can differentiate between zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso pathology in patients with multiple enhancing cerebral zzso zzso MR studies were reviewed after a database search and exclusion criteria applied, to detect areas of zzso zzso involvement without zzso zzso analysis was carried out using a 2 zzso 2 contingency table and zzso exact zzso zzso adjacent cortical zzso signal zzso was seen in eight of eight zzso and/or zzso zzso and four of 11 of the zzso zzso (10 zzso disease and 1 zzso The presence of zzso adjacent cortical zzso signal zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso for zzso The positive zzso value was zzso and negative zzso value zzso zzso exact probability test was P zzso zzso when applied to the zzso versus zzso categories, indicating a significant zzso zzso adjacent cortical zzso zzso signal appears to be more frequently seen in patients with zzso and multiple enhancing zzso compared with those with zzso and a solitary enhancing cerebral zzso The absence of this sign zzso zzso disease and the presence suggests that zzso and/or zzso zzso should remain a zzso
