To zzso zzso pancreatic regional zzso with dynamic contrast zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging by using a zzso model and to assess zzso changes during zzso stimulation in healthy zzso 

The study had institutional review board approval, and written informed consent was zzso Ten healthy volunteers (five men, five zzso mean age, zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso underwent MR imaging pancreatic zzso studies performed twice without zzso and twice during zzso zzso Dynamic zzso MR imaging consisted of zzso zzso zzso imaging with peripheral pulse triggering and respiratory zzso A dose of zzso zzso zzso per zzso of body weight was injected at a rate of zzso zzso Regional zzso parameters were fitted with a zzso zzso The analysis of zzso test for repeated zzso was used to assess differences in pancreatic zzso without and that with zzso zzso 

zzso differences in zzso parameters between the three pancreatic regions were observed zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso a significant difference was observed only between the body and the tail of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant increase zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso was observed after zzso zzso Mean pancreatic zzso was 184 zzso g of tissue zzso 71, zzso zzso g zzso 77, and 230 zzso g zzso 87 without zzso and zzso zzso g zzso zzso 338 zzso g zzso zzso and zzso zzso g zzso 176 after zzso stimulation in the head, body, and tail of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso without zzso stimulation and zzso with zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso MR imaging enables zzso zzso of regional pancreatic zzso in resting conditions and demonstrates the increase in pancreatic zzso during zzso stimulation in healthy zzso
