zzso zzso has demonstrated reduced zzso correlated with behavioral zzso effects, a finding generally interpreted in terms of facilitated retrieval of target items in the context of related zzso Without a neutral prime, however, one cannot separate zzso effects of related zzso from zzso effects of unrelated zzso Here we report an auditory semantic zzso paradigm with zzso (''The boy bounced the zzso neutral (''The next item is zzso and zzso zzso is my favorite kind of zzso sentence zzso As previously reported, reduced left inferior prefrontal zzso zzso was observed for zzso relative to zzso zzso however, the neutral condition allowed us to show that the effect arose from increased zzso in the zzso condition rather than reduced zzso for zzso zzso Our results suggest that the left inferior prefrontal zzso zzso interference from zzso representations in order to select a zzso target, and is consistent with its broader role in behavioral zzso
