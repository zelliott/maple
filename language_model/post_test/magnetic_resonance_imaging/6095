zzso review of imaging data from a clinical zzso 

To compare the interpretation of zzso spine magnetic resonance imaging zzso by clinical spine specialists and zzso in patients with zzso disc zzso 

zzso is the imaging zzso of choice for evaluation of the zzso spine in patients with suspected zzso disc zzso zzso provide zzso of terms to more consistently describe disc zzso The extent to which these guidelines are being followed in clinical practice is zzso 

We zzso data from zzso reports from patients with zzso zzso disc zzso enrolled in the zzso Patient Outcomes Research zzso We evaluated the frequency with which zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso was reported as per guidelines and when present we compared the zzso ratings to those of clinicians who completed a structured data form as part of the zzso We assessed agreement using percent agreement and the zzso zzso 

There were zzso patients with sufficient data to zzso Excellent agreement was observed between zzso and zzso on the presence and level of zzso zzso with zzso showing disagreement regarding level, of which a third could be explained by the presence of a transitional zzso In zzso of the cases in which the zzso reported a zzso zzso zzso or zzso the zzso reported no zzso on the zzso zzso reports did not clearly describe zzso in zzso of zzso In the 214 cases with clear zzso descriptions, agreement was fair zzso zzso zzso and the disagreement was zzso zzso test of symmetry P zzso zzso with clinicians more often rating more abnormal zzso zzso zzso on zzso location of the zzso was excellent zzso zzso zzso There was disagreement between left or right side in only zzso of cases zzso zzso zzso 

zzso reports frequently fail to provide sufficient detail to describe disc zzso zzso zzso between zzso readings by clinical spine specialists and zzso was excellent when comparing zzso zzso level and location within level, but only fair comparing zzso zzso
