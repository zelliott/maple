In integrated zzso systems, the zzso coils are exposed to the zzso zzso radiation, leading to a measurable radiation induced current zzso This work zzso zzso the zzso in zzso raw data and determines its effect on the MR image zzso ratio zzso zzso examines the effect of zzso dose rate on zzso zzso zzso examines the zzso effect on different zzso zzso zzso examines the effect of altering the zzso sequence timing on the zzso and zzso uses a zzso method to reduce the zzso signal from the MR raw zzso 

MR images were acquired on the zzso zzso system using various imaging sequences zzso zzso spin zzso and zzso dose rates zzso 50, 100, zzso zzso and 250 zzso and repetition times zzso with the zzso echo zzso The images were acquired with the radiation beam either directly incident or blocked from the zzso zzso The zzso was calculated for each of these scenarios, showing a loss in zzso due to zzso Finally, a zzso method was applied to the image zzso data in order to remove partially the zzso signal and recover some of the lost zzso 

The zzso produces visible spikes in the zzso data acquired with the zzso radiation incident on the zzso zzso This zzso leads to a loss in imaging zzso that increases with increasing zzso dose rate zzso loss at 250 zzso The zzso loss seen with increasing zzso dose rate appears to be largely independent of the MR sequence zzso zzso the imaging zzso had interesting visual effects on the appearance of zzso in zzso due to the timing between the zzso pulsing and the MR zzso but did not change the zzso loss for a given zzso dose zzso The use of a zzso zzso was able to remove much of the zzso noise spikes from the MR image zzso data, resulting in the recovery of a significant portion, up to zzso zzso zzso of the lost image zzso 

The presence of zzso in MR zzso coils leads to a loss of zzso which is directly related to the zzso dose zzso The zzso related loss in zzso is likely to increase for systems that are able to provide larger than 250 zzso zzso Some of this zzso loss can be recovered through the use of a zzso algorithm, which removes the zzso zzso from the image zzso
