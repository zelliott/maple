Muscle zzso is a commonly encountered problem in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to estimate the amount of muscle zzso and fatty zzso of the lower leg muscles related to ankle zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso patients with unilateral ankle zzso were included in this cohort zzso zzso circumference of the affected and healthy lower leg was zzso The degree of zzso was classified in conventional zzso The zzso areas and fatty zzso of the muscles of the lower leg were measured in bilateral zzso 

We found a significantly reduced calf circumference of the affected zzso healthy leg zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly lower zzso area of the entire lower leg zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of muscle groups revealed that only the zzso zzso had a significant zzso area decrease zzso zzso zzso All muscles showed a significant fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that unilateral ankle joint zzso leads to an overall lower leg muscle zzso but significant zzso of the zzso zzso All muscles of the affected leg undergo a fatty zzso
