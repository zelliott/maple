The design and construction of a zzso surface zzso zzso for both zzso zzso in the zzso brain at 7 T is zzso zzso zzso are required for accurately zzso zzso data sets, especially when the time courses of zzso and zzso signals are of interest as, for instance, when investigating the pathological progression of zzso stroke tissue in zzso In the current study, a zzso zzso surface zzso was developed wherein both frequency components were measured with the same detector element but with each frequency signal routed along different output zzso This was achieved by using the zzso spot technique, allowing for optimal variable tuning and matching of each channel in zzso within the zzso zzso The zzso signal to noise ratio, measured in the zzso of the rat brain, was increased by a factor of four compared to recent state-of-the-art rat brain studies reported in the zzso The zzso performance was demonstrated in an in zzso zzso stroke model, where regional variations in zzso apparent diffusion zzso maps and the zzso signal were recorded in an zzso fashion as a function of time in the acute phase of the stroke without having to exchange, zzso or zzso zzso between zzso Using the practical construction steps described in this paper, this zzso design can be easily adapted for zzso of other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso at various field zzso
