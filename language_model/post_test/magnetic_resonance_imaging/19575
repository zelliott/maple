To investigate the variation in quality of zzso spine magnetic resonance zzso images as a function of type of ownership of the imaging center, number of studies performed per month, specialty training of the image interpreter, and field strength of the MR zzso 

Data were collected from all imaging facilities in western Washington state that received reimbursement from the Washington State Health Care zzso Three readers with expertise in spine imaging, who were blinded to center and patient identification information, rated the technical image quality of each zzso All MR images of the zzso spine zzso of zzso paid for by the health care authority were zzso If a center had performed more than six studies, then six were randomly selected for zzso 

Variation in quality scores among sites was significant zzso zzso Field strength was the strongest predictor of better zzso Poorer quality was associated with for-profit ownership, a larger number of zzso at the site reading MR images, and a larger percentage of studies checked by a zzso prior to the end of the zzso 

There was significant variation in the quality of MR images of the zzso spine, and at least a portion of this variation was attributable to characteristics of the imaging zzso
