In this paper we introduce the idea of explaining responses, in one cortical area, in terms of an interaction between the influence of another area and some experimental zzso or zzso zzso We refer to these effects as zzso interactions and relate them to interactions based solely on experimental factors zzso psychological zzso in zzso designs, and interactions among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have framed zzso interactions in terms of functional integration by noting that the degree to which the activity in one area can be predicted, on the basis of activity in another, zzso to the contribution of the second to the first, where this contribution can be related to effective zzso A zzso interaction means that the contribution of one area to another changes significantly with the experimental or psychological zzso zzso these interactions can be thought of as a zzso change in regional responses to an experimental or psychological zzso In other words the contribution can be thought of as modulating the responses zzso by a particular stimulus or psychological zzso The potential importance of this approach lies in zzso zzso a degree of functional specificity on this aspect of effective connectivity and zzso providing a model of zzso where the contribution from a zzso area can be considered to zzso responses to the psychological or zzso factor defining the zzso Although distinct in zzso terms, these are equivalent perspectives on the same underlying zzso We illustrate these points using a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of attention to visual motion and a position zzso zzso study of visual zzso We focus on interactions among zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions during visual processing, under different zzso and zzso zzso
