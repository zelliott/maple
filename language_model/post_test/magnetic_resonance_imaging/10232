We measured the effect of global phase zzso on a rapid animal categorization zzso The zzso zzso of our images of natural scenes were manipulated by adding zzso random phase noise at all spatial zzso The phase noise was the independent zzso zzso and zzso distributed between 0 degrees and zzso degrees zzso zzso were remarkably resistant to phase zzso Even with zzso degrees phase noise subjects were still performing at zzso zzso The high resistance of the subjects' animal categorization rate to phase noise suggests that the visual system is highly robust to such random image zzso The proportion of correct answers closely followed the correlation between original and the phase zzso zzso Animal detection rate was higher when the same task was performed with contrast reduced versions of the same natural images, at contrasts where the contrast reduction zzso that resulting from our phase zzso Since the subjects' categorization rate was better in the contrast experiment, reduction of local contrast alone cannot explain the performance in the phase noise zzso This result obtained with natural images differs from those obtained for simple zzso stimuli were performance changes due to phase changes are attributed to local contrast changes zzso Thus the global zzso accompanying disruption of image structure such as edges and object boundaries at different spatial scales reduces object zzso over and above the performance deficit resulting from reducing zzso Additional color information improves the categorization performance by zzso
