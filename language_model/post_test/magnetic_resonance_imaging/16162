zzso and functional zzso of the zzso have been reported in patients with attention deficit zzso disorder zzso but the functional relationships between this area and other brain regions are seldom zzso In the present study, zzso correlation analyses were performed in the zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data to examine the differences in functional connectivity of the zzso between zzso children with zzso and normal zzso Positive functional connectivity with the zzso was seen in bilateral zzso area, prefrontal cortex, zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso regions and negative functional connectivity was located in bilateral zzso and zzso zzso as well as clusters in the zzso middle zzso zzso and zzso Group comparison showed that decreases in functional connectivity with the zzso were observed in zzso relative to the controls, except for the right zzso zzso which showed increased positive connectivity with left zzso For children with zzso areas exhibiting decreased positive functional connectivity with left zzso were seen in right frontal and zzso regions, and regions showing decreased negative connectivity with the zzso were observed in areas belonging to the default mode network (for left zzso including right zzso and right zzso zzso for right zzso including left zzso and right zzso The above results suggest that abnormal functional relationships between the zzso and the zzso circuits as well as the default mode network may zzso the pathological basis of zzso
