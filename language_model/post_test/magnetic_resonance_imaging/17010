Sleep is traditionally considered a global process involving the whole zzso However, recent studies have shown that sleep depth is not evenly distributed within the zzso Sleep disorders, such as zzso also suggest that zzso features of sleep and zzso might be simultaneously present in different cerebral zzso In order to probe the coexistence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso behaviors within the sleeping brain, we analyzed zzso zzso activity drawn from sleep recordings of five patients with zzso focal zzso without sleep zzso who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso We applied spectral and zzso transform analysis techniques to zzso data recorded from scalp and zzso zzso localized within the Motor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed frequent Local zzso zzso from 5 to more than zzso characterized by an abrupt interruption of the sleep zzso slow waves pattern and by the appearance of a zzso zzso high frequency pattern zzso and/or beta zzso Local zzso in the zzso were paralleled by a deepening of sleep in other regions, as expressed by the zzso increase of slow waves in the zzso and scalp zzso zzso These results suggest that human sleep can be characterized by the coexistence of zzso and zzso zzso patterns in different cortical areas, supporting the hypothesis that unusual phenomena, such as zzso zzso could result from an imbalance of these two zzso
