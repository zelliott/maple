Despite the zzso zzso of zzso structures, recent studies have suggested the evidence of cortical involvement in multiple system zzso zzso This study aimed to identify the different zzso pattern of cortical thinning in zzso according to clinical zzso and the association of cortical thinning with zzso zzso and other disease related zzso 

We used cortical thickness analysis in 53 zzso probable zzso patients (29 with zzso 24 with zzso and 35 healthy subjects and modeled local cortical thickness as a linear association with zzso volume and disease related metrics including age, disease zzso zzso and disease zzso 

We found five clusters zzso zzso zzso bilateral zzso prefrontal cortex, right zzso and zzso zzso exhibiting significant cortical thinning in zzso and two clusters zzso primary sensory motor and left zzso prefrontal zzso exhibiting a thinning tendency in zzso compared with the control zzso In correlation analysis, we identified no cluster exhibiting a significant correlation with zzso zzso in both of the zzso zzso However, cortical thickness in right zzso and left zzso prefrontal zzso showed significant negative correlation with International Cooperative zzso zzso zzso zzso of speech disorder in zzso zzso 

We identified different zzso zzso of cortical thinning in zzso zzso Our study suggests that cortical thinning of zzso occurs independently of zzso zzso as a primary disease process rather than secondary zzso
