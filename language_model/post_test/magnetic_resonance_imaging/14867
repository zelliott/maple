zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of soft tissue share several features: they are slowly progressive, locally aggressive tumors, tend to recur locally, and rarely or never zzso if not zzso Their treatment is wide surgical zzso zzso both are well differentiated tumors, very like their normal tissue zzso They share simple zzso with zzso ring zzso or giant marker zzso containing amplified zzso sequences including zzso and zzso zzso with subsequent zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We present the case of a zzso zzso made of closely zzso components of a zzso zzso and a zzso 

In a 34 year-old woman with a slowly growing mass of the arm, imaging revealed a large zzso zzso zzso mass of the upper zzso with two main zzso bone at the base and fat at the zzso zzso these two components were consistent respectively with low grade zzso and zzso zzso of the two components were labeled with zzso zzso No labeling with zzso zzso and no signal detected with zzso FISH analysis were likely due zzso No frozen tumor tissue was available for FISH analysis nor zzso 

zzso diagnoses of this new entity would be a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso component that originates from the soft zzso ruled out on imaging, and an zzso zzso zzso ruled out on zzso 

This is the first description of a zzso zzso zzso with two components that zzso and zzso demonstrate characteristics of a zzso zzso and of a zzso zzso
