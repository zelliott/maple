While there is evidence to suggest that major depressive disorder zzso is associated with structural brain zzso the precise nature of these abnormalities remains zzso 

To review recent structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso research findings in zzso while considering the potential influence of key clinical and demographic zzso 

A selective review of all zzso structural zzso studies published between 2000 and 2007 in adult samples of zzso zzso 

zzso reductions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso are consistently found in zzso patients, with more persistent forms of zzso zzso multiple episodes or repeated zzso longer illness zzso being associated with greater impact on regional brain zzso zzso medication, stage of illness, and family history all affect the nature of the findings in a regionally specific zzso 

Overall, differences between the samples in factors such as illness severity, medication, gender and family history of mental illness makes difficult to identify their zzso effects on the observed zzso zzso Also, the tracing protocols used for particular brain regions were different amongst the reviewed studies, making difficult to compare their zzso 

The data support the notion that zzso involves pathological zzso of zzso and cortical structures, and that they are generally more apparent in patients with more severe or persistent forms of the zzso
