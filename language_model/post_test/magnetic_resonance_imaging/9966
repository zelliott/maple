This study was performed to zzso zzso and characterize zzso zzso repair in ex zzso goat zzso using an 8 T magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanner and to compare the MR zzso with images obtained from zzso zzso gross zzso and zzso 

zzso neutered male zzso were assigned to an zzso zzso zzso 4) or zzso zzso zzso 4) study zzso Two zzso OC defects (7 zzso diameter, full cartilage thickness and zzso into zzso zzso were surgically created in the right zzso one in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the other in the zzso groove zzso The implant zzso zzso or zzso were secured in the zzso using a bottom anchored fixation device zzso The zzso left zzso served as time zero zzso At the day of zzso implants were placed at both zzso sites zzso and zzso on the normal left zzso Following zzso the ex zzso goat zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Within 24 h zzso MR scans of the zzso along the zzso plane of the OC zzso were acquired at 8 T and zzso zzso MR relaxation times, zzso and zzso were measured at the region of repair tissue zzso and adjacent native zzso Immediately after MR imaging, the zzso were zzso zzso zzso and a zzso OC block corresponding to the MR region of interest was prepared for zzso zzso 

The high-resolution MR images enabled zzso of cartilage and bone integrity surrounding the implant as well as zzso the margins of zzso zzso and the zzso On spin echo zzso the zzso zzso appeared as high, intermediate or low MR signal zzso zzso the zzso always appeared as low signal zzso In general, the MR signal intensity of zzso zzso was slightly higher compared to zzso zzso however, there was no difference in zzso zzso of zzso implanted with the zzso zzso or foam zzso zzso sclerosis appeared as low signal zzso The 8 T MR images showed better zzso of the stifle zzso compared to the images acquired at zzso zzso The zzso relaxation time of the zzso appears to indicate zzso due to small number of zzso a slight variation in the zzso type between 8 weeks and 16 zzso At both study times, the defects zzso appeared zzso to reddish but did not have the characteristic zzso appearance typical of zzso cartilage zzso The gross appearance of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso which was predominantly zzso and recessed with zzso of adjacent native zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso defects predominantly comprised zzso zzso tissue with only few samples showing the presence of zzso and/or zzso zzso within the zzso zzso at 8 zzso Also, compared to zzso the zzso zzso appeared to be more zzso 

Using 8 T zzso high-resolution MR images of ex zzso zzso goat zzso confirmed the capability of zzso MR imaging to distinguish the zzso zzso from the zzso and adjacent joint zzso The extent of OC repair and adjacent bone zzso (at 8 weeks and 16 weeks) observed in the MR images compared well with those observed on the corresponding zzso zzso
