To enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis of progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters established in zzso proven cases are zzso 

We examined zzso zzso in five zzso confirmed zzso patients (three men, mean age at death 77 years, range zzso zzso Time zzso between symptom onset and zzso ranged from 1 to 5 years, and between zzso and death from 33 to 52 zzso Only one patient had clinical diagnosis of zzso at the time of zzso Control group consisted of 19 zzso and zzso healthy zzso zzso zzso parameters of the zzso and zzso were measured on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso scans with Image zzso zzso of superior zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed on zzso autopsy zzso 

Mean SCP zzso on zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was smaller than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean SCP zzso at autopsy was zzso smaller than mean SCP zzso on zzso zzso zzso area in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was smaller than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area ratio in zzso was zzso and in controls was zzso zzso zzso zzso Repeat zzso 17 months later in one zzso case revealed zzso decrease of SCP zzso 

MR imaging with quantitative analysis may be useful in the diagnosis of early zzso and in monitoring disease zzso
