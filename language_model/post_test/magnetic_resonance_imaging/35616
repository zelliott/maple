In two patients with total acquired cortical zzso zzso and in six control subjects we studied the zzso zzso response to a variety of sharply defined zzso and zzso displays that either had the same mean zzso as the background zzso or were of greater mean zzso Despite their complete inability to identify or to discriminate between zzso the patients, like the control subjects, showed a zzso response to the structured zzso displays, even when they were masked by dynamic zzso zzso However, and unlike the control subjects, the patients showed no zzso response when the zzso displays lacked sharp chromatic borders, as in zzso or zzso The results indicate that although chromatic processing still occurs in cortical zzso zzso its function is solely to give rise to the detection of sharp boundaries which, in their case, can provide the perception of shape but not zzso In accordance with this, the patients could no longer describe the zzso zzso figures, which were often totally invisible to them despite their strong chromatic contrast with the zzso
