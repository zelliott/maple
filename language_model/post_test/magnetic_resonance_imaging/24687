To evaluate the inflammatory involvement of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Ten zzso zzso new patients with zzso and pain in the shoulder and pelvic zzso were zzso Seven patients with zzso (4 with zzso zzso one with zzso zzso and 2 with zzso zzso as well as 2 patients with spinal zzso and 2 patients with zzso arthritis with zzso pain served as zzso zzso of zzso spine was performed in all zzso patients and zzso Nine patients (5 zzso patients and 4 zzso also had zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso evidence of zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso patients with zzso and in zzso zzso A moderate to marked zzso zzso on a zzso 0-3 zzso zzso zzso occurred significantly more frequently in patients with zzso than in control patients zzso zzso zzso zzso In most of the patients and controls zzso zzso was found at the zzso zzso Only 2 patients had zzso at a different level (one patient had widespread zzso zzso and one control at zzso No zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso of the zzso spine in patients and zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso may be responsible for the low back pain reported by patients with zzso The prominent inflammatory involvement of zzso including those of the zzso spine supports the hypothesis that zzso may be a disorder affecting predominantly zzso zzso zzso
