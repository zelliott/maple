zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a less invasive way of mapping brain zzso The reliability of zzso for zzso zzso function is yet to be zzso 

We performed a detailed analysis of language zzso reliability by comparing the results of zzso zzso with maps determined by zzso zzso stimulation zzso 

This study was performed on 8 zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso The tasks performed during zzso included verb generation, zzso zzso and picture zzso We focused on the frontal zzso which was effectively activated by these zzso In zzso zzso 4 tasks were combined to determine the eloquent zzso spontaneous speech, picture naming, reading, and zzso We calculated the sensitivity and specificity with different Z score thresholds for each task and appropriate matching zzso For further analysis, we divided the frontal lobe into 5 areas and investigated zzso variations in sensitivity and zzso 

The zzso categorization task was the most sensitive and specific task in zzso whereas the picture naming task detected eloquent areas most efficiently in zzso The combination of the zzso categorization task and a zzso matching criterion gave the best zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when the Z score was zzso As for zzso variation, the zzso inferior frontal zzso showed the best zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the anterior middle frontal zzso had low zzso 

Despite different tasks for zzso and zzso zzso the relatively low specificity might be caused by a fundamental zzso between the 2 zzso zzso of language zzso zzso might zzso depending on the brain zzso
