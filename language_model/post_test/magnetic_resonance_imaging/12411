zzso group analyses are used to compare the zzso zzso observed in brain organization with zzso or genetic variables and to assess risks factors of brain zzso The lack of stability and of sensitivity of current zzso analysis schemes may however lead to zzso zzso A new approach is introduced to overcome the limitations of standard methods, in which active zzso are detected according to a consensus on several random zzso of the brain images, while a zzso test controls the false positive zzso Both on zzso and real data, this approach shows higher sensitivity, better recovery and higher zzso than standard methods and succeeds in detecting a significant association in an zzso study between a genetic zzso next to the zzso gene and a region in the left zzso on a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso
