zzso offers a unique insight into how our brain zzso The purpose of this experiment was to determine if motor system activity and functional connectivity between the cognitive system and zzso system is zzso modulated by an zzso level of zzso This goal was achieved through the acquisition of functional zzso data in 10 expert volleyball players and 10 novice individuals who were presented with a series of sentences describing possible technical zzso motor acts and acts that cannot be performed as positive zzso zzso or negative zzso zzso commands, while they were silently reading them and deciding whether the actions were technically feasible or zzso Compared with zzso zzso activity in the left primary motor zzso hand area zzso and in the left zzso zzso zzso was decreased by impossible actions presented as positive zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso stimuli is not that automatic as held since we found that these areas were zzso during the task, and their functional connectivity to the primary visual zzso was strengthened for possible actions presented as positive commands, reflecting the neural processes underlying the interaction between motor and visual zzso These results suggest that the neural activity within the key areas implicitly triggered by motor simulation is a function of the expertise, action zzso and zzso
