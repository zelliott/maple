zzso zzso is a zzso hormone produced predominantly in the zzso The protective effect of zzso EPO in zzso brain injury has been thoroughly examined in zzso However, the metabolism of zzso EPO in zzso remains zzso 

We aimed to evaluate the concentration of urinary EPO zzso in critically ill zzso and to identify possible clinical and laboratory variables that may be associated with zzso zzso 

The zzso of EPO, zzso zzso and zzso in the first available urine sample during the initial 72 h of life were measured in 103 critically ill zzso Clinical and laboratory data were collected for each zzso 

There was a positive correlation between zzso levels and urinary levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The concentration of zzso was elevated in zzso who developed acute kidney injury zzso during the first week of life compared with those without zzso zzso zzso zzso and was also elevated in zzso with brain injury, as demonstrated by ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, compared to zzso without brain injury zzso zzso zzso An increased zzso zzso level was associated with the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and brain injury zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

An increased urinary EPO level in the early zzso period is significantly associated with kidney and brain injury in critically ill zzso
