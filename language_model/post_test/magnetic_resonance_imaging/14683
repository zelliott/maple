To determine whether the zzso differed between typical cases of zzso zzso with unilateral knee involvement and zzso cases involving zzso other than the knee, zzso disease, and disease outside of the knee zzso 

Cases of zzso zzso involving the knee joint were evaluated for the distribution of the disease and severity of degenerative zzso zzso other than the knee were evaluated for the presence and severity of degenerative arthritis, and the distribution was classified as either zzso zzso or zzso Clinical history was reviewed for patient age at zzso a history of inflammatory arthritis, diabetes zzso and known steroid zzso zzso exact test was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between typical and zzso presentations of the zzso 

zzso zzso was identified in 45 zzso in 39 zzso zzso patients were classified as zzso and 11 patients had zzso zzso There was no significant difference in age at zzso presence of degenerative arthritis, or known inflammatory arthritis when comparing typical and zzso presentations of the zzso 

zzso percent of patients in the present study had zzso presentation of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or disease in zzso other than the zzso There was no significant difference in age at zzso presence of degenerative arthritis, or known inflammatory arthritis when comparing typical and zzso presentations of the zzso Of the 39 patients, only three had no evidence of degenerative arthritis, which suggests that many cases of zzso zzso are secondary to chronic zzso change in association with degenerative zzso
