We used zzso to map foot, elbow, fist, zzso index finger, and lip movements in 30 healthy zzso For each movement type confidence intervals of zzso sites in the primary motor zzso zzso were zzso In order to improve the precision of their anatomical zzso and to zzso the mapping of cortical zzso sites, we used both the assessment of locations in the conventional zzso system and a zzso projection zzso In addition to the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso clusters within the zzso zzso centers of gravity were zzso Both methods showed a high overlap of their zzso confidence zzso The zzso method revealed statistically significant distinct zzso locations, zzso elbow versus index finger movements and index finger versus thumb zzso Increased degree of complexity of finger movements resulted in a spread of the zzso location toward the arm zzso The zzso zzso zzso evaluation of limb movements showed high precision and was able to reveal differences in zzso movement zzso zzso zzso revealed a clear zzso order of movement representation in zzso and also reflected different degrees of complexity of zzso
