zzso brain injury zzso and zzso procedures commonly result in tissue loss within the cerebral zzso zzso is limited by the anatomical tissue gaps and the hostile zzso created by the zzso A search for novel zzso that are zzso and conducive to healing and zzso is zzso One approach is with the use of zzso a type I zzso zzso zzso zzso We review the current evidence on the use of zzso and describe our experience with its use in zzso models of surgical brain zzso A cortical zzso model is used to mimic the significant amount of tissue loss seen in zzso and clinical zzso The use of zzso as a carrier of zzso zzso cells and a potential topical zzso agent is zzso zzso can bridge tissue gaps and reduce surrounding zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells within the tissue scaffold is zzso zzso achieves zzso almost zzso and is associated with less tissue damage when compared with other conventional zzso There are, however, certain limitations with the application of zzso mainly due to its zzso low pH and need for zzso The use of zzso zzso scaffold is a promising approach for the reconstruction of the injured zzso New experimental models and research methods are required to fully explore its potential in minimizing secondary brain injuries and to promote zzso zzso
