Are visual face processing mechanisms the same in the left and right cerebral zzso The possibility of such zzso zzso seems puzzling in terms of neural resource zzso and we currently lack a precise characterization of the lateral differences in face zzso To address this need, we have undertaken a three-pronged zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed cortical sensitivity to facial zzso the zzso effects of context and zzso response zzso zzso on all three fronts revealed systematic zzso zzso We found that: zzso zzso patterns in the left zzso zzso correlate with zzso zzso while those in the right correlate with zzso zzso zzso zzso Context exerts significant zzso influence in the left, but has limited effect on the zzso zzso zzso persists in the right even after activity on the left has returned to zzso These results provide important clues regarding the functional architecture of face processing, suggesting that the left zzso is involved in processing zzso face zzso and perhaps is a precursor to zzso zzso analyses on the zzso
