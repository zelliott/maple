This paper describes our experience in developing a zzso (Digital Imaging and Communications in zzso server based on widely available personal computers enabling to use X-ray digital images for teaching and scientific zzso 

The system is based on a zzso server running on a widely used personal zzso The selected zzso images are collected directly from the zzso equipment or from a dedicated zzso image processing zzso through a zzso connection and converted into one of the standard formats zzso or zzso to allow their direct importing into multimedia presentations for teaching or scientific zzso 

This system allows fast and easy collection of zzso images in zzso format directly from the diagnostic equipment or from the zzso zzso These images may be used for scientific and teaching presentations without loss of image quality and zzso characteristics in zzso images as there is no zzso acquisition zzso 

The extensive possibilities of implement the system described on widely used PCs makes the system extremely versatile and zzso the preparation of teaching material and scientific zzso
