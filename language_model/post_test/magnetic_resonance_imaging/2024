The aim of this study was to compare peripheral zzso enhancement with zzso progression on zzso coded harmonic zzso zzso with those as seen on magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso A total of 20 patients with 24 zzso confirmed by dynamic zzso zzso were included in this zzso All 20 patients were examined with zzso in conjunction with a zzso zzso contrast agent zzso U zzso and with zzso delay zzso The pattern and the time of contrast enhancement were recorded on zzso zzso We compared zzso images with zzso in terms of the similarity of zzso peripheral zzso The significance of size of tumor and baseline zzso on the ability to see peripheral zzso enhancement was independently zzso zzso zzso enhancement was shown on zzso in 22 zzso of 24 zzso Of 22 zzso 21 zzso with peripheral zzso enhancement had progressive zzso zzso on zzso zzso In 4 zzso of 5 zzso less than zzso zzso in diameter, zzso peripheral zzso were depicted on zzso zzso In terms of the similarity of peripheral zzso zzso images showed the similarity more than zzso grade with zzso in 21 zzso of 22 zzso This study shows that zzso is approximately equal to zzso in its ability to show peripheral zzso enhancement with zzso zzso even in small zzso
