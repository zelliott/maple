To describe a large pedigree with zzso disease type zzso zzso zzso in which severe pelvic and thigh zzso weakness occurred in two patients, detected by zzso the leg muscle zzso pattern on magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The pedigree comprised 18 patients, aged between 15 and 85 zzso zzso years, who were serially evaluated for up to three zzso All 18 patients and 13 zzso zzso people underwent zzso zzso An zzso study of lower limb zzso was carried out in four zzso Three patients underwent zzso zzso zzso testing was carried out in 17 patients and in all 13 zzso normal zzso 

Fourteen patients were zzso or slightly zzso The two oldest patients, aged 84 and 80, showed a moderate zzso Two other patients, aged 70 and 53, showed zzso and gradually progressive zzso zzso extending up to the thigh and pelvic musculature, resulting in zzso zzso zzso scans of all three patients with a mild zzso showed subtle and zzso fatty zzso of calf zzso muscle zzso with thigh muscle involvement in one patient, and extensive zzso of intrinsic foot zzso In the youngest patient with zzso leg zzso the zzso scan showed massive fatty zzso of all the calf muscles, zzso thigh muscle zzso and internal and external hip rotator zzso zzso biopsy specimens showed zzso zzso with no superimposed zzso Good correlation was seen between zzso and genetic zzso 

Late in the clinical course, a small proportion of patients with zzso develop severe zzso leg zzso and long-term follow-up is essential for its zzso zzso scans may show zzso involvement of the thigh zzso
