Images from different individuals typically cannot be registered precisely because anatomical features within the images differ across the people zzso and because the current methods for image registration have inherent technological limitations that interfere with perfect zzso zzso the inevitable error in image registration is therefore of crucial importance in assessing the effects that image zzso may have on subsequent analyses in an imaging zzso We have developed a mathematical framework for zzso errors in registration by computing the confidence intervals of the estimated parameters (3 zzso 3 zzso and 1 global zzso for the similarity zzso The presence of noise in images and the zzso in anatomy across individuals ensures that estimated registration parameters are always random zzso We assume a functional relation among zzso across zzso in the images, and we use the theory of zzso zzso zzso to show that the parameters are zzso zzso zzso We then use the zzso zzso of this distribution to zzso the confidence intervals of the transformation zzso These confidence intervals provide a quantitative assessment of the registration error across the zzso Because transformation parameters are zzso related to the coordinates of landmark points in the brain, we subsequently show that the coordinates of those landmark points are also zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso we then zzso the confidence intervals of the coordinates for landmark points in the zzso Each of these confidence intervals in turn provides a quantitative assessment of the registration error at a particular landmark zzso Because our method is zzso zzso however, its current zzso is limited to assessing the error of the parameters in the similarity transformation across zzso We assessed the performance of our method in computing the error in estimated similarity parameters by applying that method to real world zzso Our results showed that the size of the confidence intervals zzso using our method decreased - zzso our confidence in the registration of images from different individuals increased - for increasing amounts of blur in the zzso Moreover, the size of the confidence intervals increased for increasing amounts of noise, zzso and differing zzso Thus, our method precisely zzso confidence in the registration of images that contain varying amounts of zzso and varying anatomy across zzso
