The properties of a zzso iron oxide zzso model contrast agent have been zzso The test material, zzso contained iron oxide zzso zzso coated with zzso zzso naturally occurring zzso zzso of the zzso suspension showed the existence of zzso stable particles ranging from zzso 100 zzso down to single crystal zzso The small zzso 20 zzso particles represented the major number fraction of particles present, but only zzso zzso of the total iron oxide zzso The volume weighted average diameter of the individual iron oxide zzso forming the zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso using transmission electron zzso and vibrating sample zzso zzso zzso zzso results were obtained with X-ray zzso and zzso zzso A number of additional zzso properties could also be determined on a routine zzso such as the distribution standard zzso for the zzso distribution of crystal sizes, the magnetic zzso the magnetic zzso and the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso of the iron zzso These parameters are useful tools for evaluation of the magnetic characteristics and contrast efficacy of zzso contrast zzso
