A quantitative zzso analysis of zzso nucleus can provide valuable information in early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with Alzheimer's diseases zzso Purpose of the study is to estimate the volume of segmented zzso nucleus from MR images and to correlate the variation in the segmented volume with respect to the total brain zzso We have also tried to evaluate the zzso nucleus zzso with the age related zzso of white matter zzso gray matter zzso and zzso fluid zzso in a group of Alzheimer's disease zzso 

zzso fast low angle shot zzso zzso brain MR images of 15 zzso patients, 15 normal volunteers and 15 patients who had normally diagnosed MR images were included in the zzso Brain tissue and zzso zzso were segmented using the statistical zzso mapping package and a zzso zzso respectively and the volumes were zzso Volume of segmented zzso nucleus is correlated with respect to the total brain zzso Further, the zzso nucleus zzso is estimated with the age related zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in a group of zzso zzso 

zzso reduction in the zzso volume of zzso patients was observed compared to that of the normal zzso zzso analysis also showed significant variation in the volume of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Among the patients who had normal appearing brain, zzso showed significant changes in the zzso zzso We zzso that these changes can be considered as an indication of early zzso 

The method of zzso analysis of brain structures is simple and effective way of early diagnosis of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's zzso We have illustrated this with the observed changes in the volume of zzso nucleus in a group of zzso A detailed study with more subjects will be useful in zzso these results for early diagnosis of zzso
