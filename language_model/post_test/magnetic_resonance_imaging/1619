The surgical treatment of medically intractable zzso lobe zzso includes the zzso of zzso lobe zzso Although the reported zzso outcomes are highly zzso there is growing evidence that the extent of zzso of the zzso lobe directly zzso with seizure zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso system was used to monitor and zzso the zzso of the zzso and zzso in 14 zzso zzso Fourteen patients with intractable zzso of zzso lobe origin underwent standard zzso investigations including MR imaging, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on 10 patients, whereas four were treated with selective zzso zzso zzso was applied as zzso For all procedures, the objective was to zzso the zzso completely, and zzso to the zzso margin of the zzso 

zzso zzso MR imaging taken when optimal zzso was thought to have been achieved revealed residual zzso zzso or zzso in seven of 14 zzso An unexpected acute zzso was found in one zzso At 17 months' zzso 13 zzso of 14 patients are seizure free or have significantly improved seizure zzso 

The mobile zzso zzso MR system provides high-resolution images without restriction on surgical instruments or zzso The ability to identify and zzso residual zzso zzso lobe targets before zzso closure is of potentially tremendous value in zzso seizure zzso
