zzso functions are typically zzso to the right cerebral hemisphere, giving rise to a left visual field advantage in visual zzso zzso In a first study we investigated whether this is also true for symmetry detection off zzso Twenty right-handed participants with left zzso speech dominance took part in a visual zzso experiment requiring them to judge the symmetry of zzso figures made by joining zzso in symmetrical or zzso zzso As expected, a significant left visual field advantage was observed for the symmetrical zzso In a second study, we zzso the study with 37 left-handed participants and left zzso speech zzso We again found a left visual field zzso Finally, in a third study, we included 17 participants with known right zzso dominance for speech zzso dominance had been identified with zzso in an earlier study; Van der zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso Around half of these individuals showed a reversed pattern, zzso a right visual zzso advantage for zzso figures while the other half zzso the left zzso zzso These findings suggest that symmetry detection is indeed a cognitive function zzso to the right zzso for the majority of the zzso The data of the participants with zzso speech dominance are more in line with the idea that language and zzso functions are zzso in opposite brain zzso than with the idea that different functions zzso zzso although there seems to be more zzso in this zzso
