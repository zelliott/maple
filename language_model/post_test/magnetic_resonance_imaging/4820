While American Society of Anesthesiologists and European Society of zzso guidelines recommend 6 h zzso zzso for food and zzso zzso in children, some institutions allow shorter zzso times of 4 zzso zzso of this pilot study was to compare zzso residual gastric contents volumes zzso after 4 zzso 6 h after a light breakfast, using magnetic resonance imaging zzso in healthy volunteer children not scheduled for zzso 

Four zzso 6 h zzso zzso of food zzso were simulated in a crossover zzso After overnight zzso zzso each child zzso a light breakfast zzso flakes, milk zzso on two separate zzso Additional clear fluid (7 zzso raspberry zzso was given either after 2 zzso ) or 4 h zzso ), followed by zzso zzso acquisition for 2 zzso zzso was obtained on a zzso zzso scanner as 5 zzso zzso images zzso and volumes were traced manually by one blinded zzso Data are given as median zzso or mean zzso standard zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers aged zzso zzso years zzso zzso for zzso and zzso at baseline was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso after 4 and 6 h was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after syrup intake was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso , zzso 

zzso gastric contents volumes at a hypothetical zzso start were similar for 4 and 6 h food zzso in healthy volunteer school-age zzso
