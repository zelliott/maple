Although reductions in the expression of the zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been observed in the aging brain, it is unknown whether these changes contribute to age-related zzso zzso To address this issue, we measured zzso zzso metabolism and zzso structure across the lifespan of zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso and zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso metabolism was estimated using steady state relative cerebral blood volume zzso which is a zzso of zzso that provides the highest spatial resolution, optimal for the analysis of individual zzso of the zzso zzso We found that like zzso normal aging in zzso mice is characterized by an zzso decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although abnormal zzso zzso signals were observed in zzso and zzso mice, only zzso mice showed accelerated zzso decline of zzso metabolism in the zzso We also found zzso structural changes in zzso mice, which included an enlarged zzso and zzso as well as global brain zzso These zzso and structural changes in zzso mice correlated with a deficit in zzso learning in the active place avoidance zzso Our results suggest that the decrease in CB that occurs during normal aging is involved in age-related zzso zzso zzso Our findings also illustrate the value of using multiple zzso techniques in transgenic mice to investigate mechanisms involved in the functional and structural changes that occur during zzso
