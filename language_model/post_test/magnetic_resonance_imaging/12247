We have previously observed decreased zzso of zzso zzso involved in planning zzso zzso and execution zzso zzso of a set shift in patients with early Parkinson's disease zzso compared with control zzso Here, we aimed to assess whether cognitive impairment in zzso could drive these zzso zzso patients underwent a comprehensive zzso evaluation and participated in our Wisconsin zzso zzso task functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Patients were separated into 2 groups according to the presence of mild cognitive impairment zzso Patients with zzso displayed reduced activity in the cognitive zzso loop, which includes the zzso nucleus and prefrontal zzso while planning a set shift, whereas zzso patients exhibited zzso patterns similar to those of healthy participants from our previous zzso Furthermore, reduced zzso was observed in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Finally, zzso activity, correlated with individual memory scores, suggesting a zzso mechanism in patients with preserved zzso These results suggest that the presence of zzso in zzso affects activity in the prefrontal zzso and zzso nucleus as well as zzso zzso
