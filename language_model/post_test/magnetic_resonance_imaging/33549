zzso zzso images zzso zzso with optimal zzso ratios for zzso MR zzso is a conditional maximum problem, and its solutions are generalized matched zzso We have investigated six matched zzso corresponding to all possible combinations of three flow suppression conditions and two zzso ratio zzso zzso Four of these matched filters zzso to previously described zzso the zzso matched zzso the standard zzso the global zzso zzso and the global zzso zzso The two others are referred to here as the local zzso zzso and the local zzso zzso These six matched filters have been applied to zzso zzso phase contrast zzso zzso The local zzso zzso is found to be the most effective in suppressing zzso zzso flow and preserving desired zzso zzso
