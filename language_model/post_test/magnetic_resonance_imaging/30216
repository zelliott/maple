The zzso zzso nicotine zzso detection of zzso cued trials in zzso zzso and reduces the associated neural activity in human inferior zzso zzso By using functional magnetic resonance imaging we test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso may result from reduced use of zzso information derived from prior zzso In a within subjects design zzso volunteers were given either zzso or nicotine zzso 2 zzso zzso prior to performing a cued target discrimination zzso Attention was either zzso zzso or zzso zzso cued to the right or left visual zzso The difference in reaction times to zzso and zzso cued targets is termed the zzso zzso and indicates the costs for zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso effect and zzso neural activity in right inferior zzso zzso Further regions consistently modulated in their activity by nicotine were the right middle zzso zzso left middle frontal zzso left zzso zzso and right zzso The effects of nicotine upon zzso zzso were investigated by comparing zzso activity when attending to the right zzso left visual zzso under zzso and zzso If nicotine reduced the use of zzso information zzso zzso in zzso zzso should be smaller under nicotine as compared with zzso Even though an zzso zzso of neural activity was observed in the zzso and middle zzso zzso we found no evidence for differences in zzso zzso under zzso and zzso Our data support a role of zzso zzso receptors in zzso several zzso of zzso zzso via zzso of right inferior zzso zzso and frontal brain zzso In contrast, the findings in the zzso zzso do not support the hypothesis that the effects of nicotine on zzso zzso are due to reduced reliance on zzso information derived from prior zzso
