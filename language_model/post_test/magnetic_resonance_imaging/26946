This exploratory study examined the extent to which individual differences in sensory processing sensitivity zzso a zzso trait characterized by social, emotional and physical sensitivity, are associated with neural response in visual areas in response to subtle changes in visual zzso Sixteen participants completed the zzso Sensitive Person zzso a standard measure of zzso zzso they were tested on a change detection task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso was associated with significantly greater zzso in brain areas involved in zzso visual processing zzso right zzso left zzso bilateral zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as in the right zzso when detecting minor zzso zzso changes in zzso These findings remained strong and significant after controlling for zzso and zzso traits that are often correlated with zzso These results provide the first evidence of neural differences associated with zzso the first direct support for the sensory aspect of this trait that has been studied primarily for its social and affective zzso and preliminary evidence for heightened sensory processing in individuals high in zzso
