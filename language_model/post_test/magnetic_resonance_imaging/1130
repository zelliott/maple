During follow-up for patients with cervical zzso zzso of serum zzso cell zzso zzso zzso levels in the absence of zzso zzso zzso presents a diagnostic and therapeutic zzso In the current prospective study, the authors evaluated the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect disease recurrence in this zzso 

Women with cervical zzso who experienced complete responses to primary treatment or salvage therapy and who had no evidence of zzso disease as detected by conventional methods but had serum zzso levels zzso or zzso zzso zzso on 2 consecutive occasions were eligible for the zzso PET was performed within 2 weeks after the completion of conventional studies for the assessment of zzso 

zzso consecutive patients were registered for the current zzso PET findings were positive for 19 zzso 14 who had a distant zzso or zzso 2 who had a local zzso or zzso and 3 who had both local and distant zzso Of these 19 patients, 17 were confirmed to have zzso zzso the remaining two were found to be free of disease but had severe zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven of the eight patients with negative PET findings were not found to have zzso disease on zzso Overall, PET detected zzso zzso in 17 zzso P zzso zzso of the 18 patients with zzso zzso Seven of these 18 patients received therapy with zzso zzso complete control was achieved in 6, four of whom currently are alive and free of zzso The addition of PET in the current setting curbed the use of futile zzso therapy and significantly increased overall survival for patients in the current cohort compared with a historical group of 30 consecutive patients who had elevated zzso levels as a first sign of zzso 

PET expedited the detection of zzso cervical zzso in patients with unexplained zzso of zzso zzso Such expedited detection may have positive effects on patient zzso
