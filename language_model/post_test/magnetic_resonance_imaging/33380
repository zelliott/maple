zzso zzso zones in the primary motor zzso for thumb movements, namely thumb zzso extension, zzso and zzso have been described in zzso zzso monkeys but not in zzso Even recent cortical mapping based on zzso monitoring does not provide information about zzso zzso zones as it is not ethically possible to search the human motor zzso extensively by zzso zzso 

A zzso man with discrete cortical embolism over the left central zzso is zzso Only a mild weakness of his right thumb was zzso zzso zzso was affected to a greater degree than thumb extension, zzso and zzso The zzso ran along the bottom of the central zzso and affected part of the zzso and zzso zzso on both sides of zzso Animal studies in zzso zzso monkeys have shown that the zzso zzso zones for thumb movement, especially for thumb zzso are located in the part of the motor zzso just adjoining the central zzso that folds down from the zzso to the depth of the central zzso It was possible to explain the prominent weakness of thumb zzso if we applied the results of the animal zzso 

Our case suggests that the same arrangement of zzso zzso zones found in monkeys may also exist in human zzso
