A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed to image the human brain at 7 zzso A hybrid decoupling scheme was implemented that used both zzso decoupling and the partial geometric overlapping of adjacent zzso zzso The decoupling scheme allowed zzso elements to be arrayed along all three Cartesian zzso this facilitated zzso of the transmit field, zzso and parallel imaging acceleration along the zzso direction in addition to the standard zzso zzso Each channel was independently controlled during imaging using a zzso console and a 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean isolation between all combinations of zzso elements was 18 zzso 7 zzso After zzso zzso the standard zzso of the transmit field uniformity was zzso in an zzso plane and zzso over the entire brain superior to the zzso zzso uniformity was sufficient to acquire fast spin echo images of this region of the brain with a single zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso maps showed higher zzso in the periphery vs center of the brain, and higher zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso vs the frontal zzso Parallel imaging acceleration in a zzso zzso plane was zzso The implication of the number of channels in a zzso zzso was zzso it was determined that improvements in zzso and zzso zzso can be expected when using more than 15 independently controlled zzso zzso
