To present a method for generating reference maps of typical brain characteristics of groups of subjects using a novel combination of rapid quantitative zzso zzso Imaging zzso and brain zzso The reference maps can be used to detect significant tissue differences in patients, both locally and zzso 

A rapid zzso method was used to obtain the zzso relaxation rate zzso the zzso relaxation rate zzso and the zzso density zzso These three tissue properties were measured in the brains of 32 healthy subjects and in one patient diagnosed with Multiple zzso zzso The maps were zzso to a standard brain template using a linear zzso zzso The differences of the mean value zzso zzso and zzso of 31 healthy subjects in comparison to the oldest healthy subject and in comparison to an zzso patient were zzso zzso anatomical structures were characterized using a standard zzso The zzso sum of the zzso differences was used to show significant tissue zzso 

The zzso of variation of the reference maps was high at the edges of the brain and the zzso moderate in the cortical zzso matter and low in white matter and the deep zzso matter zzso The elderly subject mainly showed significantly lower zzso and zzso and higher zzso values along all zzso The zzso patient showed significantly lower zzso and zzso and higher zzso values at the edges of the zzso system as well as throughout the zzso white matter, at the internal and external capsules and at each of the zzso zzso 

Brain zzso of rapid zzso is a promising new method to generate reference maps of typical brain characteristics and to automatically detect zzso tissue properties in the zzso
