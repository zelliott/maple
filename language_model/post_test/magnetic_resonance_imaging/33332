The objective of our study was to investigate the association between high zzso zzso zzso zzso and hip zzso in young zzso 

In a retrospective study, blinded observers reviewed 82 pelvic zzso and hip zzso studies of three groups of zzso those with zzso zzso of the hip zzso zzso angle, zzso those with borderline zzso zzso angle, zzso and control patients zzso angle, zzso The zzso angle and zzso zzso zzso zzso angle, zzso were assessed on pelvic zzso and zzso zzso was assessed on MR images zzso angle, zzso The zzso and Fisher exact tests were used to correlate zzso zzso with zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement for zzso and delta angles and the diagnostic performance of zzso zzso as a marker of zzso were zzso 

Thirty-one patients with zzso 23 with borderline zzso and 28 without zzso were zzso Excellent zzso agreement was found for zzso angle zzso correlation zzso zzso and for delta angle zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso had a significant association with zzso zzso but no association with zzso zzso zzso A significant difference zzso was found between patients with zzso zzso and those without zzso zzso with respect to mean delta angle zzso zzso zzso had zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value, zzso negative zzso value, and zzso overall accuracy as an indicator of zzso 

zzso zzso shows promise as a strong zzso marker of zzso
