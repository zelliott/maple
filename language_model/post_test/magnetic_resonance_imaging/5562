Information processing models of zzso stress disorder zzso suggest that zzso is characterized by preferential allocation of zzso resources to potentially threatening zzso However, few studies have examined the neural pattern underlying attention and emotion in association with zzso zzso In the present study, combat veterans with zzso zzso engaged in an emotional oddball task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Veterans were classified into a high or low zzso group based on their scores on the Davidson zzso zzso zzso Participants zzso zzso target stimuli zzso from frequent standards zzso while emotional and neutral zzso were presented infrequently and zzso zzso revealed that participants with greater zzso zzso showed enhanced neural activity in zzso and zzso regions for emotional stimuli and attenuated activity in zzso prefrontal and zzso regions for attention zzso In the anterior zzso zzso participants with fewer zzso symptoms showed equivalent responses to zzso and emotional stimuli while the high symptom group showed greater zzso for negative emotional zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso zzso activity coupled with altered zzso and anterior zzso function may be a neural marker of attention bias in zzso
