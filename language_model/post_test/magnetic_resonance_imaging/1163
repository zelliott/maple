To test magnetic resonance zzso contrast media of different molecular weights zzso for their potential to characterize zzso zzso changes in an experimental tumor treatment zzso 

zzso a poorly differentiated human breast cancer cell line, was implanted into 31 female zzso zzso zzso Animals were assigned randomly to a control zzso or drug treatment zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso In both groups, dynamic MR imaging zzso was performed in each animal using up to three different contrast media on sequential days at baseline and follow-up zzso The zzso of the contrast media used ranged from zzso Da to 92 zzso Using a zzso kinetic model, tumor zzso zzso including the fractional plasma volume zzso and zzso zzso zzso were estimated for each contrast zzso These zzso characteristics were compared between drug and control groups and between contrast media of different zzso 

zzso grew significantly slower zzso zzso zzso in the drug treatment group than in the control zzso Mean zzso and zzso values decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group compared to baseline values using intermediate or zzso contrast media zzso but did not change significantly using small molecular contrast media zzso In the control groups, mean zzso and mean zzso values did not reach statistical significance for any of the contrast media zzso 

zzso effects of a zzso zzso on tumor zzso characteristics can be monitored by dynamic zzso zzso agents, such as zzso offer a substantial dynamic range and are less limited by imaging precision and therefore should be considered a practical alternative to monitor zzso treatment effects in a clinical zzso
