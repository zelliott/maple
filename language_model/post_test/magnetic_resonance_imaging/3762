zzso zzso detection and diagnosis in zzso zzso Images zzso requires a robust zzso zzso Since manual zzso is a time-consuming task which engages valuable human resources, automatic zzso zzso received an enormous amount of zzso For this goal, various techniques have been zzso However, zzso Random Field zzso based zzso have produced reasonable results in noisy images compared to other zzso zzso seeks a label field which zzso an energy zzso The traditional zzso method, simulated zzso zzso uses zzso Carlo simulation to access the minimum solution with heavy zzso zzso For this reason, zzso are rarely used in real time processing zzso This paper proposed a novel method based on zzso and a hybrid of social zzso that contain an zzso colony zzso zzso and a zzso zzso which can be used for zzso single and zzso zzso in real time zzso Combining zzso with the zzso zzso helps find the better path using neighborhood zzso zzso this interaction causes the zzso to zzso to an optimum solution zzso Several experiments on phantom and real images were zzso zzso indicate that the proposed zzso zzso the traditional zzso and hybrid of zzso in speed and zzso
