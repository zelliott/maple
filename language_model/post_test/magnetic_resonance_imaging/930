Search for a zzso conjunction target can be facilitated by presenting one set of zzso prior to the second set of zzso and the zzso the preview benefit zzso & zzso zzso The early presentation of one set of zzso enables them to be efficiently filtered from zzso We report two studies investigating the time course of the preview zzso In zzso 1 we use a standard reaction time analysis to show that the benefit has a relatively slow time course; old items need to zzso the new set by 600 zzso or more in order to be fully filtered from zzso Furthermore, the reductions in reaction time across time in the preview condition varied zzso with the display size, suggesting that old items were discounted from search in zzso In zzso 2 we examined the neural locus of this filtering effect over time, using zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that regions of zzso zzso are selectively activated in a preview search condition relative to a detection zzso These regions also increase in zzso as the preview zzso increases (and search then becomes zzso consistent with them modulating the parallel filtering of zzso from targets in spatial zzso Interestingly, the same areas as those activated in preview search were also active in conjunction search relative to its own detection zzso Thus these regions either zzso parallel filtering in conjunction search too, or they zzso different zzso functions according to task zzso
