We performed blood zzso zzso zzso functional MR imaging in 11 children younger than 5 y of age and 10 children older than 5 y of zzso All but five of the children in the older age group were tested under light zzso We examined the cerebral zzso metabolism zzso associated with the processing of a flashed and a reversing zzso zzso These stimuli had been shown in a previous study to induce identical vascular zzso The reversing zzso activated twice the zzso population of the flashed zzso doubling the zzso associated with zzso We compared the extent of zzso for the positive zzso response and found that it did not differ between the different age zzso We estimated the zzso metabolism by examining the change in the local zzso zzso concentration using Delta zzso Because both stimuli induced the same vascular response, any increase in oxygen requirement would have to be met by the identical blood zzso zzso zzso will therefore result in an increase in the oxygen extraction fraction zzso which raises the local zzso zzso In the younger children, both zzso stimuli produced zzso high zzso zzso In the older children, the zzso concentration to the flashed stimulus was significantly lower than to the reversing zzso We conclude that, for identical zzso the zzso energy requirement associated with the cortical processing is higher in young children than in older children because the presence of superfluous synaptic connections in the immature visual system activates a larger zzso zzso
