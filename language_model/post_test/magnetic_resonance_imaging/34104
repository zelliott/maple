The purpose of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of brain zzso performed within a vertically opened MR zzso We worked with the zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, zzso with an integrated tracking device zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Technologies, zzso As a holding device for this instrument we constructed a special zzso The whole system allows an exact adjustment of an optimum biopsy direction and guidance of the biopsy in a zzso interactive mode in near zzso As biopsy tools we used zzso aspiration and specially made zzso needles zzso zzso zzso zzso We performed a prospective diagnostic brain biopsy study in 18 zzso zzso of the needle was carried out using zzso zzso zzso The sample was taken after controlling the exact position of the needle tip on zzso zzso In 12 cases an exact zzso diagnosis was zzso In 6 cases of negative biopsy (4 aspiration zzso the samples were not zzso Our results demonstrate the feasibility of interactive zzso minimally invasive brain zzso in an open MR zzso The best results were achieved using cut needles for zzso of zzso zzso visible on zzso zzso guidance zzso
