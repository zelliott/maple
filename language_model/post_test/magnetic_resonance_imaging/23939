A zzso effect can be obtained with zzso zzso zzso a zzso structurally related to zzso a loop zzso We have investigated the zzso effect of zzso by magnetic resonance imaging and use of the zzso model of cerebral zzso in the zzso This method enables zzso zzso of the extent of the cerebral zzso from zzso zzso zzso This article reports the evolution of the extent of zzso with time zzso 1, 2, 4, 6, 24 and 48 zzso 7 and 15 days and 1 month after induction of the zzso in rats zzso with 5 zzso zzso zzso or an appropriate zzso At all times, the rats treated with zzso had, on average, smaller zzso than control rats zzso decrease between 2 h and 6 zzso These results strongly suggest a significant zzso zzso zzso but modest zzso effect of zzso in zzso cerebral zzso Further investigations should be performed to determine if zzso or its zzso are of clinical zzso
