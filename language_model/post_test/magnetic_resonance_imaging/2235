With increasing frequency, zzso zzso of the zzso arteries are recognized as a possible cause of zzso zzso zzso In the presence of a zzso aneurysm, zzso changes may be subtle at presentation and correct diagnosis often requires serial zzso We report a patient with a zzso aneurysm of the anterior cerebral artery zzso causing zzso in whom less invasive diagnostic tools, such as high-resolution computerized zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso were helpful in confirming the diagnosis and in following the evolution of the zzso 

We present this zzso old woman who experienced the sudden onset of severe headache without associated neurological zzso Head CT showed zzso with blood in the zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso failed to demonstrate an zzso zzso but showed evolving irregularities of the zzso consistent with a zzso zzso These findings were confirmed by zzso and zzso The patient was treated conservatively and made an excellent zzso A zzso obtained 2 months later showed slight improvement of the previously zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso are often required to confirm the diagnosis and to follow the evolution of an zzso zzso With recent advances in zzso techniques, however, critical information can be obtained by less invasive imaging studies, such as zzso and zzso
