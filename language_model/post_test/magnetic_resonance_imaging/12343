Older adults commonly report disturbed sleep, and recent studies in humans and animals suggest links between sleep and zzso disease zzso Studies are needed that evaluate whether sleep variables are associated with zzso evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the association between zzso sleep variables and zzso deposition in zzso older zzso 

zzso study of 70 adults zzso age, 76 zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the Baltimore zzso Study of Aging, a zzso aging zzso zzso zzso sleep zzso MAIN zzso AND zzso zzso burden, measured by carbon zzso Pittsburgh compound B zzso zzso zzso distribution volume ratios zzso 

After adjustment for potential zzso reports of shorter sleep duration were associated with greater zzso burden, measured by mean cortical zzso (B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso (B zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Reports of lower sleep quality were associated with greater zzso burden measured by zzso zzso (B zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Among zzso older adults, reports of shorter sleep duration and poorer sleep quality are associated with greater zzso zzso Additional studies with objective sleep measures are needed to determine whether sleep zzso causes or zzso zzso zzso
