The aim of this study was to assess the ability of zzso determined zzso volumes and bone zzso zzso to predict zzso in bone zzso after 1 year in patients with different types of inflammatory joint zzso zzso patients underwent zzso laboratory and clinical examination at baseline and 1 year zzso zzso resonance imaging of the wrist and finger zzso was performed in 22 patients with zzso arthritis less than 3 years zzso 1) who fulfilled the American College of zzso zzso criteria for zzso arthritis, 18 patients with zzso arthritis or zzso arthritis zzso zzso 22 patients with more than 3 years duration of zzso arthritis, who fulfilled the zzso criteria for zzso arthritis zzso zzso and 20 patients with zzso zzso zzso The volume of the zzso membrane was outlined manually before and after zzso injection on the zzso sequences in the finger zzso Bones with zzso zzso were summed up in the wrist and fingers on zzso inversion recovery zzso These zzso features was compared with the number of bone zzso 1 year zzso The MR images were scored independently under masked zzso The zzso volumes in the finger zzso assessed on zzso images was highly zzso of bone zzso 1 year later in patients with zzso arthritis zzso 1 and zzso The strongest individual predictor of bone zzso at zzso follow-up was bone zzso zzso if present at the wrist at zzso Bone zzso on baseline zzso were in few cases zzso at follow-up zzso The total zzso volume in the finger zzso and the presence of bone zzso in the wrist bones, seems to be zzso for the number of bone zzso 1 year later and may be used in zzso The importance of very early bone changes on zzso and the importance of the zzso of these findings remain to be zzso
