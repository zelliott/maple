zzso agents are widely used with magnetic resonance imaging zzso to increase the contrast between regions of interest and the background zzso thus providing better quality zzso Such agents can work in one of two ways, either to specifically enhance the signal that is produced or to zzso in a specific cell type of zzso zzso used image contrast agents are typically based on zzso complexes or zzso iron oxide, the latter of which is used for imaging zzso zzso When zzso barrier zzso breakdown is a feature of central nervous system zzso pathology, zzso administered contrast agent enters into the zzso and alters contrast on MR zzso However, zzso breakdown reflects downstream or zzso zzso The initial recruitment of zzso to sites of disease such as multiple sclerosis zzso zzso zzso or zzso takes place across an intact, but zzso brain zzso zzso imaging zzso the ability to obtain a zzso zzso to reveal the presence of brain pathology in the absence of significant structural zzso We have developed smart contrast agents that target and zzso adhere to sites of disease and have been used to reveal activated brain zzso when images obtained by conventional zzso look zzso Indeed, our selectively targeted zzso of iron oxide have revealed the early presence of cerebral malaria pathology and ongoing zzso plaques in clinically relevant models of zzso
