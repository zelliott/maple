zzso zzso zzso is associated with a distributed pattern of zzso in the spinal zzso and the brain secondary to selective zzso zzso We used functional MR Imaging zzso to explore brain zzso in zzso patients during two zzso tasks of different complexity, zzso continuous hand tapping and writing of zzso figure, with the right dominant hand and without visual zzso zzso zzso patients and two groups of zzso healthy controls were zzso Task execution was monitored and recorded using zzso zzso Hand tapping was correctly performed by 11 zzso patients and writing of the zzso by 7 zzso zzso After correction for behavioral zzso zzso patients showed in both tasks areas of significantly lower zzso in the left primary zzso zzso and right zzso Also left zzso and right zzso prefrontal zzso showed zzso during hand zzso During writing of the zzso task zzso patients showed areas of higher zzso in the right zzso and zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of right zzso cortex, anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso during writing of the zzso increased with severity of the neurological zzso In conclusion zzso demonstrates in zzso a mixed pattern constituted by areas of decreased zzso and areas of increased zzso The decreased zzso in the primary motor zzso and zzso presumably reflects a regional zzso damage, the decreased zzso of the left zzso and primary sensory zzso could be secondary to zzso phenomena, and the increased zzso of right zzso zzso and zzso might have a possible zzso zzso
