Clinical signs of acute peripheral zzso zzso were repeatedly reported with zzso zzso The clinical relevance of such a mechanism is not known, as most studies were biased by patients with additional clinical signs zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso auditory evoked zzso zzso and DC zzso zzso were tested in 232 consecutive patients with clinical signs of unilateral zzso 

Forty five of the 232 patients zzso had at least one zzso zzso suggesting zzso dysfunction mainly due to possible zzso zzso zzso zzso and multiple sclerosis zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were seen in 24 patients, and zzso abnormalities of zzso and following eye movements occurred in 22 zzso Three patients had zzso zzso and one had delayed zzso waves IV and zzso Clinical improvement was almost always (32 of 34 zzso zzso associated with improvement or zzso of at least one zzso zzso Brain zzso was done in 25 of the 44 patients and confirmed zzso zzso in six zzso zzso three zzso one zzso 

zzso dysfunction was suggested in 45 of 232 consecutive patients with clinical signs of zzso on the basis of abnormal zzso findings, and was mainly attributed to zzso zzso and multiple zzso The frequency of zzso zzso mimicking zzso is underestimated if based on zzso established zzso zzso
