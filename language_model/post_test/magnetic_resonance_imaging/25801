Eye tracking and brain zzso assessed by magnetic resonance imaging were examined in 48 patients in their first episode of schizophrenia and in 15 normal zzso zzso patients showed higher rates of eye tracking dysfunction and more abnormal brain zzso involving the lateral zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso structures and the zzso zzso than zzso Enlargement of the lateral zzso and global rating of abnormal brain zzso were significantly more prevalent in male zzso than female zzso These findings indicate that abnormalities in a variety of brain regions are present in some zzso during the period shortly after the first hospitalization and could not be a function of treatment or chronic zzso We found no relation between abnormal eye tracking and any single feature of abnormal brain zzso However, normal eye tracking was significantly associated with zzso abnormalities in zzso reflecting an inverse association between quality of eye tracking and degree of zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that abnormal eye tracking is not zzso by the same processes that lead to structural brain anomalies in zzso
