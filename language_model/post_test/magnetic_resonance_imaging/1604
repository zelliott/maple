The goal of the current study was to analyze the zzso results and wound complications in patients with soft tissue zzso treated with zzso radiation therapy and en bloc zzso A standard protocol of zzso zzso was administered followed by en bloc zzso in 209 zzso The protocol included needle or zzso zzso prospective staging, a consistent dose of zzso standardized prospective evaluation of surgical margins, and long-term zzso The target zzso dose was zzso zzso zzso patients had zzso zzso and 180 had high-grade zzso The mean followup was 55 zzso The significant wound complication rate was zzso zzso zzso major zzso and zzso zzso zzso complications were significantly higher in patients with lower zzso zzso when compared with patients with upper zzso or zzso zzso and in patients with zzso larger than 5 zzso The local recurrence rate was zzso in patients who did not have prior surgery, and 37% in patients who had prior surgery at an outside institution zzso zzso Local recurrence was increased significantly in patients who had prior zzso At latest zzso 78 patients zzso were continuously zzso six zzso were alive with no evidence of disease, nine zzso were alive with disease, 63 zzso died of disease, and 11 zzso died of another zzso The zzso and zzso zzso survival rates were zzso and zzso zzso zzso survival was zzso A significant decrease in survival was seen in patients who had a local zzso and in patients with high-grade zzso zzso zzso can be given safely with a wound complication rate not significantly higher than that reported for other forms of zzso zzso Local recurrence tends to be higher if surgical intervention is done before zzso center zzso Distant disease continues to be the cause of the high mortality in these zzso
