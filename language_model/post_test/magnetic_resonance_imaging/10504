Few studies have assessed long-term prognosis and risk factors for death after spontaneous zzso zzso zzso Patients who survive the acute phase may run different zzso depending on their zzso treatment, and zzso The present study was performed to find out the zzso for long-term mortality after zzso 

We assessed zzso prognosis in a zzso cohort of patients who had survived the first 3 months after zzso zzso zzso zzso living in the same geographical area were randomly drawn from the population register and followed up for the same zzso 

zzso mortality was significantly higher in zzso patients than in controls zzso and zzso zzso zzso The annual risk for death in zzso patients was zzso and the annual risk for fatal zzso zzso was zzso The zzso patients with good recovery at 3 months showed similar risk for death as zzso zzso zzso and pneumonia were the most common causes of death in zzso zzso zzso smoking, age, and diabetes seemed to increase the risk for death in patients and zzso 

zzso of zzso run a higher long-term risk for death than zzso and zzso zzso However, those who show good recovery at 3 months run a similar outcome as zzso
