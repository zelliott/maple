Current clinical zzso He lung ventilation MR imaging protocols rely on the patient's ability to control inhalation and exhalation and hold their breath on zzso This is zzso for intensive care unit patients under ventilation or for pediatric populations under the age of 3 to 4 zzso To address this problem, we propose a zzso protocol for zzso He lung ventilation spiral zzso This approach was evaluated in zzso and on zzso 

The protocol was implemented on a clinical zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso images were acquired using a spiral zzso in zzso on a lung phantom and in zzso on zzso the animal breathing freely from a gas zzso Dynamic spiral ventilation images were reconstructed using retrospective zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso signal dynamics was modeled taking account of gas inflow and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso ventilation images acquired in spontaneously breathing rabbits were reconstructed with a zzso resolution of 50 zzso Gas volume variations and zzso maps were zzso The zzso model was validated in zzso and in zzso with various gas zzso zzso parameters zzso residual capacity, tidal volume, and zzso zzso were extracted from the MR signal zzso 

zzso imaging can be performed at tidal volume using a simple experimental zzso without any ventilation device or zzso zzso Acquisition time, zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso using the developed zzso zzso zzso ventilation images can be obtained without artifacts related to motion or gas zzso Lastly, zzso maps can be derived from the zzso ventilation images and zzso parameters extracted from the global signal zzso
