zzso zzso zzso zzso have been widely used in many zzso fields, due to their characteristic large zzso shifts, narrow zzso bands, deep tissue penetration and minimal background zzso zzso zzso materials that integrate the merits of zzso and other functional entities have also attracted extensive zzso Here in this paper we present a zzso structured zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in the fields of zzso therapy zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso (10 zzso in zzso were prepared via sequential zzso and zzso zzso was coated as shell layer, in which zzso zzso zzso and silicon zzso zzso was zzso zzso The zzso shell improved the zzso of zzso zzso molecules in zzso zzso and the zzso linkage zzso anchored the zzso molecules in the zzso zzso Under zzso at zzso zzso the zzso zzso gave zzso bands at 550 zzso and zzso zzso One zzso peak could be used for zzso imaging and the other was suitable for the zzso of zzso to generate zzso oxygen for killing cancer zzso The zzso performance was investigated using a zzso oxygen zzso and was investigated in zzso in zzso cells using a fluorescent zzso Meanwhile, the zzso displayed low dark zzso and zzso zzso image in zzso zzso Further, benefiting from the zzso zzso zzso in the core, the zzso could be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging zzso Compared with the clinical commercial contrast agent zzso the zzso zzso showed a comparable zzso zzso value zzso and similar imaging zzso
