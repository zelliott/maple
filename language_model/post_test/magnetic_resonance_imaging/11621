We describe an unusual zzso that represents an uncommon but important element in the differential diagnosis of subcutaneous scalp zzso in a zzso 

A zzso boy presented with two clusters of subcutaneous scalp zzso The zzso increased in size and zzso zzso zzso showed no changes in underlying zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging were zzso zzso and clinical evaluation showed no evidence of rheumatic zzso Complete zzso of the zzso together with adjacent zzso and zzso was zzso zzso examination showed the zzso to be zzso zzso given the absence of rheumatic disease, these represented deep zzso zzso a benign zzso No recurrence has been observed in our zzso 

While we chose total zzso because of zzso concerns about a possible zzso zzso some other authors have suggested that surgery be limited to zzso biopsy when a benign zzso such as zzso zzso is strongly zzso
