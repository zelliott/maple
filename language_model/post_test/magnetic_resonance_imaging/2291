Previous zzso studies have suggested that patients with schizophrenia fail to recruit appropriate focal patterns of cortical responses to cognitive zzso We investigated whether patients with schizophrenia show a normal focal response to a simple motor zzso Seven strongly right-handed patients with schizophrenia and seven strongly right-handed normal subjects performed motor tasks of increasing zzso Patients were unable to recruit as focal a response even to a simple, automatic sequential finger movement zzso They showed greater zzso zzso in the primary zzso and lateral zzso regions and had a significantly lower zzso zzso than normal zzso These phenomena increased with the complexity of the zzso These results demonstrate a functional zzso in the cortical motor zzso of patients with zzso
