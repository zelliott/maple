this study aimed to correlate magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso with pain response at provocative zzso in patients with low back zzso 

zzso patients who underwent MR imaging of the zzso spine and subsequent provocation zzso as part of a clinical evaluation of low back pain were enrolled in the zzso MR images were then evaluated for disc zzso high-intensity zone zzso and zzso zzso In the procedure of zzso zzso pain was zzso as positive, whereas zzso pain and no pain were zzso as zzso Finally, MR and zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso test based on results of zzso zzso 

zzso was conducted on 256 discs zzso 116 discs of which presented with zzso pain, and the others presented with zzso zzso There were 141 discs we reevaluated as Grade zzso on MR images, 17 of which presented with zzso zzso 115 were evaluated as Grade zzso 99 of which presented with zzso zzso zzso was found in 60 zzso of which had zzso zzso The zzso abnormalities we zzso in 58 discs, 51 of which zzso zzso zzso zzso pain was zzso correlated with Type zzso discs on zzso zzso zzso zzso Grade zzso disc zzso on MR image zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities zzso zzso zzso 

disc zzso grades on MR imaging zzso association with zzso zzso Type zzso discs on zzso Grade zzso disc on MR images, the presence of zzso zzso abnormalities might indicate zzso pain zzso with chronic low back zzso
