During surgical removal of a zzso zzso correct identification of the facial nerve is necessary for its preservation and continuing zzso We zzso analyzed the spatial relationship between zzso zzso and the facial nerve using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso 

Twenty-two patients with a unilateral zzso zzso were examined with MR zzso The position and spatial relationship of the facial nerve to adjacent tumor within the internal auditory canal zzso and zzso angle zzso zzso were assessed on zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso images and on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The entrance of the nerve into the zzso canal at the zzso zzso and the nerve root exit zone along the brain stem were used as landmarks to follow the nerve course zzso and zzso on all zzso 

The spatial relationship between zzso zzso and facial nerve could not be detected on zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso of the patients, the position of the nerve in relation to the tumor was discernible on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In tumors with a zzso diameter up to 10 zzso the entire nerve course was zzso in tumors with a diameter of 11 to 24 zzso only segments of the facial nerve were zzso and in tumors larger than 25 zzso the facial nerve could not be seen, zzso to focal nerve thinning and obliteration of landmarks within the zzso and zzso 

Identification of the facial nerve and its position relative to an adjacent zzso zzso is possible on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images but not on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this spatial relationship depends on the zzso size and zzso
