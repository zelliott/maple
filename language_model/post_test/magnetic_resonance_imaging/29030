Early determination that breast cancer is bilateral and zzso can change therapy strategy and, zzso mortality and morbidity zzso The authors present a case with zzso zzso breast cancer detected only by zzso zzso zzso 

Early and delayed zzso zzso imaging and dynamic zzso were performed in a patient with a zzso zzso shown on zzso 

Although early zzso zzso imaging detected bilateral breast cancer zzso both dynamic zzso and zzso missed the zzso in the left zzso Additional zzso seen on delayed zzso zzso images of the left breast, which were initially thought to be benign, completely disappeared after zzso chemotherapy and zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso in the left zzso 

This case suggests that zzso zzso may be useful for detecting bilateral cancer, and delayed imaging may give additional information regarding the possible zzso nature of the zzso
