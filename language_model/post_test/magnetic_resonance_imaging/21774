The zzso zzso cortex, and zzso were measured on zzso magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether patients with early Alzheimer's disease had significantly more zzso than healthy zzso To determine whether the zzso is limited to certain cortical regions, the zzso zzso was measured because this area is not usually zzso involved early in Alzheimer's zzso Eight mildly to moderately impaired patients who met National Institute of Neurological Disorders and zzso Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease and eight controls who matched for age, zzso and educational level were zzso zzso was zzso in the following zzso zzso zzso cortex, insular cortex, and zzso zzso The authors found significantly more zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the Alzheimer's zzso zzso of the zzso zzso did not differ between the zzso There were no significant zzso differences in any of the regions zzso Their findings show that mildly to moderately impaired Alzheimer's patients have significantly more zzso of the zzso zzso cortex, and zzso than healthy zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso is probably discrete because the groups did not differ on measures of the zzso zzso Selective zzso of the zzso and insular zzso has not previously been reported using the zzso methodology on zzso magnetic resonance zzso Their data suggest that the zzso may be involved early in Alzheimer's disease and that zzso of the insular zzso may contribute to the cognitive deficits typical of early Alzheimer's zzso
