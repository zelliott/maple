This paper presents the views of a coordination chemist on the synthesis and the properties of new contrast agents containing zzso Attention is drawn to various zzso complexes such as the zzso zzso zzso the zzso as well as compounds obtained by template zzso The structural factors influencing the kinetic and zzso stability of the zzso complexes are discussed with special emphasis on the zzso zzso zzso Some of the zzso complexes under investigation are more stable than zzso
