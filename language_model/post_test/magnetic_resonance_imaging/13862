zzso zzso zzso function and deficits on zzso tasks have been separately reported in antisocial zzso We investigated whether these zzso are independent or associated factors underlying zzso in aggressive personality zzso zzso offenders and healthy controls and whether there are associated changes in quantitative brain zzso 

This study reports on the findings from a sample of 51 zzso offenders and 24 controls, recruited from maximum security psychiatric hospitals, who were characterized using the Special Hospital Assessment of Personality and zzso zzso zzso underwent assessment of zzso function zzso response to zzso zzso zzso testing and had a diagnostic zzso zzso Of this sample 19 controls and 24 patients also had quantitative measurement of frontal and zzso lobe volumes on magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso zzso aggressive zzso had enhanced zzso function compared with controls and highly impulsive aggressive zzso zzso and secondary zzso had poorer zzso but not zzso zzso function than controls and zzso There were no significant group differences in frontal or zzso lobe brain zzso Although zzso and aggression are correlated zzso zzso appeared to be related to both executive function and zzso function, while aggression only correlated zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not directly correlate with frontal or zzso volume or zzso 

zzso appears to be contributed to by both impaired zzso function and zzso zzso zzso zzso function alone makes a contribution to zzso Treatment needs to take account of the zzso and zzso deficits in this challenging zzso
