zzso disorders zzso such as pain, joint sounds, and impaired movement are common, and magnetic resonance imaging zzso is now the method of choice for diagnostic zzso 

To describe MR criteria chosen and the amount of zzso joint zzso pathology registered when examining MR images from patients referred to a university hospital for imaging of their zzso

zzso MR criteria that allow for comparative assessment are zzso According to these criteria, a large proportion of the patients referred for MR examination showed zzso changes indicating zzso zzso
