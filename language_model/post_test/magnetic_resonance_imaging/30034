There is growing interest in the nature of slow variations of the blood oxygen zzso zzso signal observed in functional zzso zzso zzso In humans, these slow zzso variations are thought to reflect an underlying or intrinsic form of brain functional connectivity in discrete zzso zzso While these zzso zzso may be relatively enduring phenomena, other evidence suggest that dynamic changes in their functional connectivity may also emerge depending on the brain state of subjects during zzso 

In this study, we examined healthy subjects zzso zzso 24) with a mood induction paradigm during two continuous zzso recordings to assess the effects of a change in zzso mood state zzso to zzso on the functional connectivity of these zzso networks zzso zzso zzso Using independent component analysis, we identified five networks that were common to both experimental states, each showing dominant signal fluctuations in the very low frequency domain zzso zzso zzso Between the two states, we observed apparent increases and decreases in the overall functional connectivity of these zzso zzso findings included increased connectivity strength of a zzso network involving the zzso anterior zzso and anterior zzso zzso with subjects' increasing sadness and decreased functional connectivity of the zzso mode zzso 

These findings support recent studies that suggest the functional connectivity of certain zzso networks may, in part, reflect a dynamic image of the current brain zzso In our study, this was linked to changes in zzso zzso
