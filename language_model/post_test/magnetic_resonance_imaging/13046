zzso in the zzso and function of two gray matter structures central to emotional processing, the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and amygdala, have consistently been reported in bipolar disorder zzso Evidence implicates abnormalities in their connectivity in zzso This study investigates the potential disruptions in zzso functional connectivity and associated abnormalities in white matter that provides structural connections between the two brain regions in zzso 

zzso individuals with BD and 31 healthy comparison subjects zzso participated in a scanning session during which functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during processing of face stimuli and diffusion zzso imaging zzso were zzso The strength of zzso functional connections was compared between BD and HC groups, and associations between these functional connectivity measures from the zzso scans and regional fractional zzso zzso from the zzso scans were zzso 

zzso connectivity was decreased between the zzso and zzso in the BD group compared with HC group, during the processing of fearful and happy faces zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a significant positive association between zzso functional zzso and zzso in zzso white matter, including the region of the zzso zzso was identified zzso zzso zzso 

This study provides evidence for abnormalities in zzso functional connectivity during emotional processing in zzso The significant association between zzso functional connectivity and the structural integrity of white matter that contains zzso connections suggest that disruptions in white matter connectivity may contribute to disturbances in the coordinated responses of the zzso and zzso during emotional processing in zzso
