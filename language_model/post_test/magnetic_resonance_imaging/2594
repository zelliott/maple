The zzso of zzso zzso zzso is still zzso We investigated the relationship between zzso and risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases, especially zzso carotid artery zzso zzso 

We studied zzso and zzso in 323 subjects between 1991 and zzso Using zzso zzso scan images, we measured zzso zzso at eight points and evaluated cerebral zzso Duplex carotid zzso was performed on the carotid arteries zzso and used to divide the severity of zzso into five zzso zzso factors for cerebrovascular diseases and zzso complications were assessed from the clinical zzso 

Age was significantly correlated with the size of frontal and whole zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly more severe in subjects with hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and whole zzso were significantly more severe in subjects with a history of cerebrovascular accident zzso zzso zzso Other risk factors and zzso complications were not correlated with zzso There were no significant differences in the severity of zzso among the five groups of zzso The severity of zzso in each region was not related to zzso There was no significant difference in the age of patients in relation to the five grades of zzso However, zzso was significantly more severe in subjects with zzso zzso or zzso of the deep border zone zzso zzso zzso There was no relationship between zzso and cortical zzso or zzso of the cortical border zzso 

zzso correlated with age, hypertension, and past history of cerebrovascular disease but not with zzso zzso was significantly more severe in zzso zzso and zzso of the deep border zzso These results suggest that zzso disease may zzso the zzso and development of zzso
