The outcome of liver zzso depends on complete removal of all zzso zzso Our aim was to determine the value of zzso routine magnetic resonance imaging zzso for complete detection of zzso zzso 

We compared zzso zzso seen on zzso in 182 patients to zzso findings (including zzso zzso and zzso 

The overall rate of zzso was zzso each for segments 2 and 3, as compared to zzso each for segments 5, 6, 7, and zzso zzso additional zzso were found zzso two thirds of them in the left lobe zzso size: zzso zzso mean total number of zzso in those zzso zzso In segments 2 and 3, the relative frequency for zzso diagnosis of additional zzso was zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, most of the 15 zzso zzso not verified zzso or zzso had been described in the right zzso lobe zzso segment zzso 

zzso provided reliable zzso zzso zzso Special attention should be paid to segments 2 and 3, which showed a lower total number of zzso but an elevated relative frequency of zzso detected additional zzso
