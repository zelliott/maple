zzso agents that can diffuse freely into or within tissue have numerous attractive features for zzso zzso Here we present preliminary data illustrating the suitability of zzso zzso labeled zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso alcohol and zzso as a freely zzso contrast agent for magnetic resonance zzso zzso Dynamic zzso images acquired in rat brain with a balanced zzso free zzso sequence following administration of zzso zzso show that this agent can be zzso with 2-4 s zzso resolution, 2 zzso slice zzso and 700 zzso zzso resolution while retaining adequate zzso zzso zzso relaxation zzso on zzso in blood at zzso T yield zzso zzso 46 zzso 4s and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the rat brain at zzso zzso analysis of the zzso dynamics of the balanced zzso free zzso image intensity in tissue and zzso blood indicate that zzso has a zzso of roughly zzso and a zzso of 43 zzso 24 zzso In addition, the images indicate that zzso is freely zzso in brain and hence has a long residence time in zzso this in turn makes it possible to image the agent continuously for tens of zzso These characteristics show that zzso is a promising agent for robust and quantitative zzso imaging in the brain and zzso
