We previously reported that high circulating free testosterone zzso was associated with better performance on tests of memory, executive function, and spatial ability, and with a reduced risk for Alzheimer's zzso In this study, we report that free T levels, measured on multiple occasions over 14 years, predict regional cerebral blood flow zzso measured by PET in 40 older zzso zzso regression, indicated that higher Free T was associated with increased zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso on the zzso anterior zzso zzso and right inferior frontal zzso Total T zzso were positively correlated with zzso in the left zzso bilateral thalamus, and left inferior frontal zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso T influences brain physiology in regions critical for memory and attention and provide one mechanism through which T may affect cognitive zzso
