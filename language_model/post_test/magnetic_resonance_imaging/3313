Previous zzso studies have suggested that zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso arthritis zzso might result from the failure of the zzso system and displacement of the zzso zzso This study aimed to examine the relationship between zzso plate pathology and the zzso arthritis magnetic resonance imaging score zzso of the lesser zzso to zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso using high-resolution 3 T magnetic resonance imaging zzso In 24 patients with zzso the zzso was zzso using 3 T zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso and zzso post zzso sequences were acquired through 96 lesser zzso zzso Images were scored for zzso bone zzso zzso and bone erosion using the zzso system and the zzso plates were assessed for zzso zzso females and 7 males with a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso and disease duration of zzso years zzso zzso took part in the zzso zzso plate pathology was most frequently demonstrated on zzso at the fifth zzso zzso An association was demonstrated between zzso plate pathology and zzso zzso bone zzso zzso and bone erosion at the fourth and fifth zzso zzso In patients with zzso 3 T zzso demonstrates that zzso plate pathology at the lesser zzso zzso is associated with features of disease zzso zzso plate pathology is more common at the fourth and fifth zzso zzso in subjects with zzso in contrast to the zzso for the second zzso reported previously in subjects without zzso
