zzso zzso transplantation zzso is a potential treatment for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Delayed zzso magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage zzso has recently been developed as a sensitive and specific measure of cartilage zzso zzso Under the conditions of zzso zzso is directly related to the zzso zzso Our aim for this study was to demonstrate the potential of zzso to evaluate ACT zzso 

Eleven ACT implants were studied 2 to 24 months zzso by zzso zzso values from three regions of interest were obtained to examine zzso content zzso in the zzso zzso in native cartilage adjacent to the zzso and zzso in native cartilage further removed from the implant (as zzso 

One implant failed and therefore was not zzso Four of the implants were studied between 2 and 6 months zzso and showed low zzso zzso less than zzso of the control native zzso Five of the six implants studied between 12 and 24 months zzso showed zzso zzso comparable to zzso of zzso One zzso graft showed low zzso comparable to the surrounding native cartilage, with normal zzso seen in cartilage far from the graft zzso The zzso index zzso values of the graft zzso to zzso from the group of implants 6 months or less was 59% zzso zzso of control, whereas those at 12 to 24 months were zzso zzso zzso of zzso The two groups were statistically different with a P value of zzso 

The zzso level in zzso that were implanted for less than 12 months appeared to be lower than that in the remote zzso At 12 months or greater, the zzso in this study had zzso levels that were comparable to both the adjacent and remote zzso This preliminary study of ACT implants has shown that it is feasible to apply the zzso technique in patients with ACT as a way to obtain information related to the composition of zzso These results provide motivation and the pilot data with which to design further clinical zzso
