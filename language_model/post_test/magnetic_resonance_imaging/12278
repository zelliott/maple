With the flooding zzso of medical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Imaging zzso implicit modeling techniques are increasingly applied to reconstruct the human zzso especially the zzso However, displaying implicitly represented geometric objects arises heavy zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso Unit zzso accelerating technique was developed for high performance rendering of implicitly represented objects, especially the zzso The experimental results suggested that the rendering performance was greatly enhanced via exploiting the advantages of modern zzso
