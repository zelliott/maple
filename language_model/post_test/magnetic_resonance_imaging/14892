The purpose of this study was to categorize the zzso and kinetic features of enhancing zzso in breasts with zzso zzso using dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging and to assess factors zzso of breast zzso 

We zzso reviewed the clinical and zzso data of 21 enhancing zzso in 19 patients with zzso zzso who underwent breast magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy or an operation in our hospital from September 2008 to July zzso These zzso were sorted by zzso and kinetic features and final assessment category according to the zzso zzso 

Nine cases were confirmed to be zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 2) and invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the remaining 12 cases were zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fat necrosis zzso zzso 1), foreign body zzso zzso zzso 3) and silicone zzso zzso zzso zzso Common features of zzso included irregular shape zzso zzso margins zzso zzso enhancement zzso and type III kinetic pattern zzso The correlations of margins and kinetic curve pattern with zzso and zzso approached statistical significance zzso zzso zzso zzso We found no correlation for shape zzso zzso zzso or internal enhancement zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso The zzso rate of enhancing zzso was zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging were zzso and zzso zzso The positive zzso value, negative zzso value and accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso agreement for the kinetic curve pattern was good zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement was seen in describing the shape, margin, enhancement and assessing the final category zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging had a high sensitivity, negative zzso value for the prediction of breast cancer but a low specificity due to features of foreign zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso The significant zzso factors for zzso were margins, kinetic curve pattern and final assessment zzso zzso zzso agreement for the kinetic curve pattern was zzso
