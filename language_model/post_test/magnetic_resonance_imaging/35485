zzso is considered a zzso gene for schizophrenia and zzso disorder, but little is known regarding the potential mechanisms through which it may zzso increased zzso Given that zzso plays a role in cerebral zzso development, zzso in this gene may have relevance for zzso models of schizophrenia that have implicated cortical deficits in its zzso 

We investigated whether the zzso zzso zzso was associated with prefrontal gray matter volumes using magnetic resonance imaging in a cohort of patients with schizophrenia zzso and healthy volunteers zzso and positive and negative symptoms in 200 patients with zzso 

Among patients and healthy volunteers, zzso carriers zzso had significantly less gray matter in the superior frontal zzso and anterior zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso Further, among patients left superior frontal zzso gray matter volume was significantly zzso correlated with severity of zzso In addition, patients who were zzso carriers zzso had significantly greater severity of positive symptoms zzso compared to patients who were zzso zzso zzso 

These findings zzso zzso in variation of prefrontal cortical volume and positive symptoms, thus providing a potential mechanism through which zzso may zzso increased risk for schizophrenia or zzso zzso
