Our objective was to determine the long-term survival of patients with zzso zzso multiple pulmonary zzso zzso 

This is a zzso retrospective study of patients who underwent surgical zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell lung zzso 

Between March 1996 and December 2009, 67 patients (30 zzso underwent 121 zzso zzso patients had bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were performed in 58 zzso patients, zzso zzso scans and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in 53 zzso and zzso in 56 zzso zzso zzso zzso were benign in all patients before undergoing zzso of bilateral tumors of the same zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso in 62, zzso in 73, and zzso in zzso Eleven patients zzso had zzso zzso zzso 3- and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, and overall 3- and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated no difference in overall survival at 5 years between bilateral tumors of the same zzso type zzso zzso versus different zzso types zzso zzso zzso zzso or between bilateral tumors zzso and zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso survival of surgically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lung cancer is excellent, even in patients who have bilateral lung zzso that harbor the same zzso zzso Although the new zzso zzso system labels this disease as clinical stage IV zzso survival acts more like a separate zzso zzso after surgical zzso Thus, surgical zzso should be considered in appropriately selected patients who have multiple pulmonary zzso tumors that are zzso zzso
