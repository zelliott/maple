Brain network modeling is probably the biggest challenge in zzso data zzso Higher cognitive processes in fact, rely on complex dynamics of temporally and zzso zzso brain zzso A number of different techniques, mostly derived from zzso zzso methods, have been successfully applied for such zzso This paper instead, presents a new zzso analysis approach that applies both independent components analysis zzso and the zzso causality zzso The method includes two steps: zzso zzso is used to extract the independent functional activities; zzso the zzso is applied to the independent component zzso most correlated with the zzso to indicate its functional relation with other zzso This new method is applied to the analysis of zzso study of listening to zzso zzso words, zzso and reversed zzso As expected, activity was found in the primary and secondary auditory zzso Additionally, a zzso network of zzso supported by zzso and causality zzso was zzso This network is modulated by experimental conditions in agreement with the most recent models presented for word zzso The results have confirmed the zzso of the proposed method, and seem promising for the detection of cognitive zzso relationships in zzso zzso
