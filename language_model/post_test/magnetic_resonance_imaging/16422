It has often been suggested that the role of zzso region in sentence comprehension can be explained with reference to general cognitive mechanisms zzso working memory, cognitive zzso However, the zzso basis for such proposals is often restricted to findings on zzso Here, we argue that an extension of the database to other languages can shed new light on the types of mechanisms that an adequate account of zzso region should be equipped to deal zzso This becomes most readily apparent in the domain of word order variations, which we examined in German zzso sentences using zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso in the zzso zzso core zzso of zzso zzso not only modulated by the relative ordering of subject and object, but also by a further factor known to affect word order in a number of languages, namely zzso zzso the finding provides the first demonstration of a word zzso zzso difference within zzso sentences in this zzso Additional zzso analyses using individual behavioral data as zzso further attest to the independence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sentence zzso and zzso difficulty in performing the experimental zzso zzso We argue that these and related findings attest to the need for a processing mechanism that can manipulate zzso interacting and zzso structured zzso representations during real time zzso These properties pose a challenge to existing accounts of zzso zzso zzso
