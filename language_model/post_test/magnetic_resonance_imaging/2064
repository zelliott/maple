Previous research suggests that depressed individuals engage in prolonged zzso processing of emotional zzso A zzso neural network model of emotional information processing suggests this process involves sustained zzso activity in response to processing negative features of zzso This study examined whether brain activity in response to emotional stimuli was sustained in depressed individuals, even following subsequent distracting zzso 

Seven depressed and 10 zzso individuals were studied using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging during alternating zzso emotional processing zzso zzso and zzso processing zzso zzso zzso zzso regions were traced on high-resolution structural scans and zzso to the functional zzso The time course of activity in these areas during emotional and zzso processing trials was zzso 

During emotional processing trials, zzso individuals displayed zzso responses to all zzso which decayed within 10 zzso In contrast, depressed individuals displayed sustained zzso responses to negative words that lasted throughout the following zzso processing trials zzso zzso zzso The difference in sustained zzso activity to negative and positive words was moderately related to zzso zzso 

zzso suggest that depression is associated with sustained activity in brain areas responsible for coding emotional zzso
