zzso zzso formation has the potential for acute respiratory compromise from obstruction or zzso from zzso The initial attempt to secure the airway is of paramount zzso We describe a patient with an unstable cervical spine secondary to zzso disease who developed progressively zzso zzso cold zzso 

A zzso man with an unstable zzso in halo traction presented with progressive airway obstruction secondary to zzso zzso extending from the cervical to the zzso zzso After review of computerized zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso studies, preparations were made to secure the airway through zzso assisted zzso A conservative approach was chosen to secure the airway before surgical airway control as a first line zzso Following local and topical zzso awake zzso was performed to assess the extent of obstruction and possibility of zzso without zzso zzso A narrow tract along the lateral zzso was identified to continue zzso to the zzso from which point the cords were zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation otherwise distorted the normal anatomy and prevented zzso from other zzso The airway was successfully secured without trauma with a zzso zzso zzso ID zzso zzso 

This report suggests that selected cases of tense zzso zzso zzso can be effectively managed with zzso zzso for assessment and subsequent zzso before requiring surgical airway control as a first line zzso
