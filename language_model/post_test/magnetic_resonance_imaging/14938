zzso zzso Imaging zzso using contrast agents is a very powerful technique for diagnosis in clinical medicine and biomedical zzso The synthesis of zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso and acting as new zzso contrast agents seems to be a promising way for cancer zzso Indeed, it is well established that zzso zzso plays a key role in tumor zzso acting like a zzso for the zzso zzso proteins like zzso zzso through the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been found to be associated with a wide range of zzso making it a zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso were zzso and surface zzso with zzso zzso The large number of the zzso acid functions at the outer surface of the zzso was used for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso acid with the zzso group of the zzso We examined the design of the zzso with each individual entity and then the combination of two and three of zzso Several methods were used to characterize the zzso surface zzso and the magnetic properties of these contrast agents were studied using a zzso T clinical zzso zzso The affinity towards zzso was evidenced by surface zzso resonance and zzso zzso zzso
