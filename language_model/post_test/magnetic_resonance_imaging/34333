zzso zzso was reevaluated after completion of zzso treatment at a mean age of zzso zzso zzso zzso in 35 young adults with zzso zzso zzso zzso The patients were subdivided into 4 groups according to their first zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings: group I, 11 patients with isolated zzso zzso and normal zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso group II, 7 patients with zzso and small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso group zzso group III, 13 patients (5 with zzso and 8 with multiple zzso hormone zzso with zzso zzso abnormalities such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso group I and P zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso stalk zzso and zzso zzso zzso and group IV, 4 patients with multiple zzso hormone zzso secondary to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso status were reevaluated after zzso withdrawal using zzso insulin zzso and sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor I zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined at the time of zzso and 6, 12, and 24 months after zzso of treatment in the patients with permanent zzso and after 6 months in those with normal zzso responses to zzso The patients in groups I and II showed a normal response to stimulation after completion of zzso treatment regardless of zzso size, whereas all patients in groups III and IV still had a zzso response of less than 3 zzso to any of the zzso zzso volume zzso in 6 of 7 patients in group II, whereas in all patients in group III zzso studies confirmed the initial zzso Mean zzso and zzso zzso at the time of zzso were significantly higher in groups I and II than in groups III and zzso In patients of groups III and IV, mean zzso was significantly decreased after 6 and 12 months, whereas zzso was significantly decreased 12 months after treatment zzso Our results confirm that a high proportion of children with zzso and normal or small zzso show zzso of zzso zzso at the completion of zzso treatment, whereas zzso is permanent in all patients with zzso zzso zzso stalk zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso shortly after zzso withdrawal had limited value in the diagnosis of zzso of childhood onset associated with zzso zzso zzso but became accurate after zzso zzso We suggest that patients with zzso and zzso zzso abnormalities do not require further investigation of zzso zzso whereas patients with zzso and normal or small zzso zzso should be zzso well before the zzso of adult zzso
