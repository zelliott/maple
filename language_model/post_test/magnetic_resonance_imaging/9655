The aim of this study was to investigate whether cognitively preserved zzso or zzso zzso of persons with zzso disease zzso exhibit increased brain zzso zzso 

We performed a zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso compound B zzso PET study on 9 zzso and 8 zzso twin pairs zzso for cognitive impairment as well as on 9 healthy elderly control zzso zzso zzso was analyzed with zzso zzso zzso and with region of interest analysis with the zzso ratio as a measure of zzso zzso 

zzso preserved zzso zzso of cognitively impaired zzso had increased cortical zzso zzso zzso of control zzso in their zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso preserved zzso subjects did not differ from the zzso Further, the cognitively preserved zzso subjects showed similar zzso zzso patterns as their cognitively impaired zzso The cognitively impaired subjects zzso and zzso individuals zzso showed typical zzso patterns of zzso zzso 

zzso factors appear to influence the development of zzso zzso plaque zzso The zzso between cognitive impairment and brain zzso in zzso twins implies that there may be important zzso factors that zzso the relationship between brain zzso and zzso zzso may be zzso in high-risk individuals in its zzso stage with zzso zzso but clinical follow-up will be needed to confirm zzso
