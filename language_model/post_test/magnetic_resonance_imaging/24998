A generally zzso zzso fusion method was evaluated using molecular imaging and zzso zzso data sets from 15 brain tumor patients with zzso frames attached to their zzso Point pairs, placed on the frame only, were zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated to map zzso from one coordinate space to the zzso The zzso frame was considered the reference structure and the standard for zzso zzso An zzso test zzso zzso zzso confirmed the point pair choice to be zzso The zzso confidence zzso for the zzso showed the measured distance difference between the registered volumes was within one zzso zzso A further experiment was conducted to independently evaluate the brain registration based on testing for consistency of randomly selected zzso zzso A zzso result zzso zzso zzso showed that the consistency zzso both interior or both zzso before and after volume registration were significantly zzso This fusion method may be a viable alternative when other methods zzso
