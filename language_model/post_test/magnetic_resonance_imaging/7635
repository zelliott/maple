zzso zzso can zzso blood brain barrier zzso dysfunction in zzso injury, however, its role in zzso brain zzso remains zzso This study assessed the zzso effects induced by treadmill zzso particularly on brain zzso in transient middle cerebral artery zzso zzso 

zzso middle cerebral artery zzso to induce stroke was performed on rats after 2 weeks of treadmill zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to evaluate the dynamic impairment of cerebral zzso after zzso zzso In addition, zzso of wet and dry brain weight, Evans Blue zzso and Garcia scores were performed to investigate the cerebral water content, zzso zzso and zzso deficit, zzso Moreover, during zzso injury, the expression of zzso 4 zzso was detected using zzso and Western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso improved the relative apparent diffusion zzso zzso loss in the zzso zzso and zzso at 1 hour and zzso hours after cerebral zzso In the treadmill zzso group, zzso values of the zzso zzso and zzso increased less at zzso hours, 1 day, and 2 days after stroke while the brain water content decreased at 2 days after zzso Regarding the zzso zzso the zzso amount of contrast agent leakage of treadmill zzso group significantly zzso Less Evans Blue zzso was also observed in treadmill zzso group at 2 days after zzso In addition, treadmill zzso zzso the Garcia score deficits at 2 days after zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso results showed a significant decrease in the expression of zzso after treadmill zzso following zzso 

zzso zzso may reduce cerebral zzso and zzso dysfunction during cerebral zzso injury via the zzso of zzso
