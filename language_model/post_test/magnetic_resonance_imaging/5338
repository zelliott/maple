In zzso zzso the risk to develop zzso disorder is 3 to zzso higher than in term zzso Moreover, zzso infants exhibit deficits in motor coordination and zzso Based on clinical data, higher oxygen levels in zzso infants lead to worse neurological outcome, and experimental zzso causes wide-ranging cerebral changes in zzso zzso We zzso that zzso in the immature brain may affect motor activity in zzso zzso We subjected newborn mice from zzso to zzso to 48 h of zzso zzso zzso and tested motor activity in running wheels starting at adolescent age zzso zzso from zzso to zzso regular wheels were replaced by complex wheels with variable crossbar positions to assess motor coordination zzso zzso with diffusion zzso imaging was performed in the corpus zzso to determine white matter zzso in mice after zzso at ages zzso and zzso in comparison to control zzso Adolescent mice after zzso zzso revealed significantly higher values for maximum zzso and mean zzso in regular wheels than controls zzso In the complex running wheels, however, maximum zzso was decreased in animals after zzso as compared to controls zzso zzso fractional zzso and increased zzso diffusion zzso were observed in the corpus zzso of zzso and zzso mice after zzso zzso compared to control zzso zzso in the immature brain causes hyperactivity, motor coordination deficits, and impaired white matter zzso in adolescent and young adult zzso
