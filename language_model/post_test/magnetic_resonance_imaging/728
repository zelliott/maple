zzso zzso zzso the same pitch from tones with differing spectral shapes, requires one to extract the fundamental frequency from two sets of zzso and compare zzso We previously showed this difficult task to be easier when tonal context is present, presumably because the context creates a tonal reference point from which to judge the test zzso The present study assessed the role of the right auditory zzso in using tonal context for pitch zzso zzso patients with focal brain zzso of the right or left anterior zzso lobe zzso zzso and 12 matched control participants zzso made pitch zzso on complex tones that could differ in fundamental frequency and/or spectral zzso This task was performed in isolation and within a melodic zzso The zzso group showed zzso both on trials in which extraction of pitch from differing spectral shapes was required zzso zzso and when this was not required zzso zzso All groups performed poorly in the isolated condition, but improved with melodic zzso Degree of improvement varied in that the zzso group performed zzso whereas the zzso group was not able to obtain the same amount of zzso from the melodic zzso In particular, melodic context did not facilitate the zzso group's performance on zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso did not affect these results, suggesting that the zzso were due to the removal of the anterior zzso zzso The results of this study therefore zzso right anterior auditory cortical areas in making pitch zzso relative to tones that were heard zzso We propose that auditory association areas located on the anterior portion of the superior zzso zzso an area with connections to frontal regions implicated in working memory, could be involved in holding and zzso tonal zzso
