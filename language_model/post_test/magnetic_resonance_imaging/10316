To investigate the influence of deep white matter zzso zzso and zzso white matter zzso zzso on progression of cognitive decline in zzso elderly zzso 

All data come from the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Study of zzso in the zzso at zzso zzso We performed a 3 year follow up study on zzso subjects of the zzso study using both repeated magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive zzso zzso decline and its dependency on zzso severity was assessed using linear zzso models adjusted for sex, age, education, treatment group, and test version when zzso 

We found that the volume of zzso at baseline was zzso associated with reduced mental processing speed zzso zzso zzso In addition, we found that the progression in zzso volume paralleled the decline in mental processing speed zzso zzso zzso In contrast, neither presence nor progression of zzso was associated with change in performance on any of the cognitive zzso 

zzso should not be considered benign but probably zzso impairment in cognitive processing zzso
