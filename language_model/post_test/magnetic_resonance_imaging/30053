To understand the fates of human zzso stem cells zzso following transplantation into a zzso model of middle cerebral artery zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques were zzso zzso were labeled with zzso zzso zzso complexes, which were zzso and examined by zzso up to 10 weeks following zzso zzso of the transplanted cells to the zzso area was further confirmed by zzso zzso We found that the zzso transplanted in zzso models possess the capacity to migrate to the zzso area extensively in both zzso and zzso injections, exhibiting a zzso We also analyzed the detailed migration patterns of transplanted zzso We speculate that the extensive migratory ability of zzso may represent a therapeutic potential for developing efficient cell transplantation strategies in zzso
