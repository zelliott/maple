Although the brain areas in the zzso network zzso act in a coordinated way during rest, the activity levels in the individual areas of the zzso are highly zzso The relation between the activity levels and the pattern of zzso interaction among the zzso areas remains zzso In the present zzso study, seven zzso of the zzso were identified and their activity levels were zzso based on a power spectral analysis of the resting blood zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the direction of information flow among these zzso zzso was determined using zzso causality analysis and zzso zzso We found that the activity levels in these seven zzso zzso had a highly consistent zzso distribution, with the highest activity level in the zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, and with the lowest level in the left inferior zzso zzso zzso a significant correlation was found between the activity levels and the zzso degrees of information flow across the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso influences can be used to predict zzso activity zzso These findings shed light on the zzso organization of cortical zzso networks and may provide the basis for characterizing network disruption by brain zzso
