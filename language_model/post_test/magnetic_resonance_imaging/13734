The zzso effects of the zzso binding agent, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been investigated in the rat zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso zzso The zzso estimates of absolute zzso blood flow showed a reduction from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 h after 10 zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso after 100 zzso zzso zzso blood flow recovered to control values 24 h after 10 zzso zzso zzso but there was no recovery by 24 h after the higher zzso Dynamic zzso MR images were obtained at zzso zzso following injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso assuming a model zzso input zzso A zzso zzso which is related to blood flow rate and zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso was calculated from the zzso zzso zzso showed a reduction from zzso to zzso zzso 6 h after 10 zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso after 100 zzso zzso Although the magnitude of changes in zzso was smaller than that in zzso blood flow, the time course and zzso patterns were very zzso The apparent zzso zzso volume zzso zzso showed a zzso reduction 6 h after 100 zzso zzso zzso possibly associated with vascular shutdown within large regions of the zzso These results suggest that zzso values for zzso zzso into zzso could be a useful zzso indicator of blood flow changes induced by zzso agents such as zzso
