Dynamic zzso zzso zzso is widely used in the diagnosis and staging of cancer and is emerging as a promising method for monitoring zzso response to zzso However, zzso imaging techniques are still evolving and methods of image analysis remain variable and zzso and range from relative changes in the pattern of enhancement to zzso zzso of contrast agent zzso The combination of results from different institutions is therefore difficult and the sensitivities of different methods have not been zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate correlations between qualitative and quantitative methods of analysis for zzso images from breast cancer patients undergoing zzso zzso Fifteen patients underwent zzso examinations before and after one course of zzso Changes in the zzso pattern of signal enhancement, the rate and zzso of enhancement and the volume transfer constant of contrast agent between the blood plasma and the zzso zzso space zzso zzso and the zzso fractional volume, zzso were zzso In addition, whole zzso zzso analysis was compared with zzso analysis to investigate the extent of zzso zzso It was found that changes in the rate of enhancement correlated strongly with changes in zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Furthermore, it was found that the shape of the signal enhancement curve only changed when the zzso values changed by 50% or zzso Median zzso values determined following zzso analysis of zzso maps of zzso were approximately equal to those determined by whole zzso zzso zzso The absolute change in the zzso values correlated zzso with the zzso values, particularly for responding zzso Thus, for higher zzso zzso values, a greater decrease was zzso Greater changes were observed in the upper extremes of the zzso zzso than in the median values after one course of zzso
