We present the first in zzso zzso zzso image of the human leg with zzso zzso zzso size using the magnetic resonance electrical zzso zzso zzso zzso After a review of its experimental protocol by an Institutional Review Board zzso we performed zzso imaging experiments of four human subjects using a 3 T zzso zzso zzso thin and flexible zzso zzso with a large surface area and good zzso we could inject as much as 9 zzso current in a form of 15 zzso pulse into the leg without producing a painful sensation and motion zzso zzso injecting two imaging currents in two different directions, we collected induced magnetic flux density data inside the zzso zzso zzso images reconstructed by using the zzso harmonic zzso zzso well distinguished different parts of the subcutaneous zzso zzso muscle, zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone inside the zzso We could observe zzso noise spikes in the outer layer of the bone primarily due to the MR signal void phenomenon zzso Around the fat, the chemical shift of about two zzso occurred obscuring the boundary of the fat zzso Future work should include a fat correction method incorporated in the zzso pulse sequence and improvements in zzso coils and image reconstruction zzso Further human imaging experiments are planned and being conducted to produce zzso images from different parts of the human zzso
