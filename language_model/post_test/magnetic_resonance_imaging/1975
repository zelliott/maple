Our goal was to describe the MR findings of zzso injected silicone in zzso zzso and to determine the most optimal combination of pulse sequences for discrimination of injected silicone from the surrounding zzso Seven zzso zzso were referred for zzso in order to detect the injected silicone in the subcutaneous zzso and to zzso distant migration and possible zzso Conventional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso plain short zzso inversion recovery zzso and two STIR sequences with, respectively, water and silicone suppression were applied at zzso zzso Three observers trained in zzso zzso the images separately for the abnormalities and rated the images using a zzso zzso The STIR with water suppression provided the highest contrast between silicone and the surrounding zzso zzso zzso STIR pulse sequences provided clear images for the evaluation of the amount and patterns of local and distant spread of injected fluid zzso zzso resonance imaging readily identifies the zzso injected zzso its distant migration and the amount of tissue disorganization around the silicone zzso Two zzso STIR sequences are usually sufficient for imaging the spread of zzso
