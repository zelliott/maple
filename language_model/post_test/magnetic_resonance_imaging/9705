zzso smoothing of images prior to applying zzso statistics is an important step in zzso analysis and statistical zzso mapping zzso and is used to account for registration zzso to zzso the data and to integrate imaging signals from a region around each zzso However, it has also become a limitation of zzso based methods, since it is often chosen zzso and lacks spatial zzso to the shape and spatial extent of the region of interest, such as a region of zzso or functional zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso named zzso zzso analysis zzso for determining the optimal zzso zzso smoothing of images, followed by applying zzso group zzso In zzso zzso zzso projection is applied regionally to get the direction that best discriminates between two groups, zzso patients and zzso this direction is equivalent to local filtering by an optimal kernel whose zzso define the zzso zzso zzso By considering all the neighborhoods that contain a given zzso we then compose this information to produce the statistic for each zzso Finally, zzso tests are used to obtain a statistical zzso map of group zzso zzso has been evaluated using simulated data in which the ground truth is known and with data from an Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso The experimental results have shown that the proposed zzso can precisely describe the shape and location of structural zzso
