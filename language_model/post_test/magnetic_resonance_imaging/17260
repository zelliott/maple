Identification of focal cortical zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso images of young children with zzso focal zzso is important, as surgical zzso may offer improvement of seizure control and subsequent zzso zzso However, the MR appearances of zzso of cortical development may change during brain zzso We report 4 children with zzso focal zzso whose MR images in infancy showed localized cortical and zzso signal abnormalities zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso zzso suggestive of abnormal cortical zzso The visibility of these zzso was significantly reduced on later MR zzso zzso blurring of the zzso matter junction in these areas was the only indicator of cortical zzso in 3 patients, which was recognized only after comparison with earlier zzso zzso zzso was subsequently confirmed in all patients, following surgical cortical zzso of the zzso MR images performed early within the first year of life in children with zzso are important to identify areas of zzso The appearances of zzso on later scans can be very subtle escaping recognition, and conclusions may be misleading with respect to diagnosis and appropriateness of surgical zzso
