To zzso compare cartilage zzso values after zzso therapy zzso and zzso zzso zzso transplantation zzso repair zzso 

The study had institutional review board approval by the ethics committee of the Medical University of zzso informed consent was zzso Twenty patients who underwent zzso or zzso (10 in each zzso were zzso For zzso patients of each group were matched by mean age zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging was performed with a zzso MR zzso and zzso maps were calculated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso quantitative zzso values were calculated within the cartilage repair area and within cartilage sites determined to be zzso normal zzso zzso Additionally, with consideration of the zzso organization, global regions of interest were subdivided into deep and superficial zzso zzso between cartilage sites and groups were calculated by using a three-way analysis of zzso 

zzso zzso assessment of normal native zzso cartilage showed similar results for all patients and a significant trend of increasing zzso values from deep to superficial zones zzso zzso zzso In cartilage repair areas after zzso global mean zzso was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso whereas after zzso mean zzso was not reduced zzso zzso or zzso zzso For zzso variation, repair tissue after zzso showed no significant trend between different depths zzso zzso or zzso zzso in contrast to repair tissue after zzso in which a significant increase from deep to superficial zones zzso zzso zzso could be zzso 

zzso zzso mapping seems to reflect differences in repair zzso formed after two surgical cartilage repair zzso zzso zzso zzso
