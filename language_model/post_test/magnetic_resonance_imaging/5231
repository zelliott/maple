To identify the dynamic zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging features that may predict the outcome of patients with breast zzso 

zzso images from 87 patients newly diagnosed with primary breast cancer were zzso The kinetic parameters (including cold spot, hot spot, and zzso zzso were derived from the zzso zzso These parameters were used to thoroughly reflect the tumor zzso The association of dynamic MR features (including kinetic and zzso zzso with established zzso indicators was zzso 

zzso tumors with poor zzso indicators showed higher values of hot spot parameters zzso initial Slope zzso and zzso zzso zzso higher values of a zzso zzso initial slope ratio zzso zzso and lower values of a cold spot zzso zzso initial slope zzso than those with favorable zzso zzso The zzso internal enhancement pattern and zzso enhancement pattern were more frequently observed in patients with poor zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that kinetic parameters zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso internal zzso zzso and zzso zzso were independently and significantly associated with zzso grade, zzso zzso status, tumor size, and zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that all hot spot, cold spot, and zzso parameters may be useful to zzso identify highly aggressive breast zzso More importantly, cold spot and zzso parameters may serve as crucial indicators to predict the outcome of breast zzso
