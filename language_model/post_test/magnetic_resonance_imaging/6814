zzso zzso inversion and zzso zzso with extremely high spatial selectivity and uniform profiles are a requirement for numerous MR techniques, such as zzso zzso spin labeling and outer volume zzso zzso zzso used for inversion of zzso zzso are zzso but the superior selectivity of zzso full passages has not been widely exploited for zzso because a simple way of zzso the zzso of these zzso zzso is zzso An zzso derived zzso equation is zzso zzso to a large class of zzso including the zzso zzso zzso pulse and allowing the determination of the precise zzso required to achieve any effective flip zzso The properties of this zzso are zzso and a highly selective and homogeneous HS zzso pulse is zzso Based on this zzso a new class of zzso zzso is zzso These zzso zzso selective zzso and inversion zzso zzso zzso afford optimal zzso zzso achieving uniform profiles at any effective flip zzso zzso zzso are compared to existing zzso modulated zzso zzso in simulations and phantom experiments and shown to be superior in terms of selectivity and zzso while requiring less zzso zzso An application of zzso zzso to zzso zzso spin labeling is zzso
