zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso nucleus in zzso animals results in locomotion and a zzso response resembling that seen during zzso This has led to the hypothesis that parallel zzso of zzso and locomotor systems from the zzso could form part of the zzso zzso mechanism of zzso However, the degree to which zzso structures play a role in cardiovascular zzso in awake humans has not been zzso We studied the effects on heart rate zzso and mean zzso blood pressure zzso of zzso stimulating the zzso and zzso zzso in awake humans undergoing neurosurgery for movement disorders zzso zzso 13 Parkinson's disease, zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased during high frequency zzso 90 zzso electrical stimulation of the zzso zzso 5 zzso 3 beats zzso P zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso 3 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso 5 zzso 3 beats zzso P zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso 3 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) or zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso 3 beats zzso P zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso 2 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This was accompanied by the zzso of movement, but without the movement zzso zzso of the internal zzso zzso did not increase cardiovascular variables but did facilitate zzso Low frequency zzso 20 zzso stimulation of any site did not affect cardiovascular variables or zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso in awake humans can cause a modest increase in cardiovascular variables that is not dependent on movement feedback from exercising zzso The relationship between this type of response and that occurring during actual exercise is zzso but it indicates that zzso command could be involved in zzso zzso of the locomotor and cardiovascular systems and thus contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso
