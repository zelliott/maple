zzso medications are commonly used in treating zzso zzso However, technical details of the correct usage of these medications for zzso cavity with obstruction are zzso 

A three-dimensional model of zzso cavity was constructed from zzso scans of a healthy human zzso zzso cavities corresponding to healthy, moderate, and severe zzso obstruction zzso were simulated by enlarging the inferior zzso zzso which was documented by approximately one-third reduction of the minimum zzso area for the moderate and two-thirds for the severe zzso The discrete phase model based on zzso zzso fluid dynamics was used to study the zzso zzso The results were presented with drug particle (from 7 zzso zzso to zzso zzso deposition distribution along the lateral walls inside these three zzso zzso and comparisons of the particle ratio escaping from the cavity were also presented and zzso 

zzso zzso is an essential condition that had the most impact on particle deposition of the factors zzso the particle percentage escaping the zzso cavity decreased to less than a half and one-tenth for the moderately and severely blocked zzso zzso of flow rate and particle diameter increased the escaping zzso however, zero escaping percentage was detected with the absence of air flow and the effect was less noticeable when the particle diameter was very small zzso zzso The existence of zzso flow and head tilt angle helped to improve the particle escaping ratio for the healthy zzso however, such changes were not significant for the moderately and severely blocked zzso 

When using an zzso medication, it is zzso to have a moderate zzso zzso rate and small size particles to improve particle escaping zzso Various head positions suggested by clinicians do not seem to improve the drug escaping ratio significantly for the zzso cavities with inferior zzso zzso
