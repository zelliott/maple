In this study, a novel method for dynamic parallel image acquisition and reconstruction is zzso In this method, called zzso inherited parallel acquisition zzso localized reconstruction zzso are used to achieve higher reduction factors, and lower noise and artifact levels compared to that of generalized zzso partially parallel acquisition zzso zzso In zzso the full zzso for the first frame and the partial zzso for later frames are required to reconstruct a whole series of zzso Reconstruction zzso calculated for different segments of zzso from the first frame data set are used to estimate missing zzso lines in corresponding zzso segments of other zzso The local determination of zzso reconstruction zzso is essential to adjusting them according to the local zzso ratio characteristics of zzso zzso The proposed zzso is zzso to dynamic imaging with arbitrary zzso sampling zzso zzso of magnetic resonance zzso using the zzso method with a reduction factor of 6 and using dynamic imaging studies of human subjects with reduction factors of 4 and 6 have been performed to prove the feasibility of our method and to show apparent improvement in image quality in comparison with zzso for dynamic zzso
