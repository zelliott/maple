zzso zzso has become the preferred zzso zzso To fully take advantage of the high anatomical resolution the zzso zzso system was adapted for use in zzso zzso zzso The head ring which until recently was made of an aluminum zzso has been replaced by an zzso head ring of pure titanium without changing the dimensions and fixation zzso No significant zzso due to zzso currents has been zzso Minor distortion induced by the titanium head ring can be corrected zzso Thus the geometric information is limited only by the zzso resolution of the MR zzso
