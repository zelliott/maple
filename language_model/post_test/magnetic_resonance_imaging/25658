We evaluated zzso ratios and zzso values of 6 zzso zzso and 8 zzso cell zzso in the head and neck in order to differentiate these two zzso zzso ratios were calculated by dividing intensity of tumor by that of muscle in same slice zzso zzso values were calculated from zzso images and zzso zzso zzso difference of zzso ratios was found between zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso but no difference of zzso values was seen between two zzso zzso ratio was considered to be a useful and zzso index for evaluation of head and neck zzso
