zzso evidence suggests that motor zzso are prevalent in zzso spectrum disorder zzso relate to the social and zzso deficits at the core of the diagnosis and may reflect abnormal connectivity within brain networks underlying motor control and zzso zzso of zzso functional connectivity data using spectral zzso approaches has been shown to be an effective means of visualizing functional organization within the brain but has most commonly been applied to explorations of normal brain zzso This article presents a zzso of a key area of the motor network, the primary motor zzso zzso a key area of the motor control network, in adults, typically developing zzso children and children with zzso and introduces methods for selecting the number of zzso matching parcels across groups and testing group zzso The zzso is based solely on patterns of connectivity between individual zzso zzso and all zzso outside of zzso and within all groups, a gross zzso to zzso organization emerged within zzso which was zzso zzso Although this gross organizational scheme was present in both groups of children, statistically significant group differences in the size and segregation of zzso parcels within regions of the motor zzso corresponding to the upper and lower limbs were zzso zzso comparison of the zzso zzso for children with zzso with that of younger and older TD children suggests that these organizational differences, with a lack of differentiation between lower zzso regions and upper zzso regions, may be due, at least in part, to a delay in functional specialization within the motor zzso
