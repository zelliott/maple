To evaluate and compare the performances of zzso imaging, zzso and clinical examination in the detection of residual zzso 3 months after treatment of patients with head and neck zzso cell zzso 

A consecutive sample of 50 patients with zzso cell zzso of the oral zzso zzso zzso or zzso or a cervical zzso zzso zzso from an unknown primary site excluding zzso lip and zzso vocal zzso zzso 

Treatment outcome was assessed after 3 months by clinical examination, zzso and zzso zzso zzso specificity and accuracy were calculated relative to proven biopsy of residual zzso or a clinical follow-up of 4 zzso 

zzso cancer was confirmed in 8 patients zzso while the clinical follow-up was zzso in the remaining 42 zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso as compared to zzso zzso and clinical examination zzso zzso was higher for clinical examination zzso intermediate for zzso zzso and lowest for zzso zzso 

This study finds very high sensitivity for zzso in the detection of residual zzso However, its lower zzso lack of anatomical resolution, and high cost, require further studies to determine its role in routine zzso
