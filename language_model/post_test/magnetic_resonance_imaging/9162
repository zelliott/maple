Many believe that the fetus spine had only one zzso from zzso to zzso which is a global zzso and that the zzso zzso appears with the erect zzso They agree that the zzso of Homo sapiens is not positioned zzso at birth and that it is during the first few years that the zzso in humans, moves zzso in relation with the progressive acquisition of erect posture and the zzso of bipedal zzso Nevertheless, there is no zzso study assessing these parameters in zzso in zzso during the fetal zzso zzso zzso study of the zzso junction of the spine in in zzso fetuses was to document the presence of a zzso zzso in the fetal population in zzso long before standing and walking and its change during zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso of fetuses aged of zzso weeks of gestation were zzso The zzso were performed on computerized zzso zzso images using a professional software to calculate the zzso and radius of the zzso zzso The presence or absence of visual zzso zzso was noted for each zzso zzso tests were performed in order to disclose a correlation between the zzso age and the zzso zzso A test was considered significant for P zzso zzso There were 14 zzso 17 females and 14 zzso All the zzso zzso showed zzso the presence of a zzso in the zzso zzso The visual zzso zzso was present in zzso of zzso The measurement of the zzso zzso varies between zzso and zzso zzso and a mean of zzso zzso with a corresponding radius ranging from zzso to zzso zzso with a mean of zzso zzso The statistical analysis showed no correlation between the zzso age and the zzso zzso (R zzso zzso zzso The hypothesis of increased zzso zzso with zzso age is zzso It is difficult to accurately determine the role played separately by zzso and by erect zzso A visual zzso zzso was noted in zzso of cases with mean radius of zzso zzso This zzso was not correlated statistically to zzso age which means that it is not related to growth and might be genetically zzso Mechanical factors may play a major role in the determination of the shape of the growing zzso One can ask if the pelvis zzso is genetically determined or if it is mechanically determined under muscular and zzso zzso This study shows that the zzso of human fetuses is oriented zzso zzso in zzso of cases, and in zzso of cases based on the zzso appearance of the zzso zzso So beside the effect of progressive acquisition of erect posture and zzso in determining the formation of zzso angle, we believe that zzso play an important role in the formation of the zzso zzso
