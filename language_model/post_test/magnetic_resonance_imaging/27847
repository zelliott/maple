Some have suggested that zzso might be the best reference standard for a true fracture among patients with suspected zzso zzso The primary aim of this study was to determine the rate of zzso diagnosis of an acute zzso fracture in a cohort of healthy zzso 

In a prospective study, 33 healthy volunteers were recruited and both zzso of each were zzso except for 2 volunteers for whom only one wrist was zzso To simulate the usual clinical context the 64 scans of healthy volunteers were mixed with 60 zzso scans of clinically suspected zzso fractures but normal zzso zzso These 124 zzso scans were blinded and randomly zzso Five zzso evaluated the zzso scans independently for the presence or absence of a zzso fracture and other injuries according to a standard zzso 

To answer the primary question, only the diagnoses from the 64 scans of healthy volunteers were zzso The zzso diagnosed a total of 13 zzso zzso therefore, specificity for diagnosis of zzso fracture was zzso zzso confidence zzso range zzso The 5 observers had a moderate zzso agreement regarding diagnosis of zzso fracture in healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso 

The specificity of zzso for zzso fractures is high zzso but zzso do zzso zzso have only moderate agreement when interpreting zzso scans from healthy zzso zzso is not an adequate reference standard for true fractures among patients with suspected zzso zzso
