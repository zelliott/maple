The use of zzso materials has been shown to be an effective method for increasing transmit and receive sensitivity in areas of zzso intensity in the brain at high zzso zzso in this article show that the use of these materials does not increase the zzso zzso for a phased array receive zzso does not have any zzso effects on the zzso zzso within the brain, and does not affect the specific zzso rate distribution within the zzso Areas of the brain close to the pads exhibit significant increases zzso in transmit field efficiency, but areas further away show a less pronounced zzso decrease due to the homogenization of the transmit field and the loss introduced by the zzso zzso
