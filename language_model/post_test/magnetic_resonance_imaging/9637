zzso X-ray zzso zzso has been used extensively for bone mineral density and body composition zzso Surprisingly, the role of zzso in monitoring changes in children's body zzso using direct imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso as reference, is still yet to be zzso We aimed at zzso the use of zzso in monitoring change in the thigh lean soft tissue mass zzso and fat mass zzso when compared with thigh skeletal muscle mass zzso and zzso measured using zzso as the reference standard, from childhood to zzso At zzso 22 healthy children (16 boys and 6 zzso aged zzso were included, and then recalled at zzso stage zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of the same region were measured on the same zzso The same protocol was repeated zzso zzso At zzso zzso overestimated zzso on average by zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not significantly different zzso zzso to zzso the zzso At zzso change in zzso and zzso were not significantly different to change in zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso of the difference was zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso to zzso for zzso The zzso of zzso between the 2 techniques was zzso for both zzso and zzso This study zzso the use of zzso in monitoring changes in zzso and zzso in children, confirming its significant potential in clinical and research roles in pediatric body zzso
