zzso cervical zzso zzso detected by imaging methods is a prerequisite for the clinical diagnosis of zzso cervical zzso zzso Little is known about the spontaneous course and prognosis of clinically zzso zzso zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to update a previously published model zzso for the development of clinically symptomatic zzso and to assess the early and late risks of this event in a larger cohort of zzso zzso A group of 199 patients zzso women, 105 men, median age 51 zzso with magnetic resonance signs of zzso cervical zzso zzso but without clear clinical signs of zzso was followed zzso for at least 2 years zzso zzso zzso Various zzso clinical, imaging, and zzso parameters were correlated with the time for the development of symptomatic zzso Clinical evidence of the first signs and symptoms of zzso within the follow-up period was found in 45 patients zzso The 25th zzso time to clinically zzso zzso was zzso months, and symptomatic zzso developed within 12 months in 16 patients zzso The presence of symptomatic cervical zzso and zzso abnormalities of cervical zzso dysfunction detected by zzso or zzso zzso were associated with zzso development and early development zzso or zzso zzso of zzso while zzso zzso predicted later zzso zzso progression to symptomatic zzso The zzso zzso model based on these variables correctly predicted early progression into zzso in zzso of the zzso In conclusion, zzso abnormalities of cervical zzso dysfunction together with clinical signs of cervical zzso and zzso zzso are useful zzso of early progression into symptomatic zzso in patients with zzso zzso evaluation of cervical zzso dysfunction in patients with cervical zzso or back pain is zzso zzso follow-up is justified in high-risk zzso zzso
