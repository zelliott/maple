The aim of this study was presentation of a zzso zzso technique with a moving table as a screening tool for bone zzso in patients with breast zzso Twenty-two patients with breast zzso underwent both a zzso zzso bone zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso images were acquired with a moving table at six different anatomical positions within a measurement time of 20 zzso zzso images were acquired using a zzso inversion recovery zzso accomplished by an zzso zzso zzso sequence through the head, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso shot sequence covering the whole zzso The zzso findings indicating bone zzso were compared with findings from bone zzso zzso zzso were confirmed by follow-up examinations over 1 zzso Twelve patients showed bone zzso zzso zzso was superior to bone zzso in predicting zzso origin with a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso a specificity of zzso zzso zzso and an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed additional findings such as zzso of the lung and zzso zzso zzso with moving table technique may be an effective method of total body screening for bone in selected patients with breast zzso and a high risk of distant zzso although with the higher costs of zzso bone zzso must still be considered as the first method for screening patients with breast zzso
