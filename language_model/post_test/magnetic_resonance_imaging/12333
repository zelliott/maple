The human brain function involves complex processes with population codes of zzso zzso zzso research has demonstrated that when representing zzso activities, zzso is an important characterizing zzso Inspired by this finding, significant amount of efforts from the scientific communities have been recently devoted to sparse representations of signals and patterns, and promising achievements have been zzso However, sparse representation of zzso signals, particularly at the population level of a group of different zzso has been rarely explored zzso In this paper, we present a novel zzso sparse representation of zzso zzso signals from multiple subjects via dictionary learning zzso Specifically, we extract and pool zzso zzso signals for a set of cortical landmarks, each of which possesses intrinsic anatomical correspondence, from a group of zzso Then an effective online dictionary learning zzso is employed to learn an zzso dictionary from the pooled population of zzso signals based on zzso determined dictionary zzso Our experiments have identified meaningful zzso of zzso zzso in the learned dictionary, which zzso to consistent and meaningful functional responses of the brain to external zzso Our work demonstrated that sparse representation of zzso zzso signals is naturally suitable and effective in recovering population codes of zzso signals conveyed in zzso zzso
