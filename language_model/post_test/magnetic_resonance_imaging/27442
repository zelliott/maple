Although freezing of gait zzso is reportedly caused by cerebrovascular disease, few studies have examined its zzso We examined regional cerebral blood flow zzso patterns in patients with zzso resulting from chronic zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Among patients with chronic zzso zzso treated at our zzso unit, we performed zzso zzso in seven patients with zzso zzso zzso and in 20 patients without zzso zzso zzso We analyzed and compared the zzso data using three-dimensional zzso surface projections of the two zzso 

On zzso zzso the zzso group showed a significant reduction in zzso in the bilateral anterior zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso The mean zzso for the bilateral zzso zzso was significantly higher in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso data of the anterior and zzso zzso were analyzed on a zzso basis, the mean zzso for the left anterior zzso zzso was significantly higher than that for the right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that anterior zzso zzso dysfunction may be involved in the pathology of zzso in patients with chronic zzso zzso
