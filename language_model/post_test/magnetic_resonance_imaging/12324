zzso magnetic resonance zzso focused ultrasound zzso is a novel technique to supplement the spectrum of established zzso zzso In contrast to traditional zzso procedures, zzso is zzso and entirely zzso with continuous temperature zzso at and around the target in real zzso It has no trajectory restrictions and does not involve zzso zzso Since no device is implanted into the brain or the body, there is no restriction to future diagnostic zzso with MR zzso The ability to treat a variety of zzso zzso neurological diseases by precisely focusing ultrasound energy to desired targets in the thalamus, zzso and zzso zzso while avoiding collateral tissue damage is certainly zzso zzso clinical studies on over 130 patients with zzso pain, essential zzso Parkinson's disease and obsessive-compulsive disorder are very promising and demonstrate that ultrasound energy can precisely be focused through the intact skull, without zzso zzso zzso the ultrasound parameters allows not only to zzso pathological zzso or silence dysfunctional zzso zzso but also to zzso neural functions, as shown in zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso focused ultrasound is a novel, zzso alternative treatment option for patients with zzso movement disorders, such as essential zzso and Parkinson's zzso
