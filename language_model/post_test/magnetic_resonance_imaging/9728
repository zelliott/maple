The present study was conducted to address whether the zzso disc of rabbit could be considered zzso as a valuable model to provide new insights into the tissue and cellular changes of zzso zzso aging and zzso as an appropriate tool to investigate the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso disc from rabbits with increasing ages zzso 6 and 30 zzso were compared by zzso and zzso observation using zzso grading and zzso scoring zzso The expression of transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells were zzso by quantitative real-time zzso 

zzso analysis indicated an early zzso increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso scoring was also zzso The analysis of transcript expression levels showed that zzso and zzso were zzso as a function of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in the zzso zzso cells of aged rabbit zzso zzso 

Our study describes the consistency of the rabbit as a model of zzso disc changes as a function of age by zzso tissue zzso with cellular modification zzso
