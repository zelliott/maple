Two simple zzso for correcting the errors in zzso maps for phantom zzso are zzso they both give accurate zzso maps with a low zzso of variation zzso The rate correction method is based on an equation relating the true zzso zzso and that determined zzso zzso for zzso zzso The response zzso method is a zzso analysis of the difference between zzso and zzso from which correction factors are zzso for a range of zzso values and for every zzso of an zzso The factors were obtained from zzso filled with a homogeneous gelatin gel and having different zzso zzso The zzso in homogeneous phantom zzso were reduced from zzso to approximately zzso for zzso values ranging from zzso zzso Examples are shown for the correction of zzso maps of zzso filled with zzso dosimeter gel zzso with zzso beams from a linear zzso The zzso presented can easily be implemented on a clinical zzso zzso
