A zzso type of zzso disease zzso is characterized by the extensive involvement of the cerebral white matter as well as the cerebral gray zzso It has been a point of controversy, however, whether the white matter changes represent primary or secondary zzso The aim of this study was to zzso by using MR images and zzso zzso whether the white matter zzso in zzso are primary or secondary zzso 

zzso changes of zzso zzso and zzso findings of six zzso cases of zzso were zzso zzso 

zzso MR images of brains affected by zzso revealed that zzso zzso appeared in the cerebral gray matter zzso months after onset and in the cerebral white matter around the lateral zzso approximately 5 months after zzso They rapidly extended to deep and zzso white matter during the next several months and then to the entire cerebral white matter 10 months after zzso zzso examination of the white matter zzso revealed zzso changes or tissue zzso associated with zzso zzso which indicates primary involvement of the white zzso At the terminal stages of cases with a longer clinical course, MR images showed zzso zzso in the zzso tracts in the internal capsule and brain zzso which zzso disclosed loss of zzso and zzso accompanied by zzso zzso that indicates secondary zzso 

zzso white matter zzso in zzso were considered to be primary changes of the disease, but the zzso of the zzso tracts were secondary to cortical or cerebral or both white matter zzso
