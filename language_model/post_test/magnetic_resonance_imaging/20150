zzso zzso dominant zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso is an inherited systemic vascular disorder characterized by zzso zzso zzso strokes leading to vascular zzso The gold standard to confirm the diagnosis is to identify a zzso in the underlying gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso material zzso deposition around vascular smooth muscle cells is a specific diagnostic feature of zzso and electron microscopic examination of a skin biopsy is another useful method for its zzso Although zzso of zzso zzso on the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells has been reported, the composition of zzso has not been zzso To zzso the relationship between zzso protein and zzso we performed zzso zzso electron zzso using zzso and freeze zzso skin taken from two zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso around vascular smooth muscle cells was specifically labeled with zzso against the zzso portion of zzso but not with zzso recognizing the zzso zzso zzso In zzso skin zzso no zzso binding was detected around the small zzso zzso From these results, the major component of zzso in zzso patients is the zzso of the zzso gene zzso Our results shed light on the relationship between zzso gene zzso and zzso deposition of zzso around the vascular smooth muscle zzso
