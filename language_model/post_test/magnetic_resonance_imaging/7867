To assess the correlations between zzso plaque characteristics and inflammatory activity by combined use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Patients underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratios zzso of zzso sections were determined from mean standard zzso values zzso zzso between TBR and mean vessel wall zzso total vessel area, zzso area, vessel wall area and zzso wall index were zzso zzso types were defined as zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were also classified as thick, thin, or zzso zzso zzso 

The study included 31 patients zzso plaque zzso There was a significant decrease in TBR values across the zzso cap groups, such that zzso zzso and zzso plaques had significantly higher TBR than zzso and collagen zzso There were weak positive correlations between TBR and mean vessel wall zzso vessel wall area and zzso wall zzso 

Thin or zzso zzso zzso plaques and zzso plaques possess high inflammatory zzso The combination of zzso zzso and zzso could be useful for qualitative and quantitative diagnosis of carotid zzso zzso
