Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso data of 170 consecutive patients with inflammatory back pain zzso and/or zzso of the lower limbs were evaluated in a retrospective zzso The aim was to determine the frequency of zzso and zzso zzso in this population, and to assess the significance of zzso zzso zzso for diagnosis in early zzso 

zzso zzso were performed in all zzso patients and dynamic zzso of the zzso zzso in patients with zzso who had indefinite results on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

European zzso Study Group criteria for zzso were fulfilled by zzso patients zzso eight additional patients had symptoms suggestive of zzso zzso The most frequent zzso subset was zzso zzso zzso diagnosed in zzso patients zzso zzso was detected by zzso in zzso patients with zzso and unclear zzso zzso Of those, 14 were diagnosed as zzso and seven females with moderate unilateral zzso but no features of zzso also not on follow-up (at least 1 zzso were classified as zzso zzso zzso Ten of the 14 zzso zzso and none of the seven US patients were zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients with zzso zzso positively predicts zzso zzso is a frequent zzso zzso There are zzso zzso zzso patients with moderate unilateral zzso whom we propose to be classified as zzso
