The method of constrained zzso previously applied to magnetic resonance imaging zzso is extended to magnetic resonance zzso This method assumes a model for the MR zzso The model parameters are estimated directly from the phase zzso zzso This process zzso the need for the fast zzso transform zzso (which often exhibits limited resolution and ringing zzso The technique is tested on simulated data, phantom data, and data acquired from human liver in zzso In each case, constrained reconstruction offers spatial resolution superior to that obtained with the zzso
