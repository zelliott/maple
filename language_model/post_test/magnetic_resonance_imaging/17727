zzso score is a standardized anatomical zzso of zzso tumors proposed with the aim to zzso the decision-making process of any zzso evaluating kidney tumors potentially suitable for zzso zzso The system was proposed in a series of patients treated with open partial zzso zzso and was recently validated in a series of patients treated with either open or zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to validate the zzso score in a series of consecutive patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso 

We evaluated zzso all the zzso or CT images of 62 consecutive patients who underwent zzso for zzso tumors at a zzso teaching institution by a single surgeon between September 2006 and November zzso 

zzso score zzso zzso zzso was correlated with warm zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso console time zzso zzso zzso blood loss zzso zzso zzso percentage of zzso repair zzso zzso zzso and overall complications zzso zzso zzso zzso score was the only variable able to predict the risk of the overall complications zzso zzso zzso zzso score turned out to be an independent predictor of zzso zzso zzso in multivariable analysis zzso zzso P zzso zzso once adjusted for zzso experience Finally, zzso score was the only independent predictor of the need for zzso repair zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was an effective tool to predict zzso and risk of zzso complications also in patients who underwent zzso This zzso must be considered useful to improve patients counseling and selection for zzso
