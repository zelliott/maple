There is an zzso medical need to identify zzso zzso that allow us to accurately diagnose and monitor Alzheimer's disease zzso at its very early stages and to assess the response to zzso zzso To a certain extent, zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies can detect changes in structure, cerebral blood flow, and blood zzso that distinguish zzso and mild cognitive impairment zzso subjects from healthy control zzso zzso However, it has been challenging to use fully automated zzso zzso methods to identify potential zzso zzso zzso We have thus proposed a method based on independent component analysis zzso for studying potential zzso MR image features that can be coupled with the use of support zzso machine zzso for zzso scans into categories of zzso zzso and HC zzso The zzso data were selected from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies zzso and the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso The experimental results showed that the zzso method coupled with zzso zzso can differentiate zzso and zzso patients from HC subjects, although further zzso improvement in the zzso method and inclusion of additional variables may be required for optimal zzso
