To describe our experience and clinical strategy for zzso body zzso zzso of spinal zzso 

zzso patients with 33 spinal zzso underwent zzso zzso simulation while free zzso zzso target volumes included involved portions of the zzso body and zzso zzso Planning target volume zzso expansion was 6 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso the zzso was excluded from the zzso zzso equivalent dose was calculated using the linear zzso model with zzso zzso 3 zzso Treatment was linear accelerator based with zzso zzso dose was adjusted to maintain zzso dose within zzso Survival, local control, pain, and zzso status were zzso 

zzso patients are alive at 1 year zzso survival, 14 zzso Median follow-up is 6 months for all patients (7 months for zzso Mean previous zzso dose to 22 patients was 35 zzso and median zzso was 17 zzso Renal zzso breast, and lung zzso each) were the most common zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso one to four zzso of 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Median zzso and target zzso equivalent doses were 70 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thirteen patients reported complete and 17 patients reported partial pain relief at 1 zzso There were four failures zzso zzso zzso with magnetic resonance imaging evidence of zzso zzso No zzso parameters zzso of failure were zzso No zzso toxicity was zzso 

Spinal zzso is effective in the zzso zzso Volume expansion must ensure optimal zzso coverage while avoiding spinal zzso zzso The long-term safety of spinal zzso and the zzso of the zzso model in this setting remain to be determined, particularly the zzso impact of prior zzso
