zzso resonance imaging zzso is an emerging tool to assess zzso iron load in patients with zzso dependent zzso 

We performed zzso zzso star zzso assessment in 44 zzso dependent patients to study the prevalence of cardiac and liver iron overload and the relationship of zzso measurement with various clinical and zzso zzso 

Mean age of the study subjects was zzso years zzso zzso and the mean cardiac zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Fifty percent of the subjects had abnormal cardiac zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso was not found to have any correlation with serum zzso or liver zzso Liver zzso value was abnormal in zzso of the subjects and it correlated zzso with both current and 12 months average serum zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso Clinical parameters including age, duration of zzso age starting iron zzso therapy, and ratio between zzso volume and zzso dosage were not correlated with cardiac and liver zzso 

We conclude that iron overload in heart and liver is common in our zzso dependent zzso Liver zzso has inverse correlation with serum zzso zzso zzso does not have any correlation with the various clinical and zzso zzso
