Many claims are made as to the efficacy of topical preparations in zzso the skin, yet most of these claims cannot be substantiated by scientific study for the skin layers beneath the stratum zzso and yield no information on the remainder of the zzso and zzso This argues for an in zzso quantitative method for measuring the effect of water loading extended to various layers of the zzso 

zzso high-resolution in zzso zzso studies of zzso and zzso of finger pad skin layers were conducted on one normal subject using two zzso methods zzso white soft zzso zzso and water zzso The zzso study was carried out immediately following removal from prolonged skin zzso zzso zzso for skin zzso zzso zzso was studied in seven healthy volunteers at 0 and 7 h zzso with zzso zzso dependence in skin zzso was investigated on the same subject by looking into the zzso of zzso and finger pad zzso System stability and measurement zzso was verified through a detailed phantom zzso 

Images of normal and hydrated human skin were obtained in zzso at zzso dimensions of 50 zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso and zzso as a function of exposure to zzso zzso water and zzso on the image signal intensity, observed zzso and interaction of free and bound water in specific zzso were identified and correlated with existing zzso zzso zzso of stratum zzso due to zzso was expressed as an in zzso model of tissue zzso 

zzso of the zzso study showed that the changes due to the previous zzso of the skin are zzso for all skin zzso For both zzso methods zzso Vaseline and skin zzso the effects of zzso and zzso on the skin were zzso The trends of the zzso parameters for finger pad and arm skin were zzso The group study showed low zzso zzso of zzso on stratum zzso and zzso
