zzso zzso zzso is an emerging technique for zzso zzso of transgenic mouse zzso and is capable of zzso abnormalities in cardiac zzso To identify cardiac defects in zzso we have zzso zzso preparation and MR acquisition parameters to zzso image quality and assess the zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso protein 7 zzso transgenic zzso zzso methods rely on tissue penetration with a zzso zzso contrast agent to reduce tissue zzso thus improving zzso ratio zzso in rapid zzso echo zzso We investigated zzso days post zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fixed in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso solutions for either 3 days (2 and 4 zzso or 2 weeks zzso 4, 8 and 16 zzso To assess penetration of the contrast agent into heart tissue and enable image contrast simulations, zzso and zzso zzso were measured in heart and background zzso Compared to zzso zzso fixation showed reduced mean zzso in the heart at both 2 and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in calculated signal gains of zzso (2 zzso and zzso (4 zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso values from zzso zzso computer simulation of heart and background zzso and ex zzso zzso zzso echo imaging, we demonstrated that zzso fixed zzso in 8 zzso zzso in combination with zzso parameters zzso of zzso 9 zzso zzso degrees zzso produced the largest zzso in the heart zzso zzso zzso and heart chamber zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso parameters were then applied to an zzso screen of zzso zzso for the gene zzso implicated in zzso of the eye, heart zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of growth, zzso zzso ear abnormalities and deafness zzso syndrome (a condition partly zzso by cardiovascular birth defects in zzso A zzso zzso zzso was readily identified in the screen, consistent with the human zzso
