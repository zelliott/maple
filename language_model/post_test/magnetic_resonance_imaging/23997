Since its inception, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has seen rapid progress in the application to zzso Common zzso acquisition methods are susceptible to zzso field zzso resulting in signal loss at the zzso zzso area important for memory function or at the zzso zzso area for motor zzso In addition, they are susceptible to the zzso signals of large vein origin, such as the signals from its surrounding zzso fluid zzso leading to zzso zzso Spin echoes overcome these zzso However, they are less sensitive to blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso changes because of their zzso zzso A method is presented here to enhance the zzso zzso signal by recruiting more spins to participate in the dynamic zzso zzso This method divided a conventional zzso weighting period into several segments separated by blocks of extra free diffusion zzso Before the extra diffusion time spins are restored to the zzso axis preventing rapid zzso zzso This process allows more spin access to the regions that experience the zzso field zzso Because of the increased spin population that is modulated by the zzso zzso field zzso the functional signal is zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso with this enhancement may be a useful technique for zzso studies at zzso areas such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
