A spinal zzso tumor model was developed, using the zzso zzso in zzso to assess the strengths and weaknesses of magnetic resonance zzso as a zzso imaging zzso for the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were acquired both before and after intravenous zzso zzso injection, assessing zzso zzso and efficacy of imaging zzso 

An zzso tumor zzso was produced in the zzso space of six New Zealand White rabbits and subsequently studied on a zzso zzso whole body MR zzso zzso tumor tissue was removed from the thigh of a carrier zzso zzso and zzso Under zzso guidance, zzso zzso of the tumor preparation was then injected into the zzso space of the experimental zzso The injection was performed at the zzso level using an zzso needle and zzso tubing zzso within the zzso The rabbits were zzso using a circular small parts surface zzso 5 to 15 days after the zzso zzso In all six animals, one complete MR exam was obtained within the time frame of days 9 to zzso zzso and zzso zzso scans were obtained before contrast injection, with the zzso scans acquired both with and without fat zzso zzso zzso scans also were zzso using fat zzso after the injection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in all zzso The film images were interpreted in a prospective fashion by a single zzso who was masked to imaging technique and contrast zzso The digital data was analyzed by region of interest zzso At the end of the imaging studies, the animals were sacrificed and the zzso zzso confirmed by gross and microscopic zzso 

On a prospective masked read of the MR films, zzso tumor was depicted best on zzso fat zzso zzso scans using a cumulative contrast dose of zzso zzso zzso contrast enhancement of the tumor was observed in all instances on zzso zzso The zzso zzso scan was least zzso for zzso identification and differentiation from the compressed spinal zzso Depending on the pulse sequence used, one zzso to three zzso without fat zzso of the zzso could not be identified zzso on zzso zzso zzso growth with time after zzso was chronicled by MR imaging, accompanied by progression of zzso On region of interest analysis, differentiation of zzso tumor from normal zzso was greatest zzso zzso zzso on zzso scans using a cumulative contrast dose of zzso zzso The level of differentiation achieved was twice that of zzso scans using a contrast dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results were superior on statistical analysis to that with all other scan techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor could not be differentiated on the basis of signal intensity, with any statistical significance, using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were confirmed in each animal by gross and microscopic zzso On inspection of the gross zzso the tumors were noted to be located in the zzso space and to cause zzso zzso On microscopic exam, the tumor was composed of zzso cells that were moderately zzso 

In the New Zealand White zzso an zzso tumor could be created consistently using the described zzso zzso These zzso are suitable for MR imaging studies, examining zzso zzso and efficacy of imaging zzso The zzso created in the current study could not be diagnosed zzso in all cases on zzso zzso and zzso scans zzso zzso scans were most zzso for diagnosis and zzso zzso with high-dose zzso zzso scans superior to standard dose zzso zzso
