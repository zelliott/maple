Complete zzso of the cervical canal following zzso is an uncommon zzso 

We encountered a case in a woman with zzso zzso who after zzso to treat cervical zzso zzso zzso 3 developed zzso and did not resume zzso This case was diagnosed early by zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso zzso women should be managed with care because of the increased risk of zzso of the cervical duct after zzso
