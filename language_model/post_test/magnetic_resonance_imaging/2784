We studied the effects on zzso dynamics at the zzso zzso and the clinical significance of the abnormal zzso motion in 14 patients with zzso type I zzso and 14 control subjects using zzso zzso zzso Dynamic zzso consisted of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso motion were zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso space at the zzso zzso zzso In zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso detected the abnormal zzso motion of the zzso zzso which produced a selective obstruction of zzso flow from the zzso cavity to the zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso and the severity of the zzso space reduction were associated with the symptom of zzso headache, but not with the presence of zzso The finding of abnormal valve dynamics of the zzso zzso revealed by zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso mechanisms suggested in pressure register studies and opens a new possibility in the zzso assessment of zzso patients with zzso zzso
