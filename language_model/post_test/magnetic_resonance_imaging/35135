The aim of the study is to determine whether the selective zzso zzso zzso delays onset of left zzso zzso zzso dysfunction or reduces zzso zzso in zzso patients with moderate to severe zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso function and progression of valve zzso were also zzso 

zzso zzso patients with a peak zzso valve zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso function were zzso double blind to zzso 100 zzso daily zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso for a median of 19 zzso range 15 to 25) zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso were performed and zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured at baseline and zzso 

zzso deterioration occurred in 13 subjects zzso to zzso and 11 to zzso zzso zzso zzso Change in zzso mass index zzso change zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso 15 zzso per year, P zzso zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso per year, P zzso zzso and zzso zzso volume index zzso zzso 9 vs zzso zzso 12 zzso per year, P zzso zzso were small and similar for patients zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso valve area zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso worsening of zzso zzso dysfunction by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso increase in the plasma level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso per year, P zzso zzso and decline in physical function score (9 zzso 34 vs 12 zzso zzso P zzso zzso were similar for subjects zzso to zzso and zzso zzso 

In zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso did not slow onset of zzso zzso or zzso dysfunction, decrease zzso mass, or reduce progression of valve zzso
