zzso into sleep is accompanied by disengagement of the conscious brain from the external zzso It follows that this process should be associated with reduced neural activity in regions of the brain known to mediate interaction with the zzso We examined blood oxygen dependent zzso signal functional connectivity using conventional zzso analyses in 3 primary sensory and 3 association networks as normal young adults zzso from zzso to light sleep while lying immobile in the bore of a magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso connectivity was maintained in each network throughout all examined states of zzso Indeed, correlations within the zzso attention network modestly but significantly increased during light sleep compared to zzso Moreover, our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso signal zzso generally increases in light zzso These results do not support the view that ongoing zzso fluctuations primarily reflect zzso zzso Rather, accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that spontaneous zzso fluctuations reflect processes that maintain the integrity of functional systems in the zzso
