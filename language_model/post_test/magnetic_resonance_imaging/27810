The long-term effect of hamstring zzso harvest for anterior cruciate ligament zzso reconstruction on muscle zzso is not well zzso Our hypothesis was that harvest of the hamstring zzso for zzso reconstruction would result in persistent loss of volume and zzso area of the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso resonance images were made of both limbs of ten patients nine to zzso years after they had zzso reconstruction with zzso hamstring zzso The volume of the individual thigh muscles zzso was zzso The peak zzso area and the zzso area 7 zzso zzso to the joint line was measured for the zzso and zzso zzso Data were evaluated with use of the paired zzso test and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso muscles on the zzso treated side were evaluated for fatty zzso and zzso zzso 

The mean volume on the zzso treated side was zzso of that on the zzso side for the zzso muscle and zzso for the zzso zzso A zzso decrease in zzso volume and an zzso increase in the volume of the long head of the biceps on the zzso treated zzso were zzso The zzso muscle and short head of the biceps muscle showed no difference in zzso The zzso and zzso muscles also showed a decrease in peak zzso area, a decrease in the zzso area 7 zzso zzso to the joint line, and evidence of fatty zzso There was variable evidence of zzso or zzso formation within the zzso bed, with most patients having some tissue that blended into either the zzso muscle or zzso zzso zzso at a level zzso to the joint zzso 

At nine to zzso years after zzso reconstruction with zzso hamstring zzso the zzso and zzso muscles showed persistent zzso on the zzso treated side with evidence of fatty zzso and zzso in zzso zzso There was also persistent zzso of the zzso muscles and zzso zzso of the long head of the zzso
