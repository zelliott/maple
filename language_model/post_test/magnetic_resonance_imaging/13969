zzso zzso with absent corpus zzso and ambiguous zzso is a newly recognized syndrome responsible for a severe neurological disorder of zzso onset in zzso Based on the observations of 3 new cases, we confirm the zzso in affected boys, describe additional zzso findings, report the zzso data, and show that carrier females may exhibit neurological and magnetic resonance imaging zzso In affected boys, consistent clinical features of zzso zzso with absent corpus zzso and ambiguous zzso are intractable zzso of zzso zzso severe zzso poor zzso zzso zzso and early zzso On magnetic resonance imaging, a zzso zzso consisting of anterior zzso and zzso zzso with a moderately thickened brain cortex, zzso zzso zzso and complete zzso of the corpus zzso are consistently zzso zzso examination of the brain shows a zzso zzso containing exclusively zzso zzso a zzso migration zzso a disorganization of the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso white zzso Finally, females related to affected boys may have mental zzso and zzso and they often display zzso of the corpus zzso These findings expand the zzso of zzso zzso with absent corpus zzso and ambiguous zzso may help in the detection of carrier females in affected families, and give arguments for a zzso zzso mode of zzso
