The monetary incentive delay zzso task zzso zzso is an imaging paradigm used to measure neural activity of incentive zzso zzso The task reliably elicits zzso zzso and is commonly used with both adult and adolescent zzso but is not designed for use with zzso In the current article, we present data on the newly designed zzso zzso a child-friendly analog of the zzso zzso We demonstrate the task can be used successfully in children to study the neural zzso of anticipatory incentive zzso zzso from a behavioral study and a zzso study are zzso In Study zzso a sample of 8- to 14-year-old children demonstrates expected behavioral zzso subjects responded most quickly and most accurately on trials with greater potential zzso older children displayed faster reaction times than zzso In Study zzso 8- to 12-year-old children showed neural zzso patterns consistent with those seen in adults in the zzso zzso zzso was modulated by cue incentive value in zzso regions, including the zzso thalamus, zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso Study results suggest that the zzso task is a valid analog of the zzso task, and can be used to assess neural zzso of reward processing in children as young as zzso years of zzso
