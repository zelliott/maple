Local treatment options for zzso zzso in zzso zzso are virtually identical to those for early invasive breast cancer, despite the fact that the survival from this condition is much zzso Our ability to more appropriately tailor therapy for zzso is hampered by a lack of understanding of the natural history of zzso our limited ability to predict the rate of progression to invasive cancer and the response to therapy, and the absence of tools to follow patients who have not had invasive zzso zzso therapy, which has been proven to be both safe and effective in tailoring treatments for invasive cancer, could be zzso suited to zzso However, zzso therapy requires that doctors and patients delay surgical treatment that has known zzso In order to successfully introduce this approach into clinical practice, risk assessment and decision support tools will be needed to help physicians and patients feel comfortable that they are not being exposed to unnecessary or excessive zzso In addition, we need better imaging to track extent and progression of zzso Among the possible benefits of the zzso approach, we may discover that many zzso are responsive and some even zzso leaving us with treatments that might be tailored to biology and with important clues for breast cancer prevention in high-risk zzso
