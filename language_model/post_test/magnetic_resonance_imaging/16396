A retrospective zzso 

The aim of this study is to highlight one of the under recognized and under reported aspects of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and to discuss the zzso zzso signs, causes as well as the surgical and zzso implications of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso is being increasingly recognized as a cause of zzso One of the surgical pitfalls in the management of this condition is zzso of the zzso mater in zzso zzso identification of ossified zzso mater will be helpful to the surgeon to modify the surgical technique and to counsel patients regarding the risks of zzso 

A retrospective analysis of a database of zzso maintained by this author was done to identify cases of zzso where there was zzso evidence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only those patients who had both zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso were included in the zzso Patients with MR imaging alone were excluded from the analysis as CT evaluation was not done routinely in the earlier part of the zzso zzso grading was used to assess the zzso status before and after zzso The CT and MR images of these patients were analyzed to identify zzso signs of zzso zzso The pattern of zzso zzso if present, was zzso The zzso and zzso complications were zzso 

During the study period from 1997 to 2006, there were 20 patients with zzso who had both CT and MR imaging zzso Of these 20 patients, 8 had zzso evidence of zzso zzso and these patients also sustained zzso zzso during zzso Of these 8 patients, CT evidence of zzso zzso was found in zzso In the remaining one patient, there was no zzso evidence of zzso zzso The zzso signs of zzso zzso as depicted in the bone windows of CT were of 2 zzso zzso the zzso track zzso where there was a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso center and zzso the zzso zzso where there was evidence of zzso of one-half of the circumference of the zzso Of these 7 patients, 4 developed zzso fluid zzso leak following surgery and 1 of these 4 patients developed zzso zzso function improved by one zzso grade in 5 of the 7 zzso In the remaining 2 patients, there was no change in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a common finding in zzso There are 2 zzso signs of zzso zzso zzso the zzso track zzso and the zzso zzso zzso identification of zzso zzso might help the surgeon to anticipate and appropriately deal with zzso zzso during zzso This will also help to counsel patients regarding the risks of surgery for zzso The surgical and zzso implications of zzso zzso are being zzso
