To zzso characterize magnetic resonance zzso zzso findings in patients with cam zzso zzso zzso and in those with zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were not zzso MR zzso studies obtained in 50 consecutive patients (30 men, 20 zzso mean age, zzso zzso with zzso were analyzed for zzso zzso cartilage zzso and zzso abnormalities of the zzso zzso The zzso shape of the zzso head at the zzso junction was measured in eight positions around the zzso head and neck and used to calculate the alpha zzso zzso depth was zzso zzso diagnosis served as the reference zzso The zzso rank sum test was used for statistical zzso 

At surgery, hips in 33 patients were classified as having cam zzso and hips in 17 patients were classified as having zzso zzso In both groups, the mean age of patients was zzso zzso There were significantly more men zzso zzso zzso with cam zzso and more women zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The alpha angle was significantly larger in patients with cam zzso at the anterior and zzso zzso The zzso was significantly deeper in patients with zzso zzso than in patients with cam zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and superior positions were significantly larger in patients with cam zzso than in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso position were significantly larger and zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso positions were more pronounced in patients with zzso zzso than in patients with cam zzso zzso abnormalities were not significantly different between the zzso zzso bump formation at the zzso neck was significantly more common in patients with cam zzso than in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso MR zzso findings of cam zzso include large alpha angles and cartilage zzso at the zzso position and zzso bump formation at the zzso zzso characteristic findings of zzso zzso include a deep zzso and zzso cartilage zzso
