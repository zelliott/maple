The extent of fat suppression using short zzso inversion recovery zzso imaging is variable between zzso Our aim was to determine if patient's age and/or hoof temperature have an influence on the zzso relaxation time of bone zzso in the zzso zzso zzso thereby affecting the suppression of fat zzso zzso resonance imaging was conducted on standing horses and zzso samples using a zzso magnet zzso zzso The hoof temperature was measured at the lateral side of the coronary zzso A modified inversion recovery fast zzso zzso sequence was used to measure the signal intensity for a range of inversion times zzso at six different regions of interest zzso zzso zzso aspect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso aspect of the middle zzso zzso zzso aspect of the middle zzso zzso zzso bone, zzso zzso aspect of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso aspect of the zzso zzso The zzso of the bone zzso in the zzso zzso limb was calculated from the results and was found to increase by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant effect of age zzso zzso but the zzso values measured from the limbs of young zzso 1 zzso animals were considerably longer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar effects of temperature and age were found for all measured zzso but there were significant differences in the mean values of zzso , ranging from zzso zzso aspect of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso aspect of the zzso zzso
