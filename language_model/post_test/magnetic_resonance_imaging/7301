The zzso which is important for movement control and planning, is often affected by many neurological zzso Until now there has been limited information regarding how the function of the zzso impacts driving zzso This study used zzso with an integrated virtual reality driving simulator to determine which aspects of driving performance are related to the zzso in healthy drivers zzso zzso It also investigated drivers with focal zzso zzso to identify how damage to this brain region zzso driving zzso The results showed that zzso functioning is responsible for zzso coordination and complex zzso integration necessary to execute driving zzso As predicted, drivers with zzso damage, showed significantly compromised speed control during basic driving conditions, whereas their ability to perform during interactive driving situations was zzso New insights into neural mechanisms and brain plasticity regarding driving zzso are zzso Strategies in assessing and zzso drivers with related neurological conditions are zzso
