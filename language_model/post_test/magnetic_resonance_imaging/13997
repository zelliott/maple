To detect zzso of the zzso fluid zzso flow related to the heartbeat and zzso lower than zzso zzso and to compare these zzso of zzso and blood flow in cerebral vessels by using echo zzso imaging in real time zzso The existence of such waves has been well known but has not yet been shown by zzso 

In a slice perpendicular to the aqueduct, zzso flow as well as zzso could be determined in zzso zzso zzso artery, and zzso zzso After zzso analysis, four frequency bands were zzso 

In the very zzso zzso zzso range, the zzso under the zzso zzso were more closely related to zzso zzso than to changes in the zzso Also, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso under the zzso zzso corresponded with zzso and zzso zzso
