Almost 15 years after its zzso evidence for the zzso zzso between a zzso action stream and a zzso perception stream in the human cerebral zzso is still based largely on zzso case zzso To date, there is no unequivocal evidence for separate visual zzso of object features for performance of zzso actions versus zzso tasks in the zzso intact human zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test explicitly whether or not brain areas zzso size zzso for grasping are distinct from those zzso size zzso for zzso 

zzso were presented with the same real zzso zzso objects and were required to perform a number of different tasks: grasping, zzso size discrimination, pattern discrimination or passive zzso As in prior studies, the anterior zzso area zzso in the zzso stream was more active during grasping, when object size was relevant for planning the zzso than during zzso when object properties were irrelevant for movement planning zzso zzso in zzso showed no zzso however, when size was zzso in the context of a purely zzso task zzso zzso pattern zzso zzso the lateral zzso zzso zzso in the zzso stream was modulated when size was zzso for perception zzso zzso but not for action zzso zzso zzso 

While areas in both the zzso and zzso zzso responded to the simple presentation of zzso objects zzso zzso these areas were zzso activated depending on whether the task was grasping or zzso discrimination, zzso The demonstration of dual coding of an object for the purposes of action on the one hand and perception on the other in the same healthy brains offers a substantial contribution to the current debate about the nature of the neural coding that takes place in the zzso and zzso zzso
