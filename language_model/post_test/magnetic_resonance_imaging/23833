The design and interpretation of MR imaging studies of patients with suspected spinal vascular disease are based on a knowledge of zzso and zzso zzso This article describes the major zzso vessels and their appearance on zzso MR images and zzso MR zzso Current zzso MR techniques primarily detect zzso which may be increased in apparent number, size, or zzso in the pathological conditions zzso These characteristics of abnormal veins have yet to be zzso and differentiation between normal and abnormal is sometimes zzso zzso with the appearance of normal veins on MR zzso zzso recognition of abnormal vessels and thus the zzso of a more accurate differential diagnosis in the patient with a zzso or zzso zzso zzso In the future, zzso zzso MR zzso may achieve adequate spatial and zzso resolution to differentiate spinal arteries from spinal zzso This differentiation could further simplify the diagnosis of vascular zzso depending or the complexity of the vascular pattern zzso Also, the combination of MR zzso and diffusion imaging of the zzso may finally provide the information needed for characterization by MR imaging of clinically suspected zzso zzso
