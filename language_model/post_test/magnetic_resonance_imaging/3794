zzso was employed to follow the neurodegenerative zzso and the zzso of inflammatory cells by zzso labeled zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso rats (9 and 13 months after 10 zzso of cardiac zzso zzso of zzso rats zzso zzso zzso barrier zzso leakage in the area of the zzso zzso and zzso level in zzso zzso zzso unlike zzso magnetic zzso zzso ultra small zzso iron oxide particles zzso zzso revealed zzso areas in the zzso region and zzso not found in animals that were not injected with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso with indications of zzso in zzso lateral zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In the zzso and zzso regions, it was noted that zzso and zzso zzso appear in zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso confirmed the zzso presence in zzso brain zzso of the zzso and zzso The above observations thus point to a persistent dysfunction of zzso that in long-term may still lead to zzso of T cells that are predominantly of helper zzso zzso Such inflammatory processes are backed by zzso activity even up to 1 year after zzso Moreover, in these animals an zzso expression of zzso markers and zzso migration was also revealed in the zzso zzso Thus, a balance of degenerative processes and inflammatory surveillance with zzso could determine the long-term outcome of global zzso survival or the previously proposed formation of zzso plaques and zzso zzso
