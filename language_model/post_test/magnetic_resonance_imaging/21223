zzso zzso artery zzso zzso is common in cardiovascular diseases and associated with hypertension, zzso dysfunction and/or heart zzso There is a paucity of data about the prevalence and the role of zzso in the zzso of combined chronic heart failure zzso and chronic kidney disease zzso We investigated the prevalence in patients with combined zzso and its association with zzso function, cardiac dysfunction and the presence and extent of zzso zzso 

The zzso study zzso investigates the role of zzso in zzso patients with combined zzso zzso subjects underwent combined cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso including late zzso enhancement, with magnetic resonance zzso of the zzso arteries zzso 

MR study was performed in 37 patients zzso age 74 years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso of which 21 zzso had zzso zzso as zzso zzso Of these 21 subjects, 8 zzso had more severe zzso zzso and 8 zzso had a bilateral zzso zzso (or previous bilateral zzso There were no differences in age, zzso levels and medication profile between patients with zzso versus those zzso Renal function declined with the severity of zzso zzso zzso zzso although this was not significantly different between patients with zzso versus those zzso Diabetes zzso was more prevalent in patients without zzso zzso against those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence and extent of late zzso enhancement, depicting zzso fibrosis, did not differ zzso zzso zzso nor did end zzso volume zzso zzso zzso left zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither was there a difference in the presence of an zzso pattern of late enhancement in patients with zzso versus those zzso 

zzso is prevalent in combined zzso and its severity is associated with a decline in zzso zzso However, its presence does not correlate with a worse zzso a higher left zzso mass or with the presence and extent of zzso zzso Further research is required for the role of zzso in the zzso of combined chronic heart and zzso zzso
