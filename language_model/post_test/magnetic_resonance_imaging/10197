zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to map brain zzso during language zzso While previous studies have compared performance between zzso literate and illiterate subjects, there have been no such data in zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso to examine the effects of education on neural zzso associated with silent word recognition and silent zzso tasks in 24 healthy right-handed Chinese subjects (12 zzso and 12 zzso There were 30 single Chinese characters in the silent word recognition task and 30 meaningful zzso in the silent zzso zzso When we compared literate and illiterate subjects, we observed zzso differences in zzso patterns in the left zzso frontal zzso and both sides of the superior zzso zzso for the silent word recognition task and in the bilateral zzso frontal zzso and left zzso zzso zzso for the silent zzso zzso These results indicate that the patterns of neural zzso associated with language tasks are strongly influenced by zzso Education appears to have enhanced cognitive processing efficiency in language zzso
