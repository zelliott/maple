Deep brain stimulation zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising new procedure for the treatment of zzso The authors describe their technical approach for placing zzso into the zzso in awake patients with zzso including methodology for zzso mapping of the zzso in the zzso state, clinical outcomes and zzso and the location of zzso associated with optimal zzso 

zzso adult and pediatric patients with various forms of zzso were included in this zzso zzso neurological status and zzso improvement in motor function were measured using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso leads was performed using magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recording, and zzso test stimulation to determine thresholds for zzso adverse zzso zzso locations were measured on zzso zzso zzso MR images according to a prospective zzso 

zzso guided zzso of zzso zzso in patients with zzso was technically feasible in the awake state in most patients, and the morbidity rate was zzso zzso discharge rates of zzso zzso in zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso such that the two zzso must be distinguished by zzso discharge patterns rather than zzso Active zzso locations associated with robust improvement zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso were located near the zzso plane, at a mean distance from the zzso border of zzso zzso
