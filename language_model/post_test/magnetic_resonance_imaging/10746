Brain zzso is disturbed by cerebral zzso zzso zzso Our study was conducted to determine the zzso effects on this disturbed zzso 

MR zzso imaging with independent component analysis was performed in five healthy subjects and 19 patients with zzso before and after zzso zzso 6 months up to 2 zzso zzso map relative cerebral blood volume zzso cerebral blood flow zzso and mean transient time zzso were zzso zzso of interest zzso on zzso target sections were defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the rest of the zzso zzso zzso immediately zzso to the zzso A, immediately anterior to the zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso served as internal zzso zzso ratios of zzso were zzso zzso zzso U tests and generalized linear models were used for statistical zzso 

Before zzso patients' zzso zzso and zzso ratios were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso Three types of zzso zzso zzso were zzso From the first zzso follow-up at 6 months, zzso zzso and zzso ratios gradually decreased to zzso (both P zzso zzso whereas zzso ratios gradually increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso ratios decreased after zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating reversal of steal toward normal zzso 

zzso high zzso flow and zzso zzso disturbances were zzso They gradually changed toward normal zzso after zzso This explains, in part, the zzso factors of zzso and therapeutic zzso
