The goal of this study was to characterize the signal intensity zzso pattern in the zzso zzso from zzso spin echo magnetic resonance zzso images and zzso zzso zzso constructive interference in steady state zzso MR images that were obtained from a zzso group of patients with an enlarged zzso aqueduct zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso 

A retrospective zzso 

zzso referral zzso 

Eleven subjects zzso zzso with at least 1 zzso zzso and bilateral EVA confirmed by zzso bone zzso zzso were zzso 

The MR images of 22 ears were reviewed zzso 

The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from 2 sequences were compared and zzso The presence of anomalies of the zzso were also zzso In addition, the caloric test results were also reviewed to characterize the zzso function in a subset of our cohort (12 zzso 

zzso 3-D zzso MR images revealed a more variable zzso in the enlarged zzso system than did the zzso zzso There was a hierarchy for the order of zzso loss from the zzso system on the zzso 3-D zzso MR zzso There were 3 cases where the zzso loss from the zzso zzso on the zzso 3-D zzso images, was associated with an abnormal caloric zzso 

The zzso of the zzso observed on zzso 3-D zzso images of EVA patients, with zzso zzso showed a distinctive pattern, and the results from this study suggest a potential role for the MR imaging in providing physicians with better information about the functional status of the inner zzso
