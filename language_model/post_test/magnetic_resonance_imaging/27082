In patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso is detected by ultrasound zzso zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso US is recommended for screening and zzso We performed a retrospective analysis of the abilities of these zzso imaging zzso to detect zzso 

We analyzed data from zzso consecutive adult patients with zzso who received liver transplants within 6 months of imaging at a zzso care zzso Imaging reports and serum zzso levels were compared with results from pathology analysis of zzso as the reference zzso zzso of zzso CT, and zzso were calculated overall and in defined size zzso zzso imaging results and zzso zzso were zzso 

Of the zzso patients, 225 zzso had zzso confirmed by pathology analysis of liver zzso In 23 cases, the zzso were zzso or extensively zzso In the remaining 202 zzso zzso zzso discrete zzso respective zzso sensitivities of zzso CT, and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso overall and zzso zzso and zzso for small zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of US increased with the availability of CT or zzso data zzso zzso zzso sensitivity values were zzso and zzso for zzso 2-4 and zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso CT, and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso CT, and zzso did not detect small zzso zzso with high levels of sensitivity, although CT and zzso provide substantial improvements over zzso US in patients with zzso who received liver zzso
