The effects of aging on the zzso function are largely described in the zzso literature but little data is available on the beginning of this age-related zzso 

In this study, we described the cortical zzso of middle-aged zzso age zzso standard error to the mean, zzso zzso zzso subjects compared to young zzso zzso zzso and elderly subjects zzso zzso 3) while they performed a zzso zzso task during functional magnetic resonance zzso The task consisted in identifying the printing color of a word regardless of its zzso Three conditions were defined depending on the meaning of this zzso neutral (no zzso zzso zzso name matching the printing zzso zzso zzso name zzso the printing zzso with interference effect in the zzso 

zzso subjects were as slow as elderly compared to young for all conditions and both were less accurate than young subjects during interference zzso zzso showed an activity more bilateral and greater in the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso during both zzso and zzso conditions compared to zzso zzso showed an zzso level of activity between those of elderly and young subjects in the left zzso zzso and zzso zzso only during zzso zzso 

These results suggested that the age-related impairment of the zzso process could already occur around the age of 50 years and consist in an increase of the activity in the left prefrontal and zzso zzso before increasing more and becoming bilateral around the age of 60 zzso
