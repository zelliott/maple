Recent advances in high field magnetic resonance technology have increased the interest in the phase of the complex zzso zzso phase images are derived from the phase signal by removing the bias field and phase wraps from the initial zzso However, the usefulness of this data has been hindered by artifacts at the zzso surface, particularly in cortical zzso A method is proposed that efficiently removes surface artifacts by performing zzso filtering with zzso varying parameters of zzso or complex filtered phase zzso The proposed method is shown to produce improved images, revealing underlying structure and detail that are otherwise obscured by surface artifacts in images produced by traditional phase processing zzso
