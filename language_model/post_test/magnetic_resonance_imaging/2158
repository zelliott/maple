Severe zzso zzso is an important cause of brain injury in the newborn zzso We examined early events after hypoxic zzso zzso in the zzso mouse brain by zzso and related them to long-term functional effects and zzso in the same animals at 4 to 5 weeks of zzso 

zzso was induced in zzso zzso mice by exposure to zzso oxygen for 30 minutes after zzso of the left common carotid zzso The resulting unilateral focal zzso was evaluated in zzso by zzso zzso maps and apparent diffusion zzso zzso at 3, 6, and 24 hours and 5 days after zzso zzso and zzso function were analyzed after 3 zzso Four weeks after zzso the mice were killed, and zzso zzso brain sections were examined zzso 

A decrease in apparent diffusion zzso values in zzso on the affected side was found at 3 hours after zzso zzso values were significantly increased after 6 hours and remained so for 5 zzso zzso size of the zzso was attained at 3 to 6 hours after zzso and declined zzso Animals with zzso zzso had decreased forward zzso performed worse than controls in the zzso test, and showed a unilateral zzso in the zzso zzso brain sections 4 weeks zzso 

The zzso progression of the damage after zzso in zzso mice differs from that of the adult brain as judged by zzso The early zzso detected by zzso were related to functional zzso for these mice in zzso zzso
