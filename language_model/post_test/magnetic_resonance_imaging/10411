The objective of this study was to evaluate a zzso zzso zzso echo zzso imaging approach using a very short zzso TE for routine zzso imaging of the brain at 3 zzso 

Patient examinations were compared from a 3 T magnetic resonance zzso unit located immediately adjacent to a similarly equipped zzso T zzso zzso and zzso zzso images were evaluated and compared at zzso versus 3 T with a zzso zzso spin echo sequence used at zzso T and a zzso zzso sequence at 3 zzso The 2 MR systems used are from the same zzso use similar zzso zzso and use identical zzso The zzso zzso zzso used at 3 zzso relies on a short TE zzso zzso to limit zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed on 16 different zzso patient examinations at both field strengths (32 total) and similarly on 10 different zzso and zzso zzso examinations (40 zzso Four blinded zzso also evaluated these zzso 

Using an zzso zzso slice depicting the zzso nucleus zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso 70 zzso 7, 3 T zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 214 zzso 35 zzso 82 zzso 10), 3 T markedly outperformed zzso T in both zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso 12 zzso zzso On zzso imaging, despite a reduction in slice thickness (5 to 3 zzso and scan time (5 to 1 zzso there was no significant difference zzso or zzso in zzso and zzso comparing 3 and zzso zzso On blinded film review, 3 T performed slightly better on zzso scans than zzso T in regard to motion artifacts zzso zzso matter zzso and overall image zzso On zzso scans, 3 T performed markedly better in all 3 categories both zzso and zzso In regard to overall image quality, 3 T was preferred zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging can be readily performed at 3 T using a short TE zzso zzso zzso This approach offers superior zzso and zzso with reduced motion artifacts and scan time as compared with imaging at zzso T and is advocated for routine brain imaging at 3 zzso It is robust zzso in over 1500 patients to zzso and does not experience significant specific zzso ratio limitations, poor tissue contrast, or zzso motion artifacts like encountered with spin echo zzso imaging at 3 zzso
