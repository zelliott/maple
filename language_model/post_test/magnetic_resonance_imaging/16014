zzso zzso studies have identified zzso brain zzso However, no study has investigated the zzso aspect of zzso brain zzso Here this issue was investigated using zzso evoked itch in ten healthy zzso zzso stimuli were applied to the left wrist and brain activity was measured using zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso In the zzso experiment, the magnetic responses evoked by the itch stimuli were observed in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso associated with the magnetic responses were mainly located in the zzso zzso subjects) and zzso zzso subjects) secondary zzso zzso zzso which were also activated by the itch stimuli in the zzso zzso We also observed an zzso magnetic response in the zzso part of the zzso region in six zzso zzso and zzso data showed that the magnetic response in this region was mainly associated with zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso was significantly longer in the zzso than that in the zzso zzso suggesting the difference to be associated with transmission in the zzso zzso The timing of zzso of the zzso was between those of the zzso and zzso zzso Other sources were located in the zzso primary zzso and anterior zzso zzso (one subject zzso This study is the first to demonstrate part of the time course of zzso brain zzso Combining methods with high zzso and spatial resolution zzso zzso and zzso would be useful to investigate the zzso aspect of the brain mechanism of zzso
