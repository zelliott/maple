A method for zzso zzso using a single zzso zzso inversion recovery prepared, true fast imaging with zzso zzso zzso acquisition at low flip angle zzso was implemented in this zzso zzso values measured by zzso technique in a zzso water phantom and the human brain and abdomen of healthy volunteers were compared with the results of the standard zzso fast spin echo zzso zzso A good correlation between the two methods was observed zzso in the zzso and zzso in the brain and abdominal zzso The zzso values of the zzso agreed well with published zzso zzso enables fast zzso of zzso to be obtained within a single zzso with good zzso which is particularly important for chest and abdominal zzso
