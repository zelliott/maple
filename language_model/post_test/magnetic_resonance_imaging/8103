The purpose of our study was to correlate zzso characteristics with rotator cuff zzso injury on magnetic resonance imaging after fractures of the zzso zzso We zzso obtained magnetic resonance imaging on 30 patients with zzso zzso fractures after zzso each fracture zzso using zzso and zzso systems and determining the displacement of the greater zzso Twelve patients zzso had either complete zzso or zzso of at least one of the rotator cuff zzso No zzso was identified in the rotator cuff zzso in nine patients zzso zzso of injury to the rotator cuff zzso increased substantially with respect to increasing zzso and zzso classes and 5 zzso or greater displacement of the greater zzso zzso Additional study is needed to determine the exact role of rotator cuff zzso injury in the ultimate function attained by patients with zzso zzso zzso
