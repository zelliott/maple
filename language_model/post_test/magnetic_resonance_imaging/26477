zzso zzso zzso are zzso for commonly used zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and so zzso Imaging of these sites in the living human brain may provide an important tool to evaluate the mechanisms of action as well as to monitor the treatment of depressed zzso zzso and characterization of an improved zzso imaging agent, zzso zzso was zzso The new compound, zzso displayed an extremely potent binding affinity toward zzso ( zzso zzso in membrane preparations of zzso cell lines expressing the specific zzso zzso zzso also showed more than zzso selectivity for zzso over zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ( zzso and 840 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso compound zzso showed an excellent brain zzso in rats zzso dose at 2 zzso post intravenous zzso zzso and consistently displayed the highest zzso (between zzso zzso post IV zzso in zzso a region with the highest density of zzso The specific zzso of zzso in the zzso exhibited the highest zzso ratio zzso - zzso was zzso at 120 zzso post IV zzso The preliminary imaging study of zzso in the brain of a zzso by single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso post IV injection indicated a specific zzso in zzso region rich in zzso These data suggest that the new zzso zzso may be useful for zzso imaging of zzso binding sites in the human zzso
