The neural zzso of the dual working memory zzso process were investigated using concurrent performance of auditory and visual zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso behavioral testing, a lettered zzso zzso paradigm was implemented for an zzso examination of healthy volunteers who performed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso simultaneous visual and auditory zzso zzso The behavioral performance, as measured by the reaction time, was deteriorated in the dual task condition compared to the single task zzso Group analysis of the zzso data revealed that the majority of zzso identified during each component task was zzso activated in the dual task zzso However, several neural zzso such as left middle frontal zzso left superior zzso zzso zzso aspect of right inferior zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso were selectively activated during the dual zzso zzso These data suggest that new neural networks come into play to assist in the greater load placed on the zzso with the zzso stimulation zzso which may also have implications in zzso zzso zzso
