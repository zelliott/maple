This article shows that zzso the zzso kernel for a constant integral can make a significant improvement in performance of zzso zzso zzso A comparison was performed between standard and zzso zzso kernels of various sizes using data from four commonly used magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso Standard zzso were performed and compared with a zzso zzso data set generated by use of a large (13 zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of systematic zzso intensity offset error and zzso of generated zzso were used to estimate zzso zzso zzso zzso estimates of the zzso savings in zzso time were compared with the measured time required for each zzso and with the automated image registration zzso zzso The use of a small (5 zzso 5 zzso 5) zzso kernel produced relative errors comparable to those in the gold standard data set, allowing saving in zzso time of up to 30 times in comparison with standard zzso zzso This approach brings the zzso of MR volume zzso much closer to the demands of a clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
