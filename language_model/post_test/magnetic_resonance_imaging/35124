The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical features and the characteristics of MR images of patients with zzso zzso zzso 

We reviewed the MR findings and clinical features of 31 consecutive patients (20 men, 11 zzso mean age zzso zzso who had been diagnosed with clinical zzso zzso zzso between the zzso locations on each MR sequence were analyzed using a zzso zzso The clinical and MR findings were compared in relation to the zzso and clinical zzso 

The most frequently involved site, seen as high signal intensity on zzso images, was the corpus zzso (20 zzso followed by the zzso nucleus (16 zzso and the zzso zzso (13 zzso zzso associations were seen between the zzso and the zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the red nucleus, between the zzso zzso and the zzso nucleus, and between the red nucleus and the zzso nucleus on the zzso and zzso images zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso red nucleus, and zzso nucleus were involved zzso with the corpus zzso more frequently in zzso zzso grades 3 and zzso 

zzso involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus axis was the main MR pattern in zzso zzso zzso which connected with various areas of the zzso We zzso that these overlapping MR features could be regarded as an entity zzso as the zzso zzso zzso
