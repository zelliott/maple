Here we demonstrate that differentiation between zzso zzso tumor progression zzso and radiation necrosis zzso can be achieved with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained from zzso verified 38 zzso 8 complete RN, and 5 zzso cases with partial residual zzso The zzso zzso ratios for these groups were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten zzso patients underwent zzso twice zzso before and once after radiation zzso due to enlargement of the original zzso or the development of new zzso post zzso The zzso ratios of ten original site zzso had decreased by the second zzso and these zzso were revealed to be zzso In contrast, the zzso ratios of two zzso distant from the original site increased, and these zzso were revealed as cases of zzso Repeat PET imaging was found to be useful for evaluating changes in zzso tumor activity with respect to the treatment zzso
