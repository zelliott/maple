The value of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in assessing iron overload in the zzso was zzso investigated in 40 consecutive zzso MR appearance, measure of signal intensity and zzso and zzso times were correlated with the zzso determined level of iron in the zzso in each zzso zzso examination revealed no iron overload in 19 patients, mild iron overload in seven, moderate iron overload in six, and severe iron overload in zzso All 19 patients with no zzso iron overload and 11 of the other 21 patients with zzso iron overload were correctly identified by MR imaging zzso zzso specificity zzso accuracy zzso zzso iron overload was diagnosed when a decrease of signal intensity of the zzso compared with those of zzso tissue and zzso zzso was zzso MR images demonstrated all eight cases of zzso three of the six cases of moderate, and none of the seven cases of mild iron zzso Only zzso with severe iron overload had a significant mean decrease in signal intensity and zzso and zzso zzso Although specific, MR imaging is poorly sensitive to zzso iron zzso
