To compare changes in apparent diffusion zzso zzso in zzso meningitis using serial zzso imaging zzso 

Thirty zzso with meningitis and 12 zzso controls were studied using zzso zzso was zzso by placing region of zzso on zzso white matter during acute illness and again at 21 zzso Three groups of patients were zzso those with normal findings on both conventional zzso and zzso those with abnormal zzso only and those with abnormal conventional zzso as well as zzso zzso assessment was performed in controls and patients at 3 months using Indian adaptation of zzso scales of infant development zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso meningitis with normal imaging zzso zzso 8) showed no significant difference in zzso compared to zzso Patients showing zzso only on zzso zzso zzso 10) and on both conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso than controls at baseline zzso zzso study showed no significant differences in zzso in controls compared to any patient zzso zzso reduced zzso scores were observed in patient groups compared to zzso 

We conclude that quantitative zzso may detect zzso zzso early in brain zzso which may be associated with abnormal motor and mental zzso
