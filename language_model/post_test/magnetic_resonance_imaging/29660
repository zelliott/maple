To assess the ability of zzso zzso and serum tumor marker zzso for the early prediction of response in patients with zzso germ cell tumors zzso undergoing salvage high-dose chemotherapy zzso 

Before zzso of zzso 19 patients with zzso from zzso were evaluated with zzso CT or zzso and TM after 2-3 cycles of induction chemotherapy and the results compared with those of the baseline zzso PET was analyzed visually and zzso by calculating the standard zzso value zzso CT or zzso was evaluated for changes in tumor size zzso zzso disease zzso zzso viable zzso partial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso density or signal intensity, zzso and contrast zzso For the zzso the worse case, zzso the most vital zzso detected in a patient, was zzso The reference standard was the result of the zzso after zzso of any residual masses (N zzso 10) and/or the zzso follow-up for at least 6 months after completion of the treatment (N zzso zzso 

Six of zzso patients (32 zzso remained zzso for over 6 months following treatment, whereas 13 zzso zzso zzso The outcome of zzso was correctly predicted by zzso CT and TM in 89 zzso 67 % and 88 zzso zzso In 5 of 6 patients with successful zzso PET was negative zzso zzso zzso zzso with CT or zzso showing a partial zzso of the tumor in 4 of 5 zzso Of the 13 patients not cured by zzso the PET data were positive in all zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso results were true positive zzso or zzso in 8 and false negative zzso in 5 zzso The combined assessment of CT and TM corrected 3 false negative zzso and 1 false positive CT zzso Two patients with zzso outcome despite a favorable response by CT and TM criteria were exclusively identified by zzso The zzso sensitivities and zzso for the prediction of therapy response are as zzso PET zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso TM zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso has a high zzso value for predicting the response to chemotherapy in patients with zzso zzso early in the course of treatment and may improve patient selection for subsequent zzso zzso Especially in patients with response to induction chemotherapy according to CT or TM zzso PET offers additional information to detect patients with an overall zzso zzso
