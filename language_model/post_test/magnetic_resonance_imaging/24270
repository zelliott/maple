The study aims to assess whether the increasing use of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in place of diagnostic cardiac zzso in the management of pediatric patients with zzso heart disease has had an impact on pediatric cardiac zzso 

zzso analysis of data was zzso 

The study was performed at the zzso Children's Hospital zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnostic cardiac zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso from zzso are included zzso zzso zzso 

zzso length of stay, and zzso of complications were zzso In cases used to plan surgery, 30-day survival following the procedure was zzso zzso outcomes were compared between the two zzso zzso outcomes planned using zzso were compared with national outcomes from zzso zzso zzso zzso 

For zzso zzso patients, zzso male, median age 3 years, zzso range 1 to zzso median hospital stay was 1 day zzso range 0 to zzso and complications occurred in 11 zzso Median hospital stay for zzso zzso patients zzso male, median age 3 years, zzso range 0 to zzso was significantly zzso 0 days zzso range 0 to 1, P zzso with fewer complications (16 zzso P zzso zzso zzso and 283 zzso patients underwent surgery within 18 zzso One zzso patient zzso and four zzso patients zzso died within 30 days zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging has resulted in reduced rates of complication and shorter hospital stays without a significant impact on surgical zzso
