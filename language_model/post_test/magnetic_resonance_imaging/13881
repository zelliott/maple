The patterns of cortical zzso evoked by tactile and mechanical painful stimulation in six normal subjects and three patients with complete zzso of the corpus zzso are described and zzso with emphasis on the zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso was investigated by functional magnetic resonance zzso In both groups, painful stimulation activated the first zzso insular and zzso zzso in the zzso hemisphere, and the zzso zzso zzso in both zzso zzso between the two patterns of cortical zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso by unilateral painful stimulation is at least partially independent of the corpus zzso and suggests a different organization of the pain and touch zzso
