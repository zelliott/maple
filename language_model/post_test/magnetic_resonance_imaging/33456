A retrospective comparison was made between zzso bone scans and corresponding spine MR images in 35 patients who had complementary studies within 2 zzso Bone scans were performed with zzso imaging of the entire body and zzso was performed with a zzso zzso signal scanner using standard techniques with zzso and zzso zzso There were 18 male and 17 female patients diagnosed with cancer prior to these zzso Cancer diagnoses included 14 zzso 12 breast, 1 zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso 1 each of zzso melanoma, myeloma and zzso of unknown primary zzso Of the regions zzso 69 were positive for zzso zzso by zzso and 63 regions by bone zzso zzso regions were zzso positive and 56 regions zzso zzso No patients with entirely positive bone scans were negative by zzso but one patient was entirely positive by zzso but negative by a bone zzso At least one region was zzso read in 21 zzso Distribution of positive regions was similar on bone scan and zzso The greatest number and proportion of zzso readings occurred in the zzso regions and more frequently in patients with prostate zzso Considering its widespread availability and the ease of performing a zzso survey for zzso zzso bone scanning remains the study of choice for initial evaluation of patients with zzso However, zzso is an excellent complementary technique when bone scan findings are inadequate for answering clinical zzso zzso appears to be quite sensitive and probably more specific for zzso in certain locations of the zzso
