The zzso approach to the zzso junction area zzso requires a more or less extensive drilling of the two first cervical zzso zzso and zzso The extent of drilling necessary to zzso a zzso at the zzso was analyzed from a series of 125 cases including 114 zzso and 11 zzso processes treated using a lateral approach zzso or zzso over a 15-year period zzso The extent of drilling was estimated on CT scanner zzso views from the reduction of the zzso surface and three groups were zzso zzso than one third zzso one third and one half, and zzso than one zzso The extent of drilling was compared with the zzso location in relation to the bone limits of the zzso within these limits, outside them and into the zzso zzso It was also analyzed with regard to pathology when separated into three groups zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and non zzso zzso Only 26 cases had a significant zzso zzso more than one third of the joint surfaces and of these, 14 were more than one zzso In all these 14 cases, the bone structures were already invaded and 13 of them were, to some extent, beyond the bone limits of the zzso Of the 12 cases with drilling between one third and one half, 11 involved the bone structures and 1 was located inside the zzso bone zzso zzso of more than one third was required only in the case of bone zzso 10 out of 23 bone zzso all the 14 cases of zzso one case of zzso arthritis and one case of zzso joint zzso In the other cases including mostly zzso zzso drilling was limited to less than one third, though a high rate of complete removal was achieved zzso zzso by zzso with zzso zzso (N zzso 10) or by lateral bone zzso (N zzso 5) was achieved in all cases involving more than one half zzso and in one case of zzso By adequately choosing the surgical approach, the extent of drilling can always be zzso zzso bone zzso is only necessary when the zzso has already destroyed the zzso In that case, lateral or zzso fusion is an efficient zzso
