Reorganization of primary zzso zzso subsequent to either reduced or enhanced peripheral input is well zzso Recently, plastic changes following arm zzso in humans were shown to correlate with phantom limb zzso This raised the question whether spatial attention and pain may cause cortical reorganization in the absence of zzso Using zzso zzso imaging to study the zzso representation in the human primary zzso cortex, we report a delayed shift of the representation of digits 2-3 due to pain on the digits zzso which outlasted the pain by several zzso In contrast, reorganization during spatial attention was less zzso was seen almost immediately and only during the zzso These data indicate that spatial attention and pain without peripheral zzso cause cortical reorganization by different zzso The differential time course of zzso effects observed at the zzso may be due to zzso of the zzso pathways by zzso input from the spinal zzso zzso zzso
