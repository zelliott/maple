The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the presence of joint zzso joint pain, and protein levels in joint zzso fluid zzso of patients with internal zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso joint zzso 

zzso zzso in 26 patients with ID and zzso of the zzso were zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso evidence of joint zzso was evaluated in zzso zzso zzso of zzso were collected from the superior joint space during pumping zzso and the protein concentration was zzso The presence of pain was based on joint tenderness or a complaint of pain in the zzso region during mouth opening or zzso 

Joint zzso was demonstrated in 20 of 25 zzso painful zzso a significantly higher zzso than in pain-free zzso (5 of 13, zzso The mean protein concentration zzso zzso in zzso from painful zzso was significantly higher than in pain-free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the mean protein concentration zzso zzso in zzso from zzso with zzso was significantly higher than in zzso without joint zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate that painful zzso are more likely to show joint zzso on zzso and the protein levels in zzso recovered from these zzso is higher than in pain-free zzso These data also suggested that joint zzso may be related to the inflammatory changes seen in patients with ID and zzso
