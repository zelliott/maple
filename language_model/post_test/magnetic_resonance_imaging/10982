The use of a zzso zzso agent with a zzso that increases markedly at temperatures above the phase transition temperature zzso of the zzso membrane was evaluated during magnetic resonance imaging zzso guided zzso zzso A zzso aluminum zzso zzso laser unit and a zzso zzso system were used for tissue zzso in eight rabbit zzso in zzso One zzso was made in each animal prior to administration of the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of 57 degrees C containing zzso zzso were injected zzso and two additional zzso were zzso zzso scans were performed in heated zzso after tissue temperature had zzso and zzso zzso after zzso of tissue zzso zzso in signal intensity zzso for zzso prior to injection of the agent was zzso zzso zzso zzso for the laser group and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Signal intensity after administration of the agent unrelated to heating was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso For zzso made after injection of the agent, a significant increase was found in the laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The persistent signal enhancement found in areas exposed to a temperature above the threshold temperature above zzso allows zzso monitoring of zzso guided zzso zzso
