Clinical results for unilateral zzso screw fixation after zzso zzso fusion have been reported to be as good as those for bilateral zzso However, no studies have directly compared unilateral and bilateral zzso zzso screw fixation after minimally invasive surgery zzso for zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether unilateral zzso zzso screw fixation is comparable with bilateral zzso zzso screw fixation in zzso zzso zzso 

This was a prospective zzso study of 53 patients who underwent unilateral or bilateral zzso zzso screw fixation after zzso zzso for zzso zzso degenerative disc zzso Twenty-six patients were assigned to a unilateral zzso zzso screw fixation group and 27 patients were assigned to a bilateral zzso zzso screw fixation zzso zzso time, blood loss, clinical outcomes zzso is, zzso zzso Index zzso and visual analog scale zzso zzso complication rates, and fusion rates were assessed using CT scanning 2 years after surgical zzso 

The 2 groups were similar in age, sex, zzso diagnosis, and operated level, and they did not differ significantly in the length of follow-up zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso or clinical zzso Both groups showed substantial improvements in zzso and zzso scores 2 years after surgical zzso The groups differed significantly in operative time zzso zzso minutes; bilateral zzso zzso blood loss zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion rate zzso zzso bilateral zzso and zzso zzso change zzso zzso bilateral zzso 

zzso and bilateral screw fixation after zzso zzso produced similar clinical zzso Although zzso results were better with unilateral screw zzso the long-term results were better with bilateral screw zzso suggesting bilateral screw fixation is a better choice after zzso zzso
