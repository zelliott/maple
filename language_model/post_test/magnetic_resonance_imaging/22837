The application of zzso zzso sampling of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging is zzso The effects of zzso zzso during signal acquisition on the zzso zzso zzso function are analyzed and compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is found that in addition to the use of zzso zzso the proper choice of the zzso duration zzso is essential for imaging zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso ratio zzso with negligible zzso loss in spatial resolution is obtained for an zzso duration of zzso approximately zzso zzso For zzso and zzso zzso corresponding values are derived as zzso Phantom zzso confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the impact of different zzso zzso on zzso and spatial resolution for a given zzso zzso In zzso scans show the potential of zzso zzso imaging with zzso sampling for musculoskeletal imaging using standard MR zzso The zzso of complex anatomy is demonstrated by zzso curved slices from the zzso resolved zzso zzso image zzso
