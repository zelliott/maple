To evaluate the efficacy of targeted prostate biopsy using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to characterize zzso features of tumors detected with targeted prostate biopsy in men with previous negative prostate biopsy zzso 

We zzso studied 87 patients with a persistently increasing level of serum zzso zzso zzso at least one previous set of negative zzso prostate zzso and normal digital zzso zzso All patients were examined with combined zzso and zzso zzso before undergoing the prostate zzso zzso biopsy was performed using zzso zzso standard 12 zzso plus targeted biopsy to suspicious zzso as identified on zzso images on their zzso 

Of a total of 87 cases, 82 zzso patients had suspicious zzso on their zzso Of these 82 patients, 46 zzso patients had prostate cancer zzso as determined by the zzso The patients with zzso showed a significantly higher zzso of having suspicious zzso (the anterior or zzso on zzso than the patients without zzso zzso On analysis by dividing all biopsy zzso into the targeted zzso and standard cores, zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso standard zzso zzso Of 43 patients who underwent radical zzso 37 zzso patients were detected with zzso located at the anterior or zzso portion of the zzso For tumor characteristics according to tumor locations, there was no significant correlation between tumor location and zzso scores or zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that a zzso prostate biopsy after prostate zzso might be considered for the identification of cancer zzso and the detection of zzso for patients with a previous negative standard prostate biopsy result despite a persistently elevated zzso zzso
