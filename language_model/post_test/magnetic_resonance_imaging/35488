Brain imaging genetic research involves a multitude of methods and spans many traditional levels of zzso Given the vast permutations among several million common genetic zzso with thousands of brain tissue zzso and a wide array of cognitive tasks that activate specific brain systems, we are prompted to develop specific hypotheses that zzso zzso evidence and state clear predictions about the anatomical sources, magnitude and direction zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso brain activity zzso To begin to develop a framework for shaping our imaging genetic zzso we focus on previous results and the wider imaging genetic zzso zzso emphasis is placed on zzso evidence that links zzso and zzso studies with models of synaptic zzso In shaping our own imaging genetic hypotheses on the development of Attention Networks, we review relevant literature on core models of synaptic physiology and development in the anterior zzso zzso
