We studied whether zzso zzso could be produced by electrical stimulation of zzso zzso placed over human visual areas identified with zzso Identification of areas was confirmed by recording zzso zzso from the zzso such as zzso electrical responses from zzso over the zzso face area zzso The probability of detecting electrical stimulation of a visual area varied with the position of the area in the visual cortical zzso zzso of early visual areas including zzso zzso and zzso was almost always zzso whereas stimulation of late visual areas such as zzso was rarely zzso When zzso were zzso from late areas, subjects reported that they were simple shapes and colors, similar to the descriptions of zzso from early zzso There were no reports of elaborate zzso such as faces, even in areas like zzso where zzso have complex response zzso For sites zzso zzso the detection threshold was determined by varying the stimulation current as subjects performed a zzso detection zzso Current thresholds were similar for late and early zzso The similarity between both zzso quality and threshold across early and late areas suggests the presence of functional zzso that link electrical stimulation with zzso
