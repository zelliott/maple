To test the clinical value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso 

All deliveries from January 1993 through December 1994 were reviewed to identify 42 zzso at term with zzso presentation and zzso delivery due to zzso Complete data were available for 41 women, and subjects were divided into the following two subgroups, according to clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten zzso women with uncomplicated zzso delivery served as zzso zzso data from zzso zzso were correlated with fetal and zzso dimensions to evaluate various criteria for the diagnosis of zzso zzso 

Comparing both the fetal head volume derived from zzso ultrasound assessment and the zzso head volume zzso zzso with maternal pelvic capacity determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso volume exceeding pelvic zzso indicated that 25 and 27, respectively, of the 28 women had been clinically diagnosed correctly with zzso zzso corresponding to sensitivities of zzso and zzso zzso Fetal head volume was not larger than pelvic capacity in any of the women in the control zzso In seven of the 13 women diagnosed as zzso to zzso the fetal head volume exceeded the pelvic zzso 

A fetal head volume estimate exceeding zzso pelvic capacity is a frequent finding in zzso with zzso birth due to zzso zzso An appropriate prospective study to determine the benefits of an zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso in high-risk zzso is zzso
