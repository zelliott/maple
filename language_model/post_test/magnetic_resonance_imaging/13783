To study the feasibility of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso virtual zzso of the labyrinth to assess subtle inner ear zzso 

A retrospective case review of patient with known inner ear pathology to determine the feasibility and clinical value of zzso virtual zzso 

zzso referral zzso 

Ten patients with symptoms of zzso hearing loss or vertigo who underwent high-resolution zzso between 1996 and zzso 

zzso image zzso with three-dimensional zzso zzso to assess inner ear zzso 

To evaluate how 3-D rendering with virtual zzso can depict subtle labyrinthine zzso 

Cases with typical 3-D models and virtual zzso views are presented to illustrate this new image processing zzso 

The virtual zzso view of the labyrinth revealed subtle inner ear zzso This 3-D zzso technique is able to render inner surface changes of tiny structures within the inner zzso It can be performed within a very short time using dedicated hybrid rendering zzso It allows zzso of pathology in a comprehensive way for clinicians and is able to add 3-D information for zzso in doubtful two-dimensional zzso We suggest the term virtual zzso for virtual zzso zzso of the zzso
