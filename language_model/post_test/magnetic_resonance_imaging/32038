The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of vascular risk factors and white matter zzso zzso in patients with Parkinson's disease zzso and its impact on clinical features such as motor zzso 

60 patients with zzso zzso women and 35 zzso mean age zzso zzso years, mean duration of disease zzso zzso zzso with good response to zzso were zzso Besides neurological examination, the degree of motor impairment was evaluated in all patients using zzso zzso and zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso to assess the degree of zzso using Age Related White Matter Changes zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the prevalence of classic vascular risk factors included zzso hypertension, diabetes zzso zzso 1 and 2; plasma cholesterol, cardiovascular diseases, alcohol abuse and smoking was zzso 

zzso of at least one vascular risk factor was noted in 19 patients zzso No significant differences were found between the groups of patients with and without vascular risk factors with regard to all clinical parameters and total zzso zzso These factors did not differ between the groups of patients with more than 3 vascular risk factors and other zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso occurred in 33 patients zzso No significant differences in all zzso clinical factors and the total number of vascular risk factors between the groups with zzso zzso or zzso and without zzso zzso were zzso The group of patients with at least one focus with score of 2 in the zzso scale did not differ significantly in all zzso clinical parameters from the rest of the zzso 

Our data suggest that the severity of zzso and zzso of vascular risk factors are not significantly related with the degree of motor disability in zzso
