To establish the first evidence-based diagnostic criteria for zzso zzso zzso enabling it to be zzso from zzso multiple sclerosis zzso which is a difficult differential zzso 

zzso consecutive AM patients examined from 1996 to 2010 at zzso University hospital, who fulfilled the empirical definition of AM zzso and 51 zzso zzso patients in whom zzso zzso was measured, were zzso The first available brain zzso findings were compared between the zzso Then, we compared the clinical and laboratory features between the 16 AM cases who did not meet the zzso brain zzso criteria for zzso after more than 5 years follow-up and 51 zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso findings, we established diagnostic criteria for AM and calculated the sensitivity and zzso 

AM patients had a significantly lower frequency of zzso brain zzso on baseline zzso than zzso zzso zzso AM patients had a significantly higher frequency of present and/or past history of zzso disease and zzso and higher zzso fluid levels of zzso 9 and zzso but a lower frequency of zzso zzso bands than zzso zzso zzso Our proposed diagnostic criteria for AM demonstrated zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for AM against zzso zzso with zzso positive zzso value and zzso negative zzso zzso 

Our first evidence-based criteria for AM show high sensitivity and zzso and would be useful zzso
