The three-dimensional zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso were studied to evaluate its accuracy in the assessment of the zzso carotid zzso zzso collateral circulation and also the zzso of zzso zzso zzso bypass zzso All zzso zzso of the zzso major arteries seen in conventional zzso were revealed clearly with zzso However zzso had its practical limitation in the evaluation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso probably due to the deterioration of contrast in its slow flow and zzso effect of the zzso In addition to that, zzso often exaggerated the severity of the zzso zzso mostly in severe zzso The zzso state of collateral flow and the zzso of zzso bypass could be evaluated as properly with zzso as with conventional zzso although zzso was limited in spatial resolution and evaluation of flow zzso In conclusion, zzso was considered zzso be a reliable zzso zzso as a screening examination for the evaluation of the carotid zzso disease and as the follow-up study of the zzso patients with zzso bypass zzso
