It is important to gain an understanding of the pharmacological activities of zzso of compounds in development, especially if they are found in systemic circulation in zzso zzso evaluation of zzso is normally conducted with synthetic standards, which become available during various stages of drug zzso However, the synthesis of zzso standards may be protracted, taking anywhere from several weeks to months to be zzso This often slows down early pharmacological evaluation of zzso Once a zzso is found to possess comparable (or zzso pharmacological activity than the parent compound, additional studies are performed to better understand the implications of circulating zzso active zzso To conduct some of these studies as early as possible without slowing the progression of a compound in development is important, especially if critical go or zzso decisions impinge on the outcomes from these zzso Early pharmacological evaluation of significant zzso is hereby proposed to be conducted in the drug discovery stage so that all pertinent studies and information can be gathered in a timely manner for zzso It is suggested that these major zzso be isolated, either from biological or chemical sources, and zzso zzso For biologically generated zzso zzso is proposed as the tool of choice to zzso these zzso before their evaluation in pharmacological zzso For zzso that have the same zzso characteristics as the parent compound, zzso can be conducted using zzso zzso instead of zzso In this article, we propose a strategy that could be used to determine the pharmacological activities of zzso isolated in zzso zzso
