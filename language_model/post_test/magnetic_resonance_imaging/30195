Just as words can rhyme, the signs of a signed language can share structural properties, such as zzso zzso description at this level is termed zzso We report that a zzso zzso network is engaged during zzso similarity zzso made in both English zzso and British Sign Language zzso zzso Since these languages operate in different zzso these data suggest that the neural network supporting zzso processing is, to some extent, zzso zzso within this network was however modulated by language zzso hearing status zzso and age of zzso acquisition zzso The influence of language and hearing status suggests an important role for the zzso portion of the left inferior frontal zzso in zzso zzso processing in deaf zzso This, we suggest, is due to increased reliance on the zzso component of speech when the auditory component is zzso With regard to age of first language zzso non-native zzso activated the left inferior frontal zzso more than native zzso during the zzso task, and also during the task performed in English, which both groups acquired zzso This is the first zzso demonstration that age of first language acquisition has implications not only for the neural systems supporting the first language, but also for networks supporting languages learned zzso
