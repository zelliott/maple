The goal of this prospective study was to characterize the zzso and zzso changes of the zzso head during maturation using zzso in a zzso group of zzso zzso 

zzso pupils zzso zzso of 331 pupils from a primary and high school were asked to take part in this study and were willing to zzso zzso zzso of the hip was obtained at baseline and zzso zzso With these images, we analyzed the zzso zzso and zzso changes related to age, status of the zzso and location on the zzso 

The radius of the zzso head and neck increased with age, as expected, zzso The zzso extension increased significantly with age zzso but zzso tilt and alpha angle showed no differences zzso Building groups by using the zzso status, we found that the zzso extension had the highest changes in the zzso group and almost stopped in the zzso zzso The tilt angle did not change significantly zzso zzso smaller zzso were found in the zzso group, however, these were in a normal range in all of zzso zzso to the position, the highest zzso values were located in zzso and zzso zzso 

Our data can be used as zzso values, which can be compared to patients or zzso with certain risk factors zzso professional zzso this will offer the chance to detect and understand pathological zzso
