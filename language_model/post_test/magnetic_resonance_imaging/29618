Solid zzso masses are found zzso Further analysis of the characteristics of solid zzso masses is useful for optimal zzso 

A retrospective analysis of all solid zzso masses was conducted from December 1998 to May 2003 at the zzso Department, Central University Hospital of zzso zzso A total of 162 solid zzso masses were zzso The zzso imaging diagnosis of ultrasound and zzso zzso and final pathological results were zzso 

One hundred and zzso tumors were zzso confirmed to be zzso cell zzso zzso 17 tumors zzso were zzso There were eight zzso zzso eight zzso zzso and one benign mixed zzso zzso Three zzso and five zzso were strongly suspected before zzso The majority of the benign tumors were zzso or zzso zzso The percentage of small benign tumors zzso or zzso zzso was significantly higher than large benign tumors zzso zzso Although it is possible to use imaging to detect some benign tumors, the majority of benign tumors cannot be diagnosed definitively by imaging before zzso 

zzso in solid zzso masses is zzso zzso zzso solid zzso tumors appear mainly as zzso zzso The zzso differentiation between an zzso and a benign tumor can be zzso Our data suggest that a biopsy is necessary in selected patients to achieve the maximum accuracy in order to provide optimal zzso
