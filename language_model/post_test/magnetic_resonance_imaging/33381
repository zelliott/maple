zzso resonance zzso and imaging enable us to investigate zzso and zzso changes associated with cerebral zzso The specific aims of these studies were to establish the relationships between energy zzso and regional cerebral blood flow and to determine whether zzso imaging is sensitive to the known thresholds for cerebral tissue energy failure and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso resonance zzso zzso of energy zzso in the zzso brain were obtained as a function of cerebral blood flow zzso with the hydrogen clearance zzso before, zzso and after unilateral or bilateral zzso of the common carotid zzso zzso and zzso images were obtained in a separate series of zzso 

Major changes in brain energy zzso were observed at flow values of 20 zzso zzso and zzso The cerebral blood flow threshold for maintenance of energy status was lowered in hypothermia, consistent with a protective zzso zzso imaging intensity increased at cerebral blood flow values of 15 to 20 zzso zzso and below and increased gradually following the onset of severe global cerebral zzso but with a delay of about zzso zzso 

The zzso observations suggest that the flow thresholds for electrical function and zzso are a direct consequence of energy zzso zzso of the zzso and imaging data suggests that zzso imaging is sensitive to disruption of tissue energy metabolism or to a consequence of this zzso The possibilities arise of visualizing energy failure with the spatial resolution characteristic of magnetic resonance imaging and detecting compromised but zzso zzso
