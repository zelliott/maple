zzso zzso may reveal insights into the processes by which genetic factors increase the risk of developing zzso To determine whether patterns of zzso zzso may be useful as zzso zzso we compared patterns of structural zzso in patients with zzso healthy controls, and their respective zzso The surfaces of the left and right amygdala, zzso thalamus, zzso nucleus, zzso zzso zzso and nucleus zzso were assessed in 40 pairs of healthy comparison controls zzso and their siblings zzso and 25 pairs of patients with schizophrenia zzso and their siblings zzso in magnetic resonance zzso images using large deformation zzso metric mapping zzso and parallel transport zzso The zzso asymmetry deformation of each structure was first measured via zzso and then translated to a global template via parallel transport for evaluation of the patterns of asymmetry both within and across zzso Our results revealed that zzso observed in zzso subjects occurred in the zzso and the anterior segment of the zzso with more pronounced expansion deformation in the zzso structures zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso and zzso Disturbance in this pattern of zzso was observed in both zzso and zzso zzso More specifically, zzso and reductions in the zzso pattern of zzso were observed in the zzso formation, zzso zzso and zzso These altered patterns of zzso are present in subjects with schizophrenia and their siblings, and therefore may represent a zzso zzso
