zzso spinal canal tapering may increase zzso zzso and zzso One report suggests that the cervical spinal canal zzso more steeply in patients with zzso I than in healthy zzso The goal of this study was to test the conclusion by measuring spinal canal tapering in another cohort of zzso 

zzso patients with zzso and MR imaging were zzso The MR images were evaluated for zzso zzso and zzso On a zzso zzso MR image, the zzso diameter of the spinal canal was measured at each cervical level, and a linear trend line was fit by zzso zzso The slope of this line was recorded as the taper ratio in zzso Patients with zzso zzso of zzso zzso (with or without zzso were compared with those without zzso zzso (with or without zzso zzso in taper ratios for the 2 groups were tested for significance by the zzso test with significance set at zzso 

zzso patients with zzso were zzso 22 had a zzso zzso and 32 did zzso zzso was identified in 20 of the patients with zzso and in 8 of the zzso The taper ratios averaged zzso zzso for the patients with a zzso zzso (with or without a zzso and zzso zzso for those without it, significant at P zzso zzso zzso did not substantially alter the taper ratio in either zzso 

Patients with zzso with a zzso zzso have more steeply tapering cervical spinal canals than those without zzso
