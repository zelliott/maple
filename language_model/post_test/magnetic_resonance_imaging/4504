zzso and zzso phased array detectors were developed to increase the sensitivity and resolution of MR imaging of the human brain cortex, especially for detecting cortical zzso in pediatric zzso zzso An automated intensity correction zzso based on an zzso zzso filtered image was used to correct the image intensity for the zzso reception profile of the zzso Seven phased array coils were constructed and zzso The sensitivity of these coils was up to zzso higher at the surface of the zzso than that achieved with a conventional head zzso and up to zzso greater at the center of the zzso The sensitivity obtained was comparable with that of a conventional small surface zzso but extended over the larger dimensions of the array and previously zzso areas such as the top of the zzso The advantages of the improved sensitivity are demonstrated with high resolution images of the zzso
