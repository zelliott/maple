zzso zzso are biologically and chemically zzso zzso with high oxygen and zzso carrying zzso Their use as liquid zzso gas carriers during liquid ventilation has been zzso We established a method of high resolution zzso of the totally zzso zzso The goal of this study was to investigate zzso and zzso airway strain in the setting of increasing airway pressures on zzso images of the zzso zzso Sixteen female zzso rats were zzso and the liquid zzso zzso instilled into their zzso zzso was performed at various zzso zzso zzso of zzso length and zzso area were obtained from zzso zzso images for each pressure zzso Changes in zzso area were used to determine zzso strain, while zzso strain was calculated from changes in zzso zzso Our method of zzso allowed clear zzso of the great zzso zzso strain increased significantly up to zzso zzso The greatest strain could be found in the range of low airway zzso zzso strain increased strongly with the initial pressure rise, but showed no significant changes above zzso zzso zzso strain was generally higher in zzso zzso while zzso strain showed no zzso Analysis of mechanical characteristics showed that zzso and zzso airway expansion occurred in an zzso zzso Whereas zzso strain still increased with higher pressures, zzso strain quickly reached a zzso zzso zzso strain was higher in zzso zzso as dense zzso zzso to dependent, in this case to zzso parts of the zzso acting as liquid positive end zzso zzso
