Advances in zzso techniques hold significant promise for improving understanding of disorders of consciousness arising from severe brain zzso We review zzso studies of the zzso state zzso and minimally conscious state zzso and findings in an unusual case of late emergence from zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso techniques, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and quantitative zzso and zzso zzso variations of residual cerebral activity across these patient zzso The results suggest models to distinguish the zzso basis of VS and zzso Less clear are potential brain mechanisms underlying late recovery of communication in rare zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies and recent experimental findings suggest that structural zzso of the brain following severe injury may play a role in late functional zzso More generally, relatively long time courses of recovery following severe brain injury emphasize the need to develop markers for identifying patients who may harbor potential for further meaningful zzso Introduction of zzso into the clinical evaluation process will require developing zzso for zzso assessments of cerebral zzso Although limited in number, available studies already provide important insights into underlying brain mechanisms that may help guide development of such assessment zzso
