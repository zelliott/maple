To investigate the relationship between the number of zzso zzso spaces zzso and zzso findings in patients with traumatic brain injury zzso 

zzso patients with zzso and 21 controls were zzso 

Fifteen patients underwent zzso within a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso days from the brain injury and 23 after an average period of zzso zzso zzso zzso All subjects were examined with a battery of 13 zzso tests zzso 

The average number of zzso was significantly higher in patients than in zzso There were no significant differences between patients and controls in terms of zzso zzso The number of zzso showed a significant inverse correlation with processing speed and a positive correlation with visual zzso of attention only in patients studied within a short delay of zzso 

zzso are not directly associated to zzso findings, suggesting that they may represent a result of the zzso zzso
