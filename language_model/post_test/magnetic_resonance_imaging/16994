zzso zzso zzso zzso is a well known clinical rehabilitation zzso however the neural mechanisms that zzso this treatment at Central zzso System zzso level are still not completely zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a suitable tool to investigate effects of zzso treatments on brain zzso Moreover, monitoring the effective executed movement is needed to correctly interpret zzso zzso most of all in neurological patients where required motor tasks could be only partially zzso The proposed experimental zzso includes a zzso T zzso zzso a motion capture system to acquire zzso data, and an zzso zzso The introduction of metallic devices and of stimulation current in the zzso room could affect zzso acquisitions so as to prevent a reliable zzso maps zzso What we are interested in is that the Blood zzso Level zzso zzso zzso marker of neural activity, could be detected within a given experimental condition and zzso In this paper we assess zzso Signal to Noise zzso zzso as image quality zzso zzso signal change is about zzso as revealed by a zzso T zzso This work demonstrates that, with this innovative zzso in the main cortical zzso regions zzso zzso signal change can be detected at least in the zzso of the zzso and almost zzso of the zzso are suitable for zzso signal change zzso The integrated experimental zzso will therefore allows to detect zzso induced movements zzso maps simultaneously with zzso acquisitions so as to investigate zzso rehabilitation treatments contribution at zzso zzso
