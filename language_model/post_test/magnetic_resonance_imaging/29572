We studied a patient with right zzso damage for whom tactile stimuli on the zzso hand zzso to the intact left zzso were extinguished from awareness during double simultaneous zzso when his right hand was positioned in the zzso zzso This demonstrates the role of an zzso spatial reference frame in attention that can determine awareness of stimuli despite intact sensory zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging to zzso the neural zzso of such zzso zzso we found that limb position modulated neural responses to tactile stimuli at early cortical stages zzso in the intact zzso zzso in bilateral middle frontal zzso also was modulated by limb position and may contribute to integrate sensory zzso into a zzso zzso representation of zzso
