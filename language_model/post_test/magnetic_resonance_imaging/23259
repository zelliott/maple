Despite extensive research of the zzso network, a set of regions which tend to reduce their activity relative to rest in response to zzso tasks, its function is still zzso Specifically, it is still not clear to what extent the zzso profile of this network is driven by processes related to external stimulation zzso or zzso or is driven by specific thought zzso To address this question, we examined the ability of thoughts, generated in the absence of external zzso to zzso default network zzso In a set of experiments, several types of long lasting zzso thoughts were zzso by brief zzso auditory zzso zzso zzso brain zzso far zzso the zzso were demonstrated during these zzso zzso zzso brain activity in the default network showed a striking zzso associated with zzso thought zzso More specifically, a preferential zzso was observed in essentially the entire default network during zzso thoughts when compared to the other zzso thought zzso Furthermore, several regions of the default network showed long-lasting above rest zzso during the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that default network zzso can be modulated in the absence of external zzso thus pointing to the importance of zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, together with previous research, these results support the notion that zzso oriented processing is a core specialization of the default zzso Finally, our zzso experimental paradigm introduces a new method for studying default network zzso
