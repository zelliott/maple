zzso zzso between zzso elements of a transmit array is one of the key challenges faced by parallel zzso zzso An zzso output zzso zzso power amplifier zzso concept was introduced to address this zzso In an example zzso an zzso network was designed to transform the zzso zzso of the metallic oxide semiconductor field effect transistor zzso into a very low value for suppressing zzso zzso effect, and meanwhile, to match the input zzso of the zzso to the optimum load of the zzso for maximizing the available output zzso Two zzso amplifiers with zzso output rating were developed zzso and were further evaluated with a transmit array in phantom zzso Compared to the conventional zzso sources, the new approach exhibited considerable effectiveness suppressing the effects of zzso zzso The experiments further indicated that the isolation performance was comparable to that achieved by zzso overlap zzso The new approach, benefiting from a distinctive zzso zzso also exhibited a superior zzso against load zzso zzso of the new approach in zzso MR was demonstrated on a zzso clinical zzso
