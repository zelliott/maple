zzso zzso as a crucial issue in acupuncture zzso studies, is still a controversial zzso Previous studies have generally adopted a zzso general linear model zzso approach, which predicts the zzso changes in the blood zzso zzso signal zzso to the zzso zzso However, this method might become zzso since the precise timing and duration of acupuncture actions cannot be specified a zzso In the current study, we applied a zzso zzso zzso approach, zzso support zzso machine zzso to explore the neural specificity of acupuncture at zzso zzso 40 zzso using kidney 3 zzso as a control condition zzso to different zzso but the same nerve zzso In addition, to verify whether the typical zzso approach is sensitive enough in exploring the neural response patterns evoked by zzso we also employed the zzso method to the same data zzso The zzso analysis detected distinct neural response patterns between zzso and zzso predominantly for the zzso while negative following the zzso By contrast, group analysis from the zzso showed that acupuncture at these different zzso can both evoke similar widespread signal decreases in multiple brain regions, and most of these regions were zzso zzso mainly distributing in the zzso and zzso zzso Our findings may provide additional evidence to support the specificity of zzso relevant to its clinical zzso Moreover, we also proved that zzso analysis is prone to be susceptible to errors and is not appropriate for detecting neural response patterns evoked by acupuncture zzso
