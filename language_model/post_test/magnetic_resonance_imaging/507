To determine the diagnostic utility of different spinal inflammatory zzso assessed by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso or with zzso inflammatory back pain zzso compared with healthy zzso 

We scanned 35 consecutive patients with AS fulfilling the modified New York criteria, 25 patients with zzso of zzso months' duration (both groups were age zzso or zzso years and had a Bath zzso zzso Disease zzso Index score zzso or zzso and 35 healthy zzso and zzso volunteers using zzso zzso STIR sequences of the zzso zzso were independently assessed in random order by 3 readers blinded to patient zzso zzso spinal zzso were recorded consistent with definitions proposed by the zzso International zzso Working Group: zzso corner inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso in central zzso slices and lateral inflammatory zzso zzso in lateral zzso zzso scored zzso for the 3 possible reader pairs were used in the analysis of sensitivity, zzso likelihood ratios zzso and areas under the curve for the entire spine and by spinal zzso 

zzso utility was optimal when zzso or zzso zzso were recorded (for patients with zzso values for sensitivity, zzso and positive zzso were zzso zzso and 12, respectively, and for patients with zzso were zzso zzso and 8, zzso zzso had high specificity zzso but low sensitivity zzso Nine controls had zzso or zzso zzso but only 2 controls had zzso zzso 

zzso utility of STIR zzso for AS is optimal when zzso or zzso zzso are zzso A single zzso can be found in up to zzso of healthy zzso
