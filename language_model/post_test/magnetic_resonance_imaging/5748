High zzso fluid pressure zzso in the primary tumor has been shown to promote zzso in melanoma zzso and to predict for poor survival in cervical cancer zzso The potential usefulness of zzso acid zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for assessing tumor zzso zzso was investigated in the present zzso 

zzso and zzso melanoma zzso with and without zzso regions were subjected to zzso and subsequent measurement of zzso zzso images of zzso zzso is the initial extraction fraction of zzso and F is blood zzso and zzso zzso is zzso to zzso volume zzso were produced by zzso analysis of zzso zzso 

In tumors without zzso significant inverse correlations were found between zzso and zzso both for zzso and zzso tumors, and between zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso correlations between zzso and zzso or between zzso and zzso could not be detected for tumors with zzso zzso 

zzso may be developed to be a useful zzso method for assessing zzso in tumors without zzso This possibility warrants further studies involving several zzso different experimental tumor lines, as well as human zzso
