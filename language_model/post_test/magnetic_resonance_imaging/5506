The aim of this study was to evaluate therapy response in patients undergoing zzso zzso for zzso cancer using dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The zzso degree of tumor zzso and contrast media zzso were compared to the results of the zzso zzso zzso 33 patients were examined using a zzso scanner with repetitive zzso zzso sequences after contrast media zzso All patients were examined twice - before therapy and immediately before zzso 

In all patients, the tumor volume decreased zzso 72 zzso zzso In zzso patients, the slope of the contrast media enhancement curve decreased zzso 31 zzso zzso In zzso proven zzso after therapy, the decrease in slope was significantly higher than in the group without zzso and the decrease in slope was better for distinguishing between zzso and zzso than the decrease in zzso 

Using zzso helps to identify zzso undergoing zzso zzso better than volume decrease zzso
