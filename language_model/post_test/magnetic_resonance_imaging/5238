The aim of this study was to develop a zzso risk prediction model for zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso cancer and to identify a low-risk group before zzso 

The medical records of 360 patients with zzso cancer who underwent surgical staging were collected from four institutions and were zzso zzso By using serum zzso levels, zzso biopsy data, and magnetic resonance imaging zzso data, a zzso zzso model was zzso Patients whose predicted probability was less than zzso were defined as low zzso The developed model was zzso validated in 180 patients from two independent zzso 

zzso zzso levels and three zzso parameters zzso zzso invasion, zzso zzso enlargement, and extension beyond zzso zzso were found to be independent risk factors for zzso zzso The model classified zzso of patients as part of a low-risk group, and the false negative rate was zzso In the validation zzso the model classified zzso of patients as zzso and the false negative rate was zzso The model showed good discrimination zzso under the receiver operator characteristic curve zzso zzso and was zzso zzso The negative likelihood ratio of our low-risk criteria was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso which was equivalent to the zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso at the assumed prevalence of zzso zzso of zzso 

Using serum zzso and zzso as criteria resulted in the accurate identification of a low-risk group for zzso zzso zzso among patients with zzso zzso
