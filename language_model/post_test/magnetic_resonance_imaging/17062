Parallel magnetic resonance imaging zzso requires an array of zzso zzso elements with different sensitivity zzso and with minimal electromagnetic zzso The goal of this project was to develop a new method based on induced current compensation or elimination zzso for improved zzso element decoupling and to investigate its performance in phantom MR zzso 

An electromagnetic decoupling method based on induced current compensation or elimination for zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed with the design criteria of high efficiency, easy zzso and no physical connection to zzso array zzso An zzso approach was employed to analyze the decoupling mechanism and zzso A zzso zzso array and an zzso zzso array were built to test the performance of the zzso Following zzso tests, MR imaging experiments were performed on a zzso MR zzso 

The bench tests showed that both zzso achieved sufficient decoupling with a zzso less than zzso zzso among the zzso elements at zzso zzso The MR phantom images demonstrated zzso sensitivity zzso from each zzso element and the unique decoupling capability of the proposed ICE decoupling zzso B1 zzso of the individual elements were also measured and zzso 

The theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the decoupling method for high field zzso zzso array designs without overlapping or direct physical connections between zzso zzso which provide more flexibility for zzso array design and zzso The method offers a new approach to address the zzso array decoupling issue, which is a major challenge in implementing parallel zzso
