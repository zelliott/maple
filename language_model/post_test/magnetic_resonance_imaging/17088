Brain extraction is an important zzso step for further processing zzso registration and zzso zzso of brain zzso zzso Due to the zzso and time-consuming nature of manual zzso automated or zzso methods are essential for large-scale zzso Automatic methods are widely available for human brain imaging, but they are not zzso for zzso brains and hence may not perform zzso To date, little work has been done on zzso brain zzso We present an extended zzso neural network zzso that operates in 3-D on the entire image zzso We evaluated its performance under varying zzso and resolution and tested this method against the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso proposed for mouse zzso The results show that this method zzso existing methods and is robust under low zzso and with partial volume effects at lower zzso Together with the advantage of minimal user intervention, this method will facilitate automatic processing of large-scale zzso brain zzso
