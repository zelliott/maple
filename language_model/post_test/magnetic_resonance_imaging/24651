This study used magnetic resonance imaging zzso to evaluate in zzso zzso changes in the length of the zzso zzso zzso in patients undergoing total knee zzso zzso We sought to answer two questions: first, does the zzso change with zzso Second, does the zzso show a zzso zzso 

zzso knees in 76 consecutive zzso patients were zzso The age range was zzso years zzso zzso The study included 62 females and 14 zzso zzso was performed at full extension and at zzso zzso zzso and full zzso 

There were significantly different patterns between genders zzso zzso zzso The main zzso occurred earlier, at zzso in females and later, at zzso in zzso In zzso zzso values in full extension were significantly longer than those measured at other zzso zzso In male subjects, significant differences in zzso values were found between full extension versus zzso zzso zzso zzso and full zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and full zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These differences might influence the zzso complications related to the zzso mechanism after zzso These data provide useful information for surgeons attempting to achieve a satisfactory balance between joint gaps in the zzso reduced position zzso
