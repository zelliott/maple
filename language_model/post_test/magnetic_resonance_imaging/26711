zzso vision zzso information along 2 main zzso orientation and spatial frequency zzso An important question is how this primary visual information is integrated to support high-level zzso It is generally assumed that the information carried by different zzso is combined following a zzso zzso We directly addressed this assumption by investigating how the network of zzso cortical regions processes distinct zzso over zzso Face stimuli were flashed during 75, zzso or 300 zzso and zzso They were filtered to preserve low zzso zzso middle zzso zzso or high zzso zzso Most zzso regions robustly responded to coarse zzso face information in early stages of visual processing zzso until 75 zzso of exposure zzso zzso processing decayed as a function of exposure duration zzso until 150 zzso In contrast, the processing of fine zzso face information became more robust over time in the bilateral zzso face regions and in the right zzso face zzso The present evidence suggests the zzso strategy as a plausible modus zzso in high-level visual zzso
