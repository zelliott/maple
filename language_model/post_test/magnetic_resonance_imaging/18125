zzso zzso patterns may reflect zzso cortical connectivity during an early period of brain zzso We here investigated anatomical distribution of cortical zzso deficits underlying panic disorder and the relationships of these potential zzso markers with panic symptom zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso structural images were obtained from 23 patients with panic disorder and 33 matched healthy zzso Local zzso zzso were measured in each zzso zzso cortical zzso and regional zzso patterns were compared between zzso zzso areas in which zzso patterns were associated with panic symptom severity were also zzso zzso reductions in cortical zzso were observed in panic patients compared with healthy individuals, which were mainly distributed in the lateral brain extending from the zzso to the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso in the zzso cortical regions which exert zzso roles in the default mode network, was associated with less severe panic zzso zzso analysis for the zzso zzso of local zzso zzso revealed that zzso of the zzso cortical regions with other cortical areas which belong to the default mode network were reduced in panic patients with severe symptoms relative to either less severe patients or healthy zzso Our findings suggest not only substantial zzso in cortical zzso patterns in panic disorder but also potential contribution of integrated cortical folding pattern of the default mode network to alleviated panic zzso
