One way to overcome the zzso low sensitivity of Nuclear zzso zzso zzso is to enhance the signal by dynamic nuclear polarization zzso where the polarization of zzso ratio zzso electrons is transferred to the surrounding zzso using zzso zzso zzso Recent developments in zzso zzso and applications have shown that zzso is one of the most effective methods to increase the nuclear spin polarization in zzso organic, and biological zzso It is possible to obtain a solution of molecules containing zzso zzso in combination with methods to zzso rapidly the polarized solid zzso In this chapter, a brief introduction on a theoretical basis and some of new zzso applications in zzso zzso as well as medical applications in zzso zzso Imaging zzso are zzso
