The correlations between the size of corpus zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the spatial zzso synchronization during finger and shoulder movements were analyzed in nine right-handed zzso The zzso surface areas of corpus zzso zzso and of seven zzso regions were measured from the zzso slice of the anatomical zzso zzso zzso between pairs of zzso zzso zzso the central and zzso regions of both zzso was zzso after zzso filtering zzso data by the zzso operator zzso The spatial zzso synchronization was evaluated using zzso a novel measure which zzso the number of independent sources of spontaneous zzso zzso The zzso of zzso between the left and right zzso areas after movement onset in the lower alpha band zzso zzso correlated with the size of the zzso body in both types of zzso The size of the zzso body also correlated with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso band in finger movement, and in the zzso zzso band in shoulder zzso The size of the zzso anterior intermediate and zzso intermediate zzso of zzso correlated with zzso in both types of movements indicating more zzso of synchronized zzso zzso in subjects with a large zzso zzso The results suggest that the size of zzso zzso which is known to connect the primary zzso and the supplementary motor areas of both zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso during voluntary finger and shoulder zzso
