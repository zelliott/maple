Until now there is a lack of carefully controlled studies with conventional MR imaging performed exclusively in concussion with short lasting loss of consciousness zzso 

A MR investigation was performed within 24 hours and after 3 months in 20 patients who had suffered a concussion with a verified loss of consciousness of zzso 5 zzso As a control group, 20 zzso and gender matched patients with minor zzso injuries had a MR investigation using the same zzso 

In a concussion population with an average zzso duration of zzso 4 minutes no case with unequivocal zzso traumatic pathology was zzso 

An ordinary concussion with short lasting zzso does not or only seldom result in a degree of diffuse zzso injury zzso that is zzso by conventional MR with field strength of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of earlier MR studies in concussion using field strength of zzso T as well as of studies with diffusion zzso MR imaging zzso zzso reveal zzso shortcomings, in particular use of inadequate control zzso There is, therefore, a need for carefully controlled studies using MR of higher field strength and/or studies with MR zzso exclusively in common concussion with zzso of zzso 5 zzso
