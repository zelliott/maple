We report four patients with slowly progressive cervical zzso The four patients had several features in zzso 1) progressive cervical zzso with a duration of several months to years, 2) abnormal zzso in the cervical to upper zzso zzso levels with or without zzso enhancement, 3) zzso zzso were positive both in serum and zzso 4) high levels of zzso zzso load in zzso The calculated risk of zzso in two patients showed a high value, comparable to those of zzso and higher than those of healthy zzso zzso Because the clinical and laboratory findings of these four cases show similarities to those of zzso we propose that these four cases may be a zzso form of zzso
