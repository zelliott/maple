zzso resonance imaging zzso is a promising medical imaging technique that we used to assess zzso neck cortical zzso 

Our primary objective was to assess whether cortical bone in the zzso neck assessed by zzso was associated with failure load in a simulated sideways fall, with and without adjustment for total bone zzso Our secondary objective was to assess the reliability of the zzso zzso 

We zzso 34 human zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso geometry at the zzso neck were the cortical zzso area zzso second area moment of inertia zzso zzso zzso and section zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were analyzed with the standard zzso zzso From zzso we report the zzso bone mineral density zzso in the zzso neck and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso were loaded to failure at 100 zzso in a sideways fall zzso (15 degrees internal zzso 10 degrees zzso 

Failure load zzso was the primary zzso We observed that the zzso neck zzso and zzso were strongly associated with failure load zzso zzso and zzso zzso These associations were similar to those between zzso neck zzso and failure load zzso zzso but lower than the associations between zzso zzso and failure load zzso zzso 

We report that zzso holds considerable promise for measuring cortical bone geometry in the zzso neck and for predicting strength at the zzso zzso
