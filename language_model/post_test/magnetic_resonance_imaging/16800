Human information processing is characterized by bottlenecks that zzso zzso These bottlenecks limit both what we can perceive and what we can act on in zzso zzso Although zzso and response limitations are often attributed to independent information processing zzso it has recently been suggested that a common zzso limitation may be responsible for zzso To date, however, evidence supporting the existence of such a zzso bottleneck has been zzso Here, we tested the unified bottleneck hypothesis using zzso zzso zzso 1 isolated brain regions involved in the response selection bottleneck that limits zzso zzso zzso These same brain regions were not only engaged by a zzso zzso task in zzso 2, their activity also tracked delays to a zzso decision-making task caused by concurrent zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that a unified zzso zzso including the inferior frontal zzso superior zzso frontal cortex, and bilateral zzso temporally limits operations as diverse as zzso zzso and zzso
