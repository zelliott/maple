zzso recording during in zzso zzso imaging for correlation of zzso events with changes in zzso parameters has, until now, not been zzso Here we present a method that uses specially prepared zzso zzso for the continuous monitoring of both cortical steady potential and zzso during in zzso zzso imaging studies of experimental animal zzso In order to demonstrate the reliability of this approach we zzso single episodes of cortical spreading depression in rats by zzso zzso zzso injection, using an zzso zzso During the passage of DC potential shifts and associated reduction in zzso zzso zzso regions, reflecting the progression of cortical spreading depression over the cortex, were visible in zzso images of the rat zzso No zzso artifacts due to the zzso and zzso were visible in the zzso zzso Thus, we have demonstrated under controlled experimental conditions, that zzso recording with zzso zzso can be performed simultaneously with zzso zzso zzso The described method enables further zzso investigations of phenomena which are zzso by zzso
