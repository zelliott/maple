We studied whether magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the zzso zzso is useful to distinguish zzso motor zzso zzso from lower motor zzso disease zzso and whether abnormalities resemble those of chronic inflammatory zzso zzso zzso We compared MR images of the zzso zzso of nine patients with zzso with scans from five patients with zzso eight patients with zzso and 174 zzso In two patients with zzso and in three patients with zzso the MR images showed an increased signal intensity on the zzso images of the zzso zzso Two other patients with zzso demonstrated a more zzso increased signal intensity on the zzso images, occurring in one patient only in the zzso and in the other patient in the zzso and in the zzso zzso of the zzso MR images of the zzso zzso of eight patients with zzso were zzso The distribution of the MR imaging abnormalities corresponded with the distribution of symptoms of the zzso zzso in zzso and symmetrical in zzso These findings demonstrate that MR imaging abnormalities of the zzso zzso in patients with zzso resemble those seen in zzso and may be useful to distinguish zzso from zzso
