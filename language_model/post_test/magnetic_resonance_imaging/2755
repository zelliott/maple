A reliable protocol for zzso zzso mapping of the zzso region was set up for future characterization of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso phase zzso available on our zzso T zzso was selected and acquisition parameters were chosen on the basis of tests performed on zzso zzso gels with zzso in the zzso zzso Some experiments were carried out to evaluate the accuracy of zzso calculations for selective and zzso zzso zzso for image uniformity corrections, and for different situations of slice shift and repetition zzso The chosen protocol was then applied to in zzso evaluations to check the long-term precision by means of repeated zzso performed on the same subject over a zzso zzso Two or more reference gels were positioned both in the phantom and volunteer at the edge of the zzso zzso Image zzso consisted of an automatic zzso written by the authors in zzso 77, that selected the best fit for each zzso between zzso and zzso zzso models, and prepared four zzso images zzso and zzso slow and fast contribution, zzso being a function of zzso density and of zzso that may be used for future zzso The phantom experiment results showed an accuracy of zzso if a linear correction was performed using the reference gels at the edge of the zzso No significant differences in accuracy were found between selective and zzso zzso pulse, and a zzso correction was not demonstrated zzso The zzso performed on four volunteers showed that the best zzso model for healthy zzso tissue was zzso zzso zzso resulted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the group of zzso from one zzso zzso all the measurement zzso ranged from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso that was carried out considering the two classes of volunteers and of zzso positions zzso or left) showed that differences found between the two zzso were not zzso while zzso differences among individuals are significant if a probability level higher than zzso is zzso As in this case, the main source of error can be attributed to the biological variations among zzso Future statistics collected on patients for the zzso evaluations of the zzso tissue will clarify whether the zzso relaxation is a sufficient zzso for zzso discrimination of healthy and zzso zzso
