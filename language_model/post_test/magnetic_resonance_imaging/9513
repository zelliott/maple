The purpose of this study was to highlight the issues related to zzso muscle size evaluation that is commonly done in field zzso The zzso area, thickness (the vertical distance from the upper end of the elbow zzso to that of the zzso and zzso (the horizontal distance from the left to the right end of the elbow zzso of the elbow zzso at levels from the reference site zzso of the upper arm length from the zzso process of the zzso to the lateral zzso of the zzso to 5 zzso zzso to it were determined in 11 young men using magnetic resonance imaging, both at rest and during zzso elbow zzso at zzso of zzso voluntary zzso During zzso of zzso voluntary contraction, the thickness increased but the zzso decreased at each measurement site compared with those at zzso This was possibly due to difference in muscle zzso between both zzso The correlation zzso between the thickness and zzso area for the elbow zzso were significantly lower at rest zzso than during zzso of zzso voluntary contraction zzso The present findings indicate that the zzso muscle size measurement at rest includes errors zzso to the zzso of the resting zzso
