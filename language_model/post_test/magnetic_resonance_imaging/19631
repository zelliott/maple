To establish a pig model suitable for imitating pulmonary zzso to facilitate research in the diagnosis of pulmonary zzso 

Thirteen animals were zzso mechanically zzso and subjected to pulmonary artery zzso initiated from the right external jugular zzso With the use of a zzso zzso repetitive zzso maneuvers were done at different locations of the pulmonary zzso zzso Conventional pulmonary zzso MR zzso and zzso MR imaging were zzso 

The model remained zzso stable throughout the 13 experiments, without any significant difference between the blood pressure zzso at the start and at the end of the zzso and pulmonary artery zzso In each of the nine animal experiments that investigated MR imaging, four of four using zzso MR imaging zzso and zzso zzso and five of five using MR zzso zzso pulmonary artery zzso all repeated pulmonary artery zzso were successfully performed zzso of zzso 

The zzso pulmonary artery zzso model in the pig allowed zzso controlled zzso of pulmonary zzso at different levels of the pulmonary artery in the same zzso MR zzso and zzso MR imaging were adequate to detect the pulmonary artery zzso and the zzso lung regions, zzso The model may be a helpful tool for future research in this zzso
