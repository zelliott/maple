To evaluate the accuracy of zzso row CT zzso for the prediction of tumor invasion of the zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 35 patients with primary zzso cancer underwent zzso staging magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso The tumor relationship to the zzso expressed in 3 categories zzso free zzso zzso tumor distance zzso or zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso distance zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso distance 0 zzso was determined on CT by two observers at patient level and at different anatomical zzso A third expert reader evaluated the zzso tumor relationship on zzso which served as reference zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso and areas under these zzso zzso were zzso The zzso agreement of CT was determined by using linear weighted zzso zzso 

The zzso of CT for zzso invasion was zzso for observer 1 and zzso for observer zzso The zzso agreement was zzso zzso zzso The performance of CT at zzso zzso levels was statistically significant better compared to low anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso row CT has a poor accuracy for predicting zzso invasion in zzso located zzso The accuracy of CT significantly improves for tumors in the zzso zzso There is a high inconsistency among zzso
