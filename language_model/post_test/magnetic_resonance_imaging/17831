zzso partial zzso zzso variety zzso an zzso dominant disorder caused by zzso zzso is characterized by fat loss from the zzso However, it is unclear whether these patients appear muscular because of a lack of subcutaneous fat or have an actual increase in muscle zzso zzso we compared muscle mass and volume of selected muscles in women with zzso and control subjects using zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso scans were obtained on 39 women, aged 18 to 65 years, with zzso and 17 healthy women matched for body mass index and age zzso zzso Volumes of muscles in both the zzso calves, and zzso were calculated from zzso scans and muscle mass in zzso were calculated from zzso In addition, abdominal zzso and zzso scans were analyzed from 129 healthy, zzso women zzso zzso Comparisons between women with zzso and control subjects were made using zzso adjusting for zzso body mass index, and zzso 

Patients with zzso compared with control subjects had significantly greater volumes of the thigh muscles, zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso calf muscles zzso zzso 713 vs zzso zzso 335 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso muscles (210 zzso 51 vs 175 zzso 34 zzso zzso and 165 zzso 38 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Patients with zzso also had significantly increased arm and leg muscle masses when measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity, assessed by insulin tolerance tests, was zzso correlated to the calf muscle zzso 

Female patients with zzso have increased skeletal muscle volume and mass compared with those of normal zzso
