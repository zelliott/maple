zzso is a well-known zzso zzso However, localized zzso which may be one of the zzso of zzso has not been separately zzso In the present study, we attempted to characterize the clinical and magnetic resonance zzso imaging features of localized zzso in comparison with ordinary diffuse zzso and zzso cortical zzso 

MR findings for 43 patients with zzso and ten with zzso cortical zzso which is the differential diagnosis of localized zzso were zzso zzso Clinical findings such as the onset and severity of zzso and imaging findings including the affected area of the brain, structures outside of the hemisphere, and zzso zzso changes were zzso 

Of the 43 patients, 11 showed signs of localized zzso zzso zzso zzso was predominantly seen on the left side zzso and had a tendency toward zzso zzso compared to zzso cortical zzso The zzso of the zzso abnormalities in the diffuse zzso localized zzso and zzso cortical zzso groups were zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were three localized zzso patients whose affected areas shrank and whose images were similar to those of zzso cortical zzso 

zzso zzso accounts for one quarter of all zzso cases in this zzso The zzso of zzso abnormalities in patients with localized zzso was almost half that of patients with diffuse zzso zzso abnormalities were absent in patients with zzso cortical zzso Associated zzso abnormalities may be a clue to zzso localized zzso from zzso cortical zzso
