This study was designed to examine the utility of visual inspection of zzso zzso lobe zzso metabolism in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso using zzso zzso 

Seventy-five subjects zzso normal controls zzso 26 zzso and 22 zzso with zzso and zzso scans were included in this zzso We developed a zzso visual rating scale to evaluate the presence and severity of zzso zzso on zzso zzso The visual zzso ratings were compared with quantitative zzso zzso rate zzso data extracted using regions of interest zzso from the zzso PET scans of all zzso A standard rating evaluation of zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso were used to determine and compare the diagnostic accuracy of the zzso and cortical zzso 

For both zzso and cortical ratings, high zzso and zzso zzso were found zzso values zzso The zzso rating was highly correlated with and yielded a diagnostic accuracy equivalent to the zzso zzso measures zzso values zzso The combination of zzso and cortical ratings significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy over the cortical rating alone, with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of NL cases being correctly zzso 

This study shows that the visual rating of zzso zzso on PET is reliable, yields a diagnostic accuracy equal to the quantitative zzso measures, and is clinically useful and more sensitive than cortical ratings for patients with zzso We suggest this method be further evaluated for its potential in the early diagnosis of zzso
