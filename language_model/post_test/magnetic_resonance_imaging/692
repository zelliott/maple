The present study used functional and structural zzso to investigate differences in zzso zzso underlying shifts of attention in young and old subjects, studied with zzso zzso Two different zzso syllables were presented and the subjects were instructed to attend to and report from either the left or right ear zzso Typically, a zzso advantage is observed when attending to the zzso zzso and a zzso advantage when attending to the zzso zzso The behavioral results showed that the old group had difficulties with zzso zzso of the zzso advantage in the attend left zzso This is interpreted as a failure of an important aspect of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of attention for selection of zzso zzso The zzso results showed that an area in the left middle frontal zzso was more activated in the young group compared to the old group in the attend left zzso The structural zzso data showed reduced gray matter density of the same area in the old zzso Based on these zzso findings, we suggest that the left middle frontal zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso of selecting zzso zzso and to inhibit processing of zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies addressing the question on how age-related changes in zzso processing is reflected in both functional and structural differences in the zzso
