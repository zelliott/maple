There is still controversy regarding the optimum time to perform surgery for zzso Some recommend surgery soon after birth and others delay until the age of 12 zzso zzso pressure has been measured in an attempt to provide a scientific zzso but many questions remain zzso To date, little attention has been given to zzso volume and its changes during the first few years of life in children with zzso The zzso goal was to focus on zzso volume during this period and to compare zzso obtained in patients with zzso with zzso obtained in healthy zzso 

Using the technique of zzso the zzso volume of 84 children with various forms of zzso was measured on zzso computerized zzso zzso The change in average volume that occurs with increasing age was calculated and compared with a model of normal zzso volume zzso The age at presentation for children with zzso was 1 to 39 zzso zzso of the patients were younger than 12 zzso In eight patients in whom only one zzso expansion procedure was performed, zzso zzso volumes were measured as zzso Several interesting observations zzso 1) There was little difference in head growth between boys and girls with zzso during the first few months of zzso After the age of 12 months, however, the difference in zzso volume normally seen between the two genders was observed in the zzso group as zzso 2) Excluding children with complex zzso who have smaller heads, children with all other types of zzso have similar head growth after the 1st year of life, with no difference between the number of and type of zzso zzso Children with zzso syndrome develop greater than normal zzso volumes after the 1st year of zzso 3) Although children with zzso are born with a smaller zzso volume, by the age of 6 months volume has reached normal levels, and from that point on volume follows the pattern of normal head zzso 4) Children who presented after the age of 6 months and later developed zzso zzso after initial successful treatment had a small zzso volume at their initial zzso 5) Of the patients whose zzso zzso volumes were measured, all but one had zzso volumes at or above normal values, and their zzso volumes were considerably higher than normal for their zzso These children all followed a growth curve parallel to that of healthy children but at higher volume zzso One patient with a zzso initial zzso volume was surgically treated at a very young age and, despite zzso expansion surgery, zzso volume did not reach normal zzso It is zzso that this was due to the fact that the operation was performed at a time when zzso was still zzso 

The results of this study indicate that the underlying mechanism leading to zzso and zzso of head volume zzso its effect during the first few months of zzso zzso of zzso volume in clinical practice could be used to zzso zzso the optimum time for zzso In zzso children, this may be useful in predicting possible zzso
