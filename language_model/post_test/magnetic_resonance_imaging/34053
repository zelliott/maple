zzso recognition of zzso duct injuries after zzso zzso largely relies on zzso retrograde zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, these invasive procedures are not without zzso zzso experience with use of magnetic resonance zzso zzso to identify these injuries is zzso 

The medical records of five patients who had undergone zzso zzso and had suspected major zzso duct injuries were zzso All five patients underwent zzso followed by conventional zzso either zzso or zzso or zzso The findings of zzso and conventional zzso were zzso 

Four patients had proven zzso duct zzso The remaining patient had zzso zzso into the common zzso duct zzso during zzso zzso which presented as transient zzso mimicking a zzso duct zzso The zzso images were of higher diagnostic value than conventional zzso images in four patients with frank zzso duct zzso For these patients, zzso showed only the zzso sign of the zzso and zzso was needed to zzso the upper zzso zzso zzso however, demonstrated the entire zzso system zzso and zzso to the zzso or zzso sites zzso In the remaining patient with zzso zzso the two techniques yielded similar diagnostic zzso 

This preliminary study suggests that zzso is an ideal diagnostic test whenever zzso duct injury following zzso zzso is zzso
