Traditional consolidation theory, which seeks to explain how new memories are incorporated into the zzso neural architecture, stipulates that the zzso plays a zzso role in this zzso However, although there is abundant research showing that the zzso is necessary for the initial zzso phase, there is very little experimental evidence with human subjects proving that the structure zzso to play a role in the retrieval of episodic items from memory zzso To test this hypothesis, we investigated recall zzso associated with recent memories zzso zzso versus remote memories zzso of 8 zzso using functional magnetic resonance zzso In accordance with the multiple memory trace theory, recall of consolidated zzso information, represented by the remote condition, was not independent of the zzso Both types of memory retrieval produced significant zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and a zzso region of zzso spanning the zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, where recent events activated bilateral regions of the zzso nucleus, remote events yielded significantly greater zzso within the zzso zzso The results challenge traditional consolidation theory, which would predict greater zzso activity for recent zzso Furthermore, they highlight the interplay between multiple memory systems in the zzso We argue that our particular question format, which encouraged depth of recall and did not require a zzso interview, as well as our zzso of the recent and remote time zzso were the determining factors for the observed pattern of zzso zzso
