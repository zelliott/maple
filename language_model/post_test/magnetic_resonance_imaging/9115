Advanced imaging techniques, particularly in CT and zzso have become state-of-the-art to support the performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso CT scanners with zzso detectors and real-time zzso have allowed the use of a zzso study, CT zzso as a zzso diagnostic study at many institutions to detect and evaluate the zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso now includes zzso zzso CT zzso and sometimes zzso to guide zzso While both zzso and zzso zzso have long been well evaluated by MR and CT zzso information about the zzso wall and plaque zzso is now zzso In the setting of acute zzso CT with zzso or MR with diffusion and zzso has increased the ability to separate territory at risk from zzso zzso and can help to guide more appropriate zzso This article addresses current zzso zzso imaging applications as well as a few techniques on the horizon that show great promise in helping to characterize those zzso amenable to zzso zzso
