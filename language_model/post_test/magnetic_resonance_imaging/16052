Patients with Parkinson's disease zzso may present impairment in cognitive functions even at early stages of the zzso When compared with the general population, their risk of zzso is five to six times zzso Recent investigations using structural zzso have shown that zzso in zzso is related to cortical structural changes and that specific cognitive zzso can be attributed to zzso in specific zzso We review the structural zzso studies carried out in zzso using either a manual region of interest zzso approach or zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso volume is decreased in patients with zzso with and without zzso in addition, zzso zzso correlated with deficits in verbal zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso in zzso involves structural changes in zzso areas and widespread cortical zzso zzso in zzso patients with zzso are less zzso possibly because cognitively zzso groups of patients have been zzso Patients with zzso with cognitive impairment and/or visual hallucinations present greater brain zzso than patients without these zzso These findings suggest that cortical zzso is related to cognitive dysfunction in zzso and precedes the development of zzso zzso zzso might therefore provide an early marker for zzso in zzso
