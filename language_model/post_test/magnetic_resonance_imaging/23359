Use of zzso as a recreational drug is spreading rapidly among young people all over the zzso zzso studies have linked chronic zzso use with a number of problems, including cognitive zzso zzso dysfunction, and zzso zzso However, little is known about the long-term effects of zzso use on brain structure and zzso 

We used zzso based zzso in conjunction with statistical zzso mapping on the structural magnetic resonance images of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso control individuals zzso zzso zzso to assess differences in gray matter volume between the two zzso 

We observed significant decreases in gray matter volume in bilateral frontal zzso zzso superior frontal zzso and right middle frontal zzso of zzso users in comparison with control subjects zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple comparisons at zzso zzso of zzso use was zzso correlated with gray matter volume in bilateral frontal cortex, whereas the estimated total lifetime zzso consumption was zzso correlated with gray matter volume in left superior frontal zzso 

We have demonstrated a reduction in frontal gray matter volume in patients after chronic zzso zzso The link between frontal gray matter zzso and the duration of zzso use and cumulative doses of zzso perhaps suggests a zzso effect of long-term use of the zzso Our results have important connotations for the clinical picture that is likely to emerge with the growing recreational use of zzso and is also relevant to the status of the drug as a model for zzso
