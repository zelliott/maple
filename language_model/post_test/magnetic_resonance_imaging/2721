Principal components analysis zzso of images is important in many applications such as zzso zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso is difficult for image data because the correlation zzso is very zzso We present a direct method of calculating the zzso of the zzso from the small zzso expressing the correlations between images, instead of the larger zzso representing the correlations between zzso The method is fast and zzso It is faster and requires less memory than a singular value decomposition, although it is less zzso It is much faster and more accurate than zzso and other approximate methods developed for this zzso
