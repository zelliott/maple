To assess the effect of the zzso I zzso in vitamin D zzso on the risk of developing degenerative disc disease in a Southern Chinese zzso 

Previous studies in Finns and Japanese suggest that the zzso I zzso of vitamin D zzso is associated with the development of degenerative disc disease in the zzso zzso However, sample sizes were small, and the results need to be confirmed in other zzso 

zzso degenerative disc disease was defined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso on zzso Southern Chinese volunteers between 18 and 55 years of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso chain reaction products was used to analyze the zzso I zzso The resulting zzso were correlated with the presence of zzso disc zzso and zzso on zzso 

Using zzso zzso analysis and adjusting for age and sex, the zzso zzso of zzso I in vitamin D zzso gene was significantly associated with degenerative disc disease, with an odds ratio zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Further zzso analysis showed that in individuals younger than 40 years, the OR was even higher, at zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Similarly, disc zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in individuals younger than 40 zzso zzso tears and the zzso zzso were not associated with the zzso zzso of zzso I zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the largest scale zzso study to date using zzso to define precisely degenerative disc disease in the Southern Chinese zzso We showed that the zzso zzso of vitamin D zzso zzso I is associated with a high risk of degenerative disc disease and disc zzso developing, especially in individuals younger than 40 zzso
