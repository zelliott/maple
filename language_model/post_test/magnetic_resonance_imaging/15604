zzso signal optical imaging with red zzso zzso is used extensively to provide high spatial resolution maps of zzso zzso signals as an indirect means to map evoked zzso zzso This evoked signal is generally described as beginning with an zzso or zzso in signal that is faster, more zzso and weaker compared with the subsequent signal zzso In contrast, the evoked signal detected with blood oxygen zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is generally described as containing an zzso after the initial dip and zzso even though it, too, detects zzso signals and its first two zzso appear complementary to those of zzso Here, we used zzso with zzso zzso zzso to image over zzso s after a 1 s stimulus delivery to detect and successfully use the zzso zzso phase for functional zzso Eight zzso attributes were assessed per signal phase including maximum zzso extent and peak zzso both of which were largest for the zzso zzso followed by the zzso and then the initial zzso Peak activity location did not zzso well between the three zzso zzso we found mostly modest correlations between attributes within each phase and sparse correlations between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings did not exhibit a zzso of evoked zzso or zzso zzso responses that could be associated with the zzso Beyond the zzso additional zzso fluctuations were also zzso but were typically less zzso specific to stimulus zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso are zzso
