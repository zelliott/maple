To use structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso to characterize changes in gray matter and white matter volumes between patients with zzso systemic lupus zzso zzso and matched controls, between patients with zzso zzso with and those without zzso deficit, and in relation to disease duration and treatment with zzso 

Twenty-two patients with zzso zzso and 19 healthy controls underwent high-resolution structural zzso zzso density maps for gray matter and white matter were compared between zzso 

zzso testing confirmed the presence of zzso deficit in 8 patients with zzso zzso Multiple brain regions had reduced gray matter volume in the patients with zzso onset zzso with zzso deficit versus controls or patients with zzso zzso without zzso zzso Neither disease duration nor cumulative oral or intravenous steroid doses accounted for decreases in gray zzso White matter volume was also reduced in patients with zzso zzso with zzso deficit, and the reduction was positively associated with both disease duration and cumulative oral steroid zzso zzso higher cumulative intravenous steroid doses were associated with higher white matter zzso 

zzso deficit in patients with zzso zzso is associated with zzso decreases in both gray and white matter zzso Since only white matter volume changes are related to disease duration and cumulative oral steroid use, this may suggest that gray and white matter zzso relate to different underlying zzso Further work is needed to understand the relationship between gray and white matter zzso in zzso zzso whether the underlying mechanisms relate to zzso zzso or other causes, and whether the changes are zzso or zzso Likewise, the protective properties of intravenous steroids in maintaining white matter volumes require confirmation in larger zzso
