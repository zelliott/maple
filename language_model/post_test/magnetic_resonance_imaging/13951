The nature of the zzso changes that occur in the cerebral zzso following injury to the cervical spinal zzso are largely zzso 

To investigate these zzso changes by examining the relationship between the motor cortical representation of the zzso right upper zzso compared with that of the zzso The tongue was selected because the spinal zzso injury zzso does not affect its movement and the cortical representation of the tongue is adjacent to that of the zzso upper zzso 

zzso was used to map cortical representations associated with simple motor tasks of the right upper zzso and tongue in 14 control subjects and 9 patients with remote zzso zzso cervical zzso 

The mean value for the site of maximum cortical zzso during upper limb movement was identical between the two zzso The site of maximum left zzso cortical zzso during tongue movement was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and superior to that of control subjects, indicating the presence of a shift in cortical zzso 

The findings indicate that the adult motor zzso does indeed adapt following cervical zzso The nature of the adaptation and the underlying biological mechanisms responsible for this change require further zzso
