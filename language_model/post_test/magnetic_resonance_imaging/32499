A number of recent studies of human brain activity using zzso zzso zzso and zzso have reported the presence of zzso patterns of correlated activity in the absence of external zzso Although these patterns have been hypothesized to contain important information about brain architecture, little is known about their origin or about their relationship to active cognitive processes such as conscious awareness and monitoring of the zzso In this study, we have investigated the zzso and zzso characteristics of zzso activity patterns and their dependence on the subjects' zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso was performed at zzso T on 12 normal subjects using a visual stimulation zzso followed by a 27 zzso rest period, during which subjects were allowed to fall zzso In subjects who were asleep at the end of the zzso we found zzso a higher zzso of zzso signal fluctuation during rest compared with subjects who were awake at the end of the zzso zzso zzso independent patterns of correlated activity that involve all of gray matter, including deep brain zzso zzso many patterns that were consistent across zzso zzso that average percentage levels of fluctuation in visual zzso zzso and whole brain were higher in subjects who were asleep (up to zzso and zzso zzso than in those who were awake (up to zzso and zzso at the end of the scan and were comparable with those levels evoked by intense visual stimulation (up to zzso and zzso for two subject zzso zzso no confirmation of zzso positive or negative, between zzso and VC found in earlier zzso These findings suggest that zzso activity continues during sleep and does not require active cognitive processes or conscious zzso
