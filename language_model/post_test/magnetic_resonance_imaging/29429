To investigate the zzso between different zzso scanners in magnetic resonance imaging zzso measurement of knee cartilage volume in healthy female zzso 

Five volunteers had both knees scanned using three different zzso zzso zzso volume in each compartment was measured from the images by image zzso The data were zzso using analysis of zzso zzso 

The mean total cartilage volume of the 10 knees scanned at three different zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the Siemens, GE and Philips scanners zzso Small systematic differences were seen in the total knee cartilage volume zzso 

Although there were small systematic differences in knee cartilage volume, the three zzso scanners gave broadly similar zzso
