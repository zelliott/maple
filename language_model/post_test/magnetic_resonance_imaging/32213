Motor functions decline with age due to a number of zzso There is interest in whether these changes are reflected in the zzso of the cerebral motor system in older subjects and whether such changes might be in some way zzso Most studies in humans have used functional brain imaging techniques to compare motor system zzso in younger and older zzso zzso of these results is made more difficult by potential zzso changes in older zzso However, in general, there appears to be greater motor zzso brain activity in a wider network of brain regions in older compared to younger zzso The evidence that these changes are zzso in nature is less zzso zzso of zzso and anatomical data will be required in order to fully interpret the functional imaging zzso
