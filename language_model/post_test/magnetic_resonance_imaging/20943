zzso is a disease characterized by a paucity of zzso tissue and low circulating zzso of zzso zzso zzso therapy improves eating and zzso disorders in patients with zzso 

The aim of the study was to clarify the zzso mechanism of eating disorders in zzso patients and the action mechanism of zzso on appetite zzso 

We investigated zzso neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging in zzso patients with or without zzso replacement therapy and in healthy zzso We also measured the zzso feelings of zzso 

Although there was little difference in the enhancement of neural activity by food stimuli between patients and controls under zzso zzso suppression of neural activity was insufficient in many regions of interest including amygdala, zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients when compared with zzso zzso treatment effectively suppressed zzso neural activity in many of these regions of interest, whereas it showed little effect under zzso in zzso zzso with these results, zzso formation of zzso feeling was insufficient in patients when compared with controls, which was effectively reinforced by zzso zzso 

This study demonstrated the zzso of zzso suppression of zzso neural activity and formation of zzso feeling in zzso patients, which was effectively restored by zzso The findings in this study emphasize the important pathological role of zzso in eating disorders in zzso and provide a clue to understanding the action mechanism of zzso in human, which may lead to development of novel strategies for prevention and treatment of zzso
