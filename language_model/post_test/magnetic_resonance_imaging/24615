zzso cell transplantation is a promising option for the restoration of normal zzso zzso in patients with type 1 zzso Because graft volume is a crucial issue in zzso zzso for patients with diabetes, we evaluated a new method for increasing functional tissue yield in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were labeled with three different zzso iron oxide zzso particles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso separation was performed to separate zzso zzso from the empty zzso and cell viability and function were zzso zzso labeled with 1000 zzso zzso zzso zzso experienced a zzso reduction in graft volume, with a zzso loss of zzso zzso zzso labeled with 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso reduction in graft volume, with a zzso loss of capsules containing zzso No zzso could be achieved using zzso zzso due to its toxicity to the primary zzso zzso labeling of zzso is useful for transplant zzso during zzso separation as well as in zzso imaging after zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso can also reduce the volume of the zzso zzso without zzso their function by removing empty zzso
