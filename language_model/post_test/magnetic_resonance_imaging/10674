zzso zzso zzso zzso most of the neurological morbidity including zzso deficits in survivors of premature zzso However, it is unknown whether and, if so, how zzso affects functional cortical zzso 

Here, we assessed changes in the zzso zzso response to visual displays depicting human locomotion in adolescents who were born premature with magnetic resonance imaging signs of zzso 

zzso of zzso activity parallel behavioral zzso Early zzso zzso brain zzso over the right zzso zzso was weaker in patients compared with zzso zzso 

This is the first evidence for zzso zzso of cortical activity by zzso zzso providing new insights into the functional pathology of zzso
