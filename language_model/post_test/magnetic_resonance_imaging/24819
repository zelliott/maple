zzso in the fat mass and zzso gene zzso are associated with human obesity and zzso behaviors, including increased food intake and a preference for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a potential regulatory zzso zzso but the mechanisms by which zzso zzso humans to obesity remain zzso In zzso zzso humans, we showed that subjects zzso for the zzso zzso zzso A zzso have zzso circulating levels of the zzso hormone zzso and attenuated zzso appetite zzso Using functional zzso zzso in zzso AA and zzso humans, we found that the zzso zzso zzso the neural responses to food images in zzso and brain reward zzso Furthermore, AA and zzso subjects exhibited divergent neural responsiveness to circulating zzso within brain regions that regulate zzso reward processing, and incentive zzso In cell models, zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, peripheral blood cells from AA human subjects exhibited increased zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso abundance compared with zzso zzso Our findings show that zzso regulates zzso a key zzso of zzso behavior, and offer insight into how zzso zzso zzso zzso to increased energy intake and obesity in zzso
