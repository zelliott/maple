In a previous publication zzso et zzso zzso we presented zzso potential zzso data on a pair of 10-year-old twin girls zzso C and zzso one of whom zzso zzso showed strong evidence of auditory processing zzso For the present paper, we analyzed zzso functions of zzso zzso generated in response to the presentation of target stimuli to either the right or left ears in a zzso zzso There were four zzso three involved the processing of real words for either zzso semantic, or spectral zzso one involved the processing of a zzso acoustic zzso zzso differences in the zzso functions were zzso In the case of Twin C, zzso functions were zzso normal across both zzso The functions for Twin zzso however, suggest poorly correlated neural activity over the left zzso region during the three word processing conditions, and over the right zzso area in the zzso acoustic zzso zzso between the zzso brains were evaluated using diffusion zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso For Twin zzso results showed reduced zzso over the length of the zzso corpus zzso and adjacent lateral structures, zzso reduced zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that failure to achieve appropriate temporally correlated zzso brain activity in response to auditory zzso perhaps as a result of faulty zzso communication via corpus zzso may be a factor in at least some children with auditory processing zzso
