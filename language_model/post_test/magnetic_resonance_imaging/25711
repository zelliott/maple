To investigate the value of MR in zzso patients with primary zzso who have an intact zzso system, from those with central diabetes zzso who have impaired synthesis and/or release of zzso 

zzso patients with clinically significant zzso zzso were diagnosed zzso as having primary zzso or diabetes zzso zzso or zzso These patients, and 92 patients without zzso disease, were then zzso with zzso zzso thin zzso sections without zzso zzso 

zzso zzso signal of the zzso was present in 90 of 92 patients without zzso zzso The signal was also present in all six patients with primary zzso In contrast, the zzso signal was absent in all eight patients with central diabetes zzso Three of the four patients with zzso diabetes zzso also had an absent zzso zzso 

zzso MR may prove important in zzso patients with central diabetes zzso from those with primary zzso
