During magnetic resonance imaging, there is an interaction between the zzso magnetic fields and the active zzso medical devices zzso In this study, in order to express the nature of this interaction, simplified zzso expressions for the electric fields induced by zzso magnetic fields are derived inside a homogeneous zzso zzso With these zzso expressions, the zzso induced potential on the zzso of the zzso can be approximately calculated if the position of the lead inside the body is zzso By utilizing the fact that zzso coils produce linear magnetic field in a volume of interest, the simplified closed form electric field expressions are zzso Using these simplified expressions, the induced potential on an implant zzso has been zzso approximately for various lead positions on a zzso phantom and verified by comparing with the measured zzso for these sample zzso In addition, the zzso of the method was tested with isolated zzso leg stimulation zzso As a result, these simplified expressions may help in assessing the zzso stimulation risk to the patients with zzso
