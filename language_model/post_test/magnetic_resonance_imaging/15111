Language has been extensively investigated by functional zzso zzso However, only a limited number of structural zzso studies have examined the relationship between language performance and brain structure in healthy adults, and the number is even less in older zzso The present study sought to investigate correlations between zzso matter volumes and three standardized language tests in late zzso The participants were 344 zzso zzso adults aged zzso years, who were drawn from the zzso Sydney Memory and zzso zzso The three language tests included the Controlled zzso Word Association Task zzso Category zzso zzso and Boston Naming Test zzso zzso analyses between zzso zzso volumes and language tests showed distinctive zzso correlation patterns for each language zzso The zzso zzso were located in the right frontal and left zzso zzso for zzso in the left frontal and zzso zzso for zzso and in bilateral zzso zzso for zzso Our findings largely corresponded to the neural zzso of language tasks revealed in zzso studies, and we also observed a less zzso asymmetry in the zzso zzso of the language zzso Furthermore, we divided the participants into two age groups zzso and zzso years zzso and then examined the correlations between structural zzso zzso and language performance for each zzso A trend toward significant difference in the correlations was found between the two age groups, with stronger correlations in the group of zzso years old than those in the group of zzso years zzso This difference might suggest a further decline of language zzso in different stages of late zzso
