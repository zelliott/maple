zzso resonance zzso zzso and imaging zzso are now well established techniques for the study of cellular metabolism and gross structure of zzso Using zzso materials, we have constructed a system for the measurement of zzso force of zzso in response to zzso electrical stimulation and voluntary effort within the bore of a 48 zzso diameter zzso T General Electric zzso whole body MR zzso Using this system we have been able to study the relationship between zzso zzso and chemistry of muscle, with zzso MRS for the measurement of zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso Image analysis using the Context Vision system enables a distinction to be made, in zzso zzso by zzso zzso of muscle, fat and zzso tissue to give force per unit cross zzso area of zzso The combination of MR and functional zzso provide a valuable tool for further detailed analysis of human muscle weakness and zzso
