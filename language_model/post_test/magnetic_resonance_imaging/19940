Conventional magnetic resonance zzso scanning techniques can identify bone zzso zzso containing mostly fat zzso But they are not able to differentiate zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso and normal red zzso This is particularly problematic in assessment of zzso or zzso zzso zzso This pilot study used dynamic zzso MR imaging zzso to evaluate the bone zzso status and to determine whether several calculated parameters derived from the zzso correlate with zzso characteristics of zzso especially with the tumor fraction zzso 

zzso scans were performed in 25 patients with proven or known zzso zzso who were about to undergo bone zzso biopsy of the zzso zzso zzso The location chosen for biopsy was examined with zzso approximately one hour prior to the zzso zzso intensity zzso zzso were generated from the region of the zzso crest corresponding to the planned biopsy zzso Enhancement parameters were zzso including peak enhancement ratio zzso maximum enhancement slope zzso time to peak zzso and mean time zzso The biopsy zzso was reported zzso with relevant reported parameters including zzso and tumor fraction zzso 

PER values were significantly higher for the bone zzso tumor zzso group than for the normal bone zzso group zzso zzso zzso A significant positive correlation was found between PER and zzso as well as zzso and zzso A negative correlation was found between zzso and zzso There was no significant difference in the mean zzso and zzso values between the zzso tumor zzso group and the normal bone zzso zzso 

The presence of diffuse bone zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso could be verified using zzso
