To estimate distances from the zzso to the zzso zzso and to explore correlations between pelvic dimensions and body zzso 

This is a secondary analysis of a parent zzso study on the mechanisms of stress urinary zzso We measured pelvic dimensions on magnetic resonance images of women with zzso zzso zzso 50) and without zzso zzso zzso 50) stress urinary zzso 

The mean distance from zzso to the zzso membrane among cases is zzso zzso (left) and zzso zzso (right), with a range from zzso to zzso zzso There were no significant differences in these distances when comparing left with right, or cases with zzso zzso correlation was found between the zzso zzso distances and heights only in the case zzso 

There is high zzso in the distance from zzso to the zzso zzso Height should not be used as a predictor of dimensions in the lesser zzso
