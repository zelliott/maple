The objective of this study was to examine brain activity, with particular attention to prefrontal function, during response execution and zzso in youths who have engaged in binge drinking zzso for at least 2 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were recorded twice within 3 years, during performance of a zzso zzso 

The study was part of a zzso study of the zzso effects of zzso 

A total of 48 undergraduate students, 25 controls zzso zzso and 23 binge drinkers (10 zzso with no personal or family history of alcoholism or zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso components of the zzso were examined by principal component analysis and exact zzso zzso analysis zzso 

zzso drinkers showed larger zzso zzso than controls in the first and second evaluations zzso zzso zzso They also showed larger zzso zzso in the second evaluation zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses in the second evaluation revealed significantly greater zzso of the right inferior frontal zzso zzso in binge drinkers than in controls during successful zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Young binge drinkers appear to show abnormal brain activity as measured by zzso zzso during response execution and zzso which may represent a neural zzso of difficulties in impulse zzso
