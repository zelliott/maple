We aimed to show that correcting image distortion significantly affects brain zzso using zzso zzso zzso and to assess whether the processing of distortion correction reduces system zzso 

We obtained zzso zzso zzso images of the brain from 22 healthy participants using zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso images using zzso zzso zzso 5, and tested the relation between distortion correction and brain volume using zzso 

Local brain volume significantly increased or decreased on corrected images compared with zzso zzso In addition, the method used to correct image distortion for zzso zzso produced fewer zzso errors from MR system zzso 

This is the first zzso study to show more precise zzso using zzso with corrected zzso These results indicate that zzso or zzso imaging trials require correction for distortion induced by zzso zzso
