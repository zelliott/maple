The symptoms of zzso zzso zzso zzso are reported to be uniform, which suggests it to be a zzso zzso syndrome, and in fact, the zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso images usually include the zzso zzso However, the reason why the zzso zzso is always involved in the zzso has not been zzso 

We encountered seven patients with spinal zzso zzso and operated on all of zzso We evaluated the zzso and zzso zzso findings in these zzso zzso zzso was followed ranging from zzso months zzso 21 zzso after zzso 

All of our patients showed swelling of the spinal cord, including the zzso zzso on the zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso showed that the swelling of the spinal zzso had resolved but that it had finally deteriorated into an zzso zzso In all of five patients who could be followed up using multiple zzso zzso scans, sequential zzso images showed that the most zzso level of areas with increased signal in the spinal zzso moved in a zzso direction with zzso 

This and the fact that the zzso zzso was included in the swelling of the spinal zzso regardless of the level of the zzso in all our patients, suggested that gravity played an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso in these zzso
