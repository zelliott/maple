To explore the potential relationship between fatigue following strokes and zzso mood, cognitive dysfunction, zzso and zzso site and to determine the zzso factors in the development of zzso fatigue zzso following minor zzso 

Ninety-nine functionally active patients aged less than 70 years with a first, zzso stroke zzso Stroke zzso score zzso in acute phase and zzso after 6 months, modified Rankin zzso score zzso at 6 zzso were assessed during the acute phase and then at 6 zzso and 12 months zzso after their zzso Scores in the zzso Assessment zzso were described and correlated to age, zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso site, mood scores, zzso data, laboratory data, and quality of life at zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso analysis in order to determine which variables recorded at zzso best predicted fatigue at zzso 

As many as zzso of the patients at zzso and zzso at zzso zzso new cases between zzso and zzso reported zzso At both 6 and 12 months, there was a significant association between fatigue and a reduction in professional zzso zzso zzso depression, and anxiety levels remained associated with zzso throughout this time period, underlining the critical role of these variables in the genesis of zzso There was no significant association between the zzso site and zzso 

This study suggests that zzso and executive zzso as well as depression and anxiety, may play a critical role in the development of zzso
