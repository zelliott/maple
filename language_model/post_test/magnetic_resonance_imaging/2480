zzso zzso evaluation of patients with zzso of zzso zzso includes zzso to delineate the pulmonary zzso and the coronary artery anatomy and to demonstrate the presence of multiple zzso zzso defects zzso All other information is obtained from zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso using the zzso sequence and zzso was employed on 18 patients with zzso four of whom had zzso zzso Mean age at zzso was zzso m zzso zzso zzso and zzso m zzso zzso zzso at zzso To compare zzso and zzso we measured the ascending zzso the zzso the left and right pulmonary arteries and each structure at three zzso zzso agreement between the two imaging methods was found if, for each zzso one of the three zzso in one structure differed by more than zzso from the other two measured in case of a local zzso and the diameter of the main pulmonary artery was less than zzso of the zzso to diagnose zzso of the main pulmonary zzso There was close agreement between zzso and zzso With regard to the zzso zzso zzso was superior to zzso in the depiction of zzso override and of right zzso zzso In three cases local zzso in the pulmonary arteries were detected by zzso and zzso zzso of the main pulmonary artery was detected by zzso in six patients and by zzso in five zzso zzso missed one case of zzso In the remaining 11 patients normal findings were found by zzso and zzso For the demonstration of zzso zzso zzso is expected to give better results than the zzso sequence which depicted two out of four zzso in this zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso in zzso the pulmonary zzso New developments in zzso indicate the feasibility of zzso the coronary zzso
