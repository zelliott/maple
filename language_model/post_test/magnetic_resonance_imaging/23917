zzso comparisons of functional zzso volumes from zzso and PET require accurate zzso matched spatial resolution, and if possible matched zzso We zzso zzso and PET volumes, using a series of linear and zzso transformations applied to the PET zzso Because of the limited number of zzso slices that were available, PET volumes were transformed to the zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso volumes have significant spatial distortion due to magnet zzso high resolution zzso volumes were zzso transformed to zzso volumes as part of the transformation zzso The smoothing effects of these registration transformations were measured, in order to match the spatial resolution of the zzso zzso and PET zzso zzso resolution of the transformed PET volumes in the zzso space was zzso by up to zzso due to the transformation zzso Due to both the image acquisition characteristics and the zzso process, the transformed PET volumes had a spatial resolution that was lower than that of zzso zzso significant smoothing of zzso volumes was necessary to match their spatial resolution with that of the transformed PET zzso zzso the spatial resolution of the zzso volumes to those of the transformed PET volumes was achieved by matching the shape of their point spread zzso In order to do this, zzso kernels were employed to smooth the zzso zzso We were unable to simultaneously match the resolution and noise of zzso and PET signals in the motor zzso zzso maps derived from transformed PET and smoothed zzso volumes were zzso zzso motor zzso was active in all zzso but there were large variations in the size of the activated region and its signal to noise ratio across zzso zzso and PET images within each zzso Nevertheless, the relative zzso changes measured by FAIR were consistent with those determined by zzso
