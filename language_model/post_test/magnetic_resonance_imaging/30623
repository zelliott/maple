This study was conducted to explore differences in gray and white matter density between bipolar and healthy comparison groups using zzso zzso zzso 

Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed for 39 subjects with bipolar I disorder and 43 comparison zzso Images were registered into a zzso zzso space and segmented into gray matter, white zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping was used to calculate differences in gray and white matter density between zzso 

zzso subjects had decreased gray matter density in left anterior zzso zzso zzso area zzso 32, zzso zzso an adjacent left zzso frontal zzso zzso 10, zzso zzso right inferior frontal zzso zzso 47, zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso 44, zzso zzso relative to comparison zzso 

The observation of a gray matter density decrease in the left anterior cingulate, which processes emotions, in bipolar subjects is consistent with prior reports that used zzso zzso zzso zzso gray matter density in the right inferior frontal zzso which processes zzso and intrinsic functions, supports zzso zzso dysfunction as a component of bipolar zzso
