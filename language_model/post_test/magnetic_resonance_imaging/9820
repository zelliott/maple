zzso in zzso zzso within the zzso axis have been implicated in the zzso of irritable zzso syndrome zzso and is a treatment zzso Acute zzso depletion zzso decreases brain zzso zzso zzso levels, and increases visceral perception and negative emotional bias in patients with zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of zzso on brain activity and connectivity during visceral stimuli in healthy women, and to compare the zzso brain connectivity of an zzso circuit in female patients with zzso without zzso 

12 healthy females zzso zzso were studied under zzso zzso conditions and zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed during a zzso zzso zzso consisting of random zzso and zzso tolerable zzso zzso least squares analyses and structural equation zzso were used to evaluate the effect of zzso on functional and effective brain connectivity during zzso zzso in healthy controls under zzso were compared with the effective connectivity of brain responses to 45 zzso zzso zzso in 14 female patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In healthy controls, zzso resulted in increased response of an extensive brain network to balloon zzso including the zzso and zzso of emotional zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effect was greater during high inflation, suggesting greater engagement of the central zzso system with more aversive visceral zzso zzso connectivity analysis revealed a profound effect of zzso on zzso between emotional zzso network zzso resulting in loss of negative feedback zzso of the zzso A zzso pattern was identified in the patients with zzso 

The findings are consistent with an zzso zzso of and increased connectivity within an emotional zzso network during aversive zzso Together with the previous demonstration of zzso visceral zzso in healthy controls, and the zzso effective connectivity pattern observed in patients with zzso these findings suggest that zzso of this brain network may play a role in central pain amplification and zzso zzso
