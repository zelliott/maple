The surface area of the zzso is theoretically important but more complicated to measure than cortical zzso Its theoretical importance is primarily due to a close relationship between the surface area (not the zzso of the zzso at any region and the number of zzso in that zzso The surface of the zzso in humans is highly convoluted and this creates difficulties in measuring its surface zzso We report here on a straightforward extension of zzso methods to magnetic resonance images that is simple, efficient and zzso We studied the zzso reliability and the relationship of measurement error to biological variation and suggest a simple method, using zzso components analysis, for zzso all the relevant parameters for efficient design of zzso We applied this method to a small sample of 15 healthy young male subjects, matched individually on age and parental socioeconomic status to 15 healthy female subjects and measured the surface areas of both cerebral zzso We found no evidence for gender differences or asymmetry in this small study, unlike a previous report using zzso zzso
