zzso studies of cartilage require the prevention of sample degradation before and during scanning and during shipment for zzso zzso zzso to achieve this include immersion in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, bovine zzso cartilage zzso samples were stored in zzso zzso saline zzso zzso with standard zzso or zzso solution with zzso a potent zzso zzso For each zzso three samples were scanned at zzso degrees C and stored at zzso degrees C or at zzso degrees C with zzso prior to zzso zzso and zzso transfer zzso rate, zzso were measured weekly over 4 months, after which time water and zzso zzso contents were compared with those of matching tissue excised zzso zzso in zzso exhibited increased zzso zzso after 1 month at zzso degrees C, P zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso P zzso zzso while zzso in zzso with zzso and zzso yielded good stability zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso after 108 days at zzso degrees zzso Water content increased while zzso content markedly decreased in all zzso Thus, stability in cartilage zzso parameters can be zzso with appropriate storage conditions, but storage time should nonetheless be zzso
