The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 18 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso 

Stroke was induced by transient middle cerebral artery zzso in zzso zzso Dynamic zzso imaging with displacement and zzso using zzso was performed 3 days zzso PET data were correlated with zzso zzso for the activated zzso markers zzso and zzso and with zzso 

zzso zzso peaked within the first 5 zzso zzso then decreased zzso remaining significantly higher in zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso or zzso with zzso eliminated the difference in zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated well zzso with zzso on zzso 

zzso PET specifically images zzso in zzso zzso in a mouse model of stroke and shows promise for imaging and monitoring zzso zzso in other disease zzso
