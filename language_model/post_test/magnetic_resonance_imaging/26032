To test the following hypotheses that zzso middle ear zzso air inflation prevents the development of zzso media with zzso in a monkey model of functional zzso tube zzso and zzso ME inflation treatment of zzso media with zzso can cause zzso clinical improvements due to fluid displacement from the zzso to the adjacent zzso 

zzso controlled zzso 

Twelve zzso zzso 

zzso tube dysfunction was induced by zzso paralysis of the right zzso zzso zzso muscle in all zzso Before and on study days 9, 15, and 21 after paralysis, the presence or absence, and distribution of ME zzso were documented using magnetic resonance imaging zzso Right and left ears were examined twice daily for 21 days using zzso and right ME air inflation zzso zzso 6 zzso or sham inflation zzso zzso 6 zzso was done immediately after those examinations if the ME pressure was zzso zzso zzso or zzso On 10 of the scheduled zzso evaluations, the zzso was repeated immediately after an inflation to document the possible zzso of fluid within the ME caused by the zzso 

Middle ear pressure remained within normal limits for the follow-up period in 11 of the 12 zzso left zzso in none of the 6 zzso right zzso and in 3 of the 6 zzso right zzso Three zzso right ears developed flat zzso zzso days 14 through zzso zzso resonance imaging documented inflammation and fluid in 1 of the 11 zzso left ears and in all zzso right zzso Lesser degrees of inflammation and zzso based on zzso evaluations were noted for the 3 zzso right ears that retained zzso pressures when compared with the right 3 ears that developed a flat zzso The zzso measure of zzso quantity within the zzso was decreased acutely after inflation, but was simultaneously increased in the adjacent zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso air inflation prevented the development of zzso media with zzso in 50% of the ears with functional zzso tube zzso zzso zzso documented the displacement of fluid by inflation from the zzso to the zzso and zzso air zzso Using standard clinical evaluations such as zzso and zzso this fluid zzso can cause a false diagnosis of zzso
