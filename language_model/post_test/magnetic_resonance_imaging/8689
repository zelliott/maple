zzso margin involvement zzso is an important zzso indicator for patients with zzso zzso This zzso aims at evaluating the diagnostic precision of magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the zzso evaluation of zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed comparing zzso against zzso after total zzso zzso zzso specificity and diagnostic odds ratio zzso were calculated for each zzso zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso and zzso analysis were zzso Study quality and zzso were zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the significance of the difference in relative zzso 

Nine studies evaluating 529 patients were zzso zzso results showed an overall sensitivity and specificity for zzso detecting zzso preoperatively of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso analysis demonstrated an overall weighted area under the curve zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without significant zzso between the studies zzso zzso P zzso zzso Good study quality further increased the sensitivity and specificity of zzso The use of a zzso zzso zzso a phased array zzso and the inclusion of two interpreters also resulted in high zzso diagnostic zzso zzso zzso showed a significant difference in the zzso for studies published in or since 2003 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging can accurately predict zzso preoperatively for zzso cancer in single units and this is zzso across different zzso This strategy has important implications for selection of patients for zzso therapy prior to zzso
