Smaller zzso lobe cortical gray matter volumes, including the left superior zzso zzso have been reported in magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of patients with chronic schizophrenia and, more recently, in patients with zzso zzso However, it remains unknown whether there are progressive decreases in zzso lobe cortical gray matter volumes in patients with zzso schizophrenia and whether similarly progressive volume decreases are present in patients with affective zzso 

zzso zzso scans at initial hospitalization and zzso years later were obtained from 13 patients with zzso zzso 15 patients with zzso affective psychosis zzso zzso and 14 healthy comparison zzso zzso volumes were calculated for gray matter of superior zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso schizophrenia showed significant decreases in gray matter volume over time in the left superior zzso zzso compared with patients with zzso affective psychosis or healthy comparison zzso This progressive decrease was more pronounced in the zzso portion of the left superior zzso zzso zzso than in the anterior portions zzso No group differences in the rate of change over time were present in other zzso 

These findings demonstrate a progressive volume reduction of the left zzso superior zzso zzso gray matter in patients with zzso schizophrenia but not in patients with zzso affective zzso
