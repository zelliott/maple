zzso zzso through central zzso zzso pathways has been implicated in various psychiatric disorders but this has not been amenable to experimental investigation in the absence of a valid zzso zzso of functional zzso zzso One approach is zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso We have previously shown that intravenous administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso elicits increases in blood zzso dependent signal zzso in regions consistent with the distribution of zzso zzso In the current study we determined whether zzso signal responses to zzso could be blocked by zzso with a zzso zzso Healthy male volunteers received oral zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso prior to intravenous zzso challenge zzso zzso signal increases following zzso infusion occurred in areas known to be rich in zzso receptors such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These responses were attenuated by zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso produces reliable patterns of response that are zzso by zzso zzso these responses may therefore be useful zzso measures of zzso function in psychiatric zzso
