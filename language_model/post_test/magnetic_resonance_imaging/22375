The aim of this study was to directly detect spectral components of the magnetic fields of zzso currents caused by firing of the zzso in the zzso nerve in response to visual zzso zzso The magnetic field parallel to the main zzso field can potentially alter the local phase and magnitude of the MR signal which can cause signal loss due to zzso zzso Measured frequency zzso showed evidence of the zzso stimulus localized to regions containing the zzso zzso not thought to be due to motion artifacts, in 30 out of 52 experiments in 5 adult human zzso The effect was zzso zzso zzso of the mean magnitude equilibrium signal from the zzso in the frequency range zzso zzso corresponding to an estimated field of zzso zzso zzso zzso at an echo time of TE zzso zzso zzso using a zzso T zzso zzso Only 1 of 12 phase image experiments showed zzso These findings provide preliminary evidence for direct detection of zzso firing in the zzso zzso
