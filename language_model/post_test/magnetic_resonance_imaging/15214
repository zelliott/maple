A large variety of sexual zzso have been described in the brains of many zzso species, including zzso zzso occurring sexual zzso has been implicated in the risk, progression and recovery from numerous neurological disorders, including head injury, multiple sclerosis and zzso zzso altered mice are a key tool in the study of zzso relationships in the zzso central nervous system and serve as models for human zzso and neurological zzso However, there are a limited number of quantitative three-dimensional analyses of the adult mouse brain zzso In order to address limitations in our knowledge of anatomical differences, a comprehensive study was undertaken using full zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine sexual zzso in the zzso whole mouse zzso An expected difference in overall brain size between the sexes was found, where male brains were zzso larger in volume than female zzso Beyond the overall brain size differences in the zzso the following significantly different regions were zzso males were larger in the thalamus, primary motor zzso and zzso zzso while females were larger in zzso zzso area, zzso zzso and anterior zzso Using high-definition zzso zzso on a normal zzso mouse strain, we have mapped in detail many zzso statistically significant differences in brain zzso
