We examined whether any differences in brain volumes at entry into alcohol dependence treatment differentiate subsequent zzso from zzso 

zzso in alcohol dependence treatment zzso zzso 75) underwent magnetic resonance imaging approximately 6 zzso 4 days after their last alcoholic drink, and 40 zzso zzso light drinkers zzso were studied as control zzso At follow-up zzso zzso zzso months later, 23 zzso zzso had zzso from drinking and 52 zzso had zzso zzso zzso compared zzso zzso and zzso 

Compared with zzso future zzso had smaller brain tissue volumes in the left amygdala, zzso head, and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and adjacent zzso white matter zzso and had larger volume in the left lateral zzso zzso Compared with zzso future zzso had smaller brain tissue volumes in the right middle zzso zzso and superior frontal zzso Compared with future zzso future zzso had smaller tissue volumes primarily in bilateral zzso zzso and surrounding zzso zzso were virtually unaffected after controlling for common zzso 

At entry into alcohol dependence treatment, the brain structure of future zzso differs from that of future zzso Future zzso have smaller brain volumes in regions of the zzso reward system that are critically involved in impulse control, emotional regulation, zzso and evaluation and anticipation of stimulus zzso and zzso zzso abnormalities of this zzso might zzso greater risk for resumption of hazardous drinking after treatment and might contribute to the definition of a zzso zzso risk profile in alcohol zzso
