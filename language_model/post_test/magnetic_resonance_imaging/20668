This study included 179 consecutive patients who had high-risk zzso sources and received zzso zzso Patients were treated with intravenous zzso agents, or underwent zzso zzso if their international zzso ratio zzso was zzso We compared the frequency of bleeding complications between patients with prior zzso use and those zzso We also investigated whether there were differences in functional outcome and zzso rates between zzso 

A prior zzso use was present in 28 patients zzso Although zzso levels were higher in the prior zzso group, the frequency of bleeding complications was not different between patients who received prior zzso and those who did zzso No differences were observed in patients with or without prior zzso use, for successful zzso rate zzso in zzso zzso grade 2 or zzso zzso or modified Rankin score zzso at zzso
