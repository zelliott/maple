The zzso functional connectivity is complex, has high energetic cost, and requires efficient use of zzso the zzso main energy zzso It has been proposed that regions with a high degree of functional connectivity are energy efficient and can minimize consumption of zzso However, the relationship between functional connectivity and energy consumption in the brain is poorly zzso To address this zzso here we propose a simple model for the energy demands of brain functional zzso which we tested with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 54 healthy volunteers at zzso Higher zzso metabolism was associated with zzso larger zzso signal zzso and a higher degree of connectivity was associated with zzso increases in zzso supporting our hypothesis for the energy efficiency of the connectivity zzso zzso metabolism (in the absence of zzso accounted for zzso of brain zzso zzso which suggests that the spontaneous brain activity accounts for zzso of the energy consumed by the zzso The energy efficiency of the connectivity hubs was higher for zzso zzso zzso and zzso hubs than for cortical zzso The higher energy demands of brain communication that hinges upon higher connectivity could render brain hubs more vulnerable to deficits in energy delivery or zzso and help explain their sensitivity to neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's zzso
