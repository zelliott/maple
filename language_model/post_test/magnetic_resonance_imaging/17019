We zzso a zzso zzso approach to investigate the relationship between the three-dimensional zzso zzso of the central zzso zzso and zzso The anterior and zzso walls of the zzso were manually outlined using high-resolution magnetic resonance images of 295 right-handed healthy participants (age zzso zzso Surface reconstruction and zzso methods were employed to create anatomical correspondence of surface locations across zzso Four surface zzso including average zzso length zzso surface area, zzso dimension zzso and zzso span, were used to represent the zzso zzso of the zzso We found significant age-related decreases in the surface area for all walls of the zzso the zzso for zzso walls of the zzso and the zzso for zzso wall of right zzso zzso increases were found in the zzso spans between the anterior and zzso zzso These surface metrics (except zzso exhibited zzso zzso Specifically, age-related changes in surface zzso progressed more rapidly in the zzso than in the anterior zzso Finally, sex differences were found only in the zzso of the right anterior wall of the zzso Taken together, our results show age-related changes in the surface zzso of the zzso and therefore provide insights into the normal aging zzso
