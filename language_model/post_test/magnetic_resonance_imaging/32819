zzso emotional zzso of sensory stimuli influences their processing in various cortical and zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that negative and positive zzso are processed zzso not along a single linear zzso Here, we examined how brain is activated when subjects are listening to auditory stimuli varying zzso in perceived zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso healthy volunteers were scanned in 3 zzso while listening to International zzso Digital Sounds zzso in a block design zzso We found a strong zzso zzso relationship between zzso and blood oxygen level dependent zzso signal strength in the zzso prefrontal cortex, auditory cortex, and zzso zzso were the weakest for neutral stimuli and increased progressively for more unpleasant or pleasant zzso The results strengthen the view that zzso is a crucial factor in neural processing of zzso An alternative explanation is zzso which increases with both negative and positive zzso
