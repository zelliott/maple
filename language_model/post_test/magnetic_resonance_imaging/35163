In the present study we investigated the functional organization of zzso auditory perception with specific respect to auditory zzso processing in speech and zzso zzso Participants zzso verbal and zzso auditory stimuli according to either spectral or zzso acoustic features in the context of a sparse zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Based on recent models of speech processing, we hypothesized that auditory zzso processing, as is required in the discrimination of speech and zzso sound according to its zzso features, will lead to a specific involvement of a zzso zzso processing network zzso the zzso portion of the inferior frontal zzso and the inferior zzso zzso In agreement with our hypothesis results revealed significant responses in the zzso part of the inferior frontal zzso and the zzso zzso of the left zzso when participants had to discriminate speech and zzso stimuli based on subtle zzso acoustic zzso In contrast, when participants had to discriminate speech and zzso stimuli on the basis of changes in the frequency content, we observed bilateral zzso along the middle zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso The results of the present study demonstrate an involvement of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso analysis of speech sounds as well as in the zzso acoustic analysis of zzso sounds with analogous zzso zzso
