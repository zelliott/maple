This work considers the design and operation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso for magnetic resonance zzso zzso of finger zzso using a zzso zzso The considerations were focused on the requirements of high sensitivity, easy patient access, and zzso The proposed design is a short, zzso zzso zzso that accomplishes high spatial uniformity over a zzso region of interest zzso The zzso resembles an zzso ring, and easily fits fingers that are zzso An experimental demonstration of the proposed approach is given by imaging the zzso zzso joint in healthy volunteers using a zzso field of view zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso sequence were zzso
