We zzso and discuss our previous research results on the correlation between findings on magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso assisted zzso zzso zzso and the intensity of vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso and in the surrounding zzso zzso MR images zzso zzso zzso CT during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and CT zzso zzso zzso zzso 17) were zzso correlated zzso and zzso with zzso expression in zzso and in the surrounding liver assessed by western zzso zzso zzso ratio correlated with zzso expression index zzso values of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images, directly on zzso fast zzso images, and marginally and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso fast zzso images, standard zzso ratio of zzso correlated directly with zzso values of zzso By CT zzso zzso the zzso index of zzso showed a moderate inverse correlation with zzso values of zzso and the zzso index of the liver showed zzso moderate direct correlation with zzso values in the zzso zzso of zzso on images correlated directly with zzso values of zzso on zzso zzso zzso images, zzso fast zzso images, zzso zzso zzso images, zzso zzso images, and CT zzso zzso Our results may reflect that MR signal intensity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso on CT or MR images are closely related to the intensity of zzso expression in zzso as zzso by zzso or zzso in zzso Although the real effects of our results on zzso practice are debatable at this moment, we believe that our results may help future zzso practice in conjunction with zzso or genetic treatment for zzso
