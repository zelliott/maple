Left zzso assist devices zzso have become an important treatment option for heart failure zzso However, altered blood flow patterns are suspected to affect zzso in the zzso or cause structural changes to the zzso zzso leading to zzso and valve dysfunction or zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate flow patterns in a realistic in zzso model system using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

A magnetic resonance compatible model system was developed consisting of an zzso connected to a zzso simulating the zzso flow of the native zzso An zzso was connected to the zzso model via three different zzso zzso zzso patterns in the entire system as well as flow rates in zzso positions for reduced and zero cardiac output were zzso 

zzso position influences flow patterns and flow rates in the entire zzso zzso For a residual cardiac zzso a larger zzso and a decreased flow rate of the zzso result in a higher flow rate and smaller retrograde flow in the ascending zzso when compared with a smaller zzso or a zzso position in the descending zzso zzso flow zzso in the zzso were observed for the zzso position in the descending zzso 

In the setting of reduced cardiac zzso as commonly observed in patients on zzso therapy, a large zzso to the ascending zzso for the zzso zzso zzso the zzso flow patterns in the zzso zzso Our approach may aid in a better understanding of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso position and zzso may help to prevent the progression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
