A number of zzso studies have attempted to assess the effect of zzso ozone exposure in zzso For the most part, they have failed to document convincingly an association between chronic ozone exposure and differences in lung function performance or respiratory zzso This is not surprising given the small respiratory effects observed in animals chronically exposed to ozone and assuming that people with abnormal respiratory function resulting from other occupational or environmental zzso such as tobacco smoke, would make up a much larger percentage of the population than people with respiratory effects attributable to zzso zzso either more sensitive end points must be developed to detect subtle changes due to chronic ozone exposure, or ways of selecting zzso that are especially sensitive to ozone must be zzso It has been well documented that there are large and zzso differences in the acute response of individuals to ozone as measured by pulmonary function zzso Recently, it has also been shown that there are large differences in the acute response of individuals to ozone as measured by inflammatory and other zzso zzso This paper discusses the problems of selecting individuals who are sensitive to ozone depending on the end point zzso It also describes potential new sensitive end points that might be available for ozone epidemiology studies in the near zzso
