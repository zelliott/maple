Despite an extensive literature on the neural zzso of semantic knowledge, how zzso information is represented in the brain has yet to be zzso zzso in the present study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the neural zzso of person zzso Focusing on the neural zzso of action knowledge, participants reported whether or not a common set of behaviors could be performed by people or zzso While dogs and people are capable of performing many of the same actions zzso run, sit, zzso we zzso that the representation of this knowledge would be associated with distinct patterns of neural zzso Specifically, person judgments were expected to activate cortical areas associated with theory of mind zzso zzso The results supported this zzso Whereas zzso judgments about dogs were associated with activity in various regions, including the zzso and zzso zzso identical judgments about people yielded activity in areas of prefrontal cortex, notably the right middle and zzso frontal zzso These findings suggest that person knowledge may be functionally zzso from comparable information about other animals, with zzso judgments about people recruiting neural activity that is indicative of zzso zzso
