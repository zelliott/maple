zzso disease zzso is a zzso zzso of unknown origin in which zzso involvement has been reported in the range of zzso to zzso in large zzso Reports on clinical and zzso aspects of zzso syndrome zzso are in general limited in zzso Our purpose was to determine the MR patterns in patients with zzso who had neural zzso involvement and to correlate our findings with possible vascular zzso 

The MR images of 65 patients with zzso and neural zzso involvement were zzso In a zzso of patients who had serial MR studies, we evaluated the zzso location and distribution of the zzso and whether they corresponded to any vascular territory, and studied their extension, enhancement patterns, and zzso zzso 

The most common imaging finding in zzso patients who had neural zzso involvement was a zzso junction zzso with zzso extending along certain long tracts in the brain stem and zzso in zzso of the zzso The next most common location of involvement was the zzso region, seen in zzso of the zzso Three primary cervical spinal zzso zzso and one case of isolated zzso nerve involvement were zzso 

The zzso distribution of zzso in zzso appears to support the hypothesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso veins of the zzso explains the zzso involvement of the brain stem structures observed in our zzso This pattern of zzso distribution might help to differentiate zzso from other zzso as well as from the zzso diseases of the zzso such as multiple zzso
