The neural mechanism of number representation and processing is currently under extensive zzso In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we designed a number comparison task to examine how people represent and compare zzso numbers in the brain, and whether they process the decade and unit digits in zzso We manipulated the zzso zzso and zzso distance between the pairs of zzso We observed both zzso interference and the distance effect in the zzso zzso People responded more slowly to zzso pairs of numbers and pairs of a smaller zzso The inferior zzso zzso showed common and distinct patterns of zzso for both zzso selection and number comparison zzso and its activity was modulated by the zzso interference effect and the distance zzso Taken together, these results support both parallel and holistic comparison of zzso numbers in the zzso
