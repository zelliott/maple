We introduce a hybrid method for functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso detection based on the well-developed zzso and zzso zzso The proposed method includes zzso both of the zzso zzso inherent in zzso and the prior information afforded by the zzso component of region zzso Compared to the fuzzy zzso zzso analysis, this method avoids making assumptions about the number of clusters and the zzso complexity is reduced zzso We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the general linear model and the fuzzy zzso zzso method conducted on simulated and in zzso zzso Experimental results show that our method successfully detected expected activated regions and has advantages over the other two zzso
