In zzso cell zzso zzso evaluation of the extent of disease is one of the major zzso of patient zzso Historically this is undertaken using plain zzso and bone zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be useful in detecting skeletal and zzso zzso in both adults and zzso 

To evaluate the usefulness of zzso zzso in patients with zzso in comparison with plain zzso and bone zzso 

In nine children zzso years of zzso mean zzso zzso who had a pathological diagnosis of zzso and had either plain zzso or bone zzso for comparison, 43 zzso MR examinations were zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the disease on zzso zzso were compared with those on plain zzso and bone zzso 

zzso showed zzso zzso involvement in one patient, zzso zzso involvement in three, and zzso zzso disease in zzso zzso zzso identified additional skeletal zzso in three zzso of eight patients, compared with plain zzso and in two zzso of eight, compared with bone zzso zzso zzso detected zzso zzso of the disease in five zzso of the nine patients exclusively, except for one patient whose lung zzso were also detected on plain zzso In two patients, treatment was changed according to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a useful initial and follow-up diagnostic method to assess the extent of zzso because zzso zzso not only identifies more skeletal zzso of the disease than do plain zzso and bone zzso but also detects zzso zzso of the zzso
