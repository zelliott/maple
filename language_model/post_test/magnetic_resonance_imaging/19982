In a pilot zzso zzso study, a protocol was designed to zzso three-dimensional magnetic resonance zzso images for linear and zzso zzso of the developing rat zzso MR imaging, because of its zzso nature, provides a complement to traditional optical zzso zzso zzso received 0, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso injection during gestation days zzso At zzso days zzso 23 and 60, brains from representative male and female rats from two zzso in each dose group were fixed with zzso neutral zzso zzso by zzso zzso for in zzso MR zzso A zzso small animal magnet system was used to obtain zzso images at 100 zzso resolution for zzso 23 and 150 zzso resolution for zzso zzso Data from a rapid screening method based on zzso MR slices of whole brain, zzso zzso and zzso showed a zzso decreased volume of whole brain, zzso and zzso in treated zzso zzso zzso estimates using the zzso method confirmed these zzso The brains were subsequently removed and processed for conventional zzso examination of zzso and zzso zzso It is concluded that MR imaging in rat zzso zzso studies offers the advantages of in zzso zzso zzso of brain structures while preserving the samples for conventional optical zzso
