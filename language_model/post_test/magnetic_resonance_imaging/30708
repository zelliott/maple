The primary objective of the current prospective Phase II study of zzso zzso in adult patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso was to evaluate zzso zzso survival zzso 

Forty patients zzso men and 12 zzso ages zzso years zzso age, zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso were zzso All patients had been treated previously with surgery and zzso zzso zzso dose, 60 grays zzso range, 59-61 zzso In addition, all patients were treated zzso with either zzso chemotherapy (21 zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 13 zzso zzso in 8 zzso or zzso (19 zzso zzso patients who were treated previously with a zzso were treated with zzso at the time of first zzso zzso patients were treated with zzso at the time of second zzso and 19 patients were treated with zzso at the time of first zzso zzso was administered zzso on 2 consecutive days zzso zzso per day) every 4 weeks zzso defined as a single zzso zzso and zzso evaluations were performed every 8 zzso 

All patients were zzso In total, 170 cycles of zzso zzso 2 zzso range, zzso zzso were zzso zzso toxicity included zzso in all patients zzso anemia in 6 patients zzso zzso in 7 patients zzso and zzso in 9 patients zzso Four patients required zzso zzso required red blood cell zzso and two required zzso zzso One patient developed zzso fever without zzso zzso No zzso deaths zzso Seven patients zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso partial response, 11 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso had stable disease, and 22 patients zzso had progressive disease after a single cycle of zzso The time to tumor progression ranged from 2 months to 18 months zzso 2 zzso Survival ranged from 3 months to 24 months zzso 4 zzso In patients with either a zzso response or stable disease zzso zzso 18 zzso the median time to tumor progression was 6 months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the median survival was 10 months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8-10 zzso The zzso zzso rate was zzso
