The objective of the study was to compare the diagnostic reliability of zzso US with MR zzso in diagnosing zzso zzso tears, with zzso findings used as the zzso 

In a prospective study 50 patients who later underwent zzso surgery of the rotator cuff were examined zzso by zzso US with MR zzso The presence or absence of a zzso or zzso zzso zzso tear and the tear size as demonstrated by each imaging and zzso was zzso The tear size was divided into three zzso small zzso zzso medium zzso zzso and large zzso zzso 

The zzso diagnosis was a zzso tear in 40 patients, zzso tears in 5, and intact zzso zzso in zzso zzso US correctly diagnosed 35 out of 40 zzso tears and MR zzso 39 out of 40 zzso zzso Regarding zzso tears, zzso US underestimated 2 cases as no tear and overestimated 1 case as a zzso zzso MR zzso underestimated 1 case as a zzso tear and overestimated 2 cases as zzso and zzso tears zzso zzso US and MR zzso yield a sensitivity for zzso tears of zzso and zzso with specificity of zzso and zzso Based on the grading system, zzso US zzso correctly predicted the tear size of 23 zzso of the 35 zzso tears and MR zzso 30 zzso of the 39 zzso zzso 

zzso ultrasound seems to be a promising imaging zzso comparable to MR zzso for the assessment of the zzso zzso zzso
