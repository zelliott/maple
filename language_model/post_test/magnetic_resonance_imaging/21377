zzso zzso contrast agents based on zzso of a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso were prepared and studied by a variety of zzso zzso The zzso were formed by reaction of the corresponding zzso with zzso and were zzso with the zzso zzso to get the final complexes, zzso and zzso zzso structure of the complexes was estimated by investigation of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso complexes are endowed with a short water residence time zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and a high abundance of the zzso zzso zzso They show a high zzso zzso at high fields due to a convenient combination of the fast water exchange rate and the slow rate of the molecular tumbling given by their zzso zzso The zzso relaxation enhancements per zzso of a contrast agent zzso are very high reaching for a larger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 25 zzso and magnetic fields zzso T and 3 zzso respectively, which is the highest reported zzso zzso for zzso stable contrast agents of an intermediate molecular mass zzso zzso with one water zzso in the first coordination zzso
