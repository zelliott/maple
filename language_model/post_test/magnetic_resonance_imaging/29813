The concept of the zzso zzso as critically zzso and functionally impaired, but potentially viable brain, was introduced over 25 years zzso Recent studies have used a combination of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso to delineate the putative zzso zzso provides zzso cerebral blood flow imaging and zzso is an index of the largely irreversible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mismatch is an operational definition of the zzso that was introduced in the late zzso This definition has been modified in recent years with the recognition that the zzso boundary includes a region of benign zzso and that a portion of the zzso core is potentially zzso with rapid zzso An zzso zzso signature is present in the majority of patients within 6 h of stroke zzso often but not invariably associated with zzso zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso and is strictly time zzso It has been zzso that zzso imaging using zzso can provide a zzso zzso zzso and be used to predict benefit from zzso therapy beyond the established zzso zzso This has been suggested by pilot studies, but confirmation will rely on zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence and extent of the zzso may also predict the opportunity for tissue salvage with zzso zzso zzso and zzso parameters are being used in zzso stroke zzso Such trials can be performed with zzso patients zzso between treated and control groups and provide a biological signal of efficacy with only zzso of the sample size required for a Phase III zzso
