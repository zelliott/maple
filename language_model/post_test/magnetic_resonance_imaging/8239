There is growing evidence that the gene zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso This study sought to clarify the effects of the zzso zzso zzso on brain structure, function, and risk of developing schizophrenia in a zzso cohort of individuals at high risk of schizophrenia for familial zzso 

In a sample of 78 people at high genetic risk of zzso the risk of progression to schizophrenia associated with the zzso Val zzso was zzso The relationship of the Val zzso to brain structure and function was investigated using structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data collected on the high-risk subjects before their disease outcome was zzso 

The zzso Val zzso increased the risk of schizophrenia in this cohort in a zzso zzso zzso with the zzso Val zzso had reduced gray matter density in anterior zzso zzso In addition, there was evidence of increased zzso in lateral prefrontal zzso and anterior and zzso zzso with increasing sentence difficulty in those with the zzso Val zzso despite a similar level of zzso 

The zzso Val zzso is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in subjects at increased familial risk, in whom it has zzso effects on prefrontal brain structure and zzso These patterns of altered brain structure and function have previously been associated with schizophrenia in this and other zzso
