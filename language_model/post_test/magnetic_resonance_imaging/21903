The usefulness of dynamic tests of zzso release in determining underlying pathology in zzso patients is not well recognized by zzso only zzso of whom routinely perform such zzso High resolution zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has become more widely available during the past 5 years and is now generally regarded as the zzso imaging method of zzso Since few zzso patients are now submitted to surgery, it is important to ascertain the usefulness of these techniques in suggesting a pathological zzso 

A 3 year retrospective audit of the information derived from measurement of zzso and zzso responses to the zzso zzso zzso and from high resolution zzso zzso in patients being investigated for hyperprolactinemia in regional zzso zzso 

zzso patients (10 male, 74 zzso whose investigation of zzso included a zzso test and high resolution zzso zzso Patients who had zzso tests performed after zzso surgery or who did not have zzso zzso were excluded from the zzso 

zzso and zzso were measured zzso and at 30 and 60 minutes following zzso (10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was performed in all zzso 

20 patients had a normal zzso response to zzso zzso as zzso zzso 3) and this group included five patients in whom zzso was not zzso zzso zzso showed evidence of a zzso in only two patients, imaging being unequivocally normal in the zzso zzso patients had an abnormal zzso response to zzso and 18 of these had a zzso zzso zzso nine other zzso zzso zzso was performed in the remaining 46 patients with abnormal zzso response to zzso and suggested zzso in 29 zzso identified other structural abnormalities in six cases but was entirely normal in 11 zzso Neither the zzso zzso level nor the zzso response could refine the diagnosis further because of overlap between the various zzso 

The majority of patients with a normal dynamic response of zzso to zzso had a normal or near normal zzso zzso zzso In the two cases where an zzso was detected it could have been an incidental zzso or cyst, thus suggesting that zzso scanning could normally be omitted in patients whose zzso response to zzso is normal zzso of our zzso The group of patients with an abnormal dynamic response of zzso to zzso was not generally amenable to further diagnostic refinement by considering the degree of zzso or the zzso response to zzso because of overlap of these parameters between the diagnostic zzso Therefore any degree of zzso associated with a blunted zzso response to zzso warrants zzso zzso
