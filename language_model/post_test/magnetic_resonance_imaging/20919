We investigated age-related changes in default, attention, and control network activity and their interactions in young and old zzso Brain activity during autobiographical and zzso planning was assessed using zzso analysis and with intrinsic connectivity networks as regions of zzso In both groups, autobiographical planning engaged the default network while zzso planning engaged the attention network, consistent with a competition between the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The control network was engaged for both planning zzso In young subjects, the control network coupled with the default network during autobiographical planning and with the attention network during zzso zzso In old subjects, zzso network zzso was observed during both planning tasks, and old adults failed to zzso the default network during zzso zzso This failure is not indicative of default network dysfunction per se, evidenced by default network engagement during autobiographical zzso Rather, a failure to zzso the default network in old adults is indicative of a lower degree of flexible network zzso and reduced dynamic range of network zzso to changing task zzso
