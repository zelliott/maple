Little is known about current surveillance patterns after treatment of zzso liver zzso zzso or whether the intensity of surveillance zzso with zzso We sought to define current zzso patterns of surveillance and investigate whether intensity of surveillance impacted zzso 

We zzso the zzso zzso and End zzso Medicare database for patients with zzso diagnosed between 1991 and 2005 who underwent liver zzso and/or tumor zzso zzso of zzso abdominal zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was recorded for zzso 5 years after zzso The association between frequency of imaging with secondary interventions and long-term survival were zzso 

We identified zzso patients with zzso treated with zzso median age was 73 years, and the majority were male zzso zzso treatment consisted of liver zzso zzso zzso zzso or both simultaneously zzso CT zzso was zzso more often for zzso surveillance compared with zzso zzso and PET zzso A zzso trend was noted with more frequent surveillance imaging obtained in zzso year 1 zzso zzso versus year 5 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of living patients had no imaging after 2 zzso zzso of surveillance imaging correlated with procedure type zzso number of zzso years: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso Other factors associated with a greater frequency of surveillance included younger age at diagnosis, geographic location in the South, and zzso directed surgery in 2000 through 2005 (all P zzso zzso zzso survival did not differ by intensity of surveillance imaging zzso zzso 43 months vs 2 zzso 57 months vs 1 zzso 54 zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso exists in how often surveillance imaging is obtained after treatment of zzso zzso of imaging does not affect time to second procedure or median survival zzso Surveillance guidelines for zzso need to be refocused to provide the best value for zzso zzso
