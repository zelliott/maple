To investigate the potential mechanism of zzso which is the sensory and motor experience associated with dental zzso 

Twenty patients with implant supported full zzso or traditional full zzso were recruited in this zzso zzso zzso zzso scan covering the whole brain was carried out in these patients in zzso The zzso data were analyzed with zzso 99 zzso 

In implant supported removable zzso group, increased blood oxygen level dependent zzso signals during zzso were found in prefrontal cortex, zzso cortex, superior zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso In implant supported fixed zzso group, main zzso were found in prefrontal cortex, primary sensory and motor cortex, zzso area, zzso cortex, superior zzso cortex, insular, zzso zzso zzso and zzso In traditional full zzso group, significant zzso were mainly found in prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso Their zzso maps showed the greatest individually dependent zzso 

zzso and motor feedback of central nervous system in patients with implant support fixed zzso is close to that of natural zzso zzso with traditional full zzso is more likely a process of task learning, memory and adaptation, which might be a more individually dependent zzso
