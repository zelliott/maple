The authors report the principles, experimental evaluation and clinical approach of a method for dynamic imaging of flow patterns by zzso based upon the phase zzso zzso The imaging method is based upon zzso zzso functioning in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in this sequence enable attribution to the moving spins phase of a value which is considered to be zzso to the flow zzso A map of rates is then obtained from the phase zzso zzso of this sequence in zzso has shown excellent correlations between flow rate and the phase information thus zzso r always zzso zzso for rates up to zzso The first results obtained in zzso for the zzso and abdominal zzso in 11 control subjects, show that the technique is suitable for the study of zzso blood flow, providing very detailed information concerning the spatial distribution of flow zzso Mean flow in the zzso abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso greater than that in the inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso corresponding to an zzso of portal vein flow of zzso zzso zzso limitations related to the use of a zzso magnet are nevertheless stressed and the authors list the technical aspects necessary for the better clinical zzso of this zzso zzso zzso A review of the current literature forms the basis for an assessment of the potential importance of dynamic and quantitative zzso of flow patterns in the cardiovascular zzso
