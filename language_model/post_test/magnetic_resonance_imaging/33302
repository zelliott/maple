zzso therapies are gaining increasing importance and have been evaluated in many settings, including cancer, Parkinson disease, zzso repair, stroke, and zzso In this context, it is of major importance that the cells are implanted into an optimal tissue environment and, zzso that they reach the diseased zzso zzso cell injection often is the route of choice, particularly if the cells are expected to circulate in the blood for longer periods of time and are able to actively migrate to the diseased zzso Unfortunately, often only a small percentage of zzso injected cells reach the target zzso Higher zzso can be achieved if the cells are injected into an artery that feeds the diseased zzso However, in this case, fast blood zzso and substantial sheer stress make it difficult for the cells to zzso In the study by zzso and colleagues zzso genetic engineering was used to overcome this zzso zzso precursor cells were zzso zzso with very late zzso zzso binding to vascular cell zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in inflamed zzso zzso After labeling these cells with zzso iron oxide zzso containing zzso significantly increased binding to inflamed brain zzso cells was shown and their homogeneous distribution over the inflamed brain tissue was convincingly demonstrated with magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso zzso The authors concluded that transient zzso of zzso cells with zzso in combination with their zzso injection and the use of MR imaging monitoring may be an elegant way to increase the efficacy of zzso treatments of inflammatory brain zzso
