zzso functional zzso zzso has been used to indicate brain regions associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso This technique enables the zzso of the complete zzso network, including zzso and deeply situated cortical zzso Before zzso can be used as an additional diagnostic tool in the zzso zzso its added value should be assessed in relation to zzso zzso recorded from depth zzso zzso or from the zzso zzso currently the clinical zzso In this study, we propose a framework for the analysis of the zzso data to investigate in a quantitative way whether zzso reflects the same cortical areas as identified by the zzso present in zzso zzso For that purpose, the data of both zzso were analyzed with a general linear model at the same time scale and within the same spatial zzso The zzso were used as zzso in the model, yielding for zzso the brain zzso that were related to the zzso and, similarly for zzso the zzso that were zzso Finally, the results of the zzso analysis were projected on the anatomical zzso of the zzso To explore the usefulness of this quantitative approach, a sample of five patients was studied who both underwent zzso and zzso zzso For clinical zzso the results of the zzso analysis were compared to the standard visual review of zzso in zzso and to the identified seizure onset zone, the zzso area, and outcome of zzso zzso analysis revealed a spatial pattern for the most frequent and dominant zzso present in the data of all zzso The zzso with the highest correlation values were in good zzso with the zzso that showed zzso zzso during those events in the zzso zzso These results indicate that the analysis of zzso data at the time scale of zzso using the same type of zzso model, is a promising way to validate zzso zzso In fact, the zzso areas with a positive zzso response function were closely related to the spatial pattern of zzso in the zzso recordings in four of the five zzso The areas of significant zzso that were not located in the vicinity of depth electrodes, were mainly characterized by negative zzso zzso Furthermore, the area with a positive zzso response function overlapped with the zzso area in three patients, while it was located at the edge of the zzso area for zzso To zzso the results of this study encourage the application of zzso to guide the zzso of depth zzso as prerequisite for successful zzso zzso
