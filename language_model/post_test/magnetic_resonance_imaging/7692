We assessed the outcome and toxicity of salvage therapy zzso zzso with zzso and high cumulative activities in patients with zzso zzso neuroendocrine zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso a consecutive cohort of 33 patients with zzso zzso who underwent salvage zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso in our zzso All patients had progressive zzso prior to salvage treatment and had shown an initial response to zzso The mean cumulative activity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response was assessed using CT and/or zzso according to modified zzso zzso zzso was evaluated using laboratory data, including complete blood counts and zzso function tests using zzso zzso Survival analysis was performed with the zzso curve method and a significance level at zzso 

zzso responses consisted of complete response in 1 patient zzso partial response in 6 patients zzso minor response in 1 patient zzso stable disease in 14 patients zzso and progressive disease in 11 patients zzso Median zzso survival zzso from the start of salvage therapy was 13 months zzso zzso zzso and patients with a history of a durable zzso after initial zzso tended to have long-lasting zzso after salvage treatment zzso None of the patients developed severe zzso zzso zzso or a zzso syndrome during zzso zzso albeit zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in 7 patients zzso The cumulative administered activity was not associated with an increased zzso of zzso 

zzso with zzso in the zzso setting is safe and effective in patients with zzso zzso
