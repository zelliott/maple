The management of zzso zzso zzso zzso particularly in patients with no symptoms or with only minor zzso has not yet been zzso We zzso zzso patients with zzso to zzso correlations between the clinical manifestations, magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings, zzso and therapeutic zzso 

We zzso studied 37 patients with zzso who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of whom 27 patients underwent surgical zzso 

The presence of frontal headaches and anterior zzso dysfunction was unrelated to the zzso size but was more frequent in patients with zzso and zzso zzso on zzso images zzso than those with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All three patients with zzso zzso dysfunction had a high-intensity zzso on zzso zzso whereas zzso dysfunction was not observed in patients with a zzso zzso on zzso In contrast to the excellent therapeutic outcomes with regard to visual zzso and zzso recovery of zzso dysfunction was zzso only three of nine patients with zzso showed zzso Among six patients with zzso recognized intense chronic inflammation in the zzso wall, five patients had an zzso of zzso high intensity zzso two patients had distinct rim enhancement on zzso zzso all patients had frontal headaches zzso and four patients had associated zzso zzso none of which improved after surgical zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso on zzso images, which contain zzso material within the cyst, may be associated with chronic inflammation that can potentially cause irreversible zzso zzso In zzso patients with zzso of these MR zzso close follow-up with precise zzso evaluation and zzso zzso is necessary to avoid zzso progression of the zzso
