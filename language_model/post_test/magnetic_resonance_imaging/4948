The reinforcement sensitivity theory zzso relates individual differences in reward sensitivity to the zzso of the behavioral approach system zzso zzso brain structures have been repeatedly associated with reward processing, but also with cognitive processes such as task zzso In the present study, we examined the association between reward sensitivity and the zzso zzso zzso response with set switching in 31 zzso As expected, the right inferior frontal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso the left zzso were involved in zzso activity for the overall zzso zzso differences in Gray's reward sensitivity were related to stronger activity in the zzso and the zzso zzso Thus, trait reward sensitivity contributed to the zzso of brain responsiveness in zzso zzso Having considered previous research, we propose that higher zzso activity is associated with a stronger reward to process a better zzso of zzso tasks and the diminished processing of secondary zzso
