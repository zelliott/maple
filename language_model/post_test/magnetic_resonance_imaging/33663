The purpose of this study was to measure normal zzso fluid zzso zzso within the zzso and upper cervical zzso spaces and the zzso zzso Phase contrast zzso MR sequences were performed in zzso and zzso planes on 13 volunteers with flow zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed considerable variations in healthy subjects, depending both on zzso zzso and subjects, with zzso peak zzso ranging from 0 to 7 zzso In the zzso spaces, the highest zzso occurred in the anterior location and increased from the zzso zzso angle zzso towards the lower cervical zzso In the zzso system, the highest zzso occurred through the aqueduct of zzso zzso flow within the third zzso seemed to reflect a circular zzso There was a zzso net zzso flow in the aqueduct whereas in the upper cervical spaces net zzso flow was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso profiles of zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso After the R wave, zzso zzso motion was first observed in the zzso zzso spaces, soon after in the anterior zzso spaces and later in the zzso zzso Considering the zzso of zzso zzso three successively initiated phenomena may explain the zzso course of zzso zzso the zzso expansion of the main arteries at the base of the brain, the zzso expansion of the zzso axis and, finally, the zzso expansion of the zzso zzso
