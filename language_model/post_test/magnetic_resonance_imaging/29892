zzso resonance zzso of zzso interventions offers various advantages, including the absence of zzso radiation, excellent soft tissue contrast, and zzso and functional imaging zzso The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso using active zzso tracking with automatic slice positioning and zzso zzso MR zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of 16 zzso was attempted in 15 pigs using real-time tracking of active zzso zzso zzso was monitored by selective zzso projection zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso was used for the assessment of zzso zzso Additional zzso correlation was available in 2 zzso The image quality of zzso zzso zzso was rated by an independent zzso who was not involved in the animal zzso 

Active zzso tracking with automatic slice positioning allowed reliable zzso guidance and zzso of the zzso artery in all zzso zzso was successful in all zzso (11 left, 5 zzso as verified by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso The image quality of zzso zzso zzso was rated excellent in 10 animals, moderate in 4 animals, and poor in 1 zzso 

Renal zzso using active zzso tracking and zzso zzso is zzso Selective zzso zzso allows the assessment of blood supply and organ zzso before, zzso and after therapeutic interventions, thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso
