zzso can occur in zzso if zzso tissue is acutely or chronically heated to levels equal to or greater than body zzso zzso MR imaging has been shown to elevate tissue temperatures, particularly if high levels of zzso radiation are zzso To determine if MR imaging above the recommended level for zzso radiation is associated with heating of the zzso zzso skin temperatures were measured in eight subjects immediately before and after MR imaging of the zzso with a zzso zzso MR scanner at mean zzso average specific zzso rates ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The average imaging time was 23 zzso A statistically significant zzso less than zzso increase in average zzso skin temperature was associated with MR imaging zzso MR imaging, zzso degrees zzso after MR imaging, zzso degrees zzso The largest change in temperature was zzso degrees C, and the highest temperature measured was zzso degrees zzso MR imaging at relatively high specific zzso rates produced a statistically significant increase in average zzso skin zzso However, the recorded temperatures were below the threshold known to affect zzso in zzso
