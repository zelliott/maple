zzso zzso infusion leads to zzso zzso In dogs, the authors examined time course of zzso formation and the role of concentration in zzso zzso 

Dogs were prepared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To define the time course of zzso formation, serial magnetic resonance imaging was performed in animals receiving 10 or 31 days of zzso infusion zzso zzso at 40 zzso At these times, zzso was removed from the zzso and further magnetic resonance images were acquired over zzso additional zzso To assess dose versus zzso dogs received zzso infusions of vehicle, 12 zzso zzso as zzso zzso at 40 zzso or zzso zzso at 334 zzso (12 zzso for 28 zzso Additional dogs received 3 zzso as zzso zzso at 10 zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance images in dogs receiving zzso zzso zzso at 40 zzso revealed zzso zzso as early as 3 days with a prominent signal by 10 zzso zzso of zzso reduced the mass volume within 7 zzso At a fixed infusion rate, the zzso of zzso formation with the continuous zzso infusion of zzso ranged from 0 in zzso dogs to zzso in dogs treated with zzso zzso at 40 zzso (12 zzso zzso of 12 zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso in one of four zzso The authors found that infusion of zzso in different zzso at a fixed rate resulted in a zzso increase in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso around 40 zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging showed a rapid formation and zzso of the masses initiated by zzso zzso zzso These masses are dependent on local zzso
