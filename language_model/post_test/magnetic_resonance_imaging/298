The zzso and zzso clinical trials were designed to investigate the zzso effects of zzso 80 zzso and zzso 10 zzso alone and in zzso in patients at high risk of cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso enables investigation of zzso effects of these agents on cardiac structural and functional zzso Here, we report the design, analysis zzso zzso and relevant quality control procedures, and baseline patient characteristics of the zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso was undertaken in 330 subjects enrolled in zzso and 38 subjects in zzso across eight centers in six zzso zzso were performed by two independent analysts using zzso zzso Cases with discrepancies in zzso mass zzso of zzso were independently zzso Cases with discrepancies in zzso volume zzso of zzso or zzso volume zzso of zzso were then zzso by zzso 

zzso characteristics were broadly similar to the main zzso trials, except for a higher frequency of coronary artery disease and Asian ethnicity in the zzso zzso of zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso g in zzso zzso analyses revealed increased zzso and zzso and reduced zzso in subjects with a history of either coronary artery disease or zzso zzso 

The zzso cardiac zzso zzso protocol provides for a reliable assessment of the effects of zzso and zzso alone and in zzso on cardiac structural and functional parameters over a zzso follow-up zzso
