The purpose of this study was to investigate if the new folate zzso zzso zzso may enhance zzso zzso A zzso was induced in the right knee of 15 zzso zzso MR imaging of both knees was performed at 2 T before and up to 2 h and 24 h after injection zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 dose finding study and zzso zzso 6, zzso zzso zzso the zzso targeted zzso analog zzso zzso zzso 3 at 24 h after zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso zzso zzso Pulse sequences comprised zzso 80 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inversion recovery 10 degrees zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso times of zzso knees and zzso normal knees were zzso zzso zzso expression was confirmed with zzso All three contrast agents showed an initial zzso effect with significantly higher zzso of zzso knees compared with normal knees zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso but not zzso or zzso showed a prolonged enhancement of the zzso Compared with zzso values, the zzso times of inflamed zzso were significantly decreased at 2 h zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the presence of folate receptors in the inflamed zzso but not normal zzso Thus, results suggest a specific zzso of the folate zzso zzso zzso in this arthritis zzso
