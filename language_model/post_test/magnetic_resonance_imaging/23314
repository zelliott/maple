zzso brain zzso methods with a good precision and accuracy are required to detect subtle changes in brain volumes over time in clinical zzso However, the ability of established methods such as zzso US and zzso to estimate brain volume change have not been compared on the same data, nor been evaluated with zzso manual zzso We compared zzso of brain volume change between zzso US and zzso in terms of precision zzso and accuracy zzso using one baseline and two repeated follow-up zzso T zzso scans after 4 years of 10 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was larger for US zzso zzso than for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In terms of absolute brain volume zzso US and zzso showed good correlation with the manual zzso and with each other (all zzso correlation zzso zzso all zzso zzso brain volume changes, zzso showed a good zzso zzso zzso a moderate zzso zzso and US a weak zzso zzso correlation with the manual zzso For zzso of volume change, zzso zzso correlation zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed a weak zzso but correlation was fairly good for zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, US and zzso showed a good precision, accuracy and zzso for brain volume zzso For zzso of volume change, zzso showed the best zzso zzso is a good alternative if volume change zzso of other brain structures are zzso
