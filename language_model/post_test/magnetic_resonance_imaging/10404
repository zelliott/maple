To determine the association between the zzso zzso motion pattern of the zzso zzso and zzso portions of the canine zzso column and the zzso of zzso facet zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso columns of 9 German Shepherd Dogs and 16 dogs of other breeds with similar body weights and body zzso 

Different zzso parameters of the zzso column were assessed by zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso and the 3-D motion pattern were zzso and correlation zzso were zzso 

Total range of motion for zzso and extension was mainly associated with the facet joint angle, the facet joint angle difference between levels of the zzso column in the zzso plane on CT images, disk zzso and lever arm zzso 

Motion is a complex process that is influenced by the entire 3-D zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso zzso In zzso dynamic zzso of the 3-D motion pattern of the zzso and zzso portions of the zzso column will be necessary to further assess zzso that could lead to disk zzso in zzso
