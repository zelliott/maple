The justification for magnetic resonance imaging zzso in isolated mild zzso remains zzso This study was undertaken to evaluate the contribution of zzso zzso in isolated zzso to zzso fetal zzso 

zzso prospective cohort zzso 

zzso prenatal reference zzso 

From February 2000 to May 2005, we zzso collected data concerning fetuses referred to us for cerebral zzso following detection of zzso by ultrasound scan zzso zzso 

Among these, we identified and zzso those cases in which zzso was isolated and did not exceed 12 zzso in ultrasound examinations prior to zzso scan zzso zzso 

Cases in which zzso provided additional information that was likely to have an impact on prenatal management were zzso 

During the study period, 310 zzso were performed because of fetal zzso zzso and zzso were suspected to be isolated zzso to zzso zzso in ultrasound scan and formed our zzso zzso confirmed the zzso to zzso isolated fetal zzso in 106 cases zzso and found other abnormalities in 5 zzso of these 106 zzso zzso found zzso measurement to be less than 10 zzso in 43 cases zzso and more than 12 zzso in 36 cases zzso Among these 36 fetuses with zzso size more than 12 zzso 6 zzso had other zzso whereas zzso did not find other abnormalities in the 43 cases with zzso size below 10 zzso 

Before advantages of zzso to ultrasound examination can be demonstrated, it seems reasonable that zzso should remain an zzso zzso restricted to selected clinical situations in which the results are expected to modify case zzso Where ultrasound scan suspects isolated zzso of 10 to 12 zzso our data suggest that when the finding is confirmed with zzso this could be expected in around zzso of zzso zzso the policy of routine zzso in such cases should depend on prenatal zzso zzso
