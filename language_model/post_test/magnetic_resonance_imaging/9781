A review of cases where symptomatic zzso zzso zzso as known as, zzso zzso were zzso 

To determine whether there is an association between symptomatic zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso with a thickened fatty zzso 

In 2008, the primary author reported on the unusual case of a giant zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso fatty zzso This led the author to be alert to the presence of spinal zzso zzso in future cases involving symptomatic zzso zzso Since the time of the initial report, 49 patients with zzso zzso have subsequently undergone surgical treatment and not infrequently spinal zzso zzso was also zzso The opportunity, therefore, presented itself to determine to what degree the two zzso were zzso 

We reviewed the zzso findings, zzso imaging, and basic zzso data from 50 zzso treated patients with symptomatic zzso zzso zzso 

Of the 50 patients, 14 zzso were found to have associated spinal zzso zzso with a thickened fatty zzso All 14 had a thickened fatty zzso identifiable at zzso Of these, 14 had evidence of spinal zzso zzso on zzso imaging studies, including 11 with the zzso at the level of zzso or below, and 13 with a fatty zzso seen on magnetic resonance zzso 

The association between symptomatic zzso zzso zzso is more than incidental and is probably reflective of a common zzso zzso Treatment of symptomatic zzso zzso should include a careful search for evidence of spinal zzso zzso with a thickened fatty zzso
