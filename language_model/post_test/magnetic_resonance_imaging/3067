We investigated the relationship between zzso zzso quantitative magnetic resonance imaging zzso and surgical outcome in 165 patients with intractable zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso A standard zzso zzso zzso was performed in all zzso Patients with an operative follow-up zzso 1 year were excluded from the zzso The extent of the lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso was guided by zzso and the side of zzso The extent of the zzso was not zzso of seizure outcome in patients with or without zzso formation zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients undergoing a right anterior zzso zzso had a larger zzso zzso zzso zzso but the side of surgery was not of zzso value in determining seizure outcome zzso zzso zzso The topography of the acute zzso spikes did not correlate with operative outcome zzso zzso zzso and was independent of zzso zzso studies zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also shown not to be of zzso importance zzso zzso zzso Our results indicates that the extent of the lateral zzso cortical zzso and the zzso findings are not important zzso of surgical outcome in patients with zzso
