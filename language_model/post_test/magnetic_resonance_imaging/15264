In the present study, we examined whether active range of neck motion zzso differed between persons with and without a diagnosis of zzso disorder type 2 zzso and explored whether magnetic resonance zzso zzso of specific ligaments or zzso at the zzso junction was associated with increased or decreased motion in any particular direction among the zzso zzso A zzso zzso was used for registration of zzso extension, side zzso zzso and right) and rotation zzso and zzso zzso The neck structures considered were the zzso and the zzso ligaments, and the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our study comprised 87 zzso patients and 29 control persons without any known neck zzso For comparing mean values of zzso between the groups, zzso and analysis of zzso zzso were zzso zzso patients had on average a shorter range of active motion for all movements compared with the control zzso The difference was statistically significant for all measures considered, except side zzso to the zzso Among the zzso patients, increasing severity of zzso to the zzso ligaments was associated with a decrease in zzso zzso and zzso A similar pattern was seen for zzso to the zzso zzso but the trend test was not zzso An abnormal zzso zzso membrane was associated with shorter range of left zzso with a significant trend test both in analyses with and without adjustment for zzso to other zzso No significant association was found in relation to zzso to the zzso zzso but very few persons had such zzso These findings indicate that soft tissue zzso may affect neck motion as reflected by zzso However, since zzso to different structures seem to affect the same movement, zzso alone is not a sufficient indicator for zzso zzso to specific structure in the upper cervical zzso
