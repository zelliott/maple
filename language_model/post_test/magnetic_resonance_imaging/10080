That auditory hallucinations are voices heard in the absence of external stimuli implies the existence of zzso neural activity within the auditory zzso responsible for their zzso Further, auditory hallucinations occur across a range of healthy and disease states that include reduced zzso zzso drug zzso delirium, and zzso This suggests that, even in health, the auditory zzso has a propensity to spontaneously zzso during zzso Here we report the findings of a functional zzso study, designed to examine baseline activity in zzso auditory zzso During silence, we show that functionally defined zzso auditory zzso is characterized by intermittent episodes of significantly increased activity in a large proportion (in some cases zzso of its zzso zzso increases in activity are associated with zzso of spontaneous zzso in the left primary and association auditory zzso and anterior zzso zzso We suggest that, within auditory regions, zzso activity is modulated by anterior zzso cortex, resulting in spontaneous zzso during zzso zzso an aspect of the zzso zzso zzso resembles a zzso zzso for the development of auditory zzso These observations may help explain why such hallucinations are zzso
