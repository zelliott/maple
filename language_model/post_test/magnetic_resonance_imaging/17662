To investigate the changes in hip MR imaging, evaluate the frequency of hip involvement and compare the value of clinical symptoms, zzso and MR imaging in the detection of hip involvement in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso MR imaging of the hip and clinical evaluation were undertaken in 58 patients with zzso zzso All patients were followed up 3 zzso Annual zzso and clinical evaluation were carried zzso The imaging data were independently assessed by two experienced zzso who were blinded to patient identity and clinical zzso Based on the Bath zzso zzso zzso zzso Index zzso scoring system, zzso scores zzso 2 were defined as zzso hip zzso On MR imaging, both acute and chronic inflammatory changes were considered positive signs for hip zzso zzso hip involvement was defined as current or past pain or limitation of the hip zzso The statistical analysis was performed using the zzso test for comparison of sensitivity among clinical symptoms, zzso and MR imaging in the detection of hip involvement and the zzso zzso for comparison of disease duration between with and without hip zzso A P value zzso was considered to be statistically zzso For interpreting zzso and zzso the percentage of agreement between the two zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso 

On MR imaging, positive changes were detected in 86 zzso hips among 116 hips in all 58 zzso Joint zzso was observed in 73 zzso zzso 23 out of 27 patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso sequences had abnormal zzso enhancement in bilateral zzso The other abnormal MR findings included zzso bone zzso zzso in 35 zzso hips, zzso in 22 zzso hips, fatty zzso of the bone zzso in 28 zzso hips, bone zzso destruction in 32 zzso hips, and zzso narrowing in 4 zzso zzso Based on the zzso scoring system, 68, 24, 18, 6 and 0 hips had no, suspicious, mild, moderate or severe damage on conventional zzso of the zzso zzso Thirty-five hips in 20 patients had current or past pain or zzso The proportion of hip involvement according to MR imaging, zzso and clinical symptoms was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR imaging yielded higher values than zzso and clinical symptoms in the detection of hip involvement in patients with AS zzso and zzso P zzso zzso reliability for interpretation of findings was acceptable for both zzso and zzso During zzso zzso hip involvement were found in 10 hips with zzso scores zzso 1 at baseline and clinical symptoms appeared in 15 sides of the original zzso zzso On baseline MR imaging, inflammatory changes were seen in all hips which appeared symptoms and/or zzso involvement both at baseline and during zzso 

The proportion of hip involvement is much higher than that suggested by zzso changes and clinical zzso MR imaging is superior to conventional zzso and clinical symptoms in the detection of hip zzso Joint zzso and zzso enhancement caused by zzso are the zzso hip findings on MR imaging in patients with zzso
