A number of minimally invasive methods have been tested for the zzso zzso of liver tumors as an alternative to surgical zzso The use of focused ultrasound zzso to zzso deep tumors offers the first completely zzso alternative to these zzso By increasing the flexibility of this technology with modern zzso zzso design and by combining it with magnetic resonance imaging for targeting and online guidance, a powerful tool results with the potential to offer treatment to a larger population of patients, to reduce trauma to the patient, and to reduce the cost of zzso In this article, we review previous work with focused ultrasound in the liver and recent experimental results with magnetic resonance imaging zzso
