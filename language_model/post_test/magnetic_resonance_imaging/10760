zzso evidence suggests that zzso stress disorder zzso is associated with small zzso zzso The authors compared zzso subjects with zzso and zzso subjects without zzso to clarify whether small zzso size is related to zzso or to mere trauma zzso 

zzso structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess zzso volumes in 30 men who had recently been exposed to a severe burn trauma and 15 matched healthy comparison zzso 

Relative to the comparison subjects, the zzso subjects with zzso zzso as well as the zzso subjects without zzso zzso had significantly smaller volumes of the right zzso zzso with zzso zzso subjects without zzso zzso zzso total areas of burned body surface were significantly related to smaller left zzso zzso Use of zzso treatment with the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso was significantly related to larger right zzso volumes and to stronger zzso zzso 

zzso is not a necessary condition for small zzso size in zzso zzso Rather, the results provide evidence that smaller zzso size in zzso individuals is a result of traumatic zzso The zzso application of zzso zzso may protect against zzso damage induced by traumatic zzso but increases the patient's risk of developing zzso zzso
