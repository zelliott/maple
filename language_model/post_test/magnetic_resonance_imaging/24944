We report the case of a patient zzso who showed a selective zzso in the recognition of familiar people, with very mild disease progression during a period of 30 months resulting from focal zzso of the right zzso zzso On formal zzso testing, zzso obtained high scores on tests of general intelligence, episodic memory, language, executive functions, selective attention, visual recognition and zzso zzso On more specific tasks of familiar and unfamiliar face recognition, zzso scored above the zzso means on zzso tests, but obtained highly pathological results on zzso zzso His disorder of recognition of familiar people was not due to loss of zzso information, since he obtained highly abnormal naming scores when presented with photographs of famous people but borderline or mildly abnormal scores in a tasks in which he had to name celebrities from verbal zzso On the other hand, zzso recognition disorder could not be considered to be a form of zzso zzso since a similar zzso was observed when he was requested to access information about famous persons through their voice rather than their zzso Two alternative interpretations are advanced to explain zzso inability to access his relatively spared zzso knowledge not only through the person's face but also through the person's zzso The first hypothesis is that, before zzso the zzso information, zzso recognition channels must zzso into a zzso zzso zzso system and that the right anterior zzso zzso play a crucial role in this zzso zzso The second hypothesis is that the zzso units have privileged access to zzso semantic knowledge and that other recognition zzso require zzso of the zzso units in order to access zzso semantic zzso
