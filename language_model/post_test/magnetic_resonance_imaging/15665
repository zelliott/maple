To examine age-related changes in the neural systems for reading in zzso and dyslexic children and zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to study age-related changes in the neural systems for reading in a zzso sample of 232 right-handed children 7 to 18 years of age zzso dyslexic readers and 119 zzso zzso as they read zzso 

In zzso readers, systems in the left anterior lateral zzso area developed with age, whereas systems in the right superior and middle frontal regions zzso In contrast, in dyslexic readers, systems in the left zzso zzso zzso regions developed with zzso Older zzso readers were left zzso in the anterior lateral zzso area; there was no difference in asymmetry between younger and older dyslexic zzso 

These findings offer a possible zzso explanation for the differences in reading acquisition between dyslexic and zzso readers and provide further evidence of the critical role of the left zzso region in the development of zzso
