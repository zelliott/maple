To use a combined zzso approach to examine the functional consequences of zzso zzso zzso dysfunction in the human motor zzso Specifically, we examined how a single zzso zzso in different genes associated with zzso inherited Parkinson disease alters the cortical control of sequential finger zzso 

zzso individuals carrying a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 9) zzso and 23 healthy controls without these zzso were studied with functional zzso zzso During zzso participants performed simple sequences of three zzso opposition movements with their right dominant zzso Since zzso zzso and zzso zzso cause a zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, we predicted a zzso recruitment of those zzso zzso areas that are normally implicated in the control of complex motor zzso We expected this zzso to be independent of the underlying zzso 

Task performance was comparable for all zzso The performance of a simple motor sequence task consistently activated the zzso supplementary motor area and right zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso carriers but not in zzso zzso zzso of these zzso areas was similar in carriers of a zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso in different genes linked to zzso inherited Parkinson disease are associated with an additional recruitment of zzso supplementary motor area and zzso zzso zzso zzso during a simple motor sequence zzso These zzso areas were recruited independently of the underlying zzso The observed zzso most likely reflects a zzso zzso mechanism to maintain motor function in the context of a mild zzso zzso
