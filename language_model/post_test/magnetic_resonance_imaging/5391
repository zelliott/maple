We sought to improve the utility of zzso measurement as a marker of active muscle disease in patients with idiopathic inflammatory zzso by correcting for zzso zzso caused by fatty replacement of muscle that zzso chronic muscle zzso 

zzso patients with idiopathic inflammatory zzso underwent a standardized zzso evaluation of the zzso Fat fraction maps were calculated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were generated from zzso zzso images on the basis of a zzso model that incorporated zzso fat fraction zzso zzso zzso of conventional and zzso muscle zzso values were compared with one another and with standardized visual scores of muscle disease based on zzso zzso and STIR zzso 

zzso muscle zzso maps showed lower mean values and greater zzso zzso than conventional zzso zzso as analyzed over a standardized portion of the thigh zzso Conventional and zzso zzso values correlated with visual scores of active muscle disease on STIR images and with the varying intensity of disease depicted with STIR in focal muscle zzso 

zzso zzso maps of muscle can be corrected for varying fat content by combining the information from chemical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Use of this strategy may prove useful in the study of idiopathic inflammatory zzso and other diseases characterized by both muscle inflammation and zzso
