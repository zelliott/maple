zzso zzso of the third zzso was recently reported as a novel tumor entity of the central nervous system with characteristic clinical and zzso features zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report on a zzso zzso and molecular genetic analysis of five cases of this rare zzso All tumors were zzso investigated for the expression of various differentiation zzso the proliferation marker zzso and a panel of selected zzso and tumor zzso gene zzso These studies revealed a strong expression of zzso zzso and zzso In addition, most tumors contained small zzso of zzso cells zzso for zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso or zzso The percentage of zzso positive cells was generally low zzso All tumors showed zzso for the zzso growth factor zzso and zzso There was no nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To examine zzso zzso associated with the development of zzso zzso we screened 4 tumors by comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso imbalances were zzso More zzso molecular genetic analyses revealed neither aberrations of the zzso and zzso tumor zzso genes nor amplification of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our data strongly support the hypothesis that zzso zzso of the third zzso constitutes a novel tumor entity characterized by distinct zzso and zzso features, as well as a lack of zzso and genetic zzso commonly found in other types of zzso or in zzso
