Our purpose was to describe the appearance of the zzso zzso complex on MR zzso and to correlate this appearance with surgical findings in adult patients and with gross zzso findings in zzso 

MR zzso of the hip joint was performed in 40 patients and six zzso All patients underwent subsequent zzso of the zzso MR zzso consisted of a zzso three-dimensional zzso sequence in both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso planes after zzso injection of a 2 zzso solution of zzso zzso The normal and zzso appearance of the zzso complex was zzso and the zzso were evaluated on the basis of zzso signal intensity, presence of a zzso and attachment to the zzso MR zzso findings were correlated with the surgical results in all patients and with the zzso sections of the zzso hip joint zzso 

MR zzso images of the zzso three-dimensional zzso sequences allowed zzso of the zzso zzso The normal zzso was zzso without any zzso zzso and of homogeneous low signal zzso A recess between the zzso and the joint capsule could be identified in instances in which no thickened zzso was zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso a zzso or a detached zzso either with or without zzso of the zzso The sensitivity for detection and correct staging of zzso zzso with MR zzso in the patient study was zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 

MR zzso with zzso three-dimensional zzso sequences allows excellent assessment of the normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso
