The effect zzso had on the zzso response to visual stimulation zzso and white zzso alternating at a frequency of 8 zzso of human VI was investigated using a blood zzso zzso zzso contrast with an zzso zzso Data were acquired with a 5 zzso off block paradigm using zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso paired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it was found that the mean percentage signal change and the mean number of activated zzso was significantly increased for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 73, mean zzso zzso relative to those for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We believe that these results indicate that zzso enhances the zzso zzso response in human zzso
