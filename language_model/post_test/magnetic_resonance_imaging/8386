We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in conjunction with a zzso approach to zzso symptom mapping to zzso evaluate the similarities and differences between brain areas involved in language and environmental sound zzso In general, we found that language and environmental sounds recruit highly overlapping cortical regions, with zzso differences being graded rather than zzso Within zzso regions of interest, we found that in the left hemisphere, language and environmental sound stimuli evoked very similar volumes of zzso whereas in the right hemisphere, there was greater zzso for environmental sound zzso Finally, zzso symptom maps of zzso patients based on environmental sounds or linguistic deficits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wilson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso Shared neural resources for processing language and environmental zzso Evidence from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generally zzso of the extent of blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso across these regions for sounds and linguistic stimuli in young healthy zzso
