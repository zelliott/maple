To determine whether the zzso relaxation time of skeletal muscle is affected by aging and to compare the effects of aging between zzso and zzso muscles in a human zzso To investigate the mechanisms of age-related changes in zzso relaxation time in an animal zzso zzso 

zzso relaxation times of the zzso zzso rich in type I zzso and zzso zzso rich in type II zzso muscles were examined in 59 healthy human subjects, 22 to 76 years of age, by clinical magnetic resonance zzso In mice, zzso relaxation times, fat ratios, and zzso space ratios zzso zzso plus zzso zzso of the zzso zzso rich in type II zzso muscles were also examined zzso of 7 old mice, zzso zzso group of 7 young mice, 8-10 zzso 

In the human study, the zzso relaxation time of the zzso muscle increased significantly with aging zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso while that of the zzso muscle did zzso In the animal study, the zzso relaxation time of the zzso muscle was significantly longer zzso zzso zzso and the zzso space ratio of the zzso muscle significantly wider zzso zzso zzso in old than in young zzso No significant difference in fat ratio was observed between old and young zzso A zzso positive correlation was seen between the zzso space ratio and zzso relaxation time zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso relaxation time of zzso muscle increases with aging, due mainly to increased zzso space, reflecting age-related type II fiber zzso
