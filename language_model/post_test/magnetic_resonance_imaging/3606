The brain is the body's largest energy consumer, even in the absence of demanding zzso zzso report zzso zzso firing during stimulation or task in regions beyond those of primary relationship to the zzso Although the biological origin of consciousness remains zzso it is argued that it emerges from complex, continuous zzso zzso zzso Despite zzso evidence suggesting the whole brain is continuously working and adapting to anticipate and zzso in response to the environment, over the last 20 zzso zzso functional zzso zzso have emphasized a zzso view of brain function, with zzso showing only a handful of activated regions in response to zzso Here, we challenge that view with evidence that under optimal noise conditions, zzso zzso extend well beyond areas of primary relationship to the zzso and zzso zzso signal changes correlated with zzso appear in over zzso of the brain for a simple visual stimulation plus attention control zzso Moreover, we show that response shape varies substantially across regions, and that zzso zzso based on those differences produce distributed clusters that are zzso and functionally zzso symmetrical across zzso and zzso across zzso These findings highlight the exquisite detail lying in zzso signals beyond what is normally zzso and emphasize both the zzso of false zzso and how the zzso of zzso maps is not a result of localized brain function, but a consequence of high noise and overly strict zzso response zzso
