Comparing the zzso signal with zzso maps and other zzso signals, such as the optical intrinsic signal zzso within subjects should provide insight into the zzso of the zzso zzso Tongue zzso were compared in five human subjects using zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso stimulation map zzso zzso zzso zzso centered on the lateral inferior aspect of the central zzso and extended into zzso and zzso zzso adjacent to zzso tongue zzso zzso and zzso maps zzso although optical responses were zzso larger zzso zzso across multiple zzso and contained more zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso signals were similar, appearing within zzso s and zzso zzso s after task zzso Although many processes contribute to increased zzso zzso optical zzso and fluorescent dye imaging suggest that a significant part of this signal is due to a zzso decrease in zzso and increase in zzso zzso The zzso correlation of zzso and the positive zzso response within subjects suggests that the two signals may share similar zzso The zzso inconsistencies may be due to cell swelling and zzso contributions to zzso and zzso zzso This study also demonstrates that zzso maps do not precisely zzso with zzso rather they emphasize changes in adjacent zzso zzso
