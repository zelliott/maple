This study examined the zzso zzso associated with response zzso and error processing as zzso executive zzso We present zzso data showing zzso changes to the functional networks underlying response zzso and zzso comparing zzso between adults and young adolescents performing the sustained attention to response task zzso During successful zzso we observed greater zzso for the young adolescents than for the adults, in a widely distributed network including zzso zzso and zzso zzso When zzso failed, however, adults showed increased zzso compared to young adolescents in a number of regions, including bilateral zzso zzso left and right zzso zzso the right zzso and zzso zzso These differences largely remained even when the two groups were matched for performance, suggesting that performance differences are unlikely to be the driving factor behind these zzso zzso Instead, the zzso trajectory of these important executive functions may reveal the basis for the immature executive functioning of the young zzso
