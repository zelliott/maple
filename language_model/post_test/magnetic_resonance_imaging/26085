Principal zzso Analysis allows a quantitative description of shape zzso with a restricted number of parameters (or zzso which can be used to zzso the difference between two shapes through the zzso of a modal zzso A statistical test can then be applied to this set of zzso in order to detect a statistically significant difference between two zzso We have applied this methodology to highlight evidence of genetic zzso of the shape of zzso zzso To investigate genetic zzso we studied if shapes were more similar within 10 pairs of zzso twins than within zzso and compared the results with those obtained from 10 pairs of zzso zzso The statistical analysis was performed using a Mantel zzso zzso We show, using simulations, that this statistical test applied on modal distances can detect a possible genetic zzso When applied to real data, this study highlighted genetic constraints on the shape of the central zzso We found from 10 pairs of zzso twins that the zzso modal distance of the central zzso was significantly smaller than the zzso modal distance, for both the left central zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the right central zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso constraints on the definition of the central zzso shape were confirmed by applying the same experiment to 10 pairs of normal young individuals zzso zzso zzso Z zzso zzso zzso values not significant at the P zzso zzso zzso and 10 pairs of zzso twins zzso zzso zzso Z zzso zzso zzso values not significant at the P zzso zzso zzso
