The diagnosis of cervical zzso zzso is based on three factors: clinical, zzso and zzso zzso However, in spite of being universally used, the zzso of each of these diagnostic instruments has still to be zzso The objective of our study was to make a critical analysis of the evidence currently available with regard to the diagnosis of zzso 

Review of the literature from 1967 to March 2001, quoted by zzso regarding the diagnosis of zzso The articles obtained were classified into four groups: zzso or systematic reviews, controlled studies with a surgical pattern of reference, controlled studies with another pattern of reference or not controlled and cases or series of zzso We made a critical analysis of each of the articles zzso 

There is no clinical test or investigation which may be considered to be a zzso diagnostic marker, so the degree of diagnostic certainty depends on the combination of investigations and their agreement with the clinical history and zzso The data from clinical examination may be considered to be extremely useful in the diagnosis of zzso zzso investigations are characterized by their high sensitivity and low zzso so these methods should be used early in the process of making a diagnosis of zzso The zzso zzso scan is better than MR in the diagnosis of zzso cervical zzso zzso The new MR techniques have considerably improved the possibilities of diagnosis of zzso but there is no evidence that they are currently as good as the zzso zzso zzso MR is the method of choice for assessment of intrinsic spinal disorders, although there is some evidence that the degree of cervical zzso may be underestimated when MR is zzso The zzso diagnosis zzso in zzso is of high specificity since it gives only a small proportion of false positive zzso zzso evoked zzso zzso from the zzso zzso is a highly sensitive test for the diagnosis of zzso cervical zzso zzso The combination of zzso and motor evoked zzso may be useful for the detection of patients with zzso at zzso stages and for differentiation between spinal and root zzso It is essential to carry out studies to evaluate the available diagnostic tests based on zzso These studies should be the first step in making it possible to design studies to determine the natural history of zzso and the therapeutic effectiveness of the techniques currently in zzso
