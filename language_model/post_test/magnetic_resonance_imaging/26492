To determine the evolution of zzso transfer zzso in white matter regions before and after plaque development in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso 

In a zzso zzso zzso 30 patients with zzso underwent conventional magnetic resonance zzso imaging, zzso MR imaging, and clinical zzso zzso data in 12 healthy subjects were also zzso zzso zzso zzso with use of zzso MR images was used to measure the time course of the zzso ratio zzso with MR data acquired without and with zzso zzso in every zzso and to help analyze the relationship with the status of zzso depicted on zzso zzso 

There was a significant zzso zzso zzso decline in zzso zzso ratio after zzso appearance on zzso zzso A significant zzso zzso zzso progressive decline in zzso ratio was also present in zzso that later became zzso prior to initial detection on zzso zzso Even zzso years prior to zzso appearance, the zzso ratio zzso in regions destined to become such zzso was significantly zzso zzso lower than that in both white matter in healthy subjects zzso and other zzso white matter in patients with zzso zzso 

The zzso ratio reveals progressive focal abnormalities in zzso that zzso by up to 2 years the appearance of zzso on zzso MR zzso
