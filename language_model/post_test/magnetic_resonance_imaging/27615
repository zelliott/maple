The mechanism of acupuncture analgesia in zzso has been widely zzso However, the theoretical basis for selection of zzso has not been zzso In this study, we used the regional zzso method blood oxygen zzso zzso signals to determine changes in brain activity in response to zzso electrical stimulation on zzso and zzso in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in this zzso zzso zzso scanning of the brain was performed for zzso seconds before and 30 minutes after zzso electrical stimulation on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The procedure was repeated after one week with stimulation on zzso (one was 9 above zzso the second was 12 above zzso zzso the third was 7 above zzso and the fourth was 10 above zzso zzso 

The regional zzso in the zzso group was increased in the left thalamus, zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso 30, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, 30, zzso zzso zzso middle zzso zzso zzso right superior zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso when compared to the zzso zzso The regional zzso of the zzso group was decreased in the left zzso zzso zzso middle frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 

The brain region activated following zzso stimulation is the zzso zzso brain region, which may relate to the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on pain zzso Further zzso stimulation causes different central nervous responses compared to zzso zzso
