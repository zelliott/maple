The purpose of this review is to outline recent trends in contrast agent development for magnetic resonance zzso Up to now, small molecular weight zzso zzso are the workhorse in contrast enhanced zzso These first generation MR contrast agents distribute into the zzso and zzso space, thus allowing the evaluation of zzso zzso such as the status or existence of the zzso or the zzso zzso Shortly after the first clinical use of zzso zzso in 1983, compounds were suggested for liver imaging and enhancing a cardiac zzso Meanwhile, liver specific contrast agents based on zzso zzso or iron become zzso Dedicated blood pool agents will be available within the next zzso These zzso or iron agents will be beneficial for longer lasting zzso procedures, such as cardiac zzso zzso enhanced zzso after zzso or intravenous injection will be another major step forward in diagnostic zzso zzso involvement will be seen either after the injection of zzso zzso iron zzso or dedicated zzso zzso The zzso of both compound classes is triggered by an zzso into zzso It is likely that similar agents will augment zzso of zzso zzso a systemic inflammatory disease of the zzso zzso zzso agents based on small zzso labeled peptides are on the zzso It is very obvious that the future of cardiovascular zzso will benefit from the development of new zzso and zzso zzso The expectations for new zzso zzso or zzso agents are zzso However, is not likely that such a compound will be available for daily routine zzso within the next zzso
