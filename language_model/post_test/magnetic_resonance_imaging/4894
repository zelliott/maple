Children with zzso zzso may have zzso zzso zzso that zzso them to developing zzso Our aim was to evaluate zzso and zzso volumes and zzso cortical thickness of children with zzso zzso 

zzso children with zzso zzso and normal MR imaging findings were zzso Ten patients had generalized seizures, 19 had partial seizures, and 15 were on zzso zzso zzso zzso healthy controls were also zzso zzso and zzso volumes and zzso cortical zzso including zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso zzso cingulate, and zzso cortical zzso were assessed by using zzso zzso imaging and were compared between patients and zzso 

There were no significant differences in zzso and zzso volumes of patients with zzso seizures, including the zzso with generalized and partial zzso and those on and off zzso medications, compared with controls zzso zzso zzso There was significant reduction in cortical thickness in right zzso zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and left frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso Patients with generalized zzso did not demonstrate a significant reduction in cortical thickness zzso zzso zzso Patients with partial zzso demonstrated a significant reduction in cortical thickness in the right frontal zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso zzso zzso and left frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences in cortical thickness among patients on or off zzso medications zzso zzso zzso 

We found reduced cortical thickness in children with zzso zzso Further studies are necessary to zzso the zzso relevance of these structural zzso
