Attention Deficit zzso Disorder zzso is a zzso disorder mainly characterized by zzso in cognitive zzso zzso zzso studies carried out in individuals with zzso have shown abnormal functioning of the anterior zzso zzso zzso during tasks involving selective zzso In other respects, there is mounting evidence that zzso training zzso can significantly improve cognitive functioning in zzso zzso In this context, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study was conducted to measure the effect of zzso on the neural zzso of selective attention in children with zzso Twenty zzso zzso taking any zzso and without zzso to the zzso Fifteen children were randomly assigned to the Experimental zzso group zzso whereas the other five children were assigned to the Control zzso group (no zzso zzso from both groups were scanned 1 week before the beginning of the zzso zzso 1) and 1 week after the end of this training zzso zzso while they performed a Counting zzso zzso At Time 1, for both groups, the Counting zzso task was associated with significant zzso of zzso in the left superior zzso zzso No zzso was noted in the zzso At Time 2, for both groups, the Counting zzso task was still associated with significant zzso of the left superior zzso zzso This time, however, for the zzso group only there was a significant zzso of the right zzso These results suggest that in zzso children, zzso has the capacity to zzso the functioning of the zzso the key neural zzso of selective zzso
