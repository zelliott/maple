This study used zzso repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to examine the roles of the superior zzso zzso zzso and inferior frontal zzso zzso in a zzso reasoning zzso zzso performed a zzso zzso reasoning task involving zzso zzso and abstract zzso Twenty four subjects received magnetic stimulation to the zzso region prior to the zzso In the other 24 subjects, zzso was administered to the zzso region before the zzso zzso lasted for zzso with an zzso frequency of zzso We found that bilateral zzso zzso area zzso 7) stimulation disrupted performance on abstract and zzso zzso Left zzso zzso zzso stimulation impaired zzso reasoning performance while paradoxically zzso zzso reasoning zzso This resulted in the elimination of the zzso In contrast, right zzso stimulation only impaired zzso reasoning performance, thus enhancing the zzso zzso These findings are largely consistent with the zzso theory of reasoning, which proposes the existence of two different human reasoning zzso a zzso zzso system; and a zzso zzso zzso The present findings suggest that the left zzso zzso zzso zzso may zzso to the zzso system, while bilateral zzso may zzso the zzso zzso The right zzso may play a role in blocking the zzso zzso system for solving zzso reasoning zzso This study could offer an insight about functional roles of distributed brain systems in human zzso reasoning by utilizing the zzso zzso
