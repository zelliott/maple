zzso zzso zzso zzso known to be associated with plaque instability, may convey a higher stroke zzso The aim of this study was to assess whether the identification of zzso by zzso predicts zzso clinical cerebrovascular zzso 

zzso patients with high-grade symptomatic carotid zzso underwent zzso of the carotid arteries and were followed until carotid zzso or 30 zzso 

Of the 66 patients with a median follow up of zzso days, 44 zzso were found on zzso to have zzso carotid zzso Fifteen zzso events were associated with zzso carotid zzso Only 2 zzso events occurred in the absence of zzso zzso increased the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso as detected by zzso predicts zzso cerebrovascular events in patients with symptomatic high-grade carotid zzso
