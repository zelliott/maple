To zzso the clinical, zzso and genetic observations in a group of patients with unilateral synergistic divergence zzso 

Five unrelated patients with unilateral zzso underwent zzso and zzso zzso three of them also had magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and zzso Three patients underwent genetic evaluation of genes known to affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The patients did not meet the clinical criteria for zzso types 1, 2, or zzso Each patient had severe zzso weakness on the affected side and zzso zzso in primary gaze that increased on attempted zzso gaze because of anomalous zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed a much smaller zzso zzso muscle in the involved zzso zzso zzso zzso nerves were present in the one patient zzso zzso zzso sequencing in three patients revealed no zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso should be classified as a distinct zzso zzso zzso pattern within zzso zzso zzso zzso It may be caused by zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso lateral zzso by the zzso nerve zzso by genetic abnormalities zzso currently zzso or by local zzso zzso or zzso zzso
