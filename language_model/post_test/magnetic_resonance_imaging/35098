The purpose of this study was to determine cerebral zzso profile changes in response to electric stimulation to the right zzso zzso zzso for the establishment of an zzso rat zzso zzso zzso and behavioral results indicated that the experimental rats were in an early stage of zzso zzso were determined by high-resolution zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso of the following intact brain zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso data was statistically analyzed using principal component analysis zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso profiles were significantly different between the experimental and sham rats in the bilateral zzso and the zzso zzso zzso increases in total zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso were measured zzso Some zzso levels were disturbed in the bilateral zzso zzso In the sham group, zzso and zzso zzso were significantly higher or lower in the zzso zzso than bilateral zzso respectively zzso However, such differences were not observed in the experimental zzso In addition, zzso levels in the experimental group were significantly less in the zzso zzso than in bilateral zzso zzso The level of zzso in the zzso zzso significantly increased in the experimental group, compared to the zzso zzso zzso These results may provide zzso information about zzso lobe structures to provide more knowledge about zzso abnormalities at the early zzso
