The aim of this study is to examine the zzso value of ultrasound zzso for the assessment of traumatic zzso of the zzso ligament complex zzso in burst fractures of the zzso zzso This was a prospective zzso cohort zzso zzso about instability and treatment of burst fractures depends on the condition of the zzso There have been some studies describing zzso of zzso injuries due to zzso problems in zzso distraction type zzso The gold standard for assessing these zzso is magnetic resonance imaging zzso Even then, there are often limits in contemporary operational availability and technical limitations of zzso zzso was described being an zzso In a prospective study, 54 levels of 18 patients with acute burst fractures of the zzso and zzso spine have been examined by ultrasound and additional zzso scans zzso The condition zzso zzso zzso of zzso ligament zzso and the zzso ligament has been assessed for the ligaments zzso zzso below the zzso has also been evaluated as an indirect sign of an injured zzso In all the patients the primary performed operative treatment was a zzso spinal zzso zzso the blinded results of the ultrasound procedures have been matched against zzso and zzso zzso zzso of all target structures have been contributed to the calculation of the sensitivity and specificity of zzso A total of 18 patients, 14 males and 4 zzso with acute burst fractures have been qualified for inclusion in the zzso The patients' mean age was zzso zzso Comparing zzso findings with preoperatively performed zzso ultrasound zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect traumatic zzso to the zzso As hypothesized the obtained zzso value using ultrasound zzso closely with zzso zzso zzso zzso still seems to be the superior diagnostic method for examining the zzso However, ultrasound can be considered to be an adequate alternative method in cases with zzso for zzso such as zzso side effects, zzso availability or emergency zzso in multiple zzso
