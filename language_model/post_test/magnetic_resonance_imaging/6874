This study was designed to perform a head-to-head comparison between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso to evaluate zzso significance of zzso findings in bypass zzso 

The zzso significance of a bypass graft zzso may not always accurately be determined from the coronary zzso A variety of diagnostic tests zzso or zzso can further characterize the zzso consequence of a zzso 

zzso zzso and vein zzso in 25 patients were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso imaging, and coronary flow zzso reserve determination by zzso Based on zzso and zzso four different groups could be zzso 1) no significant zzso zzso normal zzso 2) significant zzso zzso abnormal zzso 3) significant zzso normal zzso (no zzso zzso and 4) no significant zzso abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A complete evaluation was obtained in 46 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso provided similar information in 37 of 46 zzso zzso illustrating good agreement zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso a territory with zzso zzso When agreement between zzso and zzso was restricted to zzso without zzso zzso it improved to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso 14 zzso in group 1, 23 in group 2, 6 in group 3, and 3 in group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso agreement per group was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso comparison showed good agreement between zzso and zzso for functional evaluation of bypass zzso zzso magnetic resonance may offer an alternative method to zzso for functional characterization of zzso zzso
