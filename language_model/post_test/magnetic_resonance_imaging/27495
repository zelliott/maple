A new dual zzso zzso high spatial resolution, zzso zzso mapping method is zzso coverage and spatial resolution using dual injection dynamic zzso zzso zzso In a zzso dynamic zzso acquisition zzso a high zzso resolution zzso is followed by a high spatial resolution main zzso to allow high spatial resolution zzso mapping for cerebral zzso The measured plasma concentration zzso from the zzso data were used to reconstruct a high zzso resolution zzso input zzso The new method reduces errors resulting from uncertainty in the zzso alignment of the zzso input function, tissue response function, and sampling zzso The technique provides high spatial resolution zzso zzso maps zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with whole brain coverage and greater zzso accuracy than that was possible with the conventional single zzso resolution zzso High spatial resolution imaging of brain zzso is highly desirable for small zzso and to support investigation of zzso within pathological tissue and peripheral invasion at the interface between diseased and normal zzso The new method has the potential to be used to improve dynamic zzso techniques in zzso
