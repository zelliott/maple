To investigate the neural mechanisms of planning, we used a novel adaptation of the Tower of zzso zzso task and zzso functional zzso Participants were trained in applying a specific strategy to an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso After training, participants solved novel problems during zzso functional zzso A zzso cognitive model of the task was used to generate a reference time series representing the expected blood oxygen zzso response in brain areas involved in the manipulation and planning of zzso This time series was used as one term within a general linear modeling framework to identify brain areas in which the time course of activity varied as a function of zzso zzso Two distinct time courses of zzso were identified, one in which zzso varied zzso with zzso operations, and the other in which zzso became pronounced only during zzso intensive zzso zzso showing the zzso relationship comprised a zzso system and include right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso area zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso 6) zzso zzso zzso engaged only during zzso processing include left inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso The implications of these results for the current model, as well as for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of planning and functional specialization of the prefrontal cortex, are zzso
