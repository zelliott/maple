To zzso contrast agent dose and pulse sequence parameters in order to achieve a zzso zzso enhancement in zzso knee zzso with ultra small zzso iron zzso zzso zzso 

zzso arthritis was induced in the right knee of nine Sprague zzso zzso The zzso knee joint as well as the zzso normal knee were investigated in a 2 zzso MR scanner before as well as in short intervals up to 2 h after zzso injection, using zzso zzso echo zzso zzso Three rats each received intravenous injections of the new zzso zzso 555 C zzso U 555 C, zzso zzso zzso at doses of 40, 100 and 200 zzso zzso Pulse sequence parameters of the zzso were zzso by varying flip angles zzso and echo times zzso Changes in signal zzso zzso of the zzso knee and zzso normal knee were zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso and compared with zzso 

zzso of the zzso knees demonstrated a marked inflammatory proliferation of the zzso The zzso zzso U 555 C caused a significant increase in signal intensity of the zzso zzso on zzso MR images zzso zzso zzso This effect was zzso using a flip angle of zzso degrees, a minimal TE and a dose of 200 zzso zzso zzso the zzso normal knee did not show any zzso zzso 

zzso can be depicted with marked zzso enhancement by the zzso zzso U 555 C using high contrast agent doses and zzso MR pulse sequence zzso
