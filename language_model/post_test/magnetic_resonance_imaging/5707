To evaluate a zzso zzso zzso zzso platform that reproduces human zzso zzso treatment to study zzso effects of zzso zzso on lung zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso zzso (20 zzso zzso 3) was delivered to the right lung of three New Zealand rabbits using zzso zzso with zzso image zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso MR zzso and CT were obtained before radiation and monthly for 4 months after zzso All zzso was performed on a zzso zzso scanner with zzso zzso 

zzso dose delivery to zzso zzso of the lower right lung was achieved without additional zzso No deficits were detected at baseline with respect to zzso and zzso Lung zzso deficits in the zzso lung regions began at 2 months after radiation and worsened with zzso No ventilation deficits were observed after zzso zzso in lung CT density in zzso regions was observed after radiation, but the changes were less significant than those in zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that highly zzso radiation can be zzso delivered to a small volume of zzso lung on a widely available clinical zzso The zzso lung injury can be detected as early as 2 months after radiation with zzso zzso The primary pattern of injury agrees with previously reported zzso damage to zzso radiation zzso This experimental design provides a cost-effective methodology for producing zzso injuries in zzso that reproduces current human treatments for studying radiation injury and agents that might affect zzso
