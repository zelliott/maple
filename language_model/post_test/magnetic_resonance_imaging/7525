To zzso evaluate the prevalence of pelvic organ zzso as an incidental finding on dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso using two different references zzso 

Sixty women with symptoms unrelated to pelvic floor dysfunction who underwent zzso including a dynamic zzso true fast imaging with zzso free zzso zzso sequence during straining were zzso Two zzso in consensus used the zzso line zzso and zzso line zzso to diagnose and grade zzso in all three pelvic zzso 

zzso was zzso mild, moderate, and severe in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of patients, respectively, using zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of patients, respectively, using zzso zzso zzso was zzso mild, moderate, and severe in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of patients, respectively, using zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of patients, respectively, using zzso zzso descent was zzso mild, moderate, and severe in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of patients, respectively, using zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of patients, respectively, using zzso No zzso zzso or muscular zzso was zzso Two percent zzso of patients had mild zzso zzso zzso had abnormal zzso angle, and zzso zzso had abnormal zzso plate zzso 

In zzso women, dynamic zzso identified the greatest degrees of zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso consistently yielded greater frequency of zzso than the zzso zzso of pelvic organ zzso may be observed in zzso patients and are of uncertain significance, requiring correlation with clinical and physical examination zzso
