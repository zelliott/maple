Evidence exists that the observation of actions activates the same cortical motor areas that are involved in the performance of the observed zzso The neural zzso for this is the mirror zzso zzso We harness this zzso system and its ability to zzso stored motor representations as a means for zzso motor zzso We combined observation of daily actions with zzso physical training of the observed actions in a new zzso program zzso observation zzso Eight stroke patients with moderate, chronic motor deficit of the upper limb as a consequence of zzso artery zzso zzso A significant improvement of motor functions in the course of a zzso treatment, as compared to the stable zzso zzso and compared with a control group have been zzso The improvement lasted for at least 8 weeks after the end of the zzso Additionally, the effects of action observation therapy on the reorganization of the motor system were investigated by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso using an independent zzso task consisting of object zzso The direct comparison of neural zzso between experimental and control groups after training with those zzso by the same task before training yielded a significant rise in activity in the bilateral zzso zzso cortex, bilateral superior zzso zzso the supplementary motor area zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our results provide pieces of evidence that action observation has a positive additional impact on recovery of motor functions after stroke by zzso of motor areas, which contain the action zzso execution matching zzso
