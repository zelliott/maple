To emphasize the importance of recognizing the zzso Robin spaces as normal zzso structures on magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso of four patients seen in the zzso zzso Department in La zzso zzso They consulted for different reasons, having been studied by MR to help identify their zzso 

The MR showed zzso structures which zzso to zzso zzso Robin spaces in several zones of the cerebral white zzso 

Although zzso zzso Robin spaces have been associated with various zzso they constitute normal zzso structures, which consists of zzso spaces surrounding the cerebral zzso zzso which should always be kept in mind when visualizing zzso structures in the cerebral white matter and zzso zzso circular or zzso following the path of the zzso blood vessels, and which have the same intensity of zzso fluid on zzso sequences as on zzso on zzso especially if they are bilateral and zzso
