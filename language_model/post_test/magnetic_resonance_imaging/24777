As a relatively recent cultural invention in human evolution, reading is an important gateway to personal development and socioeconomic zzso Despite the well documented individual differences in reading ability, its zzso zzso have not been well zzso largely due to the fact that reading is a complex skill that consists of multiple zzso Using a large sample of 416 college students and 7 reading tasks, the present study successfully identified three zzso components of reading zzso zzso zzso zzso association, and naming zzso We then tried to predict zzso scores in these components from their gray matter volume zzso on a subset of participants (N zzso zzso with high-quality structural images, adopting a zzso support zzso zzso analysis with tenfold zzso Our results revealed distinct neural regions that supported different aspects of reading zzso whereas zzso decoding was associated with the zzso in the left superior zzso lobe extending to the zzso zzso zzso association was predicted by the zzso in the zzso and zzso Naming speed was associated with zzso in distributed brain regions in the zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso zzso decoding and zzso association were zzso with general cognitive zzso However, naming speed was correlated with intelligence and processing speed, and some of the regions that were zzso of naming speed also predicted these general cognitive zzso These results provide further insights on the cognitive and neural architecture of reading and the structural basis of individual differences in reading zzso
