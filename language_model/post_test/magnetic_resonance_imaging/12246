We investigated zzso brain changes in patients with Parkinson's disease zzso that are associated with balance zzso A total of 20 patients and 16 healthy matched controls learned a balance task over a period of 6 zzso zzso testing and structural magnetic resonance imaging were performed before and after 2, 4, and 6 training zzso zzso performance was re-evaluated after zzso zzso zzso training resulted in performance improvements in both zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso gray matter changes in the left zzso in healthy zzso In zzso patients, performance improvements were correlated with gray matter changes in the right anterior zzso left inferior zzso cortex, left zzso zzso cortex, bilateral anterior zzso cortex, and left middle zzso zzso Furthermore, a TIME zzso GROUP interaction analysis revealed zzso gray matter changes in the right zzso Our results highlight zzso balance improvements in zzso patients that may be associated with specific patterns of structural brain zzso In zzso we provide novel evidence for the capacity of the human brain to undergo zzso structural plasticity even in a zzso disease state such as in zzso
