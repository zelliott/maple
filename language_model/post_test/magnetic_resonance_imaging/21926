The zzso of zzso remains zzso While the majority of patients develop zzso zzso zzso signal abnormalities on MR scans and zzso neurological deficits, some patients do develop zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and permanent neurological zzso zzso zzso cannot zzso differentiate between these two patient zzso zzso zzso imaging, however, is a new technique that clearly zzso between zzso and zzso zzso 

A 30-year-old woman developed symptoms consistent with zzso 24 hours after delivering premature zzso An zzso demonstrated extensive, diffuse zzso zzso signal abnormalities involving zzso white matter and adjacent gray matter with a zzso zzso consistent with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso images demonstrated increased zzso consistent with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Unlike routine zzso zzso imaging reliably zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso imaging can afford clear differentiation between zzso zzso zzso and zzso two very different entities with very different treatment zzso zzso imaging should be performed in all zzso patients and should greatly affect their zzso
