The purpose of this study was to assess oral contrast agents, volumes of the agents, and time points of data acquisition in regard to zzso zzso and patient zzso 

Six healthy volunteers underwent imaging on 16 different zzso Four volumes zzso zzso zzso and 1,800 zzso of each of the four contrast compounds zzso locust bean gum plus zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and tap water) were zzso zzso true fast imaging with zzso free zzso data sets were acquired at zzso intervals after contrast zzso zzso values for zzso segments zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and occurrence of side effects were zzso 

Analysis of zzso zzso revealed significantly greater zzso for all zzso sugar zzso solutions compared with water but no significant difference among the three contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved with 900 zzso of any of the contrast agents, but imaging had to be performed soon after zzso For zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso a volume of zzso zzso is zzso and the time point of data acquisition plays a minor zzso zzso of 1,800 zzso of the zzso sugar alcohol solutions led to a significantly higher rate of side effects such as abdominal zzso than did zzso of smaller zzso 

The data indicate that sufficient contrast consumption and optimal timing of data acquisition are essential to zzso of the small zzso zzso contrast agent protocols should be adapted to the zzso region in zzso
