This study determined the zzso of zzso joint zzso disk position in zzso central, and lateral aspects of the joint using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso had clinical evidence of zzso zzso clicking (N zzso zzso or restricted zzso motion (N zzso zzso zzso zzso volunteers provided a control zzso zzso position was zzso on zzso by measuring the angle formed by a line through the middle of the zzso and perpendicular to the zzso plane and a line through the same zzso of the zzso and zzso to the zzso aspect of the zzso The disk position in zzso zzso varied considerably with a tendency toward farther anterior placement in more lateral zzso In 47 zzso from a total of 52 zzso zzso restricted mobility was associated with anterior disk displacement zzso without zzso The disk position demonstrated a mean displacement of 77 degrees without significant differences at the zzso and lateral aspects of the zzso One hundred zzso from a total of 123 zzso zzso with zzso clicking demonstrated zzso with zzso zzso revealed larger lateral zzso or zzso zzso in these zzso whereas zzso images frequently showed similar ranges of disk positions as compared with zzso zzso The results suggest that disk positions of up to zzso degrees on zzso zzso and zzso degrees on lateral zzso should be regarded as normal zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of all zzso images improved the separation between disk displacement and zzso zzso
