zzso of functional PET and zzso MR images is a necessary step for combining functional information from PET images with anatomical information in MR zzso Several zzso zzso have been published and are used in functional brain imaging zzso In this paper, we present a comparison and cross validation of the two most widely used zzso routines zzso et zzso 1995, zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso Woods et zzso 1993, zzso zzso Assisted zzso zzso zzso Several transformations were applied to high-resolution anatomical MR images to generate simulated PET images so that the exact zzso zzso transformations between each MR image and its associated simulated PET images were zzso The zzso error of a zzso in relation to the known transformation allows a comparison of the performance of different zzso zzso Under the assumption that the simulated PET images embody the salient features of real PET images with respect to zzso this study shows that the routines examined reliably solve the zzso to PET zzso zzso
