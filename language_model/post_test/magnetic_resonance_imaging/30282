zzso of a zzso zzso artery during zzso knee surgery is very rare but has serious zzso The risk of vascular trauma during zzso procedures may be increased when there is abnormal branching of the zzso artery with an zzso anterior zzso artery originating above the zzso muscle and coursing between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso margin of the zzso zzso zzso identification of this anatomical zzso may help avoid these zzso 

The zzso anterior zzso artery is present in a substantial portion of the population and can be zzso by magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso study; Level of evidence, zzso 

zzso review of zzso consecutive knee magnetic resonance imaging studies was performed to evaluate the prevalence of an zzso anterior zzso zzso Images were reviewed by 3 musculoskeletal zzso 

The zzso anterior zzso artery was present in 23 of zzso zzso for a prevalence of zzso The zzso artery was most easily identified on zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The zzso anterior zzso artery is a relatively common normal zzso and magnetic resonance is an excellent zzso for detection of the artery close to the zzso joint capsule and zzso zzso 

The anatomy suggests the zzso anterior zzso artery may be at greater risk of injury in zzso procedures such as high zzso zzso revision total knee zzso lateral zzso repair, zzso cruciate ligament zzso and screw fixation for zzso zzso zzso zzso inspection of zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies may alert the surgeon to the presence of this anatomical zzso
