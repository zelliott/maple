zzso for zzso zzso is zzso A new concept based on zzso and zzso analysis of a magnetic resonance zzso data set is zzso 

zzso zzso autopsy zzso zzso containing artificially placed zzso were obtained and filled with a zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained in a zzso MR scanner in 28 zzso A three-dimensional zzso zzso of these images was zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso images were analyzed by two observers for the presence of zzso 

The average sensitivity and specificity for the detection of zzso based on three-dimensional zzso MR colon imaging were zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso images showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of merely 57% and zzso zzso The difference in the interpretation of three-dimensional MR zzso and two-dimensional zzso was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso With three-dimensional MR colonoscopy, overall sensitivity for detection of zzso measuring zzso or zzso zzso in length and diameter was zzso for larger zzso it increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The feasibility of an zzso zzso assessment of the colon is zzso zzso zzso lack of radiation exposure, and high in zzso diagnostic accuracy warrant further investigation of this novel zzso
