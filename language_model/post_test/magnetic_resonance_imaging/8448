zzso naturally draws one's zzso However, humans are capable of engaging in cognitive tasks while in pain, although it is not known how the brain represents these processes zzso There is some evidence for a cortical interaction between zzso and zzso brain activity, but the outcome of this interaction may depend on the relative load imposed by the pain versus the zzso zzso we used 3 levels of cognitive load zzso interference zzso and 2 levels of pain intensity zzso nerve zzso to examine how functional magnetic resonance imaging activity in regions identified as zzso or zzso responds to different combinations of pain intensity and cognitive zzso Overall, most zzso or zzso brain areas showed robust responses with little zzso However, during the more intense pain, activity in primary zzso cortex, secondary zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso cortex, zzso and supplementary motor area was modestly attenuated by the easy task and in some cases the difficult zzso zzso zzso activity was not modulated by pain, except when cognitive load was minimal during the control zzso These findings support the notion that brain networks supporting pain perception and zzso can be simultaneously zzso
