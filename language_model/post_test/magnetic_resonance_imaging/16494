The aim of this study was to examine the zzso volume of subjects at different stages of Alzheimer's disease and to investigate whether volume reductions in this structure are related to cognitive zzso 

zzso subjects from an zzso study were submitted to a magnetic resonance imaging scan and evaluated using the zzso State zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were divided into five groups according to the Clinical zzso zzso zzso Twenty-six subjects from the original group who had no zzso diagnosis at baseline were re-evaluated for the onset of zzso after two zzso 

The volumes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lobe were found to be reduced as a function of the severity of the zzso There were significant positive correlations between the volume of the zzso lobe and zzso and the language, attention, and total scores in the zzso State zzso and the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe and zzso volume at baseline is a risk factor for the onset of zzso 

This is the first study demonstrating that reduced zzso volume is already apparent at the zzso zzso The results of this study support the involvement of the zzso in the progression of zzso Whereas the zzso might not be directly associated with the origin of Alzheimer's disease, it may provide useful information related to its zzso
