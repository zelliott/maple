zzso of zzso zzso in the brain vary as a function of zzso at the zzso locus of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies of this zzso in the human brain have typically measured patterns of neural zzso during zzso tasks in zzso This study is the first to investigate the effects of zzso on brain physiology during rest and in zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain blood flow zzso in 42 zzso Compared with zzso carriers, zzso zzso exhibited greater zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso in zzso brain structures reflects zzso baseline differences that zzso zzso the selective behavioral advantages associated with each zzso zzso affect interpretations of previously reported zzso differences in zzso signal changes; and zzso serve as a foundation for future studies on the effects of zzso on brain zzso
