zzso magnetic field zzso zzso perpendicular to the slice plane often result in signal dropout in blood zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methods reduce these effects by acquiring multiple images with different slice zzso zzso zzso In this work a zzso zzso method is introduced as a more efficient zzso The technique zzso the zzso data for a conventional zzso phase zzso acquisition with N additional lines that extend the zzso coverage sufficiently to sample zzso fully in regions with zzso Multiple zzso of these data are reconstructed using a sliding window that provides N zzso zzso zzso Fewer total acquisitions are required than with the zzso method for the same coverage, and finer zzso steps are zzso The technique is demonstrated with a motor task using intentionally introduced zzso and compared with the zzso zzso The results confirm increased zzso zzso and zzso with the new method in good agreement with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
