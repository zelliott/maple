22 cases of zzso zzso confirmed by surgery and pathology were zzso zzso in terms of CT (16 zzso and zzso data (6 zzso 

Of 22 zzso 19 occurred in the zzso zzso 2 in the lateral zzso and 1 in the right zzso The CT value of the plain scans ranged from 20 to 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso in 16 zzso zzso zzso was noted in four zzso zzso fat density shadow was found in one zzso zzso CT found nearly no enhancement (6 zzso or slight enhancement (10 zzso with a CT value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the delayed phase, enhancement was strengthened zzso and CT value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved after 120 zzso zzso weighted images showed homogeneous zzso signals in five cases and zzso signals mixed with zzso zzso signal shadow in one zzso zzso weighted images demonstrated zzso zzso signals in all six cases, of which the zzso appearance was noted in one zzso zzso acid zzso zzso found mildly zzso enhancement in the zzso phase, and progressive mild enhancement in the delayed zzso 

zzso zzso shows zzso in plain zzso On CT and zzso zzso or slight enhancement in artery phase and progressive mild enhancement in delay phase are characteristic manifestations of zzso in the zzso
