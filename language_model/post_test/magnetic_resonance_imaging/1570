This functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigates zzso and differences in working memory zzso processes employing different types of zzso We specifically sought to characterize zzso convergence and segregation with respect to prefrontal zzso involvement using zzso zzso real object and shape memory items in a zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso are zzso activated across all stimulus zzso No zzso differences in the zzso patterns of the prefrontal zzso could be demonstrated giving support to the view of an zzso prefrontal involvement during zzso zzso However, zzso regions specialized on feature processing and involved in the zzso of the stimuli were selectively activated by these different zzso of zzso These selectively activated regions are assigned to parts of the zzso and zzso zzso
