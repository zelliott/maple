Alzheimer's disease poses a looming crisis for the health care system as well as society in zzso The low efficacy of current treatments for those already affected with this disease has prompted the suggestion that interventions might be more successful if they were applied before the development of significant pathology, that is, when individuals are clinically zzso Currently, the field requires a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for identifying those individuals destined to develop this zzso As a first step, we present here an analysis of zzso data for 95 zzso offspring zzso years of zzso of zzso zzso familial Alzheimer's disease cases and 90 zzso controls, studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate brain zzso zzso Analysis of zzso in response to a zzso memory paradigm found significantly different patterns in these zzso zzso individuals showed more intense and extensive zzso in the frontal and zzso zzso including the zzso during memory zzso an increase unrelated to the zzso zzso zzso They also showed decreased zzso particularly in the zzso and zzso during both the zzso and recall zzso of the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso individuals, at genetic risk for development of zzso Alzheimer's disease by virtue of familial zzso show functional zzso patterns distinct from those without such risk more than a decade before their parent's onset zzso While zzso study is needed to determine whether these patterns, or a subset of them, are zzso of disease zzso these findings suggest that functional zzso holds promise as a method of identifying zzso Alzheimer's zzso
