Patients with focal zzso that is zzso to medical treatment are often considered candidates for zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso has a very important role in the zzso zzso of these patients, but is unremarkable in about one-third of zzso These patients are often deferred from surgery or have a less positive outcome if surgery is eventually zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate our recently described zzso technique using routine zzso zzso zzso scans in zzso patients and to compare the results with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We identified 70 zzso patients with zzso focal zzso who underwent VT and had a normal routine zzso zzso scans were zzso and intensity and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso as previously zzso Individual scans were then compared against a set of 25 normal controls using a zzso zzso 

zzso identified 10 patients with zzso clusters zzso In 50% of these there was zzso between the lobe of the most significant cluster and the presumed lobe of seizure zzso as defined by zzso All cases were zzso with respect to zzso of the putative zzso 

Using zzso we identified focal structural cerebral abnormalities in zzso of patients with zzso focal seizures, and normal conventional zzso that were fully or partially zzso with scalp zzso This zzso analysis of zzso scans, which are widely available, could provide a useful tool in the zzso evaluation of zzso zzso zzso work is to compare these imaging findings with the results of zzso zzso and zzso of surgical zzso
