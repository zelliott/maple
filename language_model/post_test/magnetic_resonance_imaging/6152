The aim of this investigation was to document the exercise program used by zzso zzso zzso 9; 45 zzso 2 zzso while aboard the International Space Station zzso for 6 zzso and examine its effectiveness for preserving calf muscle zzso Before and after zzso we assessed calf muscle volume zzso zzso and dynamic calf muscle performance, and muscle fiber types zzso and zzso While on the zzso zzso had access to a running zzso cycle zzso and resistance exercise zzso The exercise regimen varied among the zzso with zzso exercise performed approximately 5 zzso at a moderate intensity and resistance exercise performed 3-6 zzso incorporating multiple lower leg zzso zzso muscle volume decreased zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso with greater zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Peak power was zzso lower zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso characteristics were reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso across the zzso zzso There was a zzso shift in zzso heavy chain zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso with a decrease zzso zzso zzso in zzso I fibers and a zzso among the faster zzso These data show a reduction in calf muscle mass and performance along with a zzso fiber type transition in the zzso and zzso muscles, which are all qualities associated with unloading in zzso Future zzso space missions should modify the current zzso exercise prescription and/or hardware to better preserve human skeletal muscle mass and function, thereby reducing the risk imposed to zzso
