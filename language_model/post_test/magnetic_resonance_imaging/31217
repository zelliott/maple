How are comparative judgments performed in the human brain? We scanned subjects with zzso while they compared stimuli for size, zzso or zzso zzso involved in comparative judgments were identified using three criteria: zzso zzso presence of a distance effect, and interference of one dimension onto the zzso We observed considerable overlap in the neural zzso of the three comparison zzso Interestingly, the amount of overlap predicted the amount of zzso zzso in both behavior and zzso number zzso with size, and size with zzso but number did not interfere with zzso The results suggest that during comparative judgments, the relevant continuous quantities are represented in distributed and overlapping neural zzso with number and size engaging a common zzso spatial code, while size and zzso engage shared zzso zzso zzso
