This review summarizes recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging that reveal similarities in the organization of human auditory zzso zzso and auditory zzso of nonhuman zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that HAC is a compact region that covers less than zzso of the total cortical zzso HAC is subdivided into more than a dozen distinct auditory cortical fields zzso that surround zzso zzso on the superior zzso zzso Recent advances that permit the zzso of the results of functional magnetic imaging experiments directly on the cortical surface have provided new insights into the organization of human zzso Evidence suggests that zzso regions of HAC are organized in a manner similar to the auditory zzso of other zzso species with a set of zzso organized core zzso surrounded by belt zzso that often share zzso organization with the zzso Although influenced by attention, responses in HAC core and belt fields are largely determined by the acoustic properties of zzso including their frequency, intensity, and zzso In contrast, lateral regions of HAC contain zzso fields that are little influenced by simple acoustic features but rather respond to zzso relevant complex sounds such as speech and are strongly modulated by zzso 

HAC zzso the basic structural and functional organization of auditory zzso as seen in old world zzso zzso A central challenge to future research is to understand how this basic zzso plan has evolved to support uniquely human abilities such as music and zzso
