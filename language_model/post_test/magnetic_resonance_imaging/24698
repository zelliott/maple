In this paper, a set of zzso image registration and neural activity zzso methods using functional MR Images zzso are proposed based on zzso feature zzso Our work made two zzso First, we propose to use a zzso feature to improve image registration performance of zzso zzso Point zzso based zzso The proposed feature zzso zzso zzso Models zzso to describe the local zzso structure of zzso zzso Second, we propose to use a zzso zzso Feature zzso zzso based zzso to represent neural activities related to drinking zzso As a result, neural activities patterns of different subjects drinking water or zzso zzso can be zzso with strong zzso against various zzso
