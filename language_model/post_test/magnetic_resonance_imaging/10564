Whether zzso volume increases or decreases after zzso zzso zzso is not zzso The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of zzso zzso on the volume of the zzso in patients with zzso zzso of the zzso Nine hips of seven patients with zzso zzso of the hip that have undergone zzso zzso were included in the zzso The zzso index, zzso depth, and zzso volume of each hip were calculated before and after zzso zzso resonance imaging was used for the measurement of the zzso zzso The difference between the zzso and zzso values of zzso index, zzso depth, and zzso volume was statistically zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso increases the volume of the zzso
