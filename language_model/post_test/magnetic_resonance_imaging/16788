zzso US detection of zzso zzso is challenging and rarely confirms this zzso 

To define the prenatal zzso findings in zzso zzso 

We performed a retrospective study of patients with zzso zzso who had zzso and zzso assessment at our zzso Fetal zzso was obtained in six singleton zzso between 26 and 32 weeks of zzso Imaging analysis was focused on the zzso zzso the urinary system and the zzso tract and compared with zzso clinical, zzso and surgical zzso 

The zzso zzso was zzso and did not extend below the zzso in five zzso They had a long common zzso channel zzso zzso and a zzso located over the zzso zzso Only one fetus with a zzso zzso zzso had a normal zzso Three fetuses had increased zzso signal in the zzso and two increased zzso zzso signal zzso zzso All had zzso anomalies, four had abnormal zzso and two had zzso 

Assessment of the zzso signal and pelvic anatomy during the third zzso helps to detect zzso zzso in the zzso The specificity for this diagnosis was highly increased when zzso fluid or zzso zzso content was zzso
