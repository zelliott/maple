The influence of zzso zzso zzso on multiple sclerosis zzso disease severity has been reported in multiple zzso with conflicting zzso Several studies have reported an zzso association of zzso zzso with more severe clinical disease course while, in contrast, zzso zzso has been associated with a more benign disease zzso In this study, we examine the influence of zzso of the zzso gene on disease severity in a large, zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso zzso status, 2 promoter region single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 4 measures of disease severity were tested in zzso patients with zzso zzso and secondary progressive zzso 1) Multiple zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso Index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) age at first zzso and 4) zzso between the first and second zzso The zzso zzso zzso Test was used as a single cognitive marker in zzso zzso Brain zzso was measured in 792 patients using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso carriers were zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso to investigate zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso 

In this zzso study, neither zzso zzso status nor promoter region zzso at positions zzso zzso or zzso zzso influenced the clinical disease severity, zzso or cerebral zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene region does not influence multiple sclerosis disease course in this zzso Australian multiple sclerosis zzso
