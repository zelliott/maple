In the absence of external zzso the zzso brain continues to display a rich variety of spontaneous zzso Such activity is often highly zzso is invariably rhythmic, and can occur with zzso ranging from a few milliseconds to several zzso Recently, there has been a particular resurgence of interest in fluctuations in brain activity occurring at zzso zzso zzso commonly referred to as very slow or zzso zzso zzso zzso this is primarily due to the emergence of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a technique which has revolutionized the study of human brain zzso it is also a consequence of the application of full band zzso zzso Despite these technical advances, the precise mechanisms which lead to zzso in the brain remain zzso In a host of animal studies, one brain region that consistently shows zzso at zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso similar zzso can also be observed in slices of isolated zzso relay zzso maintained in zzso Here, we discuss the nature and mechanisms of these zzso paying particular attention to a potential role for zzso in their zzso We also highlight the relationship between this activity and ongoing local network zzso in the alpha zzso zzso zzso band, drawing clear parallels with observations made in zzso zzso we consider the relevance of these zzso zzso to the pathological activity that occurs in certain types of zzso
