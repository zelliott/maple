zzso zzso imaging zzso is a commonly used technique for zzso zzso Brain zzso images acquired using zzso are sensitive to zzso changes, reflecting the level of blood zzso zzso zzso and may also contain an element of zzso contrast which detects blood flow changes in large zzso If slice inflow zzso effects are significant in zzso zzso then as the order in which the slices are acquired is changed, differences in the zzso maps are zzso However, in experiments presented here using visual zzso the data demonstrate that highly consistent results can be achieved for repetition times zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that, for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is dominated by zzso zzso zzso The thickness of the imaging slice is also an important zzso in these studies, having implications for spatial resolution, sensitivity, and acquisition zzso In separate visual zzso experiments the effect on the values of the zzso Z scores and the number of activated zzso is investigated as a function of slice thickness (from 1 to 8 zzso The maximum Z scores in the data are similar for all slice thicknesses and, after zzso to allow a direct comparison to be made, the volume of visual zzso detected as significantly activated increases with slice zzso
