In animal experiments, high plasma zzso of free fatty acids zzso are associated with increased zzso zzso stores in liver and heart, and impaired cardiac zzso In humans caloric restriction increases plasma zzso zzso 

Our objective was to assess the effects of progressive caloric restriction on zzso and zzso zzso content and zzso zzso 

This was a prospective intervention zzso 

This study included 10 lean healthy zzso 

zzso partial zzso zzso and complete zzso was zzso 

Plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso content, and zzso function were zzso 

Plasma zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso after partial and complete zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso content increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso The ratio between the early zzso and zzso contraction decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso early zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso content decreased after partial zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but did not change upon complete zzso 

Progressive caloric restriction zzso a zzso increase in zzso zzso content and a zzso decrease in zzso function in lean healthy zzso zzso zzso content showed a differential response to progressive caloric zzso indicating that zzso of zzso zzso stores is tissue zzso
