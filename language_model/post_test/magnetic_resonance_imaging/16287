zzso is a condition with a highly variable course that is hard to zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate if local gray matter volume zzso can differentiate poor zzso and good zzso functioning patients using zzso analysis in a group of zzso schizophrenia subjects zzso 

32 zzso male patients were assessed twice: at the time of the first episode of schizophrenia and one year zzso 18 healthy controls matched for age, zzso and zzso were also zzso Local gray matter volume was analyzed using zzso zzso design with factors group zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso subjects had bilateral gray matter reduction in the lateral prefrontal zzso as compared with healthy zzso zzso subjects had smaller zzso in the left zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso in the left prefrontal zzso zzso later poor and good functioning schizophrenia zzso zzso analysis might be considered a candidate for a biological marker in outcome zzso However, the small sample size, and the lack of female subjects limit zzso of zzso Moreover, studies analyzing the zzso value of brain zzso on a zzso level should be performed to assess its real usefulness in outcome zzso
