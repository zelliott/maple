It was thought that zzso carriers of fragile X syndrome zzso have no zzso zzso but there have been no quantitative studies of brain zzso and zzso Thus the authors investigated brain structure and metabolism in zzso carriers of zzso 

Eight normal zzso healthy female zzso zzso carriers aged 39 zzso 9 years zzso zzso zzso and 32 zzso controls zzso zzso 10 zzso were zzso in zzso brain zzso was measured using zzso magnetic zzso imaging, and regional cerebral zzso rates for zzso were measured using zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Compared with controls, zzso zzso carriers had a significant zzso decrease in volume of whole brain, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in volume of zzso and peripheral zzso zzso and third zzso zzso relative zzso of right zzso zzso and zzso association zzso zzso bilateral relative zzso of zzso zzso relative zzso of left zzso and zzso difference in zzso asymmetry of the zzso and zzso language zzso 

zzso carriers of zzso as defined by analysis of peripheral zzso have abnormalities in brain anatomy and zzso The biological basis for this is unknown, but most likely it includes tissue zzso for zzso zzso The findings may be of relevance to people counseling families with zzso and to understanding other zzso disorders which are associated with expansion of zzso repeats and genetic zzso
