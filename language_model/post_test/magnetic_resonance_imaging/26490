To compare zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging, and zzso zzso zzso for diagnosing and staging advanced zzso zzso 

zzso CT, and MR imaging were performed in 280 zzso Images were read by three zzso from each of the five zzso Image analysis included determination of zzso within the zzso (11 zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso zzso The standard of reference was based on surgical and zzso zzso zzso methods used were receiver operating characteristic zzso curve analysis, zzso comparison of areas under the zzso zzso zzso analysis of sensitivity and specificity pairs, and assessment of agreement between the degree of suspicion and standard of zzso 

There were 118 patients with zzso zzso 73 zzso had stage III or IV zzso zzso were found in the zzso in 70 zzso zzso in 20 zzso and liver in seven zzso zzso In the zzso MR imaging and CT zzso zzso zzso for zzso were more accurate than US zzso zzso zzso especially in the zzso spaces and zzso zzso MR imaging and CT were more sensitive than US zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso MR imaging was more accurate than CT for detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso In the liver, the zzso values for the three zzso were zzso 

CT and MR imaging are equally accurate, and either zzso can be used to stage advanced zzso zzso
