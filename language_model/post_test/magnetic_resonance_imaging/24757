Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show for the first time that levels of musical expertise zzso zzso higher order brain zzso This suggests that degree of training intensity drives such cerebral zzso Participants zzso zzso and expert zzso listened to a comprehensive set of specifically composed string quartets with zzso manipulated zzso In particular, we implemented 2 irregularities at musical closure that differed in zzso but were both within the zzso of the piece zzso zzso sensitivity scores zzso of both transgressions perfectly separated participants according to their level of musical zzso By contrasting brain responses to harmonic transgressions against regular zzso functional brain imaging data showed compelling evidence for zzso zzso of brain responses by both violation strength and expertise level in a zzso network hosting universal functions of working memory and zzso Additional independent testing evidenced an advantage in visual working memory for the professionals, which could be predicted by musical training zzso The here introduced findings of brain plasticity demonstrate the progressive impact of musical training on cognitive brain functions that may manifest well beyond the field of music zzso
