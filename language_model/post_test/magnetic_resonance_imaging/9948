Millions of older individuals consume zzso or zzso daily and these same individuals are encouraged to participate in resistance zzso Several in zzso studies suggest that zzso drugs can alter zzso metabolism and may influence adaptations to resistance zzso zzso individuals were randomly assigned to a zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso old; 4,000 zzso or zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso old; 1,200 zzso group in a zzso manner and completed 12 zzso of knee zzso resistance zzso Before and after training in zzso zzso zzso properties were assessed with zzso zzso area zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso deformation coupled with force zzso to obtain zzso zzso stress, and zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso was unchanged zzso zzso zzso with training in the zzso group, and this response was not influenced with zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso increased with training in the zzso group zzso P zzso zzso primarily due to increases in the mid zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal intensity increased with training in the zzso group at the mid zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso When zzso to zzso force levels, zzso zzso deformation and strain decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and stress were unchanged zzso zzso zzso with training in the zzso zzso These responses were generally zzso by zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso deformation and strain increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso decreased with zzso These data suggest that 3 zzso of knee zzso resistance training in older adults zzso modest changes in the mechanical properties of the zzso zzso zzso doses of zzso but not zzso have a strong influence on zzso mechanical and material property adaptations to resistance zzso These findings add to a growing body of evidence that zzso has profound effects on peripheral zzso in zzso
