zzso zzso event zzso diagnosis and prognosis are not zzso 

To identify potential diagnostic markers and outcome zzso of zzso suggestive of multiple sclerosis zzso that is, clinically isolated syndromes zzso 

zzso isolated syndrome cases zzso subjects with an zzso compatible with zzso onset and no alternative zzso with at least zzso years' follow-up were zzso zzso All cases underwent clinical, zzso zzso and zzso fluid zzso assessment, including exploratory zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso recovery, conversion to zzso and long-term neurological disability were used as outcome zzso Patients with zzso zzso spectrum disorders, idiopathic acute zzso zzso zzso zzso disease, and zzso disorders served as controls for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cases were zzso Severe presentation was associated with incomplete recovery, while presence of at least 3 zzso zzso on baseline zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso tract involvement, incomplete zzso recovery, and number of relapses predicted neurological zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso C did not correlate with any outcome zzso zzso cases had significantly lower zzso and zzso C levels compared to zzso 

An extensive diagnostic evaluation of patients with an zzso is worthwhile to make zzso zzso More robust molecular zzso are zzso
