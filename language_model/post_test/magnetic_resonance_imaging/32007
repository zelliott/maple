A next-generation zzso guidance system is proposed that will enable zzso access to both zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso This closed bore zzso zzso system is comprised of a conventional zzso rotating zzso zzso tube and a direct conversion flat panel detector on a rotating zzso positioned adjacent to the bore of a zzso T zzso To assess the feasibility of such a system, we have investigated the degree of zzso between the zzso components and the zzso For zzso zzso 200 G the effect on the zzso tube motor was negligible regardless of the orientation of zzso with respect to the motor axis of zzso frequency of zzso rotation remained within zzso of the zzso zzso frequency measured at 0 zzso For zzso zzso G the zzso slowed down to below zzso zzso at all zzso At intermediate zzso the frequency of rotation varied between zzso and zzso zzso showing a strong dependence on orientation, with zzso perpendicular to the tube axis having a much stronger effect on the rotation frequency than zzso parallel to the tube zzso In contrast to the effect of zzso on the induction zzso parallel zzso had a stronger zzso effect on the zzso electron zzso whose path was at 16 degrees to the tube zzso than the perpendicular zzso Parallel zzso of several hundred zzso had a zzso effect on the zzso focal zzso zzso perpendicular to the electron beam shifted the beam without significant zzso We have determined that the direct conversion flat panel detector zzso technology is not zzso sensitive to zzso and that the modifications required to make the proposed zzso zzso compatible are zzso The zzso of the zzso signal in the normal field of view was not significantly zzso by the presence of these zzso components in the vicinity of the zzso bore zzso
