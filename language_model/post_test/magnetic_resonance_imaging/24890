Bone zzso commonly found on magnetic resonance imaging zzso after anterior cruciate ligament zzso injury, may be associated with zzso injuries, but little is known about this zzso 

To examine demographic factors and zzso injuries associated with bone bruising in patients undergoing zzso zzso 

zzso study; Level of evidence, zzso 

Patients with zzso injury who had an zzso within 6 weeks and zzso within 3 months of injury were included in this prospective study (N zzso zzso zzso and severity of bone bruising were determined from zzso zzso for each zzso zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso plateau zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plateau zzso Multiple zzso zzso was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso for zzso of bruising and associations between bruising and zzso injuries found during zzso Outcomes included the presence of bruising and severity of lateral bruising zzso moderate, severe vs zzso zzso 

zzso of bone bruising were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Patient age between 18 and 28 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 29 years and older zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted less zzso bruising compared with patients aged 17 years and zzso Age zzso years: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and contact injuries zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted less moderate zzso zzso Male sex predicted mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Male sex also predicted mild zzso bruising zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and contact injuries predicted severe zzso bruising zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bruising zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bruising zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bruising was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso bruising and zzso bruising were not associated with any zzso or zzso zzso 

Bone bruising is more common and severe in young men, and lateral bone bruising is associated with lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso tears are associated with increased severity of zzso zzso
