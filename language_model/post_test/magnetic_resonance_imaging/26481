The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso loading zzso at a 90 degrees zzso and dynamic loading (30 deep knee zzso cause different zzso and patterns of zzso cartilage deformation in zzso The two activities were selected because they imply different types of joint loading and reflect a realistic and appropriate range of zzso zzso Twelve healthy volunteers were examined and the volume and thickness of the zzso cartilage determined before and from 90 to zzso after zzso using a water zzso zzso echo MR sequence and a three-dimensional zzso distance transformation zzso Following knee zzso we observed a residual reduction of the zzso cartilage volume zzso zzso and of the zzso cartilage thickness zzso the zzso deformation occurring in the superior lateral and the zzso zzso zzso Following zzso the change of zzso cartilage volume was zzso zzso and that of the zzso cartilage thickness zzso zzso the zzso deformation being recorded in the central aspect of the lateral zzso zzso The volume changes were significantly lower after zzso than after knee zzso zzso but the zzso thickness changes higher zzso The results obtained in this study can serve to validate computer models of joint load transfer, to guide experiments on the mechanical regulation of zzso zzso and to estimate the magnitude of deformation to be encountered by zzso cartilage within its target zzso
