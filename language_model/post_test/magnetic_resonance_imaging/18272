The potential role of magnetic resonance zzso zzso in clinical zzso practice was evaluated in 150 consecutive patients in an attempt to define clinical situations in which it aided in diagnosis, helped guide treatment options, and/or possibly eliminated the need for conventional zzso zzso Among patients with zzso pathology zzso zzso zzso zzso provided useful clinical information in zzso of cases, and could have effectively replaced zzso zzso in zzso of zzso In this group of patients, zzso provided excellent depiction of zzso and vessel zzso and in conjunction with conventional imaging zzso reliably ruled out the question of zzso versus aneurysm whenever that question was zzso Among patients with vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso in 18 of 20 zzso zzso 11 of 11 zzso vascular zzso 31 or 31 zzso cases with known zzso vascular disease, and reliably excluded zzso vascular disease in 19 of 30 zzso zzso The zzso potentially could have replaced conventional zzso zzso in less than zzso of cases with vascular pathology treated zzso and in zzso of cases with vascular pathology treated medically or zzso Imaging time was relatively short, 10 to 20 minutes for zzso vessels and zzso to 13 minutes for zzso zzso zzso included the lack of zzso resolution required for surgical planning and the possible misleading information in the settings of low flow and partial zzso It is concluded that currently available zzso zzso contribute useful information in a wide spectrum of zzso clinical situations including screening and serial zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
