Multiple stimuli present in the visual field at the same time compete for neural representation by mutually suppressing their evoked activity throughout visual cortex, providing a neural correlate for the limited processing capacity of the visual zzso Competitive interactions among stimuli can be zzso by top-down, zzso mechanisms such as attention, and by zzso zzso zzso Because these two processes cooperate in everyday life to bias processing toward zzso relevant or particularly salient zzso it has proven difficult to study interactions between zzso and bottom-up zzso Here, we used an experimental paradigm in which we first isolated the effects of a bottom-up influence on neural competition by zzso varying the degree of zzso grouping in displays that were not zzso Second, we zzso the effects of directed attention on the competitive interactions induced with the zzso zzso We found that the amount of zzso zzso varied zzso with the degree of competition left unresolved by bottom-up zzso such that zzso zzso was greatest when neural competition was little influenced by bottom-up mechanisms and smallest when competition was strongly influenced by bottom-up zzso These findings suggest that the strength of zzso zzso in the visual system is constrained by the degree to which competitive interactions have been resolved by bottom-up processes related to the zzso of scenes into candidate zzso
