The specific appearance of blood related to time at zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences is generally accepted; thus, these sequences are classically used for zzso the age of zzso zzso resonance imaging at zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on 82 zzso zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso zzso in order to zzso the appearance at different stages and with different zzso and to investigate how reliably the age of zzso can be zzso The zzso had been previously detected by CT, were spontaneous ( zzso or traumatic ( zzso in origin and were of different sizes (2 zzso to 7 zzso and ages (from zzso h to 4 years after acute zzso zzso The age of the zzso was calculated from the moment when clinical symptoms started or the traumatic event zzso The 15 patients with zzso were patients with zzso stroke in whom there was either a suspicion of zzso transformation on CT, or zzso was detected as an additional finding on MR performed for other zzso Patients with conditions that could affect the zzso of blood, such as zzso therapy or severe zzso were zzso The signal intensity pattern of the zzso was zzso and related to their ages without prior knowledge of the clinical zzso All zzso were detected with zzso zzso zzso zzso missed 13 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso sequences missed zzso zzso transformation was missed in three zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The signal pattern on zzso was identical to that on zzso zzso For all zzso a wide variety of signal patterns, without a clear relationship to the age of the zzso was zzso There was a poor relationship between the real MR appearance of zzso and the theoretical appearance on zzso zzso zzso GE was effective for detecting small zzso but was not useful for zzso the age of a zzso The zzso does not provide any more information than zzso zzso
