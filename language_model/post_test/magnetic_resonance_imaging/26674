zzso dysfunction is of frequent observation in multiple sclerosis zzso It is associated with gray matter pathology, brain zzso and altered zzso and recent evidence showed that acute inflammation can exacerbate mental deficits independently of the primary functional system zzso In this study, we measured zzso fluid zzso levels of zzso and zzso protein in zzso and in clinically isolated syndrome patients, as both proteins have been associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease zzso In zzso zzso accumulates in the brain as zzso zzso zzso possibly explaining why soluble zzso is reduced in the zzso of these zzso In our sample of zzso patients, zzso levels were significantly lower in patients cognitively impaired zzso and were zzso correlated with the number of zzso zzso zzso at the magnetic resonance imaging zzso Positive correlations between zzso levels and measures of attention and concentration were also zzso Furthermore, abnormal zzso of the cerebral cortex, explored with zzso burst stimulation zzso was observed in zzso patients, and a positive correlation was found between zzso zzso contents and the magnitude of long-term zzso effects induced by zzso No correlation was zzso found between zzso protein zzso and zzso findings, cognitive zzso and TBS effects in these zzso Together, our results indicate that in zzso central inflammation is able to alter zzso metabolism by reducing its concentration in the zzso and leading to impairment of synaptic plasticity and cognitive zzso
