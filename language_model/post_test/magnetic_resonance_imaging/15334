The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between zzso volumes and set zzso We studied 101 subjects, including 36 normal controls, 16 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, 30 patients with zzso zzso zzso and 19 patients with semantic zzso zzso using a shifting paradigm that carefully controlled for component zzso zzso were administered two conditions of the zzso Executive zzso System zzso Design zzso zzso In the control condition zzso zzso generated as many unique designs as possible in 60 s by drawing lines connecting only zzso zzso In the switching condition zzso zzso generated designs by drawing lines alternating between filled and zzso zzso We used zzso software to generate volumes of the right and left zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlations and multiple zzso showed that, after controlling for zzso State zzso and zzso only the right and left frontal lobe volumes significantly correlated with the zzso most clearly in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that frontal contributions to shifting were not related to working zzso zzso highlight the importance of carefully controlling for component cognitive processes when studying executive zzso
