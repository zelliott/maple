The goal of this work is to use vessel zzso zzso spin labeling zzso methods to detect feeding arteries without prior knowledge of their positions, and map the vascular territory of zzso 

Five healthy subjects were zzso each with four different tagging zzso The zzso tagging method was modified to use 60 different pairs of zzso steps with random orientation and zzso A signal model was developed to calculate the theoretical zzso signal resulting from a vessel in any position in the tagging zzso For each zzso the location of the feeding vessel was estimated by finding the theoretical signal that zzso most closely with the zzso 

The main zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and cerebral arteries above the Circle of Willis were identified and localized from the zzso data in all zzso In addition, external carotid branches were detected in all zzso 

zzso zzso zzso provides data that allows for blind detection of source zzso This method zzso the zzso prescription process and allows for efficient detection of zzso or collateral zzso
