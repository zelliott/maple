To determine prevalence and degree of fatty muscle zzso in zzso foot muscles in zzso volunteers and in patients with foot zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were zzso The prevalence and degree of fatty muscle zzso were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscles in 80 zzso volunteers zzso age, 48 years; range, zzso zzso and 80 patients with foot pain zzso age, 48 years; range, zzso zzso Muscles were characterized as normal zzso zzso or as having mild zzso 1) or substantial zzso 2) fatty zzso by two readers zzso zzso of visual grading for both readers were compared by using the zzso zzso zzso between age and degree of fatty muscle zzso were assessed by using the zzso zzso 

Readers 1 and 2 found substantial fatty zzso of the zzso muscle in four zzso and five zzso volunteers, respectively, and in three zzso and nine zzso patients, zzso One reader diagnosed substantial fatty zzso of the zzso muscle in three zzso volunteers and of the zzso muscle in two zzso zzso zzso for the zzso muscle varied between zzso and zzso An association between age and degree of fatty zzso of the zzso muscle was found for volunteers by both readers and for patients by reader 1 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of fatty muscle zzso of the zzso zzso considered to represent zzso zzso between zzso and zzso in both zzso volunteers and patients with foot pain, and it increases with zzso
