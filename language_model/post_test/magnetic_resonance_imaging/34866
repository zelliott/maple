zzso new evidence for the cortical origin of zzso zzso zzso in a patient with zzso cortical zzso is zzso zzso stimulation zzso zzso jerks in the right upper limb zzso An zzso zzso study with zzso stimulation showed increased regional cerebral blood flow not only in both zzso zzso but in the left zzso and primary motor areas as zzso zzso magnetic stimulation over the area of the left zzso zzso zzso motor evoked zzso in the right upper limb zzso It is concluded that in the central zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is activated first, then the impulses zzso zzso to the primary motor cortex, to elicit zzso zzso
