To explore absolute zzso of brain zzso including gamma zzso acid zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso of young adults with zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso centered on the zzso prefrontal zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso The absolute zzso of brain zzso including zzso and zzso were assessed and compared between zzso patients and healthy comparison zzso 

Sleep and zzso Center at Seoul National University zzso A high strength zzso zzso MR scanner in the Department of zzso at Seoul National University zzso 

zzso young adults with a sole diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso positive zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso years old) and 17 healthy comparison subjects zzso zzso zzso years zzso 

zzso 

Relative to comparison subjects, zzso patients had higher zzso concentration in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso patients with nocturnal sleep zzso had higher zzso concentration in the zzso prefrontal zzso than those without nocturnal sleep zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but had lower zzso concentration than comparison subjects zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The current study reports that young adults with zzso had a higher zzso concentration in the zzso prefrontal cortex, which was more prominent in patients without nocturnal sleep zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso prefrontal zzso level may be increased in zzso and the increased zzso prefrontal zzso might be a zzso mechanism to reduce nocturnal sleep disturbances in zzso
