The purpose of this study was to describe the magnetic resonance zzso imaging features of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and to correlate these findings with zzso MR imaging findings in four patients with zzso proved zzso zzso are zzso In all patients, MR imaging zzso including zzso and zzso and early and late zzso images, were zzso evaluated for the size, zzso signal intensity, and enhancement pattern of the zzso zzso was made between the MR imaging findings and zzso zzso zzso ranged in diameter from zzso to zzso zzso zzso were solitary in one patient and numerous in three zzso In all patients, the zzso were low signal on zzso images and high signal and zzso on zzso images and demonstrated thin rim enhancement on early zzso images that persisted on late zzso zzso No appreciable central enhancement of the zzso was zzso At zzso the zzso were composed of zzso spaces and zzso zzso zzso showed compressed liver zzso surrounding the zzso (three zzso and inflammatory cell zzso (one zzso which correlated with the rim enhancement on the zzso MR zzso Most of the zzso zzso in our small series were less than 1 zzso in diameter and of high signal intensity on zzso images, and had a thin rim of enhancement on early and late zzso zzso The imaging features were zzso by the underlying zzso In patients with known zzso caution should be exercised not to zzso these zzso as zzso due to the presence of thin rim zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso
