zzso evidence suggests the increased production of zzso oxygen species zzso in migraine zzso In the current study we measured zzso zzso product in the rat cortex, zzso zzso and zzso after the induction of cortical spreading depression zzso a phenomenon known to be associated with migraine aura, and tested zzso firing triggered by zzso in zzso nerves ex zzso Application of zzso to zzso mater in zzso rats induced several waves of zzso recorded by an zzso zzso in the zzso Following zzso samples of zzso zzso regions were identified with blood oxygen zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso from left and right zzso and zzso zzso were taken for zzso zzso We found that zzso increased the level of the zzso zzso product zzso zzso in the zzso cerebral zzso and zzso but also in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In order to test the zzso action of zzso we applied the mild zzso hydrogen zzso to isolated rat zzso preparations including preserved zzso zzso Application of hydrogen zzso to zzso zzso enhanced electrical zzso activity of zzso nerves showing a zzso action of zzso In the presence of hydrogen zzso zzso nerves still responded to zzso by burst of zzso activity indicating integrity of zzso zzso The action of hydrogen zzso was zzso by zzso receptors as it was abolished by the specific zzso zzso zzso Using zzso root zzso sensory zzso as test system we found that hydrogen zzso promoted the release of the migraine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which we previously identified as a trigger of delayed zzso of zzso zzso Our data suggest that, after zzso zzso stress spreads downstream within the zzso zzso system and could be involved in the zzso of zzso with the zzso of zzso system in migraine zzso
