To determine whether a quantitative MR imaging method to map zzso relaxation time zzso can be used to characterize zzso changes in the normal human zzso 

An zzso technique was used to map zzso zzso at the level of the zzso zzso in a study population of 19 healthy children (4 to 10 years old) and 31 healthy adolescents (10 to 20 years zzso and in a zzso population of 20 healthy adults (20 to 30 years zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso showed that zzso decreases with age in the zzso frontal white matter, zzso zzso anterior thalamus, zzso nucleus, zzso radiation, cortical gray matter (all P zzso zzso and zzso white zzso There was a significant reduction in zzso between childhood zzso age, zzso zzso zzso and adolescence zzso age, zzso zzso zzso in all brain structures, but there was also a significant reduction in zzso between adolescence zzso age, zzso zzso zzso and adulthood zzso age, zzso zzso zzso in all brain structures except zzso white zzso zzso shows that zzso declines to within the range zzso zzso 2 zzso of young adult zzso values by about 2 years in the zzso white matter, by about 4 years in the zzso by 11 years in the cortical gray matter, by 11 years in the frontal white matter, and by 13 years in the zzso 

Brain structures mature at zzso different rates, yet the ratio of gray matter zzso to white matter zzso does not change significantly with zzso Thus, conventional MR imaging methods based on inherent contrast are insensitive to these zzso zzso changes tend to reach completion sooner in white matter than in gray matter zzso Such zzso data are essential for studies of specific pediatric disorders and may be useful for assessing brain maturation in cases of zzso zzso
