zzso lobe zzso zzso is neither common nor easily diagnosed because of its variable clinical zzso To zzso its characteristics and surgical outcome, the authors reviewed their surgical zzso 

Between September 1994 and August 2001, 38 patients with zzso received surgical treatment at the Seoul National University zzso All patients underwent zzso mainly involving the zzso zzso 

zzso over zzso of the cases were not considered to be zzso even though zzso was the most common diagnosis zzso zzso An invasive study was performed in 37 of the 38 zzso zzso operations under regional zzso were performed in 20 patients zzso zzso disappeared in 15 zzso zzso I, zzso and rare seizure remained in 5 zzso II, zzso Thirteen patients showed a worthwhile improvement zzso III, zzso whereas 5 exhibited no worthwhile improvement zzso IV, zzso zzso were diverse, the most common being cortical zzso zzso 

Since zzso is difficult to diagnose zzso an invasive study covering the zzso lobe is mandatory, if zzso is zzso zzso zzso was the most common zzso thus awake operation under regional zzso and zzso brain mapping is helpful during extensive zzso in order to spare the eloquent zzso
