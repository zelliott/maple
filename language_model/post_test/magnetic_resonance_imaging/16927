Dynamic zzso contrast magnetic resonance imaging zzso allows the zzso assessment of brain zzso zzso by zzso via zzso the cerebral blood flow zzso and mean transit time zzso zzso value decomposition zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the most widely adopted zzso method, although they bear some limitations, including zzso zzso in the zzso function and bias in the presence of delay and zzso between the tissue and the zzso input zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed, which performs better than zzso and zzso on simulated data both in the presence and absence of zzso Moreover, zzso allows to zzso the zzso zzso Here, zzso and zzso are compared for the first time on a group of nine patients with severe zzso unilateral zzso of internal carotid artery before and after carotid zzso to investigate the effect of zzso zzso According to region of zzso analysis, zzso characterizes the zzso tissue more accurately than zzso thus improving the quality of the information provided to physicians for zzso In fact, in 7 zzso of the 9 subjects, zzso and zzso maps provided by zzso allow to correctly identify the zzso zzso to the zzso Moreover, by emphasizing the difference between zzso and healthy zzso zzso may be successfully used to monitor the zzso recovery after the treatment and/or zzso zzso also generates zzso level and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso level provides information on zzso and zzso estimates reliability and may also be used as a clinical indicator of pathological tissue state complementary to zzso and zzso thus increasing the clinical information provided by zzso zzso
