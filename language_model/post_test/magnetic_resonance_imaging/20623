zzso of zzso invading primary motor zzso and zzso motor zzso is difficult in both surgical decision-making and functional outcome zzso In this study, magnetic resonance zzso diffusion zzso imaging zzso data were used to perform zzso to zzso zzso tract zzso along its whole length in a zzso virtual reality zzso zzso The potential value of its clinical application was zzso 

Both three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso were obtained from 45 eligible patients with suspected cerebral zzso and then transferred to the zzso system zzso Volume zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and tumor were segmented and reconstructed via zzso respectively, while the zzso zzso were reconstructed via zzso All those were presented in a zzso 3-D display zzso for the purpose of zzso zzso planning and surgical simulation in each zzso The relationship between increasing zzso of the number of effective fibers of zzso zzso at affected sides and the patients' zzso Performance zzso zzso at zzso was addressed zzso 

In zzso zzso planning for zzso surgery was aided by zzso 3-D visualizing the relative position of the zzso and a zzso There was no significant difference between zzso and zzso zzso in this zzso A positive relationship was proved between zzso increasing zzso and zzso zzso 

3-D zzso zzso of zzso in this zzso environment enhances the operators to well understand the zzso information of zzso tumor contours and adjacent zzso results in surgical trajectory zzso initially, and zzso safe tumor zzso zzso In accordance to the zzso increasing zzso surgeon can predict the long-term motor functional zzso
