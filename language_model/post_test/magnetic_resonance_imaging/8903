zzso pattern analysis zzso was used to analyze zzso level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso data, which were acquired as human subjects received brief zzso stimulation of their hands and zzso Support zzso machines trained and tested on the whole brain zzso data were able to accurately decode the body site of single touches, with mean performance of zzso in a zzso discrimination task zzso performance zzso and zzso in a zzso discrimination task zzso performance zzso zzso and secondary zzso areas zzso and zzso alone zzso the touched body site with high zzso zzso was more accurate at decoding touches closely spaced on the body surface zzso fingers of the same hand) whereas zzso and zzso were equally accurate at decoding widely spaced touches zzso zzso zzso The hand and foot regions of zzso zzso and zzso were separately examined in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was better able to decode the hand of stimulation zzso zzso zzso and zzso was better able to decode the foot of zzso In addition to zzso and zzso zzso responses were observed in a region of visual cortex, areas zzso and zzso zzso in lateral zzso zzso zzso was able to accurately decode the hand but not the foot of zzso supporting the idea of a role for zzso in zzso zzso
