zzso spine involvement is common and potentially severe in patients with zzso arthritis zzso The objectives of this study were to compare the zzso of cervical spine abnormalities detected by standard zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with zzso and to identify factors associated with cervical spine zzso 

We studied 40 patients who met American College of zzso criteria for zzso and had disease zzso of 2 years or zzso Each patient underwent a physical examination, laboratory tests, standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and extension zzso zzso with dynamic maneuvers in (if not zzso and zzso 

zzso spine involvement was found by at least one imaging technique in 29 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso CT, zzso and zzso zzso and was zzso in 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most common zzso zzso of zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso The most common zzso pattern was anterior zzso zzso followed by lateral zzso zzso then by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were seen in zzso of patients by zzso zzso by CT, and zzso by standard zzso Of the 10 cases of anterior zzso by any zzso 9 were detected by standard zzso and 7 by zzso CT was the best technique for visualizing zzso zzso or lateral zzso zzso was best for assessing the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso impact of the zzso zzso The comparison of patients with and without cervical spine zzso suggested that higher modified Sharp score and zzso protein values predicted cervical spine involvement zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso spine involvement is common and may be zzso indicating that routine cervical spine imaging is indicated in patients with zzso Standard zzso including dynamic views constitutes the zzso imaging method of zzso zzso and zzso of the assessment are greatest with zzso zzso and CT are often reserved for selected zzso zzso spine involvement is associated with disease activity and with rapidly progressive joint zzso
