We report an zzso woman with zzso zzso syndrome diagnosed by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso She was admitted because of left zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a high signal zzso at the right zzso zzso zzso 10 days after the zzso It is well known that zzso zzso is useful for detecting zzso cerebral zzso zzso in the extremely acute zzso However, to our knowledge, there have been only a few reports of zzso zzso in patients with zzso stroke of the zzso zzso zzso nerve fibers in the direction perpendicular to the zzso zzso zzso shows a high signal by zzso zzso zzso of apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso nerve fibers in the zzso tract of zzso zzso also shows a high signal when the zzso pulse is applied in the zzso and y zzso We solved this problem by using zzso zzso imaging and were able to detect zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the acute zzso
