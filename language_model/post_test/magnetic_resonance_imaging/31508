We sought to investigate the value of cardiac magnetic resonance to depict cardiac zzso zzso For cardiac zzso therapy the lead for the left zzso is usually placed by zzso approach into a zzso of the coronary zzso zzso zzso of the anatomy and variations of the cardiac zzso system may facilitate the positioning of the left zzso zzso The cardiac magnetic resonance examinations of 23 subjects (16 volunteers and 7 zzso were zzso zzso All examinations were performed using zzso zzso zzso free zzso coronary artery imaging after administration of zzso contrast agents zzso in zzso zzso in zzso The cardiac zzso system was zzso in all zzso The most frequent anatomical zzso observed (in 12 subjects zzso was a connection of the small cardiac vein to the zzso at the crux zzso In 10 subjects zzso the small veins entered the right atrium independently from the zzso and the zzso zzso vein was connected to the zzso at the crux zzso Only one subject had a zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso which entered into the right atrium zzso The mean distance of the zzso vein of the left zzso and the left marginal vein to the zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the anatomy of the cardiac zzso system and its anatomical zzso can be described using cardiac magnetic zzso Its zzso zzso may help to facilitate the implant procedure and to reduce zzso zzso
