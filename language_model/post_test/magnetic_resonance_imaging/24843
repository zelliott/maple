To examine differences in number and size of signal zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso between patients with primary zzso syndrome zzso and controls who all had frequent episodic zzso headache zzso and to investigate their relation to zzso zzso level zzso patient age, disease zzso and zzso 

zzso in 22 zzso patients with zzso were compared to 20 zzso controls with zzso using the modified zzso rating zzso zzso was used for determination of zzso and the European League Against zzso SS Disease zzso Index zzso for disease activity zzso 

zzso significant differences in the total number of zzso were noted zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso for zzso of diameter zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between disease duration and number of overall zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Number of zzso zzso zzso correlated to zzso zzso zzso zzso and to patient age zzso zzso zzso without association with markers of zzso and zzso 

Our study showed that zzso on brain zzso are more common in specific regions of the brain in zzso patients with zzso than in controls with zzso signifying a more widespread cerebral zzso in SS patients with zzso zzso zzso seem to be associated to increased zzso zzso release in zzso patients with zzso and correlated with disease zzso without correlation to the actual zzso and markers of zzso and might be linked with chronic zzso of zzso intensity and zzso in zzso
