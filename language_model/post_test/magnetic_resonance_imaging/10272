To investigate the possible correlation between the changes in inflammatory active phase of zzso zzso zzso with measured changes in zzso zzso zzso levels over zzso This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential usefulness of measured zzso values in following and treating patients with zzso 

A retrospective chart analysis was performed on 23 patients who had been referred to a zzso care zzso service between July of 2002 and April of 2004 with suspected zzso The activity status of patients with zzso was graded by using the zzso activity scale zzso created to distinguish between the active and zzso zzso of zzso Laboratory values of zzso reported during the course of the study period were compiled for each study zzso 

Linear zzso analysis revealed a statistical correlation between the changes in activity of zzso as measured by the zzso score, and changes in measured values of zzso over zzso A statistically significant correlation was also found between the activity of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

It was found that changes in inflammatory phase of zzso as measured by the zzso score, statistically correlate with changes in measured zzso An additional correlation was also found between the absolute score of zzso activity and measured level of zzso These findings suggest that serial zzso zzso may be an adjunct in assessing clinical inflammatory activity of zzso and may help direct clinical decision making regarding treatment decisions in zzso
