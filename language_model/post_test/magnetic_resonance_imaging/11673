The extent of tumor zzso that should be undertaken in patients with zzso zzso zzso remains zzso The purpose of this study was to identify significant independent zzso of survival in these patients and to determine whether the extent of zzso was associated with increased survival zzso 

The authors zzso analyzed 416 consecutive patients with zzso proven zzso who underwent tumor zzso at the zzso institution between June 1993 and June zzso zzso data and other tumor characteristics identified on magnetic resonance zzso imaging were collected zzso 

Five independent zzso of survival were zzso age, zzso Performance zzso zzso score, extent of zzso and the degree of necrosis and enhancement on zzso MR imaging zzso A significant survival advantage was associated with zzso of zzso or more of the tumor volume zzso survival 13 months, zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso months zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for zzso of less than zzso Using an outcome scale ranging from 0 to 5 based on age, zzso score, and tumor necrosis on MR imaging, we observed significantly longer survival in patients with lower scores zzso who underwent aggressive zzso and a trend toward slightly longer survival was found in patients with higher scores zzso zzso tumor zzso is associated with longer survival in patients with zzso especially when other zzso variables are zzso
