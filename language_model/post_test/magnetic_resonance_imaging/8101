Recent data suggest that zzso of the DNA repair gene zzso DNA zzso zzso by increasing the zzso of zzso zzso is significantly associated with improved zzso zzso in contradiction with these findings, however, are present in the literature and the clinical and genetic context framing zzso zzso is poorly zzso 

To address these issues, we have investigated the zzso zzso status, clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso and relevant genetic features zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso amplification, and zzso zzso in a retrospective study on 86 patients affected by zzso zzso 72 patients had a clinical history indicating de zzso zzso of the tumor and the remaining 14 were secondary zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso in 41 of 86 cases zzso zzso zzso survival and overall survival were significantly longer in zzso than in zzso patients zzso versus 7 months zzso zzso zzso and 18 versus 14 months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement at magnetic resonance imaging was significantly more frequent in zzso and secondary zzso zzso and ring enhancement in zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was more present in secondary zzso zzso zzso and associated with loss of zzso on zzso and/or zzso zzso 

These observations suggest that zzso zzso is part of a genetic signature of zzso that developed from zzso zzso
