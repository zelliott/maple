zzso direction is known to zzso the zzso patterns of zzso areas as seen at the single cell level and in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso To determine whether such gaze direction effects can be observed in zzso electroencephalogram zzso measures of zzso function we investigated zzso evoked zzso zzso and steady state movement related cortical zzso zzso 

In two separate experiments, zzso were zzso by electrical stimulation of the median nerve zzso 1) and steady state zzso were induced by 2 zzso tapping paced by an auditory cue zzso zzso while subjects directed their gaze 15 degrees to the left or to the zzso 

zzso direction failed to produce any appreciable differences in the zzso of the zzso or zzso In particular, there was no effect on peak zzso peak zzso and peak scalp topography measures of zzso and zzso zzso or on spatial or zzso parameters of zzso models of the underlying cortical zzso Additional frequency domain analyses did not reveal reliable zzso changes in induced power at zzso sites zzso zzso and motor areas, or in zzso between pairs of zzso central and frontal electrodes, across a broad range of zzso 

zzso measures of zzso function, obtained in a zzso motor task, are insensitive to zzso effects of gaze direction in zzso areas that are zzso with zzso
