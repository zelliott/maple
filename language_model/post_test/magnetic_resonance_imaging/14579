zzso therapies are accompanied by a substantial zzso effect, indicating that zzso circuits in the brain have a significant capacity to regulate cough neural zzso However, essentially nothing is known about the identity of these zzso circuits or how they reduce zzso zzso these processes may help develop more effective zzso therapies in the zzso 

To identify regional changes in human brain activity related to the zzso after zzso zzso zzso 

zzso healthy participants undertook functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing a series of zzso of zzso to induce the zzso The zzso brain responses associated with zzso inhalation without any treatment were compared with those induced by zzso after zzso zzso zzso 

There was a significant decrease in zzso ratings of zzso after the zzso zzso zzso Brain activity associated with zzso inhalation was less in the zzso primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso trials compared with no treatment control zzso By contrast, zzso trials were associated with increased zzso in the prefrontal and left zzso zzso 

zzso decreases in zzso are accompanied by commensurate decreases in several brain regions activated during zzso zzso suggesting that beliefs about treatment can modify the central processing of zzso arising from the zzso The prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso are likely to play an active role in the modification of airway sensory processing after administration of a zzso
