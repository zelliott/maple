zzso zzso zzso zzso allows zzso assessment of the coronary arteries and simultaneously can provide measurement of left zzso ejection fraction zzso The accuracy of newer zzso generations zzso or more) for assessment of zzso compared with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso has not been evaluated in a zzso 

To zzso via a systematic literature review and zzso whether zzso can assess zzso with high accuracy compared with zzso and zzso 

Electronic databases and reference lists for relevant published studies were zzso zzso eligible studies provided mean zzso with its standard zzso zzso measured by zzso versus zzso and zzso zzso of weighted mean difference zzso and zzso method were used to zzso the mean difference and agreement between zzso compared with zzso and zzso 

The results of combining 12 studies showed no significant difference in zzso between zzso and zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed excellent agreement between zzso and zzso with a bias of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The results of combining 15 studies showed no significant difference in zzso between zzso versus zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed excellent agreement between zzso and zzso with a bias of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

The newer zzso generations can provide accurate zzso measurement compared to zzso and zzso zzso represents a valid technique for the combined evaluation of zzso and coronary artery zzso
