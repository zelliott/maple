We describe two pediatric patients with an uncommon zzso seizure propagation zzso Both had zzso zzso as the main or only zzso Case 1 had a small mass in the left zzso zzso zzso case 2 had no zzso on magnetic resonance zzso In both, the electroencephalogram showed not only left zzso zzso but also zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso from onset and unusual zzso generalized zzso zzso patterns arising from the left zzso zzso Case 1 was seizure free following zzso of the zzso focal or generalized zzso zzso abnormalities were no longer zzso In case 2, zzso localized the spikes to the left superior and zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested was the origin of zzso These cases illustrate the close relationship between the focal zzso area and zzso zzso and suggest that the focal area can trigger zzso zzso The therapeutic strategy may need to be altered in such zzso
