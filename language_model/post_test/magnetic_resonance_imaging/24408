Heart failure zzso has been associated with cognitive dysfunction, a high prevalence of mood disorders, and a relative loss of zzso matter in several brain zzso This study aimed to determine if, compared with controls with and without zzso heart disease zzso adults with zzso show evidence of progressive loss of cerebral zzso matter, and whether zzso changes are associated with changes in zzso depression and anxiety symptoms over a follow-up period of 2 zzso 

This was a zzso zzso study of 19 participants with zzso zzso 43 with zzso and 45 zzso zzso were older than 45 years and free of cognitive impairment at the start of zzso We acquired magnetic resonance images and used zzso zzso zzso version 8 zzso to investigate changes in the distribution of cerebral zzso matter volume over zzso We used the Cambridge zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the Hospital zzso and Depression zzso zzso to assess zzso changes in cognitive function and zzso Changes in total zzso matter volume and cognitive function were similar across the three study groups, but participants with zzso showed evidence of increasing severity of anxiety and depressive zzso zzso was associated with subtle regional loss of zzso matter in the right and left thalamus, left zzso left and right zzso cingulate, left and right zzso zzso left superior and middle zzso zzso and right inferior zzso zzso compared with controls and, to a lesser extent, participants with zzso 

zzso and zzso are not associated with a zzso loss of cerebral zzso matter or cognitive decline over 2 years compared with zzso healthy zzso Adults with zzso experience increasing symptoms of anxiety and depression over 2 years compared with controls, and this increased vulnerability is associated with a relative loss of zzso matter in brain regions that are important for the zzso of zzso
