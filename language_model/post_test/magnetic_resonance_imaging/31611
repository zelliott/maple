The authors report on their experience with a zzso virtual reality system for planning minimally invasive zzso zzso 

Between October 2002 and April 2006, the authors used the zzso zzso zzso zzso to plan zzso procedures in 106 patients, including 100 with zzso and 6 with spinal zzso The planning was performed 1 to 3 days zzso and in 12 cases, zzso prints of the planning procedure were taken into the operating zzso A questionnaire was completed by the zzso after the planning zzso 

After a short period of zzso the system proved easy to operate and is currently used routinely for zzso planning of difficult cases at the zzso zzso It was felt that working with a virtual reality zzso model of the patient significantly improved surgical zzso The zzso in individual patients could easily be understood in great detail, enabling the authors to determine the surgical trajectory precisely and in the most minimally invasive zzso 

The authors found the zzso zzso model to be in high zzso with zzso zzso the resulting zzso zzso feeling enhanced surgical zzso In all procedures planned with the zzso the chosen surgical strategy proved to be the correct zzso zzso virtual reality models of a patient allow quick and easy understanding of complex zzso zzso
