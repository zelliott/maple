zzso for brain cancer inevitably results in zzso of zzso zzso While it has been demonstrated that zzso of the brain can result in cognitive deficits, zzso relationships are not well zzso There is little work zzso a particular cognitive deficit with dose received by the region of the brain responsible for the specific cognitive zzso One obstacle to such studies is that identification of brain anatomy is both labor intensive and dependent on the individual performing the zzso Automatic zzso has the potential to be both efficient and zzso zzso is a software package developed by the University of Iowa for zzso zzso zzso It zzso MR images, the zzso atlas, and an artificial neural network zzso to segment brain images into zzso in a standardized zzso We have developed a software package, zzso that converts the regions of interest identified by zzso into a zzso zzso structure zzso The structure set can be imported into a treatment planning system for zzso We demonstrated the utility of zzso using a test case, a 34-year-old man with diffuse zzso treated with three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso successfully applied the zzso zzso to identify the right and left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was not successful in applying the ANN to identify small structures, such as the zzso and zzso Further work is necessary to revise the ANN or to develop new methods for identification of small structures in the presence of disease and radiation induced zzso The segmented zzso were transferred to our commercial treatment planning system using zzso and zzso zzso were zzso This method will facilitate the acquisition of data necessary for the development of normal tissue complication probability zzso models that assess the probability of cognitive complications secondary to zzso for zzso and head and neck zzso
