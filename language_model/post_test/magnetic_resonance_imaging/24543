zzso is a common joint disorder that is most prevalent in the knee zzso zzso zzso zzso can be characterized by the gradual loss of zzso cartilage zzso zzso of zzso fissures and cracks on the cartilage surface has been associated with degenerative zzso and can be measured by zzso zzso In addition, loss of zzso from zzso zzso of the zzso can be measured at early stage of cartilage degradation by zzso zzso In this case, a zzso phenomenon of cartilage is used to assess the changes at early zzso of zzso In this paper, a method to measure local sodium concentration in zzso due to zzso has been zzso A clinical zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso facility is used to acquire sodium images and zzso local sodium content of zzso An zzso zzso zzso sequence with low echo time has been used for MR zzso The estimated sodium concentration in zzso region from four different data sets is found to be zzso which matches the values that has been reported for the normal zzso This study shows that sodium images acquired at clinical zzso zzso system can generate an adequate quantitative data that enable the zzso of sodium concentration in zzso We conclude that this method is potentially suitable for zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement of zzso zzso
