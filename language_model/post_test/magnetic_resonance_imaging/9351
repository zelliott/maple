The aim of this study was to investigate newly diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease zzso with structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso to compare them with healthy controls, to relate the findings to clinical zzso dominant zzso or zzso instability and gait difficulty zzso to investigate the relationship between both the duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis and the severity of symptoms and the zzso zzso Patients with a zzso zzso diagnosis were compared to patients with a probable zzso zzso We hypothesized that the zzso zzso the probable zzso group, a greater symptom severity and a longer symptom duration would all be associated with more frequent pathological zzso zzso zzso patients were included and examined with zzso 35 with the zzso zzso and 23 with the TD zzso zzso had zzso zzso and 13 probable zzso Thirty healthy individuals, matched for age and sex, served as zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso and the superior zzso zzso were significantly more common in the probable zzso group than in the controls, suggesting the possibility of an emerging zzso zzso zzso No significant zzso differences were found between zzso zzso and controls, between zzso zzso and probable zzso nor between zzso and zzso No significant associations were found between duration to diagnosis and zzso results, nor between severity of symptoms and zzso zzso Thus, although pathological zzso findings were common they can not be used to separate zzso of zzso in newly diagnosed zzso
