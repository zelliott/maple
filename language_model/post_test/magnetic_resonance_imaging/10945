zzso folate zzso zzso can be defined as any neurological syndrome associated with low zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso the active folate zzso in the presence of normal folate metabolism outside the nervous zzso zzso could result from either disturbed folate transport or from increased folate turnover within the central nervous system zzso We report on a novel zzso syndrome in 20 children, which we term zzso zzso Typical features became manifest from the age of 4 months, starting with marked zzso zzso and sleep disturbances followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso developed in about one third of the zzso Most children showed zzso zzso growth from the age of 4 to 6 zzso Visual disturbances began to develop around the age of 3 years and progressive zzso hearing loss started from the age of 6 zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso regions and zzso zzso in seven children, slowly progressive zzso and zzso zzso in three children, and normal findings in the zzso Because active folate transport to the zzso occurs through zzso folate zzso protein 1 zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso gene was performed and found to be zzso However, zzso protein analysis revealed a zzso zzso zzso suspected to result from either zzso defects of zzso protein zzso the presence of folate zzso with irreversible zzso or zzso blocking the folate binding site of zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso should be started in low doses at zzso but in some patients higher daily doses of zzso acid at 2-3 zzso are required to zzso zzso zzso zzso This proposed treatment protocol resulted in a zzso clinical response in patients identified before the age of six years while partial recovery with poorer outcome was found beyond the age of 6 zzso zzso clinical and zzso monitoring should be performed 1, 3, and 6 months after the beginning of zzso After four to six months of zzso acid treatment, zzso analysis should be repeated in order to prevent zzso or zzso of zzso zzso Secondary forms of zzso have been recognized during chronic use of zzso and zzso drugs and in various known conditions such as zzso syndrome, zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso link between these underlying specific disease entities and the observed secondary zzso has not been zzso
