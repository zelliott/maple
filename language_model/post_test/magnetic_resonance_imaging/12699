We report the outcome of patients with zzso idiopathic generalized zzso zzso who were submitted to extended zzso zzso zzso 

Eleven patients with zzso who were submitted to extended zzso zzso section were zzso zzso zzso included history and zzso examination, zzso and zzso zzso zzso recording, high resolution zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and intelligence zzso zzso zzso All patients were submitted to extended zzso zzso zzso section, leaving only the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso patterns included repetitive spike and wave or zzso and wave zzso or fast zzso recruiting zzso zzso showed no focal zzso zzso mean general zzso was zzso zzso at least a zzso reduction in the frequency of generalized zzso zzso was noted in all zzso In three patients absences disappeared completely, and the others had at least zzso reduction in seizure zzso Only one patient had zzso zzso zzso and these zzso disappeared after zzso zzso After surgery, mean general zzso was zzso A very clear increase in attention level was noted in all zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings showed zzso of bilateral zzso in all zzso 

This article reports on a large and homogeneous series of patients with zzso zzso submitted for zzso zzso There was a marked decrease in generalized seizure frequency and increase in the attention level in this patient zzso Our results suggest that zzso interaction might have a role in zzso zzso zzso is a safe, effective, and zzso zzso procedure in these zzso patients with zzso zzso
