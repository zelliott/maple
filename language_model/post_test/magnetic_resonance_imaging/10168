zzso patients are impaired in zzso task performance, a measure of selective zzso zzso and functional abnormalities in zzso regions, in particular the prefrontal zzso zzso have been reported in this zzso We aimed to examine the relationship between functional zzso impaired task performance and the severity of depressive symptoms in bipolar zzso 

zzso bipolar patients zzso zzso 10; all zzso either zzso or with zzso depression, and zzso control subjects zzso zzso zzso viewed 10 alternating blocks of zzso zzso and control zzso naming the zzso of the zzso zzso response was measured using functional magnetic resonance zzso We zzso zzso differences in neural response and zzso correlations with mood and zzso 

There were no significant zzso differences in task zzso During the zzso condition, controls demonstrated greater zzso of visual and zzso and zzso prefrontal cortical zzso bipolar patients demonstrated relative zzso within zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso Depression scores showed a trend towards a negative correlation with the magnitude of zzso zzso zzso in bipolar patients, whereas state anxiety correlated positively with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 

Our findings confirm previous reports of decreased zzso prefrontal activity during zzso task performance in bipolar patients, and suggest a possible negative correlation between this and depression severity in bipolar zzso These findings further highlight the zzso zzso as a potential candidate for illness related dysfunction in bipolar zzso
