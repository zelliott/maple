zzso zzso zzso can depict acute zzso based on decreased apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unlike zzso (which have contributions from zzso zzso solely reflect diffusion zzso Recent studies indicate that severity of neurological deficit zzso with degree of zzso zzso 

To determine whether zzso volume on zzso maps zzso with length of hospitalization and clinical outcome in patients with acute zzso middle cerebral artery zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients with acute zzso zzso zzso zzso seen on zzso 

zzso volume was determined by counting zzso with zzso values zzso zzso below the average zzso value of a zzso control zzso zzso volume was correlated with length of hospitalization and zzso outcome assessed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rankin zzso zzso zzso Index zzso and a zzso outcome status with favorable outcome defined as zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso volume on zzso maps ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and was significantly correlated with length of hospitalization zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso volume was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and outcome status zzso zzso zzso (each p zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso revealed a statistically significant correlation between zzso zzso volume and outcome status zzso zzso zzso but none for Canadian Neurological zzso score, age and gender zzso zzso zzso 

zzso volume measured by using a quantitative definition for zzso tissue on zzso maps correlated significantly with length of hospitalization (as a possible surrogate marker for short-term zzso and functional outcome after 6 zzso zzso zzso volume may provide zzso information for patients with acute zzso zzso zzso
