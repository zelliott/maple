To develop a zzso magnetic resonance zzso technique to measure skeletal muscle zzso in peripheral zzso disease zzso 

A total of 11 patients (age zzso 61 zzso 11 zzso with mild to moderate symptomatic zzso zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 22 zzso were studied using an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso N zzso zzso exercised to zzso zzso (N zzso zzso exercised to the same workload achieved by zzso At peak exercise, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was infused at zzso zzso followed by a saline flush at the same zzso A zzso zzso echo zzso sequence enabled simultaneous acquisition of muscle zzso and zzso input function zzso The zzso index zzso was defined as the slope of the zzso curve zzso in muscle divided by the zzso zzso zzso 

Median workload was 120 zzso in zzso 210 zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Median zzso was zzso in zzso zzso and 75th zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 75th % zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 75th % zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso Area under the zzso for zzso zzso patients from zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso measurement of lower limb zzso with zzso zzso MR zzso zzso from zzso This method may be useful in the study of novel therapies for zzso
