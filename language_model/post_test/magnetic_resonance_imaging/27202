There is substantial inconsistency in results of brain structural magnetic resonance imaging studies in adult bipolar zzso This is likely zzso upon limited statistical power of studies together with their clinical and zzso zzso The current study was undertaken to perform an international collaborative zzso of regional zzso zzso of individual patient and healthy subject data, to zzso statistical power, detect zzso differences, assess the association of zzso medication usage with brain structural variation, and detect other possible sources of zzso 

Eleven international research groups contributed published and unpublished data on 321 individuals with bipolar disorder I and zzso healthy zzso We used linear mixed effects zzso models to evaluate differences in brain structure between patient zzso 

zzso with bipolar disorder had increased right lateral zzso left zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso patients taking zzso displayed significantly increased zzso and zzso volume compared with patients not treated with zzso and healthy comparison zzso zzso volume reduction was significantly associated with illness duration in bipolar zzso 

The application of zzso to bipolar disorder imaging identified zzso use and illness duration as substantial and consistent sources of zzso with zzso use associated with regionally specific increased brain zzso
