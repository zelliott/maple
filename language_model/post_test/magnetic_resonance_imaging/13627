Voice is not only the vehicle of speech, it is also an zzso zzso that conveys a wealth of information on a person's identity and affective zzso In contrast to speech perception, little is known about the neural bases of our ability to perceive these various types of zzso vocal zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we identified regions along the superior zzso zzso zzso that were not only sensitive, but also highly selective to vocal zzso In the present study, we asked how neural activity in the voice areas was influenced by zzso the presence or not of linguistic information in the vocal input zzso zzso zzso and zzso frequency zzso Speech sounds were found to elicit greater responses than zzso zzso in most parts of auditory cortex, including primary auditory zzso zzso on both sides of the zzso In contrast, response zzso due to frequency scrambling was much more pronounced in anterior zzso areas than at the level of zzso zzso only right anterior zzso regions responded more strongly to zzso vocal sounds than to their scrambled version, suggesting that these regions could be specifically involved in zzso aspects of voice zzso
