Recently, several studies using zzso zzso reported changes in patients with high-grade internal carotid artery zzso zzso suggestive of subtle brain tissue zzso We used diffusion zzso imaging zzso to investigate the zzso cerebral white matter integrity in zzso patients with high-grade zzso 

In 15 zzso patients with unilateral high grade zzso zzso we used zzso zzso including zzso We used a zzso approach comparing quantitative zzso metrics between both zzso including the so-called border zzso MR images were also assessed for zzso white matter zzso zzso as well as zzso via the circle of zzso 

There was no significant zzso difference of fractional zzso or mean zzso values between the zzso for any zzso zzso was graded zzso in 6 patients, zzso in 9 and zzso in zzso 

In clinically zzso patients with high-grade unilateral zzso there was no difference between the zzso parameters of the affected and the unaffected zzso These findings contrast with other studies in zzso high-grade zzso which is likely due to patient zzso These findings argue against zzso chronic tissue integrity changes and zzso the zzso of zzso carotid artery disease in individual zzso
