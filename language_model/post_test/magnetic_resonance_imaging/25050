The picture zzso and communication system zzso technology reaches its 10th zzso zzso no one could zzso the impact the zzso would have to the health care enterprise, but it is common consent today, that zzso is the key technology crucial to daily clinical image operations and especially to image related basic and clinical zzso During the past 10 years the zzso has been matured from a research and zzso stage into commercial products which are provided by all major zzso and health care equipment zzso The zzso originally implemented in the zzso Department, needs to grow and has already carried well beyond zzso limits conquering all image relevant areas inside the zzso During the past 10 years a dramatic development in imaging techniques especially within zzso zzso Advanced zzso and zzso imaging techniques result in much more images and more complex data objects than ever before which need to be implemented into the existing zzso These new imaging techniques require intensive zzso apart from the imaging zzso which need to be integrated into the image zzso and the zzso zzso Along with these new imaging techniques new clinical applications, zzso stroke zzso and research applications, zzso study of heart and brain function, in zzso and zzso require changes to the traditional zzso zzso Therefore zzso image distribution will become the high-water mark for the next 10 years in the zzso zzso This paper focuses on one new advanced imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and discusses how zzso data is zzso what zzso requires in terms of clinical and research applications and how to implement zzso in the existing zzso
