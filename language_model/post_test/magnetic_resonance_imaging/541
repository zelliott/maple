The zzso mechanism of hearing loss in patients with zzso zzso zzso remains zzso Our aim was to determine the zzso and clinical parameters that might be related to zzso The zzso images and charts of 99 patients were zzso Image processing software was used to zzso the zzso tumor diameter in three zzso its zzso its extension zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso and length of the zzso tumor portion, its shape and zzso and the zzso zzso These parameters were correlated with the patient's zzso hearing zzso The degree of hearing correlated significantly with the tumor size, volume and zzso diameter, the degree of zzso tumor growth, and the distance between the lateral tumor end and the zzso zzso zzso zzso No correlation was found regarding tumor extension, shape and consistency, the presence of zzso or the extent of erosion of the internal auditory zzso Loss of hearing in the VS appears to be zzso zzso the zzso parameters related to the hearing level can help to clarify the zzso mechanisms zzso
