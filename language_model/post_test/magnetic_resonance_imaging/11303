The present study zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and the influence of zzso on pulmonary magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging using zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso fast zzso sequence compared with three-dimensional zzso fast zzso zzso zzso Dynamic studies were performed in 16 zzso MR zzso images were interpreted by two independent observers using zzso zzso as the reference zzso The patients were divided into two groups according to the duration of holding the breath measured during MR zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso MR zzso imaging in detecting zzso defects were zzso and zzso respectively, while those of zzso MR zzso imaging were zzso and zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy of zzso MR zzso imaging was significantly higher than that of zzso MR zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso among those who could not hold their zzso zzso zzso MR zzso imaging offers promise for evaluating pulmonary zzso even among patients who cannot hold their zzso
