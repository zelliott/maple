To use magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure the diameter along the course of the zzso zzso nerve in living subjects and zzso zzso and to validate zzso zzso in the same zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso nerve were made in 23 living human subjects and in three zzso orbits using zzso surface zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso orbits were then serially zzso in the same plane, and stained by zzso zzso for digital zzso of nerve diameter and zzso of zzso tissue zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso nerve dimensions were in close quantitative agreement, showing significant decrease in the average zzso nerve diameter along its zzso zzso This finding was confirmed by zzso in living subjects, with average zzso nerve diameter declining from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso just zzso to the globe, to zzso zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso further to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Color zzso demonstrated a consistent zzso area of nervous zzso but decreasing amounts of collagen zzso 

There is a significant decrease in normal zzso nerve diameter along its length in normal subjects, reflecting reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a valid and sensitive method of detecting subtle changes in zzso zzso nerve size and can be useful in the investigation of structural zzso nerve zzso zzso nerve diameters must be measured, however, at similar distances zzso to the globe to allow meaningful zzso
