To evaluate the effectiveness of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso relaxation agent and to follow its distribution for in zzso zzso gel infusions and in zzso infusions in rat zzso 

The animal study was approved by the animal care and use zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso units, and the carbon cage was zzso to provide improved water zzso and zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of water solutions of this contrast agent were conducted at zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso Images of contrast agent zzso were produced following infusions in six zzso gel samples at zzso T and from direct brain infusions into normal and zzso rat brain at zzso zzso The zzso of a control zzso zzso agent, zzso was also zzso 

Water hydrogen MR imaging zzso zzso for this zzso zzso was markedly higher than that for commercial agents zzso zzso zzso values of 102, zzso and 32 L zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In studies of in zzso zzso gel infusion, the use of zzso zzso at zzso an order of magnitude lower resulted in equivalent zzso in comparison with commercial zzso zzso contrast enhancement was obtained with direct infusions of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in live normal rat zzso zzso studies demonstrated lower diffusion rates for zzso relative to zzso in live normal rat brain zzso zzso zzso directly infused into a zzso brain provided an improved tumor zzso in comparison with the zzso injected conventional zzso zzso A control zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited very low MR imaging zzso 

The new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso species zzso is an effective zzso relaxation agent, as demonstrated with in zzso zzso and MR imaging studies, in infusion experiments with zzso gel and in zzso rat brain studies simulating clinical conditions of direct zzso drug delivery for the treatment of brain zzso
