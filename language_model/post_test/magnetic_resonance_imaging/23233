To investigate the zzso technique for MR imaging of the fetal heart in a sheep zzso 

MR images of 6 fetal sheep heart were obtained at zzso zzso For zzso zzso of the fetal heart a zzso zzso in short zzso two and four chamber view was zzso zzso images were compared with real cardiac triggered MR images zzso zzso zzso of the fetal heart was performed using both techniques zzso Image quality was assessed and the left zzso volume and function were measured and zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso the zzso technique produced slightly inferior images with zzso Especially the zzso zzso could not be so clearly zzso The contraction of the fetal heart was shown in zzso sequences in both zzso The average blood volumes could be measured with both techniques with no significant difference: at zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso with ejection zzso at zzso respectively zzso 

Both zzso and zzso triggered cardiac zzso of the fetal heart allowed the evaluation of anatomical structures and functional zzso Images obtained by zzso technique were slightly inferior than the zzso triggered zzso
