zzso is a disorder of zzso development resulting in structurally abnormal cerebral zzso characterized by zzso and abnormal zzso of the cerebral zzso zzso is frequently associated with severe zzso deficits including intellectual zzso motor problems, and zzso There are acquired and genetic causes of zzso but most patients with a presumed genetic zzso lack a specific zzso Here we report using zzso sequencing to identify compound zzso zzso in the zzso repeat domain 62 zzso gene as the cause of zzso zzso in a sibling zzso zzso sequencing confirmed that the siblings both inherited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which predict premature zzso of zzso a protein that has a role in early cortical zzso The zzso are from a zzso family of Northern European zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso due to compound zzso zzso of zzso might be a relatively common cause of zzso in the zzso Further studies to identify zzso frequency in the population are zzso
