To zzso evaluate the early development of regional liver function after right portal vein zzso zzso with zzso zzso in patients scheduled for extended right zzso 

Ten patients who received a zzso before an extended zzso were examined before and zzso after zzso using zzso zzso of the zzso In these sequences representative region of interest zzso were performed in the zzso right zzso and the zzso left liver lobe zzso The volume as well as zzso zzso index zzso was calculated independently for each zzso 

Relative enhancement zzso after zzso decreased in the zzso and increased significantly in the zzso zzso Average zzso zzso index zzso for zzso was significantly lower zzso after zzso than before zzso zzso and significantly higher for zzso zzso 

A significant shift of contrast zzso from the right to the left liver lobe can be depicted as early as zzso after right zzso by using zzso zzso which could reflect the redirected portal zzso blood flow and the rapid zzso of a zzso functional zzso 

zzso zzso portal vein zzso zzso is widely performed before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases intravenous contrast medium zzso in the left lobe of zzso zzso The zzso zzso index for the left liver lobe increases rapidly after zzso zzso Left liver lobe function increase may be zzso by zzso zzso
