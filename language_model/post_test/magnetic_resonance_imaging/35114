The anatomical segregation of executive control processes within the prefrontal zzso remains poorly zzso The present study focused on strategy zzso on two working memory tasks: the zzso spatial working memory task and a zzso sequence generation zzso These measures were administered to a group of frontal zzso patients and a comparison group of healthy zzso zzso patients with damage to the right inferior frontal zzso were impaired on the zzso spatial working memory task, compared with healthy controls and patients without damage to this zzso This deficit was most strongly related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and was accompanied by poor strategy zzso On the sequence generation task, frontal zzso patients were impaired on a zzso phase when the working memory demands of the task were reduced, but had relatively intact performance on other zzso of the zzso Performance on the training phase was correlated with the amount of damage to the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso These results support theoretical notions of prefrontal cortical function that zzso its contribution to executive processes such as zzso strategies and monitoring over its role as a short-term memory zzso Moreover, we provide evidence for the first time that such functions are dependent on zzso brain regions within the prefrontal zzso
