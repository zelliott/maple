zzso resonance imaging zzso studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia have thinner brain zzso compared with healthy control zzso zzso is vulnerable to zzso complications zzso such as zzso and birth zzso factors that are also related to increased risk of developing zzso With the hypothesis that zzso might explain the thinner zzso found in zzso we studied patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls subjects for association between number and severity of zzso and variation in cortical zzso 

zzso scans of 54 adults with schizophrenia or zzso disorder and 54 healthy controls were acquired at zzso zzso Stockholm, zzso zzso of brain cortical thickness were obtained using automated computer processing zzso zzso were assessed from zzso records and scored blindly according to the zzso zzso At numerous cortical locations, putative effects of zzso on cortical thickness variation were tested for each zzso for zzso for composite OC scores, severe OC scores, and zzso scores among patients and controls zzso 

Number and severity of zzso varied among both patient and control subjects but were not associated with cortical thickness in either of the zzso Patients demonstrated thinner brain zzso but there were no significant differences in number and severity of OC scores across zzso 

In the present study, number and severity of zzso complications were not associated with brain cortical zzso in patients with schizophrenia or in healthy control zzso The thinner brain zzso found in patients with schizophrenia were not explained by a history of zzso
