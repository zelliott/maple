The aim of our work was to determine the efficacy of zzso inversion recovery spin echo zzso pulse sequences in zzso patients with normal and abnormal zzso Twenty neurological normal children zzso 5 months to 12 zzso as well as 65 children presenting clinically with zzso zzso deficits zzso 2 months to 10 zzso were examined using zzso zzso SE, and zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso zzso zzso between zzso white and gray matter was compared for the different pulse zzso In addition, two readers analyzed all images zzso by zzso The zzso values were significantly higher on zzso images as compared with conventional images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormal patients displayed a normal zzso on all zzso whereas 23 showed an abnormal zzso The zzso sequence provided a sensitive and specific depiction of an abnormal zzso in all of these zzso The zzso sequence provided additional information to conventional pulse sequences in determining zzso disorders in children, especially in children older than 2 zzso
