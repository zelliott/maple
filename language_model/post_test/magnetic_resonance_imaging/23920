In this paper we address the problem of finding corresponding points in a reference and its subsequent image with the aim of registering the zzso A zzso automatic zzso for zzso point pairs from zzso zzso medical images has been zzso The properties of point zzso point pair zzso and point pair consistency have been incorporated into the steps which lead to the automatic extraction and weighting of point zzso The selection of the most distinctive points of the reference image, and the search for their corresponding points in the subsequent image, have two things in zzso First, the local operator by which the distinctive points are selected mimics the template matching used to find the corresponding zzso Second, the same similarity measure is used for both zzso We have applied the zzso to a variety of computer-generated and real medical images, and have both zzso and zzso evaluated its zzso The results show that the proposed automatic zzso for point extraction is accurate and robust and that it may significantly improve on the zzso zzso and speed of the manual extraction of corresponding zzso
