The purpose of this work was to develop magnetic resonance zzso zzso for the fast and zzso measurement of zzso averaged zzso zzso of living human zzso The technique was based on a zzso echo zzso imaging zzso Motion zzso was zzso to the image plane and synchronized to zzso zzso zzso at driving zzso of 25 and 50 zzso induced by a zzso zzso Ten zzso zzso wave images were recorded within 60 s and analyzed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Six healthy volunteers (six zzso mean age zzso years; age range zzso zzso underwent zzso follow-up zzso studies over a period of 6 zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Pas for 25 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Pas for 50 zzso respectively zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso range of zzso zzso data was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The observed zzso zzso indicates a limited zzso of zzso model to explain zzso behavior of brain zzso within the applied frequency zzso The narrow distribution of data within small confidence intervals demonstrates excellent zzso of the experimental zzso The results are necessary as reference data for future comparisons between healthy and pathological human brain zzso zzso
