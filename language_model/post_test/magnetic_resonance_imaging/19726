MR imaging has played an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of zzso disease zzso since zzso zzso abnormalities on zzso images have been zzso thus, the aim of our study was to compare the value of different MR images in the diagnosis of zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with zzso underwent MR imaging zzso zzso patients were zzso confirmed, and 65 were clinically classified as having zzso through the zzso Surveillance Unit zzso of zzso There was no standardized MR imaging zzso thus, the examinations included 143 zzso 43 zzso zzso zzso 84 zzso inversion recovery zzso and 44 zzso images zzso The MR images were reviewed for zzso changes of the zzso zzso thalamus, and cerebral zzso 

zzso abnormalities were present in 70 patients zzso and were visible in zzso zzso of all available zzso zzso The zzso zzso were affected in 94 patients zzso in particular in the zzso zzso the most sensitive sequences were zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso involvement was more frequently diagnosed on zzso images zzso and zzso zzso than on zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso images and zzso showed better results in the diagnosis of signal intensity changes in the zzso zzso compared with zzso or zzso zzso however, in the diagnosis of cortical changes, zzso was clearly zzso Our data suggest that zzso is the most sensitive MR imaging technique in the diagnosis of zzso
