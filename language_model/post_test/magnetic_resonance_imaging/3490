zzso zzso was recently identified as an zzso contrast agent for the detection and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because this product displays a broad spectrum affinity for the zzso family, we hypothesized that it may also recognize other zzso zzso in vulnerable zzso zzso zzso this study aimed at zzso at the molecular and cellular level, the interactions between zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to measure the in zzso affinity of zzso toward zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neutral zzso zzso and both zzso A and N zzso and zzso Using similar zzso zzso associated with specific zzso zzso activities were measured in vulnerable and stable plaques collected from human zzso carotid zzso zzso zzso affinity of zzso for zzso in vulnerable zzso was subsequently zzso zzso between zzso and major cell types present in zzso plaques was also investigated in different cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso and human zzso vein zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting of zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Potential application of zzso for detecting zzso plaques by in zzso zzso was tested in a rabbit model of zzso In zzso zzso displayed affinities for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso exhibited higher activities in vulnerable plaques from human zzso carotid samples, as compared to stable zzso zzso zzso and zzso had either no activity or the same low activity in both vulnerable and stable zzso zzso showed zzso affinities for zzso zzso and zzso zzso by plaque zzso Moreover, zzso bound to zzso zzso and zzso foam cells in a zzso manner and with a higher intensity than the control contrast agents zzso or zzso zzso coupled to a scrambled zzso In zzso zzso zzso inhibited largely zzso and almost completely zzso zzso and zzso activities, respectively, which strongly suggested an zzso and zzso binding of zzso to these zzso This zzso binding was confirmed with in zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso value of zzso cells decreased from zzso s zzso zzso zzso to zzso s zzso with 1 zzso of zzso In addition, the zzso content measured by zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when cells were incubated in the presence of zzso and only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the control product zzso The difference of zzso concentration between both contrast agents corresponded to a specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso which may be detected by zzso MR imaging in the zzso rabbit model showed enhancement of the zzso wall after zzso injection with a significant increase of zzso values from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso (after zzso demonstrating the efficacy of the contrast agent to detect the zzso plaques in zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso may be an interesting contrast agent for in zzso molecular MR imaging of zzso zzso and zzso activities present in vulnerable zzso zzso
