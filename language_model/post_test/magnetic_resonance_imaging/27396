Current theories of the zzso of zzso spectrum disorders zzso have focused on abnormal zzso coordination of neural activity in cortical circuits as a core impairment of the zzso In the current study, we examined the possibility that zzso activity may be zzso involved in zzso brain functioning in zzso zzso zzso data were recorded from 13 adult human participants with zzso and 16 controls during the presentation of zzso zzso zzso data were analyzed in the zzso zzso frequency range and a zzso approach was used to identify the sources of spectral zzso Participants with zzso showed elevated reaction times and reduced detection rates during the perception of upright zzso faces, while responses to zzso stimuli were in the normal zzso zzso zzso organization in the zzso group was accompanied by a reduction in both the zzso and phase zzso of zzso zzso A zzso approach identified distinct networks during zzso organization in controls and participants with zzso In controls, zzso organization of zzso faces involved increased zzso zzso activity in a zzso network, while in the zzso group stronger zzso was found in visual zzso These findings highlight the contribution of impaired zzso activity toward complex visual processing in zzso suggesting zzso zzso of zzso power in zzso zzso
