zzso for zzso relaxation and diffusion zzso based on magnetic resonance signals from zzso zzso zzso are zzso The methods involve optimum use of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso The necessary theoretical framework for the methods is developed, and then the methods are applied to measure the zzso relaxation constant, zzso and the zzso constant, D, of zzso zzso In a cell containing natural abundance zzso at 790 zzso the zzso value was determined to be 155 zzso 5 zzso at 20 degrees C and at zzso T zzso For a second cell at zzso zzso at the same field and temperature, the zzso value was determined to be 66 zzso 2 zzso At a higher field of zzso zzso the zzso values for the two cells were found to be 185 zzso 10 and 88 zzso 5 zzso zzso The zzso zzso constant for the first cell was measured to be zzso zzso s and for the second cell it was zzso zzso The methods were applied to zzso in the gas phase, in zzso however, they are, in principle, zzso for in zzso or ex zzso zzso The potential role of these methods in the development of newly emerging zzso zzso zzso applications is zzso
