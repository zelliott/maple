zzso zzso are made of different materials, which can affect the zzso magnetic imaging zzso zzso zzso artifacts especially for metallic implants can decrease the image zzso This study aimed to determine whether zzso as a lightweight and zzso metal is suitable as a zzso for spinal implants based on its zzso zzso zzso 

To compare zzso behaviors, we implanted into one zzso zzso spine different test zzso made of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All test zzso were scanned using two zzso zzso zzso The artifact dimensions were traced on all scans and statistically zzso 

The total artifact volume and median artifact area of the titanium zzso were statistically significantly larger than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso and zzso zzso produced almost identical zzso behaviors zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that spinal implants made with zzso zzso will behave more like zzso devices in zzso zzso Given its zzso potential as a metal, implant zzso made with zzso would combine the advantages to the two principal zzso materials currently used but without their limitations, at least in terms of zzso zzso
