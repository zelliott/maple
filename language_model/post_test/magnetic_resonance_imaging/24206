This study has investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso transfer followed by zzso treatment as zzso gene therapy to surgical zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso The study was open and zzso and aimed at assessing the feasibility and safety of the technique and indications of zzso zzso In 48 patients a suspension of zzso zzso cells zzso was administered by zzso injection immediately after tumor zzso zzso zzso was infused daily 14 to 27 days after zzso Patients were monitored for adverse events and for life by regular zzso zzso zzso changes were monitored by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso during injection was a frequent occurrence but serious adverse events during the treatment period zzso zzso were few and of a nature not unexpected in this zzso One patient experienced transient neurological disorders associated with zzso zzso zzso There was no evidence of zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso or in tissue samples of zzso or zzso zzso DNA was shown in the zzso of some patients but not in autopsy zzso zzso The median survival time was zzso months, and the 12-month survival rate was 13 of 48 zzso On zzso studies, tumor recurrence was absent in seven patients for at least 6 months and for at least 12 months in two patients, one of whom remains recurrence free at more than 24 zzso zzso images of injection tracks and zzso zzso were zzso In conclusion, the gene therapy is feasible and appears to be zzso safe as an zzso to the surgical zzso of zzso zzso but any benefit appears to be zzso Investigation of the precise effectiveness of this gene therapy requires zzso controlled zzso
