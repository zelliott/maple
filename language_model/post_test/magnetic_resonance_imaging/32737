A common imaging finding in brain zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso The features of this zzso rim on zzso have not been previously zzso to our zzso We aimed to differentiate zzso from zzso by assessing the zzso of their zzso margin by using zzso 

zzso and zzso were performed in 12 zzso and 20 zzso zzso On zzso and zzso the prevalence and the border types zzso versus zzso of zzso rims were zzso zzso On zzso the zzso zzso versus zzso and the location of zzso rims relative to the zzso rims as well as the prevalence of the zzso rim zzso defined as 2 concentric rims at zzso margins with the outer one being zzso and the inner one zzso relative to cavity zzso were also zzso 

zzso and the border types of the zzso rims on zzso were not different between zzso and zzso On zzso there were significantly more zzso rims that were complete zzso zzso zzso and smooth zzso zzso zzso having the same location as the zzso rims zzso zzso zzso for zzso A dual rim sign was present in 9 of 12 zzso but absent in all zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may be helpful in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The dual rim sign is the most specific imaging feature distinguishing the zzso
