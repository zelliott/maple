We present a general theoretical framework suitable for an zzso but rigorous, analysis of the zzso and zzso data of zzso metal zzso This framework is based on the so-called zzso method that properly accounts for the fluctuations of the zzso zzso splitting zzso and avoids the zzso of experimental data, which occurs with the Solomon, zzso and Morgan zzso zzso and may lead to erroneous zzso The zzso of the zzso approximation is zzso Our approach is implemented in the case of a new zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designed to obtain zzso complexes of enhanced stability in comparison to natural zzso The introduction of zzso units on the six residual zzso groups of an zzso zzso leads to zzso and zzso zzso complexes with log zzso approximately zzso zzso The zzso complex zzso large water zzso zzso in zzso M zzso zzso zzso The molecular parameters governing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso above 1 T are obtained through simple zzso theoretical expressions and complementary experimental zzso The metal zzso state, the zzso diffusion zzso of the complex, and its zzso correlation time are derived from zzso lifetime studies, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation, zzso The high zzso induced by the zzso complex is attributed to its high zzso state in the presence of zzso zzso and to a zzso correlation time zzso by the zzso character of the zzso zzso
