The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging zzso performed using a zzso MR system in detecting zzso of the rotator cuff and zzso zzso This retrospective study compared the MR results obtained in 47 patients that underwent zzso using a zzso zzso MR system zzso to the surgical zzso MR images of the shoulder were obtained as zzso shoulder zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso short zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The MR examinations were interpreted by three highly zzso musculoskeletal zzso Open surgical (N zzso 26) or zzso (N zzso zzso procedures were performed within a mean time of 33 days after zzso The surgical findings revealed rotator cuff tears in 28 patients and zzso zzso in 9 zzso For the rotator cuff tears, the sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the zzso zzso the sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The findings indicated that there was good agreement comparing the MR results obtained using the zzso zzso MR system to the surgical findings for determination of zzso of the rotator cuff and zzso zzso zzso the statistical values determined for the use of this MR system were comparable to those reported in the zzso literature for the use of zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso
