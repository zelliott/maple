zzso functional outcome following surgery performed for spinal zzso zzso is still a considerable zzso Recent zzso though, strongly suggest that with serial zzso of serum zzso this might be possible in patients with zzso spinal zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether this potential significance of zzso applies as well to patients with zzso cervical zzso A further purpose was to assess the value of zzso in this regard, another zzso marker widely used to monitor cerebral zzso 

Fifty-one patients were included in this prospective zzso zzso was considered as zzso in case of neurological improvement with preservation or retrieval of walking ability, whereas zzso without restoration of gait function was regarded as zzso The zzso levels of zzso and zzso were correlated with the degree of zzso duration of symptoms, and presence of zzso high signal zzso on zzso The zzso values of both markers were correlated with zzso 

The zzso levels of zzso were neither correlated with degree or duration of zzso nor with zzso In case of an uncomplicated course the zzso levels of zzso were also not correlated with zzso In complicated courses with acute zzso deterioration normal values on the 3rd day after the event were associated with a zzso outcome, whereas one patient with zzso outcome showed a persistent pathological zzso The serum levels of zzso were not correlated with clinical parameters or with outcome in any of the zzso 

zzso zzso serum zzso do not permit prediction of functional outcome in patients with zzso cervical zzso in case of an uncomplicated zzso zzso In complicated courses with zzso zzso such zzso reflect zzso events with possibly zzso zzso zzso does not have any significance in these patients with chronic zzso of the spinal zzso
