zzso and a high zzso signal of the zzso are known to be the principal MR imaging findings of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not individual zzso findings correlate with surgical outcome in patients with this zzso 

zzso MR imaging findings in 57 consecutive patients with zzso zzso sclerosis who underwent anterior zzso zzso and were zzso for 24 months or more were zzso zzso and the results were compared with the zzso outcome zzso zzso The MR images included routine zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fast zzso images obtained on either a zzso T or zzso T zzso The images were visually evaluated by two zzso blinded to the zzso their focus was the presence or absence of zzso and a high zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was seen in zzso of cases zzso zzso zzso of the good outcome group zzso class I and zzso and 50% zzso of the poor outcome group zzso III and zzso A high zzso zzso signal was seen in zzso of cases zzso zzso zzso of the good outcome group and 50% zzso of the poor outcome zzso All 35 patients with a high zzso signal had zzso zzso zzso zzso as revealed by MR imaging, occurred in zzso of patients zzso both of whom showed a poor outcome zzso class zzso The presence or absence of zzso zzso correlated well with surgical outcome zzso High zzso signal intensity did not, however, significantly correlate with surgical outcome zzso 

Compared with a high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is more common and zzso better with surgical zzso For the prediction of this, it thus appears to be the more useful zzso
