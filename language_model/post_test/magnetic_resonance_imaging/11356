We show that magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be used to zzso the amount of muscle in the lower legs of adult rats and to zzso monitor the onset and progression of zzso zzso Muscle zzso areas determined from zzso zzso MR images allow zzso zzso of the protective effects of a zzso zzso zzso We also show that the zzso of zzso efficacy is improved by zzso of the muscle zzso Rapid animal zzso and the ability to accurately estimate efficacy make zzso an attractive technology for studying skeletal muscle zzso and zzso allowing the evaluation of potential therapies in zzso zzso
