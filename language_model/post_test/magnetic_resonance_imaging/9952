The field of mouse zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso is rapidly growing, motivated by the need for improved tools for characterizing and evaluating mouse models of human zzso zzso is an excellent zzso for investigating genetically altered zzso It is capable of whole brain coverage, can be used in zzso and provides multiple contrast mechanisms for investigating different aspects of zzso and zzso The advent of zzso scanners along with the ability to scan multiple mice simultaneously allows for rapid zzso of novel zzso zzso mouse zzso studies require attention to many aspects of experiment zzso In this article, we will describe general methods to acquire quality images for mouse zzso using a system that images mice zzso in zzso zzso radio frequency zzso coils in a common magnet zzso et zzso zzso We focus particularly on anatomical zzso an important and accessible application that has shown a high potential for impact in many mouse models at our imaging zzso Before we can provide the detailed steps to acquire such images, there are important practical considerations for both in zzso brain imaging zzso et zzso 2004) and ex zzso brain imaging zzso et zzso 2007) that should be zzso These are discussed zzso
