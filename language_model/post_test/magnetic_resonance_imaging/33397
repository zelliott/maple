The purpose of this study was to determine if a consistent relationship exists between zzso flow in the portal vein and superior zzso vein and zzso flow in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso methods were used to determine zzso flow in the zzso zzso superior zzso artery, portal zzso and superior zzso vein in 11 healthy zzso 

The mean zzso zzso zzso flow rates in the zzso zzso superior zzso artery, superior zzso zzso and portal vein were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso A strong correlation was found between measured zzso zzso blood flow, defined as the sum of flow in the zzso axis and the superior zzso artery, and portal zzso flow zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Good agreement was found between flow in the superior zzso artery and that in the superior zzso vein zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso bias zzso 20 zzso 

There is a consistent relationship between MR zzso of flow in the portal or superior zzso vein and the measured flow in the arteries zzso those zzso zzso in the superior zzso vein is an accurate predictor of flow in the superior zzso zzso
