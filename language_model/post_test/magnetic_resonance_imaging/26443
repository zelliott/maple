A retrospective study of 36 patients with zzso to lower cervical spinal zzso injury zzso divided into two groups based on whether delayed zzso zzso 

To determine zzso risk factors associated with the development of delayed zzso in zzso to lower cervical spinal zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso to lower cervical spinal zzso injury are generally at lower risk of developing respiratory failure than those with high cervical spinal zzso zzso Respiratory failure zzso as sudden zzso may occur days or even weeks after injury without any pulmonary complications in such zzso 

An index group of eight patients with complete zzso to lower cervical spinal zzso injury in whom delayed catastrophic zzso occurred were zzso Another group of 28 patients with cervical spinal zzso injury of identical magnitude and presentation but without respiratory failure served as the control zzso Six parameters presumed to be related to the delayed zzso were zzso 

The extent of zzso zzso was significantly different, being diffuse in most of the index patients, but focal in the majority of the control patients zzso zzso of the C4 segment of zzso appeared to be more frequent in the index zzso however, the difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso The zzso of transient zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the index group was significantly higher than in the control zzso zzso zzso was a much rarer event and found to be unrelated to the occurrence of zzso In five of the eight index patients, the zzso occurred during zzso Six of the eight index patients died of zzso 

Delayed but devastating zzso may develop in patients with zzso to lower cervical cervical spinal zzso injury, even when they are clinically stable and free from any pulmonary zzso The presence of zzso extensive zzso zzso respiratory distress, or zzso with or without associated zzso however transient and zzso should be regarded as warning zzso Sleep was found to be a risky period of zzso
