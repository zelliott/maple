In various medical fields vascular structures have to be examined with usually two-dimensional views which present imaging techniques zzso The interpretation of the data can be supported by zzso zzso zzso The further analysis requires often the zzso of the particular functional or anatomical zzso To attribute these zzso we developed two different zzso zzso In the first one the shape of the structures is zzso with zzso achieving very fast response times, most notably during the zzso The second strategy, the direct rendering of the volume, benefits from the accurate reproduction of the vascular zzso Although the rendering needs much more time, the strategy provides similar response times for the zzso Thus, the strategies complement one zzso
