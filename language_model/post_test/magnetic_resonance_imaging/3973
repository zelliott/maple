This study was carried out to assess the zzso differences between pain-free control subjects and patients with low back pain, either with or without disc zzso or zzso 

To analyze various zzso in human zzso fluid using zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The potential use of this technique as an additional tool for diagnostic assessment was also zzso 

zzso is thought to play a major role in the generation of zzso spine pain, a theory supported both by animal and in zzso zzso The effect of the inflammation in terms of increased metabolism has not yet been zzso 

zzso fluid was obtained from patients by zzso zzso frozen, zzso and analyzed for zzso by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso lower values for several key zzso were found in patients with low back pain or zzso with the lowest values in the zzso of patients with zzso signs of disc zzso or zzso 

The results indicate a higher level of zzso activity in patients with low back pain or zzso compared with pain-free control subjects, with this difference being most pronounced in the zzso of patients with zzso evidence of disc zzso or zzso
