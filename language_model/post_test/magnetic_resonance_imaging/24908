To assess the effect of zzso on zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and single kidney zzso zzso zzso rate zzso using dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso patients undergoing zzso zzso of a solitary zzso between August 2010 and November 2011 were evaluated with zzso immediately before and 1 month zzso zzso data were acquired with zzso zzso resolution in a zzso plane during the first pass of a zzso zzso dose of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was estimated using a maximum slope zzso An index of SK zzso zzso was assessed using data acquired every 30 s for the following zzso in the zzso plane and zzso using zzso zzso This was compared to the zzso estimated by zzso clearance zzso 

zzso in the zone of zzso decreased significantly zzso from a mean of zzso zzso to zzso zzso a mean decrease of zzso zzso analysis was performed in zzso zzso zzso was underestimated by zzso which decreased significantly in zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

It is feasible to measure zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso The significant decrease within the zone of zzso suggests that this technique may be useful for assessment of treatment zzso Further work is required to address the zzso of zzso by zzso and to validate the zzso zzso
