To describe clinical and zzso features of patients with a disease suggestive of zzso inflammation after zzso B zzso 

Eight patients with confirmed zzso inflammation occurring less than 10 weeks after zzso B vaccination are zzso They received follow-up clinically and on zzso for a mean period of 18 zzso 

Clinical and zzso findings were compatible with acute zzso zzso However, clinical zzso repeated zzso or both showed the persistence of inflammatory activity, which makes this encephalitis more suggestive of zzso than of acute zzso zzso 

The persistent inflammatory activity observed clinically and on zzso in these patients is comparable with that usually observed in zzso zzso studies are currently testing the hypothesis of a triggering role of zzso B vaccination in zzso zzso
