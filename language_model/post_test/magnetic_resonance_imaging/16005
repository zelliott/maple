zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso is a zzso disorder due to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso the zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso The typical presentation is severe zzso and zzso and zzso is often discovered later or zzso 

We sought to determine the genetic basis for severe zzso and zzso in an adolescent male with elevated serum levels of zzso but normal serum levels of calcium and zzso 

We used zzso to analyze the zzso gene in the zzso and members of his zzso 

The zzso was a compound zzso for two zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso in zzso 6 that results in replacement of zzso at position 182 by zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 7 that results in replacement of zzso at position 192 by zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were inherited from the mother and father, respectively, both of whom had zzso A clinically unaffected brother was zzso for zzso 

We report a novel zzso in the zzso gene in a patient with an unusual presentation of zzso This report emphasizes that moderate and severe zzso can be manifestations of zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso respectively, providing further evidence for a gene dosage effect in determining the zzso zzso may be an zzso condition that can zzso as idiopathic zzso or zzso
