To facilitate understanding of zzso lobe anatomy by showing zzso transformations of the zzso surface of the cerebral zzso 

zzso from fetal specimens ranging from 13 to 24 weeks of zzso age were zzso Photographs were made of the zzso surface of the cerebral zzso MR images of different fetal specimens of similar age were made for comparison of MR anatomy with dissected zzso 

At 13 weeks, the entire inner zzso arch of the zzso formation is visible on the zzso surface of the cerebral zzso The zzso zzso extends from frontal lobe to zzso zzso At 16 weeks, the outer zzso zzso arch of the zzso area, zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso Growth of the corpus zzso is associated with reduction in size of the zzso formation in the frontal zzso The zzso of the corpus zzso is the remnant of the anterior part of the zzso zzso At 18 weeks, growth of the zzso zzso begins to conceal the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso hidden from view by the corpus zzso and the zzso zzso are remnants of the previously larger zzso zzso 

Analysis of fetal specimens in different zzso stages with dissection and MR provides insight into zzso transformations responsible for the complex anatomy of the zzso zzso
