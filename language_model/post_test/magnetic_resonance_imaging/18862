With the new computer aided surgery techniques a surgery can be split in two zzso which are zzso planning and zzso The planning is frequently based on three zzso image data and takes place in the office of the zzso Using this approach the surgical feeling, the physical feedback of the patient, is not available during the planning zzso However, this feedback yields information, which is helpful or necessary for the zzso This lack of information can be compensated by a simulation zzso which simulates zzso data from image volume zzso To develop such a module first both image volume data and zzso data have to be captured from a wide range of zzso In this work a new approach for zzso analysis of the knee is presented which yields an accuracy which is necessary for such zzso Because the analysis has to be done for many patients the degree of zzso is zzso This zzso and non invasive approach is based on external zzso anatomical skin zzso video sequences and computer zzso zzso tracking of zzso and zzso for any motion pattern is zzso Because the individual zzso structures extracted from the zzso are zzso an analysis of any point or coordinate system can be done later using the originally captured zzso This gives a new degree of freedom for zzso
