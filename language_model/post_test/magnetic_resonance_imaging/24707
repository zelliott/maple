To determine the reliable zzso parameters in dynamic zzso zzso zzso for the monitoring zzso treatment in zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso zzso were treated with either saline zzso zzso 3) or zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso Before zzso zzso and after zzso 2, 8, 15, 25) treatment, zzso examinations using correlations of zzso parameters zzso zzso and zzso from two compartment zzso time to peak, initial slope and % enhancement from zzso curve zzso were zzso 

zzso growth rate was found to be zzso zzso 28 in control group, zzso zzso 11 in four mice with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 15 in four with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and initial slope zzso zzso zzso showed strong positive correlation to the initial tumor volume zzso zzso zzso In control mice, tumor zzso group and growth zzso group animals, zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso and initial slope zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significant correlation with tumor volume zzso zzso zzso In four mice with tumor zzso zzso and initial slope increased zzso or greater at earlier zzso zzso 2) than or same periods zzso zzso 2) to when the tumor started to zzso with zzso or greater growth zzso 

zzso and initial slope may a reliable parameters for monitoring the response of zzso zzso
