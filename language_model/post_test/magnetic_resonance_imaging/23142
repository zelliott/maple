zzso zzso projections from the zzso zzso to frontal brain areas and the dense distribution of zzso and zzso sites in prefrontal and sensory regions support the idea that zzso exerts influence on cognitive zzso Indeed, growing evidence suggests zzso to be an important factor in learning and zzso however, its precise role in executive processes particularly in voluntary attention is less zzso zzso zzso studies showed the zzso potential to predict zzso attention allocation and implicated the auditory zzso in central zzso zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso revealed zzso sources in the primary auditory zzso and in the anterior zzso In the present study, zzso variation of the zzso zzso potential was investigated on 72 healthy subjects while performing an auditory novelty oddball paradigm to tap zzso and bottom-up attention zzso zzso zzso effects on voluntary attention were analyzed using zzso zzso of a functional zzso zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso a key regulator of zzso zzso Because mental effort has been related to zzso attention and zzso zzso a measure of stable individual differences in cognitive effort was zzso The main result was a strong interaction of zzso and cognitive effort on target zzso zzso Greater zzso attention allocation was evident in those carriers of the zzso zzso who described themselves as being more engaged in zzso zzso We suggest that the observed interaction mirrors the interplay between zzso zzso attention by the zzso and zzso adjustment on zzso zzso
