This protocol presents an improved method for zzso imaging based on zzso techniques, applied to the zzso of zzso in small animal zzso Three types of zzso with zzso zzso adapted to special requirements for the imaging of the brain of mice and rats and to full body imaging in mice are employed in the zzso A conventional zzso zzso zzso system was upgraded with zzso supports and zzso onto the zzso zzso were zzso The system was employed for the assessment of the zzso of zzso and zzso well known zzso of zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regarding the applied zzso are reported, as well as further conditions determining the effectiveness of the detection of the zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso in mice required only zzso of the activity described in previous zzso Dynamic zzso are zzso with a time resolution as high as 10 zzso in the brain of zzso Due to the lower signal intensity obtained for mice, the time resolution was zzso for zzso with a ratio zzso of zzso and 17 zzso for zzso with the ratio zzso of zzso zzso
