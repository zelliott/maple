In humans, zzso band zzso zzso power typically increases when performing cognitively demanding working memory zzso tasks, and simultaneous zzso recordings have revealed an inverse relationship between zzso power and the zzso zzso oxygen level zzso signal in the default mode network during zzso However, synchronization also plays a fundamental role in cognitive processing, and the level of zzso and higher frequency band synchronization is modulated during zzso Yet, little is known about the link between zzso zzso power, and zzso synchronization during zzso and how these measures develop with human brain maturation or relate to behavioral zzso We examined zzso signal correlations from 18 young adults and 15 zzso children for zzso effects during a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso load zzso zzso zzso power was significantly enhanced in children compared to adults, while adults showed stronger zzso load zzso Children demonstrated a stronger negative correlation between global zzso power and the zzso signal in the default mode network relative to zzso zzso we conclude that zzso power mediates the suppression of a zzso zzso We further conclude that children suppress this network even more than adults, probably from an increased level of zzso to compensate for not fully mature cognitive functions, reflected in lower response accuracy and increased reaction zzso In contrast to power, correlations between instantaneous zzso global field synchronization and the zzso signal were exclusively positive in both age groups but only significant in adults in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso synchronization was weaker in children and zzso contrast to zzso zzso correlated with response accuracy in both age zzso In summary we conclude that zzso zzso signal correlations differ between spectral power and synchronization and that these opposite correlations with different zzso undergo similar and significant zzso developments with brain zzso
