zzso binge drink more than any other age group, increasing risk of zzso the development of the frontal zzso We hypothesized that adolescent binge drinking would lead to persistent zzso in zzso In this study, we modeled adolescent weekend zzso zzso using adolescent mice zzso days zzso zzso The adolescent intermittent binge ethanol zzso treatment includes 6 binge zzso doses of ethanol in an intermittent pattern across zzso zzso were conducted in adulthood following extended zzso to determine if there were persistent changes in zzso Reversal learning, open field and other behavioral assessments as well as brain structure using magnetic imaging and zzso were zzso We found that zzso did not impact adult Barnes zzso zzso However, zzso did cause reversal learning deficits in zzso zzso also caused structural changes in the adult zzso zzso was associated with adulthood volume zzso in specific brain regions without changes in total brain zzso zzso regions included the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso internal capsule zzso and zzso of the corpus zzso zzso The enlarged zzso volume in adults after zzso is consistent with previous imaging studies in human zzso zzso treatment was associated with significant increases in the expression of several zzso zzso zzso proteins in the adult zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings are consistent with zzso causing persistent changes in brain structure that could contribute to a lack of behavioral zzso
