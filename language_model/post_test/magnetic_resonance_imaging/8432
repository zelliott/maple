We describe a minimally invasive technique for zzso of selected juvenile zzso zzso zzso using indirect zzso of the zzso 

An zzso case series with follow-up of 9 months to 3 years was zzso The subjects included 4 teenage boys with zzso zzso zzso The intervention included zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso examination, and zzso The outcome measures included blood loss, zzso zzso and surgical zzso 

Four teenage boys underwent zzso of early stage zzso with zzso zzso The zzso were excised under indirect mirror guidance with an zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso tumor was removed zzso The operative time was less than 1 hour in each case, and blood loss was less than 100 zzso All 4 boys are free of zzso 

With the advent of refined imaging techniques and relatively safe zzso zzso minimally invasive approaches to zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso piecemeal zzso is feasible but zzso zzso zzso of the tumor mass by zzso techniques combined with zzso removal of tumor remnants from the zzso zzso allows complete, controlled surgical zzso with minimal blood zzso
