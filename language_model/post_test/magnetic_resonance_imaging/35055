Recently, zzso structural brain plasticity in humans has been demonstrated in adults after three months of training a zzso zzso Learning zzso cascade juggling was associated with a transient and highly selective increase in brain gray matter in the zzso zzso zzso the motion sensitive area zzso zzso However, the exact zzso of zzso structural changes occur is still zzso A better understanding of the zzso parameters may help to zzso to what extent this type of cortical plasticity contributes to fast adapting cortical processes that may be relevant to zzso 

Using a 3 zzso scanner and monitoring whole brain structure we repeated and extended our original study in 20 healthy adult volunteers, zzso on the zzso aspects of the structural changes and investigated whether these changes are performance or exercise zzso The data confirmed our earlier observation using a mean effects analysis and in addition showed that learning to juggle can alter gray matter in the zzso zzso as early as after 7 days of zzso Neither performance nor exercise alone could explain these zzso 

We suggest that the qualitative change zzso learning of a new zzso is more critical for the brain to change its structure than continued training of an zzso zzso
