zzso doses of zzso an zzso acid zzso zzso have a rapid zzso effect which lasts for up to 2 zzso However, the zzso mechanism regarding this effect remains zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso doses of zzso on zzso systems in conscious monkey brain were zzso Five young monkeys underwent four zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso during and after intravenous infusion of vehicle or zzso zzso in a dose of zzso or zzso for zzso and zzso post zzso Global reduction of zzso binding to zzso was observed during zzso infusion in a zzso manner, but not zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also investigated in the same subjects studied with zzso No significant changes were observed in either zzso or zzso binding after zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso infusion zzso increased zzso levels in the zzso fluid of the prefrontal zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso zzso selectively enhanced zzso transmission by zzso of zzso zzso This action coexists with the rapid zzso effect of zzso doses of zzso Further studies are needed to investigate whether the transient combination of zzso and zzso reception zzso enhances each other's zzso zzso
