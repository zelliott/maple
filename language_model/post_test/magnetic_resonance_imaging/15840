zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso zzso in the upper zzso cavity with local zzso and zzso or zzso zzso The purpose of this paper is to document three types of direct zzso extensions by zzso using zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Eleven patients with zzso confirmed zzso were admitted in our hospital between December 2002 and December zzso Their magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso 10) and CT zzso zzso 8) images were zzso zzso and particular attention was paid to tumor location and extension, enhancement pattern, cervical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The majority of patients were male zzso with zzso stage C tumor zzso Three types of direct zzso extension by zzso were put forward according to their MR and CT zzso The primary tumors were zzso zzso masses centered in the roof of the zzso cavity eroding into the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso cavity zzso the zzso cavity zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The tumor zzso were zzso on zzso images, zzso zzso on zzso images, and zzso or slight zzso on CT images with scattered zzso zzso and marginal zzso Their enhancements were significant and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in four patients zzso but no zzso proved distant zzso was zzso 

Three types of direct zzso extensions by zzso can be found on CT and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
