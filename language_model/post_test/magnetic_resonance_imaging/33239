The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the characteristic magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of zzso zzso root tear in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Thirty zzso diagnosed patients who had undergone zzso knee zzso were included in this zzso They were compared to 30 zzso patients with zzso zzso tears without root zzso The findings used for imaging analysis were as zzso the zzso tear on the zzso root of the zzso zzso in the zzso plane, the presence of the zzso sign in the zzso plane and the ghost zzso sign in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso plane was also zzso All the zzso findings of both groups were statistically zzso 

All the findings were more frequently found in the root tear group than those in the control group zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value and negative zzso value of finding a zzso tear in the zzso plane were zzso 100, 100 and zzso zzso In the zzso plane, rates for the presence of the zzso sign were 90, 100, 100 and zzso zzso In the zzso plane, rates for the presence of the ghost zzso sign were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The rates for the zzso zzso in the zzso plane were zzso 90, zzso and zzso zzso 

The findings of zzso zzso root tear were characteristic as compared with the control zzso zzso tear in the zzso plane also showed similar diagnostic accuracy as that seen in the other zzso The characteristic findings provide high diagnostic zzso and zzso plane is helpful to detect zzso zzso root zzso
