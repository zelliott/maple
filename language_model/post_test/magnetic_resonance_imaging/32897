To compare the outcome and probability of recurrence in a series of patients with unilateral idiopathic benign zzso zzso vertigo of the zzso canal zzso that were randomly treated by zzso exercise zzso zzso or by particle repositioning maneuver zzso 

zzso prospective clinical zzso 

zzso referral zzso 

Patients were included in this study if they complained of vertigo and had been diagnosed as having unilateral idiopathic zzso for at least 1 week before zzso maneuver zzso remained for 30 days in the randomly assigned treatment, and had at least 48 months' zzso 

zzso patients were treated with a single zzso and 40 patients by zzso zzso 

Resolution of benign zzso zzso zzso on the zzso The probability of recurrence was also zzso 

At Day 7, zzso was negative in zzso of the zzso patients and in zzso of those treated by zzso exercise zzso zzso zzso At Month 1, the differences between both treatment groups remained statistically significant zzso in zzso versus zzso in the zzso exercise had a negative zzso p zzso zzso The variable that influenced that zzso became negative was the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso The number of zzso in zzso and zzso exercise were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso The recurrence rate at 48 months was zzso zzso in zzso exercise and zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso Although the time zzso until the first recurrence was similar zzso zzso zzso patients included in the zzso group showed a significantly longer time zzso between the first and second recurrence zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is more effective treatment and as safe as zzso exercise in the short term for unilateral and idiopathic zzso and although it does not reduce the probability of recurrence in the zzso follow-up period compared with zzso exercise, it may delay the second zzso onset in those patients who had already experienced a single zzso Our study supports the use of zzso as the treatment of choice in unilateral and idiopathic zzso although exercise may be also considered as an alternative treatment in selected zzso
