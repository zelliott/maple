With the advent of the use of serum zzso as a marker for the recurrence of zzso zzso cancer zzso after total zzso clinicians are increasingly faced with the diagnostic dilemma of detecting the site of recurrence in zzso patients with normal clinical zzso The high protein content of this zzso may make it specifically zzso by magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

To determine the ability of MR imaging to detect the presence of zzso zzso in cervical zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso review by two independent head and neck zzso of 34 head and neck MR scans obtained from 26 patients with zzso cancer (12 with primary disease and 14 with zzso disease) all of whom subsequently underwent surgical removal of the zzso zzso considered at risk by zzso 

The average overall percent sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso negative zzso value zzso and accuracy of MR imaging were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso between the two zzso was zzso There was no overall difference in the ability of the MR scan to detect the presence of disease in the upper zzso lower zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, it was more useful for zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy zzso than for zzso zzso or the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy zzso 

MR imaging is a sensitive and accurate technique for the detection of zzso particularly zzso zzso zzso to cervical zzso zzso However, the lower specificity of this zzso zzso its use as a screening zzso
