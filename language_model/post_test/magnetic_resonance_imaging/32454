zzso studies of visually presented food stimuli in patients with anorexia zzso have demonstrated decreased zzso in inferior zzso and visual zzso areas, and increased frontal zzso relative to healthy zzso but so far no zzso could be drawn with respect to the influence of hunger or zzso Thirteen patients with AN and 10 healthy control subjects zzso zzso rated visual food and zzso stimuli for zzso during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in a hungry and a zzso zzso AN patients rated food as less pleasant than zzso When zzso AN patients showed decreased zzso in left inferior zzso zzso relative to zzso When hungry, AN patients displayed weaker zzso of the right visual zzso zzso than healthy zzso Food stimuli during zzso compared with hunger were associated with stronger right zzso zzso in patients and with stronger zzso in left lateral zzso cortex, the middle portion of the right anterior cingulate, and left middle zzso zzso in zzso The observed group differences in the zzso zzso to food pictures point to decreased zzso zzso processing in AN during zzso and to zzso mechanisms during hunger that might facilitate restricted eating in zzso
