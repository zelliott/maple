In theory, zzso zzso diffuse more slowly in cartilage than do zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that the contrast ratio between zzso and zzso disk zzso on MR images is greater after IV administration of an zzso rather than a zzso contrast medium when a clinical dose is zzso 

Twenty patients who had zzso zzso disk zzso were enrolled in this zzso The enhancement of zzso zzso and zzso disk zzso was measured at 5, 25, 40, and 50 zzso after IV injection of zzso and zzso contrast media zzso zzso 

The enhancement was consistently and significantly higher for zzso than for zzso disk fragment, although the contrast ratio between zzso and zzso disk zzso decreased between 5 and 50 zzso after the administration of each contrast zzso No significant difference was shown between zzso and zzso contrast media in the enhancement of zzso disk zzso at 5, 25, 40, and 50 zzso after zzso The contrast ratio between zzso and zzso disk zzso was not a significant difference at 5, 25, and 40 zzso after administration of both contrast zzso At 50 zzso the contrast ratio between zzso and zzso disk zzso was zzso zzso zzso with zzso contrast medium and zzso zzso zzso with zzso contrast zzso The difference was zzso 

The contrast ratio between zzso and zzso disk zzso is affected by the timing of the zzso Images obtained immediately after the injection of each contrast medium showed a greater contrast ratio than did delayed zzso In addition, with the zzso zzso this difference was greater than with zzso medium at 5, 25, 40, and 50 zzso after injection and that difference reached statistical significance at 50 zzso
