zzso between two zzso methods and a quantitative evaluation of zzso blood flow zzso for assessment of zzso zzso reserve zzso in patients with zzso 

9 patients with coronary zzso zzso 50 % were examined with an zzso zzso Recovery zzso zzso sequence by using zzso as contrast agent zzso The zzso zzso were performed both during rest and zzso induced by zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and left zzso zzso cavity were evaluated by a linear zzso zzso was calculated from the original zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and from the zzso which were zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso curves, zzso For zzso of zzso values, the mathematical model zzso 4 was used and zzso was evaluated from the zzso zzso 

With all tested methods, zzso was reduced in zzso regions zzso by arteries with zzso zzso 70 % compared with remote zzso With zzso 4 and the zzso zzso method, differences between severe zzso and remote regions were statistically zzso 

The zzso method with zzso and zzso with zzso 4 are more sensitive methods to differentiate between remote and zzso zzso than the zzso method without zzso
