zzso impairment is common in multiple sclerosis zzso and adds significantly to the burden of the zzso The ability to predict future cognitive impairment from imaging obtained at disease onset has not been zzso 

62 patients zzso within 3 months of a clinically isolated syndrome were assessed zzso 7 years zzso zzso and periodic zzso measures of zzso zzso and zzso white and zzso matter were zzso against zzso scores to explore the best zzso of cognitive zzso 

28 patients had developed clinically zzso zzso at follow-up and a further nine met revised McDonald criteria for zzso zzso in speed of information processing and executive function were the most common zzso Poor performance correlated with high anxiety zzso zzso zzso zzso metrics predicted executive deficits, and new zzso zzso at the zzso follow-up predicted slowed information zzso An increase in zzso concentration in zzso white matter over the first 3 years was associated with poor executive zzso 

zzso variables obtained at the onset of a clinically isolated syndrome can predict future development of cognitive zzso Our findings may have implications in monitoring and treating zzso
