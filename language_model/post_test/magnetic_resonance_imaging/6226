zzso zzso fields applied in magnetic resonance imaging examinations induce electrical currents in metallic zzso These zzso currents may heat up the implants and thus may be capable of causing localized tissue zzso The zzso power deposition and the zzso heating of the implant can be calculated by solving Maxwell's equations for the specific zzso First, extreme in zzso worst-case experiments were performed with a large and very thin aluminum sheet, which was placed in a zzso zzso device in a position parallel to the magnetic zzso zzso In agreement with the theoretical results the temperature rise of a zzso insulated sheet amounted to only zzso degrees C after a zzso zzso examination at 64 zzso No temperature rise in the aluminum sheet could be measured for a sheet immersed in a saline zzso Second, in zzso experiments with a hip joint zzso and an zzso plate were performed to confirm the theoretical results, which predict nearly no temperature rise in the metallic zzso No temperature rise in the implants could be zzso
