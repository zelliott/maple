After replication of previous findings we aimed to: 1) determine if previously reported zzso zzso differences between ALS patients and control subjects are limited to the motor zzso and 2) determine the zzso zzso changes corresponding to varying levels of diagnostic zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso 24 patients with zzso ALS and 17 control subjects underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to obtain zzso of the brain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the left and right motor zzso and in gray matter and white matter of zzso regions in the zzso 

In the more affected hemisphere, reductions in the ratios, zzso and zzso were observed both within zzso and zzso zzso and outside zzso and zzso zzso the motor zzso in zzso zzso However, these reductions were significantly greater within the motor zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso changes in zzso were observed at three months within the motor zzso of both zzso ALS patients zzso and at nine months outside the motor zzso of zzso patients zzso However, there was no clear pattern of progressive change over zzso 

zzso ratios are reduced in the motor zzso and outside the motor zzso in zzso suggesting widespread zzso zzso zzso changes of zzso are not reliable, suggesting that zzso may not be a useful surrogate marker for treatment zzso
