Memory for the order of events within an episode requires mechanisms capable of bridging gaps between those events and laying down memory traces that will support the subsequent retrieval of episodic sequence zzso It has been proposed that the zzso and surrounding zzso zzso lobe zzso play a critical role in these zzso Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined zzso zzso during the zzso of zzso presented noun zzso Using performance on a retrieval test, zzso zzso zzso of subsequent zzso recognition zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso triplets that were subsequently recognized with zzso and without zzso memory for the original sequence of presentation were zzso Within the zzso zzso in bilateral zzso and zzso cortical regions predicted subsequent order memory, with greater zzso observed during zzso of triplets subsequently correctly ordered than those subsequently zzso Interestingly, zzso in these regions did not correlate with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso regions contributed specifically to zzso of episodic details supporting subsequent recovery of sequence zzso
