Recent studies have shown that rotating a single zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a uniform coverage of the object and brings a number of hardware advantages zzso requires only one zzso channel, zzso zzso zzso interactions and zzso large-scale zzso zzso Motion of the zzso zzso sensitivity profile however violates the standard zzso zzso definition of a zzso zzso and the images reconstructed in this conventional manner can be zzso by zzso zzso To overcome this problem, this paper presents Time Division zzso zzso zzso as a new image reconstruction scheme that exploits the rotation of the zzso zzso sensitivity profile to facilitate zzso image reconstructions and reductions in image acquisition zzso A zzso zzso system for head imaging at 2 zzso was constructed and applied in a number of in zzso zzso In this initial study, zzso head images were obtained in half the usual scan zzso It is hoped that new sequences and methods will be developed by taking advantage of zzso zzso
