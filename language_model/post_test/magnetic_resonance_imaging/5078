zzso zzso zzso is a well-known complication after zzso zzso zzso However, there are few articles on this topic, probably because of zzso zzso In addition, patients with zzso can remain zzso for months or even years unless it causes zzso The purpose of this study is to review our experience on this zzso topic to increase awareness among spinal surgeons and zzso and avoid unnecessary zzso which is still being zzso 

This study is a retrospective case series of six patients with zzso who underwent zzso zzso spinal surgery in our zzso department between January 2000 and December zzso The medical records of each patient were reviewed and demographic data, clinical zzso initial diagnosis, surgical procedures, time zzso between operation and onset of symptoms, biological and zzso findings, treatment, and outcome were zzso 

The six patients included four women and two men with a mean age of 48 zzso Four patients had a history of zzso disc zzso one had undergone a zzso for a zzso spinal zzso and a Gill's procedure was performed in one patient with a zzso zzso The time from the zzso operation to presentation ranged from 2 months to 6 zzso All patients presented with zzso lower back pain and/or surgical site infection without fever or neurological zzso Laboratory parameters showed increased blood zzso rates and/or zzso protein level in four zzso zzso were isolated in only one zzso Five patients were evaluated with zzso zzso zzso and this showed the zzso pattern with gas bubbles in three zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed in two zzso The signal intensity varies according to stage and fluid content of the zzso The zzso was removed surgically in all patients with a good zzso 

zzso are more common in obese patients, after emergency surgery, and with zzso changes in surgical zzso On zzso zzso zzso the classic zzso appearance is highly zzso zzso resonance imaging findings are variable and less specific, but confrontation of imaging data with the surgical history helps with the zzso zzso In the early zzso period symptoms are related to the zzso zzso at later times symptoms may be linked to zzso formation clinically and zzso zzso zzso therapy is recommended when a septic complication is present or zzso zzso measures must be taken to prevent this zzso zzso sponges should always be counted at least three times zzso at closure, and at the zzso zzso markers should be used, and if there is doubt, zzso zzso must be zzso
