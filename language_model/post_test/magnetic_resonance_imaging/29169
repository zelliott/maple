zzso a novel zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be zzso in cerebral zzso as studied in animal models and clinical zzso The present study investigated the effect of zzso on zzso volume and brain zzso following traumatic brain zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso were subjected to cortical impact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a corresponding volume of vehicle zzso zzso zzso was injected 15 and 75 minutes following zzso Animals were sacrificed 24 hours following zzso zzso volume was measured zzso from zzso slices stained with zzso and zzso In this group, zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was also performed 90 minutes and 6 and 24 hours after zzso zzso swelling and water content were determined zzso 24 hours after zzso In this group, zzso pressure zzso mean zzso blood pressure zzso and cerebral zzso pressure zzso were monitored for 30 minutes before zzso zzso did not reduce zzso volume, zzso zzso or water zzso zzso zzso and the resulting zzso did not differ between treated and zzso rats 24 hours after zzso zzso zzso revealed a higher volume of zzso at 90 minutes after trauma in treated zzso However, at 6 and 24 hours after zzso no significant difference was zzso Under these experimental conditions, zzso fails to exert beneficial effects following experimental traumatic brain injury zzso
