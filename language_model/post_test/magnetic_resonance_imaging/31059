zzso switching has shown to involve several prefrontal and zzso brain zzso Most cognitive zzso used to measure cognitive switching such as the Wisconsin zzso zzso Task zzso involve additional cognitive processes besides zzso in particular working memory zzso It is, therefore, questionable whether prefrontal brain regions activated in these conditions, especially zzso prefrontal zzso zzso are involved in cognitive switching per se, or are related to zzso components involved in switching zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to examine neural zzso of pure switching using a paradigm purposely designed to minimize zzso zzso The switching paradigm required subjects to switch unpredictably between two spatial dimensions, clearly indicated throughout the task before each zzso Fast, zzso zzso was used to compare neural zzso associated with switch trials to that related to repeat trials in 20 healthy, zzso adult zzso A large cluster of zzso was observed in the right hemisphere, extending from inferior prefrontal and zzso and zzso zzso to superior zzso and inferior zzso zzso A smaller and more zzso cluster of zzso zzso in the left zzso was accompanied by zzso of left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso We conclude that left zzso zzso is involved directly in cognitive zzso in conjunction with zzso and zzso brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be related to motor components of switching zzso
