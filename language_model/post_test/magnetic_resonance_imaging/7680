Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women zzso However, it remains a difficult diagnosis problem to differentiate between benign and zzso breast zzso especially in small early breast zzso 

To assess the diagnostic value of zzso imaging zzso combined with zzso imaging zzso for small breast cancer zzso 

zzso patients (65 zzso with a zzso zzso in diameter underwent zzso zzso breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso including zzso and zzso zzso Three observers with varying experience levels reviewed zzso The probability of breast cancer in each zzso on MR images was recorded with a zzso zzso Areas under the zzso characteristic curve zzso were compared by using the Z zzso sensitivity and specificity were determined with the Z test after adjusting for data zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 1, zzso Observer 2, zzso Observer 3, zzso was greater than that of zzso zzso 1, zzso Observer 2, zzso Observer 3, zzso for all observers zzso in all zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 1, zzso Observer 2, zzso and Observer 3, zzso was greater than that of zzso alone zzso 1, zzso Observer 2, zzso Observer 3, zzso for all observers zzso in all zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was greater than that of zzso alone for observer 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and observer 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso combined with zzso can improve the diagnostic performance of zzso in small breast cancer zzso It should be considered selectively in the zzso evaluation of patients with small zzso of the zzso
