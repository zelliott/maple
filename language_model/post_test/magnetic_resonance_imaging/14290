This study describes the effect of zzso iron oxide on zzso signal intensity and defines the mechanism of action of this zzso zzso resonance images of the heart and relaxation data were obtained in 19 rats, and another three rats were used for zzso of contrast material concentration in the heart, with the contrast agent enriched with zzso A dose of 36 zzso of iron per zzso induced homogeneous signal loss in the zzso with a gated zzso sequence with a repetition time of 1,500 zzso and an echo time of 20 zzso The reduction in signal intensity was the result of a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The diffusion effect results from zzso of spins moving across magnetic field zzso generated in the tissue by the contrast zzso The relative contribution of the zzso signal loss observed in zzso was larger than that predicted from the in zzso relaxation zzso The reduced in zzso effect is likely the result of loss of a portion of the zzso blood volume during sample preparation, as assessed with the zzso zzso
