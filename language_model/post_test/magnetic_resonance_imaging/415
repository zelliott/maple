In zzso zzso zzso patients undergoing surgical zzso we sought to determine the association between zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso findings, small zzso coronary zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso are frequently observed on zzso in zzso zzso zzso measures wall thickness and detects zzso 

Sixty symptomatic zzso patients zzso zzso mean age 51 zzso 14 zzso with preserved ejection fraction zzso 64 zzso zzso and no zzso coronary disease underwent zzso zzso and delayed zzso using a zzso zzso T zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thickness was recorded on zzso zzso zzso was determined zzso of total zzso on delayed zzso zzso images and zzso as none, mild zzso to zzso moderate zzso to zzso or severe zzso VT was assessed using zzso zzso Degree of zzso was determined zzso mild, moderate, and zzso on zzso of surgical zzso 

zzso and zzso were seen in 45 zzso and 38 zzso patients, zzso In 15 patients without zzso 12 zzso had no zzso 23 zzso patients with mild zzso had mild zzso on zzso On zzso analysis, degree of zzso was independently associated with zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso on zzso had higher VT frequency compared with those without zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

A strong association exists between degree of zzso and zzso zzso seen on zzso
