In this study, we have zzso simultaneous zzso zzso zzso along with zzso zzso oxygen level zzso and zzso zzso spin zzso zzso during an zzso motor activity in human subjects in order to compare the zzso dynamics of the zzso responses recorded in each zzso These zzso have allowed us to examine the zzso of the zzso models underlying each zzso and, as a result, gain greater insight into the zzso responses to zzso zzso Although prior studies have examined the relationships between these two zzso through similar experiments, they have produced conflicting results in the literature for a variety of zzso Here, by employing a zzso zzso motor task, we have been able to emphasize the subtle zzso differences between the zzso parameters with a high zzso zzso As a result of this improved experimental design, we are able to report that the zzso measured zzso response is more correlated with the zzso measure of zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso than with zzso (R zzso zzso or total zzso (R zzso zzso This result was predicted from the theoretical grounds of the zzso response and is in agreement with several previous works zzso zzso Choi, zzso Wolf, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human brain zzso by simultaneous zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Menon, zzso zzso zzso zzso during a breath hold challenge in a two part functional imaging study with simultaneous zzso zzso in adult zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso Walker, zzso zzso zzso Choi, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Webb, zzso zzso zzso roles of changes in zzso concentration and regional cerebral blood volume in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 19 zzso zzso These data have also allowed us to examine more detailed measurement models of the zzso signal and comment on the roles of the oxygen zzso and blood volume contributions to the zzso zzso In addition, we found high correlation between the zzso measured total zzso and zzso measured cerebral blood flow (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso with flow (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso as predicted by the zzso zzso Finally, we note a significant amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso change and zzso of the zzso zzso The observed zzso in these parameters between subjects is in agreement with zzso models and provides further support that zzso and zzso have similar vascular zzso
