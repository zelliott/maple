Slow cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso reflecting the central programming of voluntary jaw movements were reported to appear preceding the zzso However, the current source producing the zzso has not yet been zzso This study aimed to determine the cortical regions involved in the central programming of zzso symmetrical voluntary jaw movements, by locating the current source of the zzso counterpart of the zzso zzso field, zzso The zzso were found in the zzso region zzso starting around 860 and 600 zzso prior to the onset of zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and gradually increasing in magnitude to the peak within 100 zzso before the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso appeared long before the reported onset of the zzso increase of zzso tract zzso The current sources producing the zzso were located in the zzso zzso zzso with no bilateral differences in zzso We conclude that the primary motor zzso is involved zzso in central programming as well as in execution of zzso symmetrical voluntary jaw zzso
