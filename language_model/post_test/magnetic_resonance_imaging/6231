A fast zzso imaging using the zzso technique is proposed for the separation of the water and fat in human in zzso zzso This technique also incorporates magnetic field zzso correction in the fast zzso zzso Experimental results of the proposed imaging technique demonstrate that the method would be useful for quick in zzso zzso separation imaging with a substantially shorter time than the conventional zzso imaging zzso
