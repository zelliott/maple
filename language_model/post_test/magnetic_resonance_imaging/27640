zzso implants are covered with a material that allows the fixation of the zzso zzso zzso Usually, the implants are covered in donor zzso which implies the risk of infection transmission, inflammation and implant zzso being also an expensive zzso The new materials used for implant meshing should be tested and a safer and cost effective solution should be zzso 

This study presents the results obtained after a 15-year use of an original zzso for the reconstruction of the zzso cavity after zzso zzso 

42 eyes of 42 patients who underwent zzso surgery for zzso zzso melanoma were included in the zzso The surgical technique was very similar to the classic zzso the major difference being the implant of a zzso made out of a zzso zzso zzso ball covered by a zzso zzso zzso shell used in cardiovascular zzso All the patients had a very good technical result, without the inflammation of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso which demonstrates a very high material zzso and an excellent zzso zzso Late implant expulsion appeared in zzso of the patients (3 zzso 

The particularly good results obtained by using this technique, the absence of an inflammatory reaction after surgery, and the long lasting stability of the zzso recommend the method as being safe, with no major complications and a good zzso zzso
