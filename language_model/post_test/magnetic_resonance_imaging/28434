Some abnormalities in the zzso on zzso stimulation have been said to indicate zzso zzso This study was undertaken to evaluate the reliability of visual evoked zzso zzso for this zzso We zzso reviewed zzso that could be interpreted as indicative of a zzso zzso based on an zzso asymmetry of zzso between the zzso recorded on the left and right zzso zzso The zzso had to be present on both left and right zzso stimulation zzso zzso Studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the American zzso zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso imaging were zzso For comparison, we also studied a control group of 30 patients with normal zzso During a zzso period, we identified 15 patients who fulfilled the aforementioned criteria and who had undergone an MR scan of the zzso Eight scans were normal and seven were zzso Of the seven abnormal scans, five revealed multiple zzso white matter zzso in both zzso suggestive of multiple zzso one a single zzso white matter zzso in the left frontal zzso zzso and one multiple white matter zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not in the zzso In the control group with normal zzso nine had at least one zzso zzso on MR zzso This yielded a positive zzso value of zzso The negative zzso value was zzso sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso Because of a high rate of false zzso zzso zzso were not reliable in predicting zzso zzso
