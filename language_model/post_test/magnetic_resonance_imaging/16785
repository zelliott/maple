zzso disorder and schizophrenia overlap in symptoms and may share some underlying neural zzso The zzso prefrontal zzso zzso may have a crucial role in the zzso of both these zzso In this study, we examined the functional connectivity between zzso and other brain regions in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso data were collected from 14 patients with bipolar disorder, 16 patients with zzso and 15 healthy control zzso zzso connectivity maps from the zzso were zzso for each subject and compared across the three zzso The three groups showed distinctive patterns of functional connectivity between zzso and anterior zzso and between zzso and zzso lateral prefrontal zzso zzso The bipolar disorder group exhibited positive correlations between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso whereas the control group exhibited zzso between these zzso The schizophrenia group did not exhibit any zzso correlation or zzso between the zzso and the zzso or zzso In contrast, neither patient group exhibited the significant zzso between zzso lateral prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso that was exhibited by the control zzso The decoupling of zzso with zzso in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is consistent with the impaired executive functioning seen in these zzso zzso connectivity between zzso and zzso distinguished bipolar disorder from zzso and may reflect differences in the affective disturbances typical of each zzso
