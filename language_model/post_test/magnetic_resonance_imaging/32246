The aim of study was to compare the sensitivity of zzso and zzso for zzso detection and zzso after zzso 

zzso patients, between 2 days and 65 months after zzso were evaluated with both CT and zzso Twenty-five patients had an zzso graft and the other three had an zzso The zzso protocol for zzso evaluation zzso a zzso spin zzso a high-resolution zzso zzso and a zzso zzso spin zzso In total 40 zzso zzso was zzso The CT protocol consisted of a blank survey followed by a spiral CT zzso zzso using 140 zzso of zzso An zzso blinded observer evaluated all zzso and zzso 

Using zzso and zzso techniques significantly more zzso zzso were detected than with zzso zzso zzso zzso CT could not determine the type of zzso in 3 of the 11 zzso detected and was uncertain in zzso zzso was uncertain about the type in 14 of the 23 zzso zzso All zzso visible on CT were visible by zzso as zzso 

zzso techniques are more sensitive for the detection of zzso after zzso AAA repair than zzso
