The inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso are key regions involved in risk appraisal during decision making, but accounts of how these regions contribute to decision making under risk remain zzso To help clarify the roles of these and other related regions, we used a modified version of the zzso zzso zzso Task zzso et zzso Journal of Experimental zzso zzso 8, zzso 2002) to distinguish between decision-making and zzso processes when participants decided to pursue a gain as the probability of loss increased zzso Specifically, we set out to test whether the zzso and zzso regions zzso to loss zzso at the time of decision making in a way that is not zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso When participants chose to zzso inflating the balloon zzso zzso we observed greater zzso and mainly bilateral zzso activity at the time of decision as the probability of explosion increased, consistent with increased loss zzso but inconsistent with an zzso zzso In contrast, we found robust zzso activity when participants chose to continue inflating the balloon zzso zzso consistent with reward zzso However, in the zzso and in mainly bilateral zzso regions, zzso zzso decreased when participants chose to zzso the balloon as the probability of explosion increased, findings that are consistent with a reduced loss zzso zzso Our results highlight the existence of distinct zzso and zzso signals during decision making, as well as the importance of distinguishing between decision and feedback zzso
