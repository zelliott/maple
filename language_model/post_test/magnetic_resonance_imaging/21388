High field zzso operating at zzso is increasingly being used in the field of zzso on the grounds that higher magnetic field strength should theoretically lead to a higher diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of several disease zzso This Editorial discusses the exhaustive review by zzso and colleagues of research comparing zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the field of zzso Interestingly, the authors found no convincing evidence of improved image quality, diagnostic zzso or reduced total examination times using zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso These findings are highly relevant since a new generation of high field zzso systems operating at zzso has recently been zzso 

zzso Higher magnetic field strengths do not necessarily lead to a better diagnostic zzso zzso zzso of high field MR systems have to be considered in clinical zzso zzso Higher field strengths are needed for functional imaging, zzso zzso zzso zzso there are few direct comparisons of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Whether the next high field MR generation zzso will improve diagnostic accuracy has to be zzso
