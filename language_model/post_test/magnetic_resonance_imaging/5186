zzso left superior zzso zzso zzso volume is one of the most zzso imaging findings in zzso However, it remains unclear whether genes play any role in our understanding of such structural zzso It has been proposed that zzso 1 zzso might be a promising gene involved in zzso because of its role in zzso and zzso In this study, the association between zzso and zzso anatomy in patients with schizophrenia was explored for the first zzso 

We investigated a zzso treated prevalence cohort of patients with schizophrenia in contact with the South zzso zzso Mental Health zzso A blood sample was collected for DNA extraction and brain structure was assessed with an zzso zzso A total of 27 subjects with schizophrenia underwent both assessments and were included in the zzso 

We investigated the association between the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and volume of the zzso We found that patients zzso for the C zzso had reduced left zzso gray and white matter volumes in comparison to those zzso for the G zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso 

This exploratory study suggests that zzso may be involved in determining zzso size in zzso and may play a role in the zzso basis of the language disturbances seen in this zzso However, due to our small sample size, the results should be regarded as preliminary and zzso in a larger zzso
