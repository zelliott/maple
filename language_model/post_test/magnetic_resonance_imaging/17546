In zzso assessment of treatment efficacy on zzso left zzso zzso zzso is crucial for experimental zzso We examined the technical feasibility of serial magnetic resonance imaging zzso for monitoring early zzso zzso in zzso zzso studies were performed with a zzso unit, 1, 3, 8, 15, and 30 days after zzso zzso zzso or sham operation, to measure zzso mass, volume, and the ejection fraction zzso Three groups of animals were zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso rats receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rats receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred on day 3 in both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso volumes were significantly lower in zzso rats than in zzso rats at days 15 and zzso zzso was lower in both zzso groups than in the sham group at all time points, and did not differ between the zzso groups during zzso Less zzso zzso was observed in rats receiving zzso than in rats receiving zzso at days 15 and zzso We found acceptable zzso and zzso agreement and an excellent correlation between zzso and ex zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso We demonstrated the ability of zzso to detect the early beneficial impact of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the tool of choice to document response to treatment targeting zzso zzso zzso in zzso
