Clinical diagnosis of cervical zzso fails to detect the location and extent of tumor invasion to cervical zzso and zzso This study attempted to assess the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the evaluation for the extent of cervical zzso 

A total of 41 patients with primary zzso cervical zzso underwent zzso throughout the staging evaluations before surgical zzso 

Without zzso zzso images were less effective than zzso images for zzso of pelvic zzso zzso zzso images provided information similar to those of zzso appearances, and distinguished the normal zzso or zzso wall from zzso invaded zzso more zzso 

The enhancement with zzso may increase the ability of zzso to provide a positive zzso zzso
