The movement towards zzso at higher field strengths zzso has enhanced the appeal of zzso spin labeling zzso for many applications due to improved zzso of the zzso Greater field strength also introduces increased magnetic zzso effects resulting in marked zzso field zzso Although zzso field zzso can be zzso by zzso over the imaging volume, marked field zzso is likely to remain within the labeling region for zzso zzso zzso This study highlights a potential source of error in cerebral blood flow zzso using zzso at high zzso We show that labeling efficiency in zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso displayed marked sensitivity to the zzso bandwidth of the inversion pulse in a rat model at zzso The majority of zzso zzso studies have not reported the bandwidth of the inversion zzso We show that a high bandwidth pulse of zzso was required to robustly overcome the field zzso in the labeling region at high field strength, which is significantly greater than the inversion bandwidth zzso used in previous zzso Unless zzso levels are at their limit, we suggest the use of a high bandwidth labeling pulse for most zzso zzso
