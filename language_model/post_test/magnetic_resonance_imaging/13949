To assess the diagnostic specificity of zzso zzso zzso for zzso among individuals with a variety of zzso confirmed conditions associated with zzso as well as changes attributable to typical aging, and to measure correlations among zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mental status examination performance, and the zzso stage of zzso 

An zzso series of 67 individuals participating in the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research zzso Disease Patient zzso who had undergone a standardized zzso zzso study and also zzso examination were zzso zzso volumes were measured from zzso zzso Each zzso zzso was assigned a zzso diagnosis and in addition, the severity of zzso pathology was staged using the method of zzso and zzso 

zzso with an isolated zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso usually had substantial zzso zzso while those with changes of typical aging did zzso Among all 67 subjects, correlations (all p zzso zzso were observed between zzso volume and zzso and zzso stage zzso zzso zzso between zzso volume and zzso State zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso and between zzso score and zzso and zzso stage zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso while not specific for zzso was a fairly sensitive marker of the zzso zzso stage zzso among subjects with isolated zzso pathology zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso cognitive zzso
