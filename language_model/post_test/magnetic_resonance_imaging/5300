zzso brain abnormalities are consistently found in schizophrenia zzso and have been associated with the familial risk for the zzso We aim to define the relative contributions of genetic and zzso factors to the association between structural brain abnormalities and zzso in a uniquely powered cohort zzso zzso and Relatives zzso 

An international zzso magnetic resonance imaging collaboration was set up to pool magnetic resonance imaging scans from twin pairs in zzso (The zzso Helsinki zzso London zzso zzso and zzso zzso A sample of 684 subjects took part, consisting of zzso twins zzso zzso zzso with 51 patients from zzso and 52 from zzso zzso and zzso twins zzso zzso zzso with 39 patients from zzso zzso The additive zzso common, and unique environmental contributions to the association between brain volumes and risk for zzso were estimated by structural equation zzso 

The zzso of most brain volumes were significant and ranged between zzso zzso cortical gray zzso and zzso zzso zzso of cerebral gray matter did not reach significance zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between zzso and reduced volumes of the zzso zzso zzso and white matter zzso zzso and increased volume of the third zzso zzso zzso These were predominantly due to overlapping genetic effects zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Some of the genes that transmit the risk for zzso also influence cerebral zzso zzso zzso
