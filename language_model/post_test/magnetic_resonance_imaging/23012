To address the potential contribution of zzso brain regions in the functional reorganization of the motor system in patients with sporadic ALS zzso and to investigate whether functional changes in brain activity are different in zzso patients with zzso upper motor zzso zzso or lower motor zzso zzso zzso 

We studied 16 patients with zzso and 13 healthy controls, using zzso while they performed a simple visually paced motor zzso Seven patients had zzso clinical zzso signs while nine patients had prevalent clinical and zzso zzso zzso zzso data were analyzed with Brain Voyager zzso 

zzso functional changes were identified in motor cortical regions in both patients and healthy zzso zzso group comparisons revealed relatively decreased zzso zzso responses in left zzso cortex, lateral zzso area, supplementary motor area and right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and relatively increased responses in the left anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Additional analyses between the two patients zzso demonstrated significant zzso zzso response differences in the anterior zzso zzso and right zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso with more robust zzso of these areas in patients with greater zzso zzso zzso there were no significant differences in performance of the motor task between zzso patients and controls as well as between zzso patient zzso 

Our data demonstrate a different zzso zzso pattern between our zzso patients and healthy controls even during simple motor zzso Furthermore, patients with zzso and greater zzso involvement show a different reorganization of the motor system compared to zzso patients with greater zzso zzso
