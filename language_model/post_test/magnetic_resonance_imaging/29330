zzso and secondary liver zzso are a common clinical problem, with a poor prognosis in most zzso zzso zzso offers the best outcome, but is only appropriate for the zzso zzso zzso techniques have been zzso but the lack of an optimal means of monitoring has limited their zzso We undertook a pilot study to assess the feasibility and safety of an integrated zzso laser zzso technique under local zzso using a real-time zzso zzso monitoring technique in a newly developed open MR zzso 

Liver zzso were zzso after the administration of intravenous zzso zzso zzso using real-time MR image guidance under local or general zzso and treated using a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso laser zzso zzso procedures were performed in 12 zzso zzso was monitored using a real-time MR zzso zzso zzso was followed by a zzso change in a region of zzso 

zzso zzso of mean size 3 zzso in diameter were produced with a maximum size of 5 zzso Eight out of 12 patients were discharged the next day with few significant zzso Repeat procedures have been performed in seven of 12 zzso Two patients with zzso of 3 zzso diameter have had complete zzso zzso with only one zzso 

zzso laser zzso for liver zzso performed as an integrated zzso technique in an open zzso MR scanner is zzso It can be safely performed under local zzso in the majority of patients, with few side zzso MR control shows the site and size of the evolving zzso zzso allowing appropriate action to be taken in terms of further zzso time of application and power zzso
