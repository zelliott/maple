zzso and zzso differences in the anatomy of the zzso joint zzso between zzso volunteers and patients with zzso disorders zzso were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Forty volunteers were examined using a zzso zzso and double surface zzso Both zzso zzso were zzso zzso 78 zzso could be zzso Each zzso was examined in the zzso position in a zzso zzso Images were analyzed zzso and zzso and compared to data zzso obtained from 91 zzso zzso 

Considering the position of the disc zzso zzso of the volunteers had a normal disc position while zzso of the patients zzso zzso disc displacement with reduction was diagnosed in zzso of volunteers and zzso of the zzso zzso disc displacement without reduction was found only in patients zzso zzso of zzso data between patients and volunteers revealed zzso of the disc and a zzso in the zzso part and the zzso band in zzso In patients, the disc presented zzso and the zzso was positioned zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso when compared to the zzso zzso the zzso and superior joint spaces were smaller in zzso Women showed disc displacement and combined zzso changes in the zzso structures significantly more often than zzso 

A large variation of zzso parameters in zzso zzso could be zzso However, reduced disc zzso zzso of the disc, narrowed zzso superior and zzso zzso and a zzso position of the zzso are more commonly associated with joint zzso
