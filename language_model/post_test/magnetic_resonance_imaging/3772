Recent studies have revealed additional face areas in the anterior zzso lobe in addition to the zzso face areas zzso face area, zzso face area, and face area in the superior zzso zzso The zzso of a patient who underwent zzso of zzso grid zzso in the right anterior zzso zzso lobe revealed a strong zzso response both in zzso zzso zzso and in the induced broadband spectral power change at an zzso located on the anterior collateral zzso zzso the border between the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and induced broadband power changes were highly specific to facial zzso which was obvious even in a single trial zzso The zzso response was recorded in an area with perfect overlap of the zzso zzso face zzso in the anterior collateral zzso proposed based on human functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso A recent zzso study in monkeys reported a zzso visual response in the zzso cortex, suggesting that the basic structural zzso of face responsive areas are preserved across zzso Although the zzso zzso has long been regarded as part of the memory system, recent data suggest that it also plays a role in zzso The zzso response in the present study might reflect visual processing based on complex zzso of visual features required for facial zzso
