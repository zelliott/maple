In advanced head and neck cancer, an zzso approach zzso radiation therapy combined with zzso chemotherapy has become an important zzso However, the high zzso of residual masses after therapy remains a zzso In this study, we zzso evaluated the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delayed imaging for the detection of recurrence of head and neck cancer after zzso and compared the zzso results with those of magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from 36 patients with head and neck cancer suspected to represent recurrence after zzso zzso zzso from therapy, 4 zzso were zzso PET was performed at 2 h after zzso injection, and zzso The results were compared to those of contrast studies with zzso or CT performed within 2 weeks of the PET study, and to zzso diagnosis (in all patients suspected of having zzso or clinical zzso The zzso sensitivity zzso zzso and negative zzso value of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were higher than those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso accuracy and positive zzso value of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly ( zzso higher than those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three of six patients with false positive findings had zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analysis showed that retrospective evaluation with the zzso zzso ratio yielded the best results zzso zzso specificity zzso followed by visual interpretation and then the zzso muscle zzso An zzso delayed imaging protocol yielded significantly better results for the detection of recurrence of head and neck cancer after zzso than zzso Because of the high negative zzso value of zzso zzso if PET is negative, further invasive procedures may be zzso
