The zzso has been shown to respond to many distinct types of affective zzso including reward and punishment feedback in zzso In humans, winning and losing situations can be considered as reward and punishment experiences, zzso In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure regional brain activity when human subjects were given feedback on their performance during a simple response time task in a fictitious competitive zzso zzso stimuli were used to convey positive zzso or negative zzso zzso The frequency of positive and negative trials was zzso varied by the zzso independently from the subjects' actual performance and zzso to zzso The results showed that the zzso increase of winning was associated with left zzso zzso whereas the zzso increase of losing was associated with right zzso zzso These findings provide functional evidence that the human zzso zzso responds to changes in magnitude of positive or negative reinforcement conveyed by zzso zzso
