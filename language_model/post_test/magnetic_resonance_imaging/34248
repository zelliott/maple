We now report newly developed three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging zzso system which is based on semiautomatic tissue extraction from the zzso MR images utilizing the fuzzy reasoning calculation method and zzso reconstruction with surface zzso We also studied normal in zzso dynamic changes of the zzso membrane zzso of zzso during rotation using this zzso zzso zzso zzso of right zzso of five healthy volunteers was obtained in five zzso positions, and extraction and zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso was made using the zzso zzso results were well with the fuzzy reasoning zzso zzso of the radius and zzso zzso were reconstructed from these images respectively, and their zzso were almost identical to the zzso zzso zzso showed there were zzso zzso on the zzso in zzso position in the all five subjects and zzso on the most zzso portion of the zzso at maximum zzso in three zzso In neutral position, the zzso of all five volunteers was almost zzso From zzso orientation, these dynamic changes of the zzso mainly occurred at the zzso portion, which is soft, thin, and zzso Otherwise, the zzso portion which is a thick and strong complex of 5 to 10 zzso run from zzso one third of the radius to zzso one fourth of the zzso demonstrated minimal dynamic changes on the zzso zzso the zzso portion is considered to be taut during rotation to provide stability between the radius and the zzso while the zzso portion is easy to zzso and allowing smooth zzso Furthermore, because of zzso our zzso system is useful for in zzso analysis of soft tissue zzso in normal and abnormal musculoskeletal zzso
