To assess the incremental value of zzso zzso and dynamic zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in detecting locally zzso prostate cancer after zzso 

zzso patients zzso age, 70 zzso with a history of zzso prostate cancer underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso prostate zzso Two readers independently scored the likelihood of cancer on a zzso scale, using zzso alone and then adding zzso and zzso Areas under receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso were estimated at the patient and zzso zzso The apparent diffusion zzso zzso from zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso were zzso 

zzso was positive in zzso zzso and negative in zzso zzso zzso zzso for readers 1 and 2 increased from zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso with zzso at the patient level, and from zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso with zzso at the zzso level zzso zzso zzso and zzso prostate sides differed significantly in median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was significantly more accurate than zzso alone in detecting locally zzso prostate cancer after zzso
