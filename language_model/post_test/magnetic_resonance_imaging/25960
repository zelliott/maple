The simultaneous acquisition of spatial zzso zzso method of imaging with detector zzso can reduce the number of zzso steps, and zzso scan time zzso The original approach zzso zzso zzso fitting with the zzso sensitivity profiles to create a set of composite spatial zzso to replace the zzso zzso Here, an zzso approach for generating the zzso is zzso A transform is derived to project the zzso onto a set of sensitivity zzso A sequence of zzso zzso and inverse zzso transform is then applied to zzso eliminate zzso dependent phase errors from the different coils while fully preserving the zzso By combining the transform and phase zzso the original zzso image reconstruction method can be replaced by an zzso zzso procedure zzso The approach also allows simulation of zzso imaging, revealing a criterion for the ratio of the detector sensitivity profile zzso to the detector spacing that produces optimal harmonic zzso When detector geometry is zzso a group of zzso zzso which can be corrected and restored to pure zzso The simulation also reveals zzso harmonic zzso effects, and a zzso procedure is presented that enables application of zzso to a large numbers of zzso The method is demonstrated on a phantom and humans using a standard zzso zzso zzso zzso
