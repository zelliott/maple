In a zzso of diagnostic accuracy studies, the sensitivities and zzso of a diagnostic test may depend on the disease prevalence since the severity and definition of disease may differ from study to study due to the design and the population zzso In this paper, we extend the zzso zzso random effects model on sensitivities and zzso to jointly model the disease zzso sensitivities and zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, as an alternative zzso we also propose jointly modeling the test prevalence and the zzso values, which reflect the clinical utility of a diagnostic zzso These models allow investigators to study the complex relationship among the disease zzso sensitivities and zzso or among test prevalence and the zzso values, which can reveal hidden information about test zzso We illustrate the proposed two approaches by zzso the data from a zzso of zzso evaluation of zzso zzso zzso in patients with cervical cancer and a simulation zzso The latter illustrates the importance of carefully choosing an appropriate zzso assumption for the disease zzso sensitivities and zzso or the test prevalence and the zzso zzso In practice, it is recommended to use model selection techniques to identify a zzso model for making statistical zzso In zzso the proposed zzso random effects models are novel and can be very useful in practice for zzso of diagnostic accuracy zzso
