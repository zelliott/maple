zzso follow-up studies in zzso disease type 1 zzso zzso are zzso Here we describe a zzso study in a zzso zzso Our zzso pedigree comprised 11 examined patients, ages between 13 and 83 zzso zzso years, serially evaluated for up to 26 zzso In all 11 patients we carried out zzso zzso and in three of them magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso zzso The 54-year-old zzso patient, yearly examined as of age 28, developed at age 48 gradual and progressive zzso zzso weakness ascending to thigh zzso His serial zzso studies showed diffuse slowing of motor zzso zzso absence or severe zzso of zzso compound muscle action zzso and spontaneous muscle activity in the zzso anterior and zzso zzso Two zzso studies of lower zzso at ages 51 and 54, showed extensive fatty zzso of zzso musculature, and progressive and zzso zzso fatty zzso of anterior and zzso zzso zzso An outstanding finding in the first zzso was the presence of marked zzso of anterior zzso musculature, which to a great degree was replaced by fatty zzso in the second zzso Muscle zzso was also noted in zzso and zzso zzso zzso There was minimal fatty zzso of the zzso zzso the remaining pelvic muscles being zzso The other ten patients showed mild or moderate zzso which remained zzso over the period of zzso zzso studies disclosed diffuse and uniform slowing of nerve zzso zzso in no case was spontaneous muscle activity zzso zzso showed the zzso characteristic pattern of zzso zzso fatty zzso involving foot and zzso zzso with preservation of thigh zzso We conclude that a small proportion of patients with zzso develop a late progression of disease zzso with zzso zzso leg weakness ascending to involve thigh musculature, and that long-term follow-up is essential for its zzso
