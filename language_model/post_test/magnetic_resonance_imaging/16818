To determine the association of early changes in zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso enhancement zzso with tumor size change after zzso zzso zzso by using an zzso zzso zzso 

This retrospective zzso study was approved by the institutional review board, with waiver of informed zzso Patients underwent magnetic resonance zzso imaging at zzso T before zzso as well as 1 and 6 months after zzso zzso analysis of change in zzso and zzso 1 month after zzso compared with zzso values was performed in 48 patients with 71 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic zzso analysis, using tumor response at 6 months according to Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso and modified zzso as end zzso 

According to zzso criteria, 6 months after zzso 30 zzso zzso showed partial response zzso 35 showed stable disease zzso and six showed progressive disease zzso zzso in zzso and decrease in zzso 1 month after zzso were significantly different between zzso zzso and zzso At area under the zzso curve zzso analysis of the zzso increase, there was an zzso of zzso for distinguishing zzso from zzso and zzso and an zzso of zzso for distinguishing zzso and zzso from zzso The zzso for decrease in zzso was zzso for discrimination of zzso from zzso and zzso and zzso for discrimination of zzso and zzso from zzso 

zzso analysis of increase in zzso and decrease in zzso 1 month after zzso can provide an early assessment of response to zzso zzso analysis of zzso MR imaging data may have potential as a zzso zzso for patients undergoing zzso treatment of liver zzso
