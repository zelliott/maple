zzso zzso zzso detects small zzso Crohn's disease with greater diagnostic yield than zzso procedures, although there are concerns that zzso has low zzso We compared the sensitivity and specificity of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with suspected or newly diagnosed Crohn's zzso 

We performed a zzso blinded study of 93 patients scheduled to undergo zzso zzso and zzso and subsequently zzso if zzso was zzso Physicians reporting zzso zzso and zzso results were blinded to patient histories and findings from zzso and other small zzso zzso zzso were compared with those from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and surgery zzso zzso zzso or surgery zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients had Crohn's disease in the terminal zzso The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the terminal zzso were zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso Crohn's disease was detected in 18 patients by using zzso compared with 2 and 6 patients by using zzso or zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Small zzso zzso was observed in 5 patients by using zzso and 1 patient by using zzso zzso imaging results indicated additional zzso in only 2 of the patients who received complete zzso 

In suspected or newly diagnosed Crohn's disease, zzso and zzso have comparable sensitivities and zzso In patients without zzso or clinical suspicion of zzso zzso should be the first line zzso for detection of small zzso Crohn's disease beyond the reach of the zzso
