The literature on zzso zzso zzso in the magnetic resonance imaging era is limited to case reports and small case zzso To our knowledge, this is the largest study of surgically confirmed zzso arising from the anterior or zzso zzso zzso 

To characterize the clinical and zzso findings of zzso arising from the anterior and zzso zzso zzso 

We studied consecutive zzso zzso zzso cases identified zzso from the Cleveland Clinic and University of Texas zzso Medical Center zzso databases from 1992 to zzso Participants included 14 consecutive cases of zzso zzso zzso confirmed by restricted magnetic resonance image zzso and seizure freedom or marked improvement following zzso 

The main outcome measure was improvement in seizure frequency following zzso The clinical, video zzso zzso pathology, and surgical outcome data were zzso 

All 14 patients had zzso zzso confirmed by restricted magnetic resonance image zzso and seizure freedom or marked improvement following zzso They were divided into 3 groups based on anatomical location of the zzso and corresponding seizure zzso In the zzso zzso group, all 4 patients had zzso findings suggestive of zzso origin of the zzso The anterior zzso cases were divided into a typical zzso group (6 cases with zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the presence of fear, laughter, or severe zzso personality zzso and an zzso group (4 cases presenting with simple motor zzso and a tendency for more frequent zzso and zzso long-term surgical zzso All zzso cases were associated with an underlying zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso may present with zzso findings that are suggestive of zzso lobe zzso and can be considered as another example of zzso zzso The zzso presentation and surgical outcome of zzso anterior zzso zzso is possibly influenced by the underlying zzso This study highlights the difficulty in zzso zzso arising from the zzso zzso in the absence of a magnetic resonance image zzso
