The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of zzso of the breast in cases in which zzso or zzso findings are zzso 

We zzso reviewed images from 115 zzso examinations of the breast performed from 1999 to 2005 for the indication of problem-solving for zzso findings on a zzso Forty-eight of the 115 women zzso were at high zzso We discerned whether zzso or zzso was used as an zzso tool and correlated the findings with those in the pathology zzso 

The zzso findings most frequently leading to zzso were asymmetry and architectural zzso No suspicious zzso correlate was found in 100 of 115 cases zzso These cases were found stable at follow-up zzso or zzso after a mean of 34 zzso Fifteen enhancing masses zzso that corresponded to the zzso zzso were seen on MR zzso All masses identified at zzso were accurately localized for zzso and six zzso zzso were zzso Four of six zzso tumors were seen in one zzso view only; two were seen on zzso ultrasound zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and compared with zzso had significantly higher specificity zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso positive zzso value zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso and overall accuracy zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso zzso incidental zzso zzso were detected at zzso and all were subsequently found zzso 

We found breast zzso to be a useful zzso tool when findings at conventional imaging were zzso zzso patient selection criteria should be used because of the high frequency of incidental zzso seen on MR zzso
