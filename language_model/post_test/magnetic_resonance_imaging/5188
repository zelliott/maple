Following successful zzso nerve zzso zzso for zzso zzso injuries zzso patients initially show a zzso movement of elbow zzso during zzso Later they are able to flex the elbow, independent of respiratory zzso 

To demonstrate cortical reorganization following zzso zzso in zzso through functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso 

Thirty adult patients underwent zzso zzso for zzso The controls were age and sex zzso All patients had zzso 3 or 4 degree of zzso Patients underwent zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso of neural activity within the motor zzso were generated in the paralyzed and control arms and center of maximum activity was zzso zzso zzso and apparent diffusion zzso were generated from zzso and zzso over the motor zzso and comparison was made between the paralyzed and control zzso 

Median zzso zzso was 6 zzso zzso patients improved from grade 0 to grade 3 or zzso There was no significant difference between the coordinates for maximum activity, when the cortical activity following elbow zzso of the patients who improved was compared with the control arm zzso There was reduction in zzso and zzso values in patients who have improved following surgery when compared to zzso zzso zzso and apparent diffusion zzso values of the zzso patients revealed no significant difference from the controls or zzso zzso 

zzso plasticity following zzso transfer in zzso does zzso There was no correlation between the degree of improvement either with the zzso of activity on the motor zzso from the chest to the elbow area, or the amount of activity on the motor zzso representing the elbow zzso
