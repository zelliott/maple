zzso zzso zzso was introduced in an attempt to reduce zzso zzso of components in total knee zzso zzso It was hypothesized that zzso could help with the positioning of zzso components in optimal zzso zzso 

A magnetic resonance imaging zzso analysis of 94 patients following zzso was zzso Of these, 46 operations were performed using zzso and 48 using conventional zzso The rotation of the zzso components was determined in the zzso and zzso were considered zzso Data were analyzed for zzso zzso observer zzso and a zzso comparison between implant zzso 

There was excellent zzso and zzso reliability with low standard zzso for the determination of zzso component zzso There were significantly more zzso in the conventional zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso 

In this setup, zzso was effective in significantly reducing zzso of optimal zzso zzso component alignment during zzso
