Few data exist on the relationship between differential zzso of peripheral zzso and early cerebral zzso size in zzso zzso Using zzso MR imaging zzso we assessed the relationship of early total and differential peripheral zzso counts and volume of zzso tissue in acute zzso 

All included patents had laboratory investigations and zzso collected within 24 hours of stroke zzso Total peripheral zzso counts and differential counts were analyzed individually and by zzso zzso zzso were outlined using a zzso threshold zzso The relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes was examined using zzso zzso zzso 

173 patients met study inclusion zzso Median age was 73 zzso Total zzso counts and zzso volumes showed a strong correlation zzso zzso zzso Median zzso volumes zzso for successive zzso zzso were: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for trend zzso Median zzso volumes zzso for successive zzso zzso were: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso After zzso analysis, larger zzso volume remained strongly associated with higher total zzso and zzso counts (both probability values zzso but not with zzso count zzso Compared with the lowest zzso zzso volumes were zzso zzso and zzso zzso larger in the highest zzso of zzso and zzso counts, zzso 

Higher peripheral zzso and zzso counts, but not zzso counts, are associated with larger zzso volumes in acute zzso zzso zzso zzso response early after zzso stroke may be a viable therapeutic strategy and warrants further zzso
