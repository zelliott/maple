Group maps created from individual functional maps provide useful zzso of patterns of brain zzso Different methods for combining information have been proposed in the statistical literature and have been recently applied to zzso zzso Since these group maps are statistics, it is natural to ask how robust they are, that is, are they sensitive to the effects of unusual zzso zzso might be in terms of extent, location, or strength of zzso Our approach in this paper is to zzso group maps formed by different combining zzso the zzso method, which involves deleting each observation zzso in turn and zzso the statistic (the group zzso is commonly used for the purpose of assessing zzso We examine the theoretical properties of four combining zzso In addition, via a collection of measures defined on the difference between group maps based on the entire sample and based on the zzso samples, we evaluate the zzso of these same methods on data from an zzso zzso zzso indicate that there is a type of zzso in the combining techniques we consider, between zzso and zzso methods that are liberal, in that they allow for the discovery of many active zzso tend also to be more sensitive to the influences of individual zzso
