Although several zzso areas are known to be involved in number processing, their possible role in zzso operations remains zzso It has been hypothesized that the horizontal segment of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso superior zzso zzso zzso contribute to operations solved by calculation procedures, such as zzso but whether these areas are also involved in operations solved by memory zzso such as zzso is zzso In the present study, we first identified the zzso areas involved in zzso and zzso by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and we found an increased zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso during both zzso zzso In order to test whether these areas are zzso involved in zzso and zzso we used zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to create, in each zzso a virtual zzso of either the zzso or zzso over the sites corresponding to the zzso of zzso gathered in zzso When compared to a control site, we found an increase in response zzso in both operations after a virtual zzso of either the left or right zzso but not of the zzso Moreover, zzso over the zzso increased the error rate in the zzso zzso The present results indicate that even operations solved by memory zzso such as zzso rely on the zzso In contrast, the zzso seems to zzso processes that are zzso to solve basic zzso and zzso zzso
