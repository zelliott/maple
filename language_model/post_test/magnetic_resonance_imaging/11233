The aim of this study was to identify brain zzso to socially threatening stimuli in social zzso subjects during different experimental zzso 

With zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, brain zzso to photographs and zzso pictures depicting angry or neutral facial expressions was measured in social zzso subjects and healthy control subjects, while subjects assessed either emotional expression zzso zzso zzso explicit zzso or picture type zzso zzso zzso implicit zzso 

Compared with control subjects, zzso showed greater responses to angry than to neutral photographic faces in the zzso regardless of task, whereas amygdala, zzso zzso and zzso visual zzso were more strongly activated only during the implicit zzso zzso in contrast to control subjects, showed similar zzso patterns during both zzso For zzso angry versus neutral faces, zzso of zzso and zzso visual zzso was found in zzso but not in control subjects, during both zzso 

zzso between social zzso and control subjects in brain responses to socially threatening faces are most pronounced when facial expression is zzso zzso zzso process angry zzso as well as zzso facial expressions, regardless of whether this is zzso The zzso plays a unique role in the processing of threat signals by social zzso
