This study explores the zzso zzso of the recognition of famous faces in patients with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and healthy controls depending on the genetic risk factor, zzso E zzso zzso An zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment was conducted while participants zzso between famous and zzso zzso We compared the results of 32 healthy controls zzso zzso zzso carriers zzso 15 zzso zzso with those of 30 patients with zzso (16 zzso 14 zzso Despite comparable task performance, patients with zzso zzso showed significantly less zzso in a large cortical network including the left zzso zzso than patients with zzso zzso Furthermore, in the zzso group, we found significantly reduced zzso in the left zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with the control zzso Our results show that critical regions of the brain show functional decline associated with major risk factors, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso signs of zzso for the development of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso seems to influence cortical zzso in patients with zzso and to a lesser degree in healthy controls as well, who are without any cognitive zzso
