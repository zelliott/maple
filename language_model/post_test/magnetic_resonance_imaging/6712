The authors used magnetic resonance imaging and an image analysis technique known as cortical pattern matching to map cortical gray matter deficits in elderly depressed patients with an illness onset after age 60 zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso depression (11 women and six zzso mean zzso zzso and 17 zzso comparison subjects (11 women and six zzso mean zzso zzso were zzso zzso spatial analyses of gray matter were conducted across the entire zzso by measuring local proportions of gray matter at thousands of zzso cortical surface locations in each subject, and these patterns were matched across subjects by using elastic transformations to align zzso zzso To zzso regional changes, statistical differences were mapped at each cortical surface location in three zzso 

The zzso depression group exhibited significant gray matter deficits in the right lateral zzso zzso and the right zzso cortex, where decreases were most pronounced in zzso zzso The statistical maps also showed gray matter deficits in the same regions of the left zzso that approached significance after zzso zzso No significant group differences were detected in frontal zzso or any other anatomical zzso 

zzso specific decreases of gray matter occur in zzso depression, supporting the hypothesis that this subset of elderly patients with major depression presents with certain unique zzso abnormalities that may differ from patients with an earlier onset of zzso
