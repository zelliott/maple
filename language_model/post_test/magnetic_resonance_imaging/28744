The zzso zzso frontal zzso can be divided into three functional zzso a zzso region with connections to the zzso system, an anterior zzso region with connections to lateral prefrontal systems, and a zzso zzso region with connections to lateral motor zzso zzso and functional imaging studies zzso this zzso frontal zzso in speech and language zzso The current functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study of word generation was designed to determine which of these three functional zzso was substantially involved by mapping individual subjects' functional activity onto structural images of their left zzso frontal zzso Of 28 zzso normal right-handed participants, 21 demonstrated a prominent zzso late zzso zzso which lies in the anterior zzso region with connections to lateral prefrontal zzso zzso increases for word generation centered in the zzso in 18 of these 21 zzso The zzso zzso region also demonstrated significant activity in a majority of participants zzso zzso zzso rarely extended into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when there was a prominent zzso If there was no prominent zzso however, activity did extend into the zzso zzso zzso In no case was activity present on the crest of the zzso zzso which is heavily connected to the zzso zzso Thus, current findings suggest that zzso frontal activity during word generation reflects cognitive and motor rather than zzso system zzso The current study demonstrates that suitably designed zzso studies can be used to determine the functional significance of zzso zzso in human zzso
