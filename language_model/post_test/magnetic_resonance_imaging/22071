The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of cortical zzso of zzso created zzso cortical zzso and to assess the sensitivity of zzso CT, and MR imaging in the detection and measurement of such zzso 

zzso cortical zzso were created in three fresh zzso zzso After performing zzso CT, and MR imaging, we zzso the specimens in the zzso zzso We then measured the remaining zzso at the zzso and the normal zzso adjacent to the zzso on all images and corresponding zzso zzso The zzso of thickness of the zzso as seen with the different imaging methods and the zzso sections were zzso zzso were repeated to evaluate the influence of different window settings on the MR imaging zzso 

When measured on zzso cortical thickness was overestimated in zzso of zzso With CT, cortical thickness was overestimated by zzso in zzso of all zzso With MR imaging, cortical thickness was zzso underestimated by zzso zzso made on MR images varied according to different window zzso The zzso zzso sequence yielded the highest sensitivity in the detection of shallow cortical zzso the zzso zzso sequence was the least sensitive of the MR zzso 

In our zzso study, cortical thickness in the presence of zzso zzso was overestimated on zzso and CT scans and underestimated on MR zzso zzso derived from MR imaging are strongly influenced by the window zzso MR imaging with the zzso zzso sequence is the most sensitive for detection of shallow cortical zzso and is more sensitive than zzso
