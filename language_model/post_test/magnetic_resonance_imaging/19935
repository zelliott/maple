The ability to resolve complex fiber populations in muscular zzso is important for relating tissue structure with mechanical zzso To address this issue in the case of zzso we employed diffusion spectrum imaging zzso an zzso method for determining three-dimensional zzso where zzso populations are zzso zzso By specifically varying zzso field strength, molecular displacement in a tissue can be determined by zzso the echo intensity against zzso strength at fixed zzso pulse zzso The displacement profiles are zzso by zzso three-dimensional zzso icons for each zzso with the zzso shape and size representing the magnitude and direction of the zzso fiber zzso To validate this method, we simulated a zzso experiment within the constraints of arbitrary crossing zzso and determined that zzso accurately depicts the angular relationships between these zzso Considering the fiber relationships in the whole bovine zzso we compared the images obtained by zzso with those obtained by diffusion zzso imaging in an anterior slice of the zzso core, a region known to possess extensive fiber zzso In contrast to diffusion zzso imaging, which depicts the anterior core solely as a region with low zzso due to the presence of zzso fiber zzso zzso shows two distinct fiber zzso with an explicit zzso relationship to each zzso In imaging the whole zzso zzso we discerned zzso of crossing and zzso fibers involving the intrinsic and zzso muscles, which merged at regions of zzso We conclude that zzso has the capacity to determine three-dimensional fiber orientation in structurally complex muscular zzso
