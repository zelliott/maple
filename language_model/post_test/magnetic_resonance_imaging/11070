In zzso small animal imaging with multiple zzso has become an important tool in modern biomedical zzso Indeed, combining exploratory techniques allows simultaneous recording of complementary data, which is required to zzso complex zzso zzso In this field, because of strict technical constraints in zzso an exciting challenge remains in the combination of Nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso offers therefore a very interesting technical zzso Here, we assessed the feasibility of this new combination by theoretically evaluating the ability of the zzso zzso to monitor zzso in a zzso To that aim, we zzso with zzso the effect of an intense magnetic field on the probe field of view and showed that the field should not have an impact on the global efficiency of the zzso
