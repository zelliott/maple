The purpose of this article is to zzso the effects that spatial sampling parameters have on the accuracy of magnetic resonance temperature zzso during high intensity focused ultrasound zzso zzso resolution and position of the sampling grid were considered using experimental and simulated data for two different types of high intensity focused ultrasound heating zzso (a single point and a zzso zzso with maximum measured temperature and zzso dose volume as the zzso It is demonstrated that measurement accuracy is related to the zzso of the temperature distribution, where regions with larger spatial second derivatives require higher zzso The location of the sampling grid relative temperature distribution has a significant effect on the measured zzso When imaging at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution, the measured values for maximum temperature and volume zzso to 240 cumulative equivalent minutes zzso or greater varied by zzso and zzso respectively, for the zzso heating case, and by zzso and zzso respectively, for the zzso circle heating zzso zzso measurement of the maximum temperature required imaging at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution for the zzso heating case and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution for the zzso circle heating zzso
