The primary goal of this study was to test the reliability of zzso language zzso in zzso patients with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with a zzso MR scanner using a simple word generation paradigm and conventional zzso In addition, zzso zzso language zzso analysis and region of interest zzso analysis in the frontal and zzso regions were compared with the zzso zzso test zzso Twenty zzso patients under zzso evaluation were zzso examined by both zzso and zzso The zzso experiment consisted of a word chain task zzso using the conventional headphone set and a sparse zzso In 17 of the 20 patients, data were available for comparison between the two zzso Fifteen of these 17 patients were zzso as left zzso dominant, and 2 patients demonstrated bilateral language representation by both zzso and zzso The highest reliability for zzso was obtained using frontal zzso zzso zzso analysis was less powerful and reliable in all cases but one, while zzso zzso analysis was unreliable as a zzso analysis when compared with zzso The effect of statistical threshold on language zzso prompted for the use of zzso zzso index zzso This study illustrates that zzso language zzso can be performed reliably in a clinical MR setting operating at a low field strength of 1 T without expensive stimulus presentation zzso
