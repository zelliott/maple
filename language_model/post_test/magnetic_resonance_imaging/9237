It is usually difficult to distinguish small zzso tumors via routine or enhanced magnetic resonance zzso zzso The knowledge of normal zzso size is helpful to detect small zzso zzso while very few true zzso data of zzso zzso have been zzso zzso we obtained the accurate reference range of normal zzso volumes in 112 individuals aged zzso years recruited randomly from a healthy community zzso zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance data were obtained using three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso True zzso volumes were measured from zzso images, while estimated volumes were calculated using zzso zzso zzso and zzso All the zzso were divided into three types according to the maximum inner diameter of zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso zzso is zzso with a slight female zzso In the whole sample, we found no gender differences of zzso volume, but a significant gender difference of zzso volume zzso A significant correlation between zzso volume and zzso zzso was zzso After excluding cases with big zzso zzso there were significant correlations between zzso volume and head zzso body height and body weight, zzso This study suggests that zzso zzso zzso may exert an important influence on zzso zzso
