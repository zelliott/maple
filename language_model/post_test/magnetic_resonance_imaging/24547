Previous studies provide evidence that zzso develops in vascular regions exposed to low wall zzso stress zzso and high zzso zzso index zzso zzso flow zzso was analyzed in 70 stroke patients with complex plaques zzso zzso zzso zzso or superimposed zzso and in 12 young healthy zzso The zzso distribution of peak zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in analysis planes positioned directly at the location of 140 complex plaques found in the 70 zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were evaluated in 8 standard analysis planes distributed along the zzso Complex plaques were predominantly found at the inner zzso of the zzso arch and of the descending zzso High zzso was zzso with the segments mostly affected by complex plaque while zzso demonstrated a zzso zzso In standard analysis planes, patients demonstrated significantly zzso altered distribution of wall parameters compared to volunteers zzso zzso in zzso of zzso wall zzso increased zzso in zzso of zzso zzso distribution was zzso with higher values at the inner zzso of the zzso While zzso and zzso showed expected changes in patients compared to healthy controls, their distribution pattern at complex plaques indicated a more complex and zzso relationship than previously zzso
