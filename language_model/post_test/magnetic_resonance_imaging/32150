The extent of cortical zzso might correlate with the severity of the clinical zzso such as cognitive delay or motor zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical features of zzso in patients with unilateral and bilateral zzso We studied 44 consecutive patients with zzso diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso features were analyzed in detail: frequency of zzso median age at onset of zzso zzso of seizures, characteristic features of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso drug zzso We also verified the presence of motor zzso Data were analyzed according to the presence of unilateral or bilateral zzso and to the presence of zzso versus zzso zzso We used the zzso test and Fisher exact test for statistical zzso zzso patients had a unilateral zzso zzso 1) and 20 patients had bilateral zzso zzso zzso Ages ranged from 1 to 37 years zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in 15 zzso patients in group 1 and in 11 zzso patients of group 2; a history of status zzso occurred in zzso of group 1 and in zzso in group 2; and a history of clusters of zzso occurred in zzso of group 1 and in zzso of group zzso Eight zzso patients in group 1 and 6 zzso patients in group 2 were in zzso Ten zzso patients in group 1 and 7 zzso patients in group 2 had zzso controlled with zzso zzso The frequency of zzso abnormalities was similar between groups zzso and zzso groups 1 and 2, zzso zzso analysis showed no difference between the two groups in the variables mentioned zzso However, motor disability was significantly more frequent and more severe in group zzso Regarding the type of zzso zzso lip versus closed zzso there was no difference in the frequency of patients with zzso and severe motor deficit was more frequently found in bilateral and zzso zzso The extent of the cortical zzso in patients with zzso does not correlate with the severity of the clinical and zzso features of zzso unlike the cognitive and motor zzso In addition, the type of zzso zzso lip versus closed zzso does not correlate with the presence of zzso or seizure control, unlike motor zzso
