Muscle power is more functionally relevant than zzso muscle strength, particularly with zzso However, the effect of age on power derived from zzso zzso has been studied zzso and it has not been studied at all in subjects zzso zzso of zzso Thus the purpose was to investigate the magnitude and causes of age-related losses in zzso power among 13 young zzso zzso 13 old (65 zzso and 13 very old zzso zzso zzso Six different loads were employed to create zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso area was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging for the calculation of specific zzso zzso signals of the zzso anterior and zzso muscles were recorded to assess zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Despite similar zzso masses and levels of voluntary drive and zzso zzso power was significantly impaired in the old zzso young zzso zzso and in the very old relative to both the young zzso zzso and old zzso zzso The novel results punctuate two important considerations for studies concerned with the effect of age on the zzso zzso First, the decreased ability of muscles from old men to produce power in the presence of reasonably zzso strength indicates the utility of studying zzso zzso Second, the precipitous decline in many measures between the seventh and ninth decades underscores the benefit of testing more than one group of aged subjects to improve our understanding of rates of change in key zzso
