zzso resonance zzso field strength is one of the key aspects to consider when purchasing MR zzso Other aspects include the zzso system, zzso design, computer and pulse sequence zzso purchase cost, local reimbursement policies, and current opinion within the medical zzso Our objective here is to evaluate the zzso aspects of the MR market, with a focus on some specific areas such as high resolution studies, examination times, special techniques, zzso open design zzso costs and reimbursement policies, academic and industrial interests, contrast media, clinical zzso and finally, zzso zzso Certainly the advantage of zzso is a higher zzso ratio and improved zzso With a zzso unit, higher spatial resolution images and higher zzso resolution images can be zzso Typical imaging times needed to produce clinically diagnostic images are about 3 times longer at zzso T than at zzso or zzso zzso zzso advanced techniques, such as functional imaging, zzso and zzso may become clinically useful in the near zzso As long as there is an unlimited demand for MR zzso it appears financially profitable to run a zzso system, despite the associated higher zzso However, if demand for MR becomes zzso zzso systems will cause less financial strain on the reimbursement zzso and service zzso Recent emphasis on cost zzso the development of zzso techniques, the increased use of MR for patients in intensive care and operating suites, the deployment of magnets in office suites, and the development of new magnet zzso all zzso the supplementary use of zzso zzso zzso MR units of all field strengths have a role in zzso
