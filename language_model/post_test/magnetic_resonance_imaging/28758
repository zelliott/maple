To measure magnetic resonance parameters zzso and zzso of the fetal lungs and investigate the relationship of these parameters to changes in volume and zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

Large teaching hospital in Nottingham and the zzso zzso Centre at the University of zzso 

zzso zzso from 20 weeks to zzso 

zzso zzso and lung volume were measured in the fetus using zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

The relationship of zzso and zzso to zzso age and lung zzso 

Linear zzso demonstrated a significant relationship zzso zzso zzso between zzso age and lung volume, zzso and zzso There was also a significant relationship between lung volume and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso time zzso give additional information to lung volume zzso in the assessment of lung physiology in zzso We have demonstrated the progressive changes which take place in the fetal lungs between 20 weeks and zzso The zzso changes which can be demonstrated with this zzso technique may have an important application in the demonstration of fetal lung maturity in a prospective zzso zzso
