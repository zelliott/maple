To zzso evaluate zzso and dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging relative to zzso MR imaging in differentiation of benign from zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate which MR imaging parameters are most zzso of zzso with associated zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso consecutive patients (78 male patients zzso age, 51 zzso 62 female patients zzso age, 53 zzso with a zzso mass underwent zzso zzso and dynamic contrast zzso MR zzso Diagnosis was based on zzso findings in surgical specimens zzso of zzso findings at zzso biopsy zzso of zzso or results of all imaging procedures with clinical follow-up (11 of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to identify the best combination of MR imaging parameters that might be zzso of zzso zzso overall performance of two observers was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic zzso 

For zzso overall diagnosis, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, a measure for diagnostic zzso was significantly larger for combined zzso and zzso MR imaging than it was for zzso MR imaging alone, with no significant difference between zzso zzso analysis of all zzso revealed that combined zzso zzso and dynamic zzso MR imaging parameters were significantly superior to zzso MR imaging parameters alone and to zzso MR imaging parameters combined with zzso zzso MR imaging parameters in prediction of zzso The most discriminating parameters were presence of zzso start of dynamic enhancement zzso zzso between start of zzso and tumor zzso and zzso size zzso zzso for zzso zzso were the same, with one zzso With dynamic zzso MR imaging zzso diagnostic performance of one observer did not zzso 

zzso and dynamic zzso MR imaging, when added to zzso MR imaging, improved differentiation between benign and zzso zzso zzso
