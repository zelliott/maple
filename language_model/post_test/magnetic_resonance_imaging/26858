a series of 9 patients surgically treated with a novel combined zzso zzso zzso approach to lateral mass of the zzso zzso is zzso 

to describe the efficacy of combined zzso and zzso zzso approach in achieving a wide exposure and aggressive zzso of tumors at the zzso 

the zzso complexity and closeness to vital zzso structures raise technical difficulties in the surgical access to the zzso Although various approaches, such as zzso approach, high anterior cervical approach, anterior lateral approach, and far lateral approach, have been reported in literature, wide exposure for the tumors at the zzso remains a unique zzso 

for our experience in the surgical exposure of the upper cervical spine, we have developed a combined zzso and zzso zzso approach to the zzso since zzso Nine patients with zzso zzso at the zzso were surgically treated through this combined zzso Reconstruction of stability was achieved by a zzso zzso fusion through a zzso approach under the same zzso 

this combined approach provided an excellent surgical field exposure to ensure the successful tumor zzso while preventing the zzso artery or nerve from zzso There was no operative mortality or severe morbidity in this zzso zzso included 1 instance of transient zzso and 2 instances of transient trouble swallowing zzso The symptoms of local pain and zzso discomfort zzso and patients suffering from spinal zzso zzso recovered well with 1 level of the Frankel scale when reevaluated 3 months after zzso With a follow-up period of 16 to 100 months, 1 patient with zzso developed local recurrence at the 14th month of zzso and died of respiratory and circulatory failure 39 months after zzso No evidence of local recurrence was found in other zzso 

the combined zzso and zzso zzso approach provides an advantageous alternative to previous reported zzso For selected cases with tumor zzso at the zzso this combined approach offers more benefits, through which a wide exposure with zzso zzso artery favoring radical zzso could be achieved without complications normally associated with zzso zzso
