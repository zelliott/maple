In the zzso brain the zzso response to a brief external stimulus changes significantly during zzso zzso changes in human infants would complicate the determination and use of the zzso response function zzso for functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in developing zzso We aimed to characterize zzso in human infants before and after the normal time of birth using rapid sampling of the blood oxygen level dependent zzso zzso A zzso stimulus and an event related experimental design were used to collect data from 10 healthy adults, 15 zzso infants at term corrected post zzso age zzso zzso zzso weeks), and 10 zzso infants zzso zzso zzso zzso A positive zzso zzso zzso was identified across all subject groups, with a systematic zzso trend in terms of decreasing zzso and increasing positive peak zzso associated with increasing zzso Application of the zzso zzso models to zzso data significantly improved the precision of the zzso zzso These findings support the notion of a structured development in the zzso response to stimuli across the last zzso of gestation and zzso
