Three novel zzso complexes bearing zzso zzso are reported and their ability to enhance water zzso and zzso relaxation times is investigated in zzso Two of them contain one coordinated water zzso and display zzso values only slightly smaller than those shown by the most clinically used contrast agents zzso zzso Moreover, in these zzso zzso the exchange rate of the coordinated water is zzso one order of magnitude higher if compared to the exchange rates previously reported for zzso complexes with zzso zzso The occurrence of such fast exchange rates of the coordinated water is exploited in the formation of zzso zzso with human serum zzso to attain systems displaying zzso values in the upper range of those so far reported for analogous zzso zzso These results strongly support the view that zzso complexes, in spite of the lower effective magnetic moment, can be considered as viable alternatives to the currently used zzso complexes as contrast agents for zzso zzso
