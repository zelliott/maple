zzso research indicates that healthy aging is accompanied by maintenance of voluntary zzso function in many situations, suggesting older adults are able to use attention to enhance and suppress neural zzso However, other experiments show increased zzso with age, suggesting a failure of zzso One hypothesis for these apparently conflicting findings is that older adults experience a greater sensory processing load at baseline compared to younger zzso In this situation, older adults might successfully zzso sensory cortical activity relative to a baseline zzso condition, but the increased baseline load results in more activity than younger adults after zzso zzso This hypothesis was tested by comparing average functional brain activity in auditory zzso using quantitative zzso imaging during resting state and zzso visual zzso It was observed that older adults demonstrated greater processing of zzso auditory background noise than younger adults in both zzso As expected, auditory activity was attenuated relative to rest during a visually engaging task for both older and younger zzso However, older adults continued to show greater auditory processing than their younger counterparts even after this task zzso Furthermore, auditory activity during the visual task was zzso of zzso distraction on a behavioral task in older zzso Together, these findings suggest that older adults are more zzso than younger, and the cause of this increased zzso may lie in baseline brain zzso
