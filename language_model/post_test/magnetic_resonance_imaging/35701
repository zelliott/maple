zzso cases are presented in which magnetic resonance zzso imaging demonstrated two types of zzso in patients with cervical zzso zzso In the first type, localized spinal zzso changes at the level of zzso consistent with zzso were revealed best with zzso images as high-intensity spinal zzso zzso In the second type, zzso consistent with either zzso necrosis or secondary zzso were noted locally, and/or extending zzso up, and/or down inside the spinal zzso These latter zzso were best revealed as zzso signals on zzso MR images and as a zzso sign zzso zzso on zzso or zzso MR zzso It is suggested that zzso zzso at the level of the zzso bar represent early zzso changes from pressure in and around the same zones that evolve into zzso enhancement regions shown as zzso on delayed computerized zzso zzso after zzso The zzso zzso are thought to be the same zzso zones of zzso necrosis evolving into a secondary zzso in the late stages (and usually found in the anterior portion of the zzso columns during delayed CT after zzso As spinal MR imaging continues to improve, these zzso will be demonstrated more clearly within the zzso zzso
