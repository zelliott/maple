Volunteers have undergone radio frequency zzso in a magnetic resonance zzso imaging system to investigate which of several possible MR parameters would be most convenient and sensitive to use to observe in zzso temperature zzso zzso were made for zzso zzso and zzso and diffusion variations, although the number of sequences needed at each temperature meant that the number of data points zzso was zzso However, in the temperature range studied zzso zzso degrees zzso changes in both zzso and the diffusion zzso were observed that agreed quite well with those predicted theoretically zzso around zzso C and zzso zzso
