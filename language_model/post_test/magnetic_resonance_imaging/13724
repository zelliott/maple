While electron zzso resonance imaging zzso enables spatial mapping of free zzso in the whole body of small animals, it solely zzso the zzso distribution and does not typically provide zzso zzso of the zzso However, zzso registration is often required for meaningful interpretation of the zzso zzso zzso An approach is reported for zzso zzso zzso imaging along with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with a zzso narrow band zzso bridge and zzso oriented electric field zzso zzso with automatic zzso control and automatic tuning control zzso was used to map the spatial distribution of zzso free zzso in zzso and in living mice, while zzso zzso zzso at 16 zzso was used to define the zzso structure to register the zzso zzso Small zzso tubes containing an zzso radical label were used as markers to enable image zzso With this zzso technique, the zzso zzso images were precisely zzso enabling assignment of the location of the observed zzso distribution within the zzso of the zzso This technique enabled differentiation of the distribution and metabolism of zzso zzso within the major zzso and body sites of living zzso
