In recent years, the demonstration that structural changes can occur in the human brain beyond those associated with development, zzso and zzso has revealed a new approach to studying the neural basis of zzso In this review paper, we focus on structural imaging studies of language that have zzso zzso measures in order to investigate the neural zzso of language skills in the undamaged zzso We report studies that have used two different zzso zzso zzso of whole brain zzso or white matter images and diffusion zzso zzso At present, there are relatively few structural imaging studies of zzso We group them into those that investigated zzso the perception of novel speech sounds, zzso the links between speech sounds and their meaning, zzso speech production, and zzso zzso We highlight the zzso of the findings by comparing the results to those from functional imaging zzso Finally, we conclude by zzso the novel contribution of these studies to date and potential directions for future zzso
