We used zzso zzso to identify the brain regions engaged during explicit and implicit sequence learning zzso and zzso zzso zzso subjects performed a concurrent zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed learning in both zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and visual regions zzso V2 and zzso were engaged during both zzso and zzso With zzso there was increased activity in the visual regions on the predictable zzso learned zzso zzso With zzso however, there was a relative decrease in activity in visual zzso The opposite patterns in the visual regions highlight the different effects of zzso and zzso The learning process was distinguished from the result of learning, by fitting subjects' functional magnetic resonance imaging data to their learning zzso This analysis revealed more extensive zzso activity during zzso and zzso zzso activity specific for the result of learning analysis, when the expected response was zzso Our results suggest a relative zzso of the brain regions engaged during zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be viewed as partially distinct but overlapping parallel zzso
