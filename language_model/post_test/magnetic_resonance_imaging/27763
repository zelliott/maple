zzso stress plays an important role in multiple sclerosis zzso zzso are zzso for zzso stress and have been related to neurological disease zzso 

To study whether plasma zzso levels were related to disease progression in zzso 

Plasma levels of zzso were determined in 17 patients with clinically isolated syndrome zzso 41 zzso zzso zzso patients and 5 primary progressive zzso zzso patients and related to zzso and clinical disease zzso 

zzso levels were similar in zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso The plasma levels were lower in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso and zzso patients in this zzso which was not confirmed in a second zzso zzso zzso levels were not related to clinical progression defined by conversion form zzso to zzso or change in Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Composite zzso scores during six years of follow-up zzso + zzso nor to change in volume of zzso enhancing zzso zzso zzso load or zzso zzso zzso load during zzso years of follow-up zzso + zzso 

These results do not support a strong role of zzso in the prediction of disease progression in zzso
