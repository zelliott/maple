It has been hypothesized that increased flux through the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required to support the zzso demands of rapid zzso cell zzso Using zzso mouse models of human zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso to brain, we estimated the activity of the zzso relative to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio was similar for both the zzso and brain zzso and their respective surrounding brains zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that the rate of zzso is significantly greater than the zzso flux in these tumors, and that the zzso flux into the zzso pool is similar in both zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso was observed in molecules derived from zzso cycle zzso in both tumor types, denoting zzso zzso In the zzso cell zzso in contrast with zzso zzso C zzso of zzso acid zzso differed from its precursor zzso suggesting that zzso did not derive from a common zzso precursor zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso the patient's primary zzso mass and brain zzso were all strongly zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as were zzso of tumors on a zzso cell zzso tissue zzso of the same zzso suggesting that zzso synthesis is cell autonomous in at least a subset of zzso cell zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso can be used in zzso mouse models to study tumor metabolism in zzso and to ascertain new zzso targets for cancer diagnosis and zzso
