To study the change in serum levels of soluble zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors zzso in zzso patients in relation to clinical disease activity and changes on brain zzso 

zzso forms of zzso molecules or soluble receptors may be released from cells as a consequence of zzso and may be useful markers for zzso 

During a prospective zzso study over 1 year, 40 patients with zzso underwent frequent imaging of the brain zzso MR images per zzso at the time of blood sampling as well as monthly zzso zzso and scoring on zzso Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso index zzso 

Patients with zzso disease had the highest levels of zzso whereas patients with progressive disease had the highest levels of zzso zzso in zzso correlated with the occurrence of attacks in patients with zzso and zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso an increase in zzso level preceded the appearance of new zzso zzso enhancing zzso on zzso In patients with progressive disease, an increase in zzso zzso level preceded the appearance of new zzso enhancing zzso on zzso whereas a decrease in zzso levels correlated with the appearance of new zzso enhancing zzso 

These results demonstrate a linkage between zzso and zzso levels and disease activity in zzso Furthermore, patients with progressive disease appear to have a different zzso stage of disease in which immune changes are tightly linked with changes on zzso The demonstration of a correlation in individual patients between zzso events and changes in disease activity has implications for monitoring patients undergoing treatment and for monitoring disease zzso
