The efficacy of surgical zzso reconstruction zzso for zzso zzso has never been truly zzso zzso to assess zzso flow have not been applied to these zzso The objective is to develop a zzso technique for assessing the effects of zzso zzso and zzso on left zzso blood flow zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance images from a healthy volunteer and from a patient before and after zzso were segmented and transformed to generate a grid model of the heart by generating zzso zzso and running zzso approximations to achieve zzso grid images per cardiac zzso These zzso formed the skeletal structure of our zzso zzso zzso geometry model, the zzso Heart Model, used for modeling fluid zzso We modeled flow, ejection zzso and blood zzso from the zzso The model was validated using a silicone zzso and mock zzso 

In the healthy heart and before zzso ejection zzso were zzso and zzso and left zzso volumes were 166 zzso and 175 zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstruction decreased left zzso volume by one zzso zzso ejection fraction was zzso in the zzso zzso shape was more zzso than preoperatively and also more zzso than the healthy zzso zzso flow patterns in the patient were significantly altered by zzso However, fluid zzso from the zzso was similar before and after zzso but worse than in the healthy zzso 

zzso dynamic modeling of the heart is possible based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging data and enables zzso quantitative assessment of the surgical zzso In the future, zzso modeling for patients with remodeled zzso may help to achieve zzso zzso flow characteristics and potentially zzso
