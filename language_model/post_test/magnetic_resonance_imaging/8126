This study investigated the relationship between zzso zzso power and zzso zzso rate zzso over the human zzso to better understand the mechanisms involved in the decline of neural activity with zzso 

zzso zzso power was calculated in standard frequency bands and averaged across recording sites in 1831 healthy subjects aged 6 to 86 years, from the Brain Resource International zzso In a subset of 175 subjects, structural zzso scans were also undertaken to determine the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso was estimated using two models of zzso power, based on: zzso zzso of zzso by total body mass, and zzso zzso by cortical zzso zzso 

zzso analysis revealed a linear relationship between the zzso estimates and zzso power under both zzso In the full sample, zzso explained zzso of the zzso in delta power, and zzso of the zzso in zzso power over the age zzso 

The results demonstrate that the large zzso signals in early childhood are associated with a higher zzso during that zzso 

The use of zzso zzso in this study highlights the utility of capturing data in an zzso framework to reveal fundamental zzso zzso
