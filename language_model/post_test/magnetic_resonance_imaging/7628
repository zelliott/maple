It was the aim of the present study to investigate zzso cycle effects on selective attention and its underlying functional cerebral zzso zzso healthy, zzso normally cycling women were investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging using a zzso paradigm during the zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the behavioral level there was a significant interaction between visual half field and cycle phase with reaction times to zzso compared to zzso stimuli being faster in the zzso compared to the zzso zzso These results might argue for a more pronounced functional cerebral asymmetry toward the left zzso in selective attention during the zzso phase with low zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging, however, did not reveal clear-cut zzso zzso changes in zzso pattern in parallel to these behavioral zzso A functional connectivity analysis identified differences between the zzso and the zzso zzso During the zzso phase, left inferior zzso zzso showed a stronger negative correlation with the right middle frontal zzso while the left zzso frontal zzso showed a stronger negative correlation with the left middle frontal zzso These results can serve as further evidence of a zzso effect of steroid hormones on networks of zzso cognitive functions not only by zzso zzso but also by affecting zzso functional zzso
