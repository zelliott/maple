zzso models of zzso such as the zzso E zzso or the LDL zzso knockout mice, usually do not exhibit many of the zzso features of human coronary heart disease zzso zzso spontaneous zzso zzso severe cardiac dysfunction, and premature zzso Here we show that mice with zzso zzso zzso in the genes for both the high density zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso double knockout zzso zzso exhibit zzso and functional defects with similarities to those seen in human zzso When fed a standard zzso diet, these zzso animals developed significant zzso zzso in the zzso zzso as early as 4 to 5 weeks after zzso We now show that they also exhibited extensive zzso coronary artery zzso and spontaneously developed multiple zzso zzso and cardiac dysfunction zzso enlarged hearts, reduced ejection fraction and zzso and zzso zzso Their coronary zzso zzso which were zzso similar to human zzso zzso exhibited evidence of cholesterol zzso and extensive zzso deposition, indicating zzso and zzso All of the zzso mice died by 8 weeks of age zzso mortality at 6 zzso Thus, zzso zzso mice provide a new zzso model for zzso and may help better define the role of zzso metabolism and zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and cardiac zzso Furthermore, these animals may be useful for zzso testing of potential genetic and/or pharmacological therapies for zzso
