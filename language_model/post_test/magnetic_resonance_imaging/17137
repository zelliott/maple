The role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso has recently been enhanced in the diagnosis of zzso fractures due to its ability to examine soft tissue zzso 

We conducted a prospective study to analyze the usefulness of zzso in fracture diagnosis and its influence on treatment decision zzso zzso patients were enrolled after suffering an acute traumatic zzso zzso zzso or zzso fractures were zzso zzso were initially classified using X-ray and CT scan following the zzso zzso Afterward, a selective zzso protocol was performed with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fractures were classified according to the zzso system and reclassified following the zzso zzso Analysis was performed before and after zzso focusing on: diagnostic changes, zzso fractures and differences in treatment decision zzso 

Thirty patients (15 zzso 15 zzso with an average age of zzso years were zzso zzso fractures were initially diagnosed using plain zzso and CT scans, while zzso diagnosed 50 fractures and 9 zzso zzso zzso modified our diagnosis in zzso of our patients zzso 18 zzso zzso the zzso of fracture pattern in zzso of the fractures zzso upgrading type A to type B zzso and the therapeutic management in zzso of our zzso 

zzso seems to be a useful tool in the evaluation of zzso acute fractures, as it allows a better zzso of the zzso complex integrity and of the levels involved, offering additional information compared to traditional diagnostic zzso
