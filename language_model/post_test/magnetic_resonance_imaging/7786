zzso zzso plaques in zzso zzso matter zzso are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease zzso and can be zzso in zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso burden in cortical zzso has been shown to improve diagnosis and monitoring of zzso However, lacking structural information in PET images requires such assessments to be performed with anatomical zzso scans, which may not be available at different clinical settings or being zzso for particular zzso This study aimed to develop an zzso zzso imaging zzso method that requires only PET images for reliable zzso burden zzso 

The proposed method has been developed using a zzso based approach on zzso scans from 143 subjects (75 zzso and 68 zzso subjects) in zzso zzso A subset of 20 subjects zzso and zzso were used as zzso 1) zzso images were zzso with tissue zzso 2) zzso surface at the zzso zzso was extracted and registered to a zzso space; 3) Mean zzso retention within zzso was estimated and mapped to the zzso For other participants, each zzso PET image (and zzso was registered to the zzso PET image for zzso zzso within zzso The results are combined by zzso zzso selection and zzso fusion to generate estimated surface zzso 

All zzso subjects (N zzso 75) were highly correlated between the zzso and the zzso methods with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and an average relative difference error of zzso (or zzso zzso per surface zzso All zzso subjects (N zzso zzso revealed visually akin patterns with a relative difference error of zzso (or zzso zzso per surface zzso 

The demonstrated accuracy suggests that the proposed method could be an effective clinical inspection tool for zzso imaging scans when zzso images are zzso
