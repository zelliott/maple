Brain zzso occur commonly in patients with lung zzso Small vessel zzso disease is frequently found when imaging the brain to detect zzso We aimed to determine if the presence of small vessel zzso disease zzso of the brain is protective against the development of brain zzso in lung cancer zzso 

A retrospective cohort of 523 patients with biopsy confirmed lung cancer who had received magnetic resonance imaging of the brain as part of their standard initial staging evaluation was zzso Information collected included zzso zzso details of the lung cancer, and the presence of zzso of the zzso A portion of the cohort had the degree of zzso zzso The primary outcome measure was the portion of study subjects with and without zzso of the brain who had evidence of brain zzso at the time of initial staging of their lung zzso patients zzso had evidence of brain zzso at presentation and 345 zzso had evidence of zzso zzso of those with zzso and zzso of those without zzso presented with brain zzso zzso In a model including age, diabetes zzso hypertension, zzso and tobacco use, zzso of the brain was found to be the only protective factor against the development of brain zzso with an OR of zzso zzso zzso zzso The grade of zzso was higher in those without brain zzso 

These findings suggest that vascular changes in the brain are protective against the development of brain zzso in lung cancer zzso
