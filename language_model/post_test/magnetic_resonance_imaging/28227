The purpose of the study was to examine zzso and zzso features of patients with concurrent Tourette's disorder zzso and zzso syndrome zzso 

The authors studied the occurrence of structural brain abnormalities using magnetic resonance imaging zzso in seven males with concurrent TD and zzso and in nine zzso zzso who had TD but did not have zzso Both groups were tested with an extensive battery of neurological and psychiatric rating scales and cognitive zzso 

Five of the seven patients with TD and AS had zzso brain zzso In contrast, normal zzso scans were found in all but one TD patient without zzso Both groups were not significantly different in the severity of motor and zzso zzso zzso depression and anxiety, or in measures of general intelligence, memory, and language zzso but patients with TD and AS had a history of more psychiatric hospitalizations, poor academic achievement, more neurological soft signs and appeared more impaired on complex problem-solving and spatial tests than did TD patients without zzso 

These findings suggest that structural cortical and zzso abnormalities are more common among individuals with concurrent TD and AS than among zzso and zzso TD patients without zzso zzso of zzso systems may play a role in the zzso of concurrent TD and zzso
