Seven patients with Carney complex underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso ultrasound zzso zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso zzso 6) in a prospective zzso Previous breast images in three patients were zzso zzso in two additional patients were zzso zzso Thus, nine patients aged zzso were included in this zzso 

zzso showed zzso zzso or zzso zzso most were not zzso Two zzso contained zzso both were zzso zzso zzso US demonstrated solid, zzso zzso masses in six patients and complex zzso masses zzso zzso in one zzso MR imaging with a zzso fast zzso zzso sequence demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images demonstrated zzso zzso with variable contrast material enhancement zzso zzso zzso Five of seven patients in the prospective review had multiple breast zzso on at least one zzso zzso and US scans were negative in three patients zzso zzso and breast MR images were negative in only one zzso 

Female patients with Carney complex often have multiple breast masses with variable imaging appearances that probably represent zzso zzso or zzso zzso MR imaging showed the most zzso These zzso all demonstrate benign characteristics and should not prompt multiple zzso
