To compare zzso zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing acute zzso zzso and to assess zzso measurement reliability in zzso among normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso patients zzso women, mean age zzso zzso with clinical suspicion of zzso were zzso zzso An experienced observer zzso zzso with a score ranging from 0 to zzso zzso and zzso were compared on the basis of the assigned score, total examination number zzso and on presence zzso zzso of zzso zzso values, calculated at the healthy zzso zzso and zzso were compared to each zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso was zzso % zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso was awarded the highest visibility score compared to zzso zzso while in the zzso group zzso had the highest score zzso The difference between zzso values of the zzso zzso and zzso groups was significant zzso The area under the zzso curve of zzso values of the zzso and zzso groups were found to be zzso (95 % zzso zzso zzso and zzso (95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso imaging appears reliable in the diagnosis and follow-up of acute zzso and could provide a reasonable alternative to zzso magnetic resonance zzso
