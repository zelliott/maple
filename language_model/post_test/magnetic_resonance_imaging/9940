White matter zzso zzso increase cognitive impairment in patients with zzso 

We investigated the impact of zzso on the zzso profiles in patients with mild to moderate zzso 

We zzso recruited newly diagnosed patients with mild to moderate zzso across South Korea for 1 zzso The participants completed zzso tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and structured neurological zzso The patients were divided into 3 categories, zzso zzso moderate, and severe zzso groups, according to the zzso degree of zzso 

zzso patients were zzso 140 zzso for the minimal zzso group, 99 zzso for the moderate group, and 50 zzso for the severe zzso Both advanced age and low general cognitive level were significant contributors to zzso in patients with zzso After adjusting for age, the zzso zzso of the zzso impact of zzso were frontal executive, language, and attention zzso However, the only significant zzso correlate was the recognition memory profile after adjusting for both age and general cognitive level zzso 

The results suggest that the most significant zzso profile zzso the burden of zzso in patients with mild to moderate zzso was the recognition memory profile, regardless of age and general cognitive zzso
