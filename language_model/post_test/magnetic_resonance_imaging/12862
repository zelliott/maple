zzso resonance imaging zzso is a useful tool for evaluating disease activity and therapeutic efficacy in zzso arthritis zzso However, conventional zzso zzso is inconvenient on several zzso We have therefore developed a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and examined its clinical zzso Thirteen zzso patients treated with zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso were included in the zzso The zzso was performed twice using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso images were scored using our proposed zzso scoring system, which we devised with reference to the zzso zzso in zzso Clinical Trials zzso zzso score zzso zzso In our zzso scoring system, zzso bone zzso and bone erosion are separately graded on a scale from 0 to 3 by imaging over the whole hand, including the zzso zzso zzso The total zzso score zzso is then obtained by calculating the total bone erosion score zzso zzso + total bone zzso score zzso zzso + total zzso zzso In this study, one patient showed a progression of bone destruction even under low clinical activity, as assessed by the disease activity score on 28 zzso zzso however, another patient's zzso decreased zzso with the decrease in zzso with the positive correlation observed between zzso and zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso are useful for assessing total disease activity and as a method linking zzso image evaluation to clinical zzso
