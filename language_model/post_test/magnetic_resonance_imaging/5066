zzso zzso are single cells found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are active during action execution and zzso In zzso zzso mirror zzso have only been found in relation to zzso movements or zzso zzso as zzso directed actions of the upper limb are not well characterized in zzso zzso zzso zzso provide important evidence for motor simulation theories of zzso sometimes referred to as the direct matching hypothesis, which propose that observed actions are mapped onto associated motor zzso in a direct and automatic zzso This study, for the first time, directly compares mirror responses, defined as the overlap between action execution and zzso during object directed and meaningless zzso directed zzso We present functional zzso data that demonstrate a clear zzso between object directed and zzso directed actions within the human mirror zzso A zzso and zzso network was zzso active during object directed actions, whether observed or zzso Moreover, we report zzso correlated activity across multiple zzso for observation and execution of an object directed zzso In contrast to predictions made by motor simulation theory, no similar activity was observed for zzso directed zzso These data demonstrate that object directed and meaningless zzso directed actions are zzso by different zzso networks and that the human mirror response is significantly greater for object directed zzso These data have important implications for understanding the human mirror system and for simulation theories of motor zzso zzso theories of motor simulation must account for these differences, possibly by acknowledging the role of experience in modulating the mirror zzso
