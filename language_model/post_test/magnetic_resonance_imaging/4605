The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical efficacy and safety of zzso zzso zzso a zzso iron oxide contrast agent for detection of zzso zzso using conventional zzso and fast zzso MR zzso zzso and zzso MR studies were performed on 25 patients with suspected focal zzso zzso Conventional zzso and zzso MR images, as well as fast zzso and fat suppressed fast zzso MR images, were zzso zzso assessment of the contrast agent was performed obtaining region of interest zzso of the liver, zzso and selected zzso zzso The pulse sequences were also evaluated zzso for overall image quality and a zzso assessment of zzso zzso The use of a zzso iron oxide contrast agent led to a decrease in zzso signal intensity on all pulse zzso zzso contrast increased zzso zzso and zzso on the conventional zzso fast zzso and fat suppressed fast spin echo pulse zzso zzso zzso contrast decreased on the zzso zzso pulse sequence by zzso Despite improvement in zzso contrast, zzso zzso preferred the zzso sequences because of overall better image zzso At a dose of 10 zzso zzso favorably impacts zzso contrast, and may be useful in zzso imaging, more with conventional zzso zzso pulse sequences than with zzso fast zzso pulse zzso
