We previously reported that zzso of zzso cells zzso into the injured site activates neural zzso cells zzso and promotes functional recovery after spinal zzso injury zzso in zzso Working toward clinical application of DC therapy for zzso we analyzed whether zzso promote functional recovery after zzso in a zzso zzso the common zzso zzso zzso are usually born as zzso zzso They are thus natural bone zzso and peripheral blood zzso due to sharing of the zzso circulation between zzso zzso leading to functional immune zzso In this study, to identify adequate CM zzso pairs, mixed zzso reaction zzso zzso were zzso Then, zzso were generated from the bone zzso of the twin selected to be donor and transplanted into the injured site of the spinal zzso of the other twin selected to be host, 7 days after zzso zzso analyses revealed fewer areas of zzso around the injured site in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso analysis showed that more motor zzso and zzso tracts were preserved after zzso in zzso zzso Motor functions were evaluated using three different behavior tests and earlier functional recovery was observed in zzso zzso These results suggest DC therapy to possibly be beneficial in primates with zzso and that this treatment has potential for clinical zzso
