The benefit of combining zzso transfer zzso MR imaging technique with zzso contrast agent zzso zzso zzso was assessed in our experimental zzso The study was accomplished by imaging a phantom containing serial zzso of zzso in zzso bovine serum zzso zzso with various protein zzso A zzso clinical MR zzso with different parameters for zzso and conventional MR sequences were zzso The combination of an offset frequency of 8 zzso and an zzso of 25 zzso produced nearly zzso zzso effect for all protein samples either without zzso or with different zzso zzso With long zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso zzso dramatically improved zzso in conjunction with zzso With short zzso the gain in zzso with zzso was zzso However, long zzso with increased number of images are beneficial in liver zzso We conclude that zzso like preparation pulse is useful when zzso contrast agents such as zzso are zzso
