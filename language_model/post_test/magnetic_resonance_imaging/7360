zzso echo time zzso zzso has been proposed as a way to produce segmented zzso maps for zzso as it provides contrast between bone, air, and soft zzso However, zzso sequences require samples to be acquired during rapidly changing zzso fields, which makes the resulting images prone to zzso current zzso In this work it is demonstrated that this can lead to zzso of zzso in segmented zzso maps zzso zzso and that these effects can be corrected for by measuring the true zzso zzso using a magnetic field zzso 

The zzso zzso during a dual echo zzso sequence were measured using a dynamic magnetic field zzso zzso images were reconstructed using nominal zzso and again using the measured zzso A zzso phantom was used to demonstrate the effect of reconstructing with incorrect zzso Images of an zzso leg phantom were reconstructed and segmented and the resulting zzso maps were compared to a segmented map derived from a CT scan of the same zzso using the zzso similarity zzso The feasibility of the proposed method was demonstrated in in zzso zzso imaging in five healthy zzso zzso PET data were generated for one volunteer to show the impact of zzso on the PET zzso 

Images of the zzso phantom exhibited blurring and edge artifacts on the zzso and zzso zzso when nominal zzso zzso were used, leading to zzso of soft tissue as bone and zzso of bone as zzso Images of the tissue phantom and the in zzso zzso images exhibited the same zzso The artifacts were greatly reduced when the measured zzso were zzso For the tissue zzso the zzso zzso for bone in MR relative to CT was zzso using the nominal zzso and zzso using the measured zzso The zzso zzso for soft tissue were zzso and zzso for the nominal and measured cases, zzso For air the corresponding figures were zzso and zzso Compared to an zzso reference image, the mean error in simulated PET zzso in the brain was zzso when zzso maps derived from nominal zzso was used, with errors in the zzso max for simulated zzso in the range of zzso zzso figures when zzso maps derived from measured zzso were used were zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso 

Eddy current artifacts in zzso imaging can be corrected for by measuring the true zzso zzso during a zzso scan and using them in subsequent image zzso This improves the accuracy of segmented PET zzso maps derived from zzso sequences and subsequent PET zzso
