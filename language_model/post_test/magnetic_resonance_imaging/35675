To investigate the association between fish consumption and zzso brain zzso 

In the zzso zzso Health zzso zzso participants age zzso or zzso underwent an zzso scan in zzso Five years later, zzso were zzso zzso assessed zzso scans in a standardized and blinded zzso Food frequency questionnaires were used to assess dietary zzso Participants with known cerebrovascular disease were excluded from the zzso 

After adjustment for multiple risk factors, the risk of having one or more prevalent zzso zzso was lower among those consuming zzso fish zzso or zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso p trend zzso zzso zzso fish consumption was also associated with trends toward lower zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso fish intake was associated with better white matter grade, but not with zzso and zzso grades, markers of brain zzso No significant associations were found between fried fish consumption and any zzso brain zzso 

Among older adults, modest consumption of zzso fish, but not fried fish, was associated with lower prevalence of zzso zzso and white matter abnormalities on zzso zzso Our results add to prior evidence that suggest that dietary intake of fish with higher zzso acid and zzso acid content, and not fried fish zzso may have clinically important health zzso
