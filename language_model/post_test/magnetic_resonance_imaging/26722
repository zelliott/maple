The objective of this retrospective study was to identify clinical and zzso features in children with zzso zzso that predict MR imaging abnormalities and seizure zzso 

Patients with clinical and/or zzso features indicating zzso lobe involvement were identified from the zzso database at a zzso children's zzso The clinical and zzso features were analyzed to identify the most important zzso of abnormal MR imaging and seizure zzso 

zzso patients were zzso 21 had symptomatic zzso with abnormal MR zzso 12 patients had probable symptomatic zzso based on an abnormal neurological exam; 33 patients had normal neurological development, normal neurological examination and normal zzso Twenty-two of these 33 patients satisfied criteria for idiopathic zzso zzso zzso syndrome (9 zzso zzso type idiopathic childhood zzso zzso (12 zzso and idiopathic zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso Eleven patients could not be zzso Early age of seizure onset and an abnormal neurological examination were significant zzso of abnormal MR zzso None of the variables examined were strong zzso of seizure zzso 

Early age of seizure onset and an abnormal neurological examination are the best zzso of abnormal MR imaging in children with zzso with zzso zzso
