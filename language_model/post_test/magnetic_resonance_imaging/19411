The purpose of this study was the development of a method for fast and efficient analysis of dynamic MR images of the female zzso The image data sets were acquired with a zzso zzso sequence which enables the detection of the zzso of the contrast agent concentration in the whole breast with a high zzso and spatial zzso In addition, a zzso zzso data set was zzso 

The dynamic image zzso were analyzed by a zzso model which enables the representation of the relevant functional tissue information by two zzso In order to display simultaneously zzso and functional tissue information, we developed a zzso zzso system, which enables a practical and intuitive zzso interface in virtual zzso 

The developed system allows the fast and efficient analysis of dynamic MR data zzso An important clinical application is the zzso and definition of multiple zzso of the female zzso
