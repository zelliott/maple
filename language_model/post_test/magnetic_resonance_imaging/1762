The aim of the study was to assess whether zzso has a zzso value at an early stage of Bell's zzso 

zzso blinded study on 30 patients suffering from Bell's zzso who came to hospital until the sixth day of illness, to receive high doses steroid zzso zzso was done on the first day of zzso treatment as a zzso with a slice thickness of zzso zzso before and after zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso The signal intensity increase was evaluated zzso by region on interest zzso The results were compared to the clinical outcome and the results of zzso 

The examinations of all patients could be zzso The 3 patients who developed a chronic facial paralysis were detected by zzso on the first day of zzso zzso The patients, who showed MR signs for an zzso course, had a highly significant zzso compound muscle action potential zzso as a result of the zzso zzso Rather than using complex measurement procedures it is possible to obtain reliable zzso information from just one measurement within the Internal auditory canal before and after zzso zzso administration of zzso 

zzso has a zzso value at an early stage of the zzso In the clinical setting this measurement is easy to perform, so that it is possible to obtain zzso information at a stage when zzso treatment is still zzso
