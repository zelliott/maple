zzso zzso delivery zzso of an zzso virus zzso 2 zzso zzso containing the human aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso gene for the treatment of Parkinson disease zzso has completed a phase I clinical zzso 

To zzso analyze magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data from the phase I trial, correlate those data with similar nonhuman zzso zzso data, and present how such information may improve future zzso gene therapy trials in preparation for the initiation of the phase II zzso 

Ten patients with zzso had been treated with bilateral zzso zzso infusions of zzso zzso and PET scans were obtained at baseline zzso zzso zzso and at various intervals after zzso Three normal adult zzso received similar infusions into the zzso Imaging studies for both groups are zzso as well as zzso zzso for the zzso 

Early zzso zzso confirmed the zzso targeting accuracy and revealed zzso zzso around the zzso zzso zzso best seen within 4 hours of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and PET scans revealed increased PET zzso at the sites of zzso zzso Similar zzso zzso in zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso 

Our analysis confirms the correct targeting of the zzso zzso tracts within the target human zzso zzso of zzso and PET confirms zzso of zzso zzso and increased PET zzso around the zzso zzso zzso Because PET zzso closely zzso with zzso zzso expression and zzso data confirm this relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso we believe that zzso zzso allows zzso of a significant part of the distribution volume of the zzso gene zzso zzso for future protocols based on these data are zzso
