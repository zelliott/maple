The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using magnetic resonance imaging zzso to observe the shape and position of the ice zzso front during primary drying for subsequent comparison of these images with those predicted by mathematical model of heat and mass transfer during primary zzso zzso zzso profile studies on both ice and zzso zzso during in zzso zzso were performed with a single point imaging zzso zzso and demonstrated that the zzso technique can be used in capturing the ice signal during zzso In order to perform two-dimensional imaging, it was found that the ice must be zzso in order to increase the apparent zzso relaxation time zzso and decrease the zzso relaxation time zzso of zzso zzso at a level of zzso zzso was shown to be an effective zzso As a result, zzso images of ice and zzso zzso doped with zzso zzso zzso were successfully collected, and the shape and position of the ice zzso front during in zzso zzso were zzso
