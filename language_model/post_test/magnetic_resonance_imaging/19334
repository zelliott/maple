Several zzso abnormalities of the zzso zzso have been described as occurring in association with zzso growth hormone zzso including zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso Their zzso however, is zzso zzso zzso development is dependent on the sequential expression of a series of zzso zzso Growth zzso hormone zzso is known to stimulate zzso zzso and a dwarf mouse model with a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso has a small anterior zzso due to zzso of the zzso We recently described the human zzso of the little mouse zzso of zzso caused by a zzso nonsense zzso in the zzso zzso gene in a Pakistani zzso We investigated MR imaging characteristics to gain information regarding the potential role of zzso in human zzso zzso 

MR images of the head were obtained of four affected male patients (age range, zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso dimensions were determined from zzso and zzso images, and zzso volumes were estimated from cubic and zzso zzso The zzso were compared with zzso values matched for age and zzso 

The zzso was small in each of the four zzso The zzso height for the anterior zzso was 3 zzso in three patients and 2 zzso in one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is significantly zzso zzso zzso less than the expected height of zzso zzso zzso zzso for men in this age zzso Estimates of anterior zzso volume in the patients ranged from 75 to 124 zzso (104 zzso 21 zzso which zzso to zzso to zzso of the normal mean volume corrected for small head size zzso zzso zzso No other zzso abnormalities were zzso 

We describe significant zzso of the zzso occurring in four dwarfs with a nonsense zzso in the zzso zzso In addition to isolated growth hormone zzso and severe zzso affected patients have anterior zzso zzso presumably due to zzso zzso Resistance to zzso explains the zzso of the zzso feature that contributes to growth hormone zzso in this zzso This is one of the few instances in which the molecular basis of zzso zzso has been zzso
