Multiple overlapping zzso acquisition zzso is a hybrid zzso MR zzso technique that combines the advantages of two- and three-dimensional zzso A zzso zzso artifact, resulting from variations in signal intensity at slab zzso is a potentially significant zzso The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of zzso MR zzso for the measurement of zzso and to evaluate the effectiveness of modifications to reduce the zzso blind zzso 

Fifty-one consecutive patients undergoing conventional and MR zzso of the carotid arteries for suspected zzso disease were zzso zzso established in the North American zzso zzso zzso Trial zzso were used to measure zzso zzso from the conventional zzso were compared with those from the MR zzso zzso of the MR zzso technique that were instituted after the initial 26 patients to reduce the zzso blind artifact included new acquisition parameters and the use of a zzso zzso 

After zzso highly significant improvements in zzso ranked correlation zzso were observed for MR zzso zzso comparison zzso to zzso p zzso zzso and comparison of conventional and MR zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso A corresponding reduction was observed in the standard zzso of the difference measurement for percent zzso for both zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, the zzso correlation zzso for conventional and MR zzso were not significantly different zzso vs zzso The areas under the zzso zzso used to predict surgically significant disease for the zzso and zzso groups were zzso and zzso respectively, for observer A and zzso and zzso respectively, for observer zzso 

zzso acquisition parameters and zzso significantly reduce the severity of the zzso blind artifact and increase the accuracy of zzso MR zzso in the measurement of percent zzso With these improvements, zzso MR zzso shows promise for zzso evaluation of zzso of the carotid zzso
