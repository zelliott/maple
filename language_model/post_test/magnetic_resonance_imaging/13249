zzso at 7 zzso has been used to investigate the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso of common zzso monkeys zzso zzso after administering four zzso injections of 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso in the tail zzso We found a statistically significant decrease in zzso in the primary zzso and secondary zzso areas of the visual zzso caused by an zzso of zzso The larger zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 640 zzso relative to V2 zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed us to robustly detect the zzso border in zzso using heavily zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso areas of the visual zzso could be identified by their zzso zzso We showed by comparison to zzso sections stained for zzso zzso zzso activity that the extent of zzso is accurately identified throughout the visual zzso by zzso zzso zzso This provides a means of visualizing functional cortical regions in zzso and could be used in zzso studies of phenomena such as cortical zzso and for zzso zzso of cortical regions to guide in the zzso of functional zzso
