The clinical application of zzso zzso zzso complexes as zzso contrast agents is limited by the slow zzso of zzso complexes and zzso long-term tissue zzso of toxic zzso zzso To alleviate the problem of slow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes were designed and prepared based on the zzso exchange to allow degradation of the zzso by zzso zzso and to facilitate zzso of zzso complexes after the zzso zzso The in zzso degradation study showed that the zzso agent was readily zzso by zzso at plasma zzso zzso No zzso was observed between the zzso on human serum zzso zzso with the zzso zzso blood pool contrast enhancement was observed for the zzso zzso The agents of both high molecular weight zzso zzso and low molecular weight zzso zzso produced significant contrast enhancement in the heart and zzso in rats at relatively high zzso Except for the zzso the signal zzso gradually decreased over zzso zzso blood pool contrast enhancement was also observed for the high molecular weight agent at a low dose zzso zzso but not for the agent with a lower molecular zzso The contrast enhancement in the urinary zzso increased over time for the zzso agents and zzso zzso products were identified by mass zzso in the urine samples from the rats administered with both zzso agents, which confirmed that the zzso agents were zzso in zzso and zzso through zzso zzso The preliminary results demonstrated the in zzso and in zzso zzso superior blood pool contrast enhancement, and rapid clearance through zzso zzso of the novel zzso zzso zzso This agent has a great potential for further zzso and clinical development with application in zzso blood pool and cancer MR zzso
