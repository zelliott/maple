We used source imaging of visual evoked zzso to measure neural population responses over a wide range of horizontal disparities zzso zzso The stimulus was a central disk that moved back and forth across the fixation plane at 2 zzso surrounded either by zzso zzso dots zzso zzso or by correlated dots presented in the fixation zzso Both disk and surround were composed of dynamic random dots to remove coherent zzso zzso zzso tuning was measured in five visual regions of interest zzso zzso human middle zzso area zzso zzso lateral zzso complex zzso and zzso defined in separate functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The disparity tuning functions peaked between 2 and 16 zzso for both types of surround in each zzso zzso tuning in the zzso zzso was unaffected by the type of zzso but surround correlation altered both the zzso and phase of the disparity responses in the other zzso Response zzso increased when the disk was in front of the surround in the zzso and zzso zzso indicating that these areas zzso zzso relationships and object zzso The correlated surround produced a consistent phase lag at the second harmonic in the zzso and zzso zzso without a change in zzso while in the zzso zzso both phase and zzso effects were zzso zzso to disparity context is thus widespread in visual cortex, but the dynamics of these contextual interactions differ across zzso
