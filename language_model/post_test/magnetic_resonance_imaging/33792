zzso zzso volumes were monitored and zzso using accurately registered magnetic resonance images zzso in six healthy individuals 30 zzso before and up to 4 h after zzso of a zzso zzso The volume of the lateral zzso increased by an average zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as blood zzso levels rose from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This was followed by a peak decrease of zzso zzso zzso below initial zzso volumes as blood zzso levels fell to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the secondary volume decrease demonstrates a zzso process of brain volume regulation for which the mechanism remains zzso
