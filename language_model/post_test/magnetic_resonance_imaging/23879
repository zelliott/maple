zzso activity due to a zzso painful stimulus applied to the right hand was studied in the middle third of the zzso brain and compared to zzso for zzso and motor tasks using the same body part, in nine normal zzso zzso activity was demonstrated utilizing zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and a surface zzso The cortical activity was analyzed based upon individual subject activity maps and on zzso activity zzso The results show significant differences in zzso across the three tasks and the cortical areas zzso The study indicates that zzso enables examination of cortical networks zzso pain perception at an anatomical detail not available with other brain imaging techniques and shows that this cortical network underlying pain perception shares components with the networks underlying touch perception and motor zzso However, the zzso pain perception network also has components that are unique to this zzso The uniquely activated areas were in the secondary zzso region, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity was in a region that, in the zzso receives zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso that in turn are targets for zzso zzso zzso subdivisions of the primary zzso and motor cortical areas were also activated in the zzso pain task, showing zzso differences in the extent of overlap with the other two zzso Within the primary motor cortex, a hand region was zzso active in the task in which the stimulus was painful zzso In the primary zzso zzso most activity in the painful heat task was localized to area 1, where the motor and zzso task activities were also zzso The study also indicates that the functional connectivity across multiple cortical regions reorganizes zzso with each zzso
