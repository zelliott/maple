The purpose of our study was to zzso and directly compare capability of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to clinical outcome zzso in candidates for lung volume reduction surgery zzso 

Twenty-five consecutive candidates for zzso (20 men and five zzso age range, zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso before and after zzso Clinical outcomes for each candidate were evaluated in terms of differences between zzso and zzso percentage forced zzso volume in 1 second zzso zzso and zzso walking zzso zzso assessed zzso lung ratios on zzso zzso zzso and zzso were calculated from regional relative enhancement ratios, functional lung volumes, and zzso zzso between upper and lower zzso zzso assessed zzso lung ratios on zzso zzso zzso and zzso were estimated using visual scoring zzso To evaluate the correlation for individual zzso lung ratios and clinical zzso all zzso lung ratios were correlated with clinical zzso zzso in mean relative enhancement ratio were directly correlated with clinical outcomes to assess the capability of zzso zzso to assess therapeutic zzso 

All zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso assessed zzso lung ratios showed moderate and statistically significant correlation with clinical zzso and improvement in mean relative enhancement ratio showed moderate or good zzso both statistically significant zzso zzso 

zzso zzso shows potential for more accurate evaluation of zzso clinical outcome for zzso candidates than zzso and can be considered at least as reliable as zzso
