zzso changes in zzso values, indicative for changes in water content, have been reported in the zzso zzso zzso However, data concerning short-term zzso changes are zzso 

The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term effects of unloading on zzso values in zzso zzso discs in zzso 

Experimental study with repeated zzso of zzso discs zzso relaxation time during a period of 38 minutes of zzso zzso 

zzso patients with acute or chronic low back pain zzso analog scale zzso 

zzso relaxation time in the zzso disc, zzso zzso angle, and zzso disc zzso 

zzso patients zzso age, zzso zzso were investigated in the zzso position using a zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso mapping was performed immediately after unloading and after a mean delay of 38 zzso No patient movement was allowed between the zzso One region of interest zzso was manually placed in both the anterior and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso in the nucleus zzso zzso 

There was a statistically significant decrease in the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increase in zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with initially low zzso values in the zzso showed minor increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas a major increase in the zzso zzso was found in discs with initially high zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients examined in the morning showed no differences, but those investigated in the afternoon showed a decrease in the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were observed in other zzso zzso analysis showed moderate correlations between the time of investigation and zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A shift of water from the anterior to the zzso disc regions seems to occur after unloading the zzso spine in the zzso zzso The clinical relevance of these changes needs to be zzso
