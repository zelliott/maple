We evaluate whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso with blood zzso zzso zzso contrast correctly predicts the relative effects of zzso agents on hypoxic fraction in zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The response of ten tumors to zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso emulsion zzso and the combination of zzso + zzso was studied with high spectral and spatial resolution MR imaging of the water resonance at zzso zzso zzso in MR signal zzso indicate increases in tumor blood oxygen zzso 

Average MR signal zzso was decreased zzso by zzso zzso by zzso + air, and zzso by zzso + zzso zzso + zzso caused a larger zzso decrease than either treatment alone zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso responding to treatment indicate that combining zzso with zzso significantly zzso the area of the tumor in which oxygen levels are increased zzso zzso zzso by zzso 

zzso predicts that zzso + zzso will increase zzso more than either treatment alone; this agrees with the known effects of these treatments on hypoxic zzso zzso zzso to choose the treatment that zzso the size and extent of increases in tumor zzso could reduce hypoxic zzso
