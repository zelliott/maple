Brain zzso is abnormal in chronic cocaine zzso To determine whether these zzso abnormalities are zzso following treatment, we studied 10 zzso zzso users with zzso zzso 2 to 3 days after admission to an zzso treatment facility and at 7 to 8 days and 17 to 29 days after zzso from zzso The patients also received zzso an zzso mixed zzso beginning 10 days after admission and continuing to the end of the zzso Imaging began zzso zzso after injection of zzso (20 zzso using an zzso gamma camera zzso zzso was performed during hospitalization using a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were merged and five zzso zzso slices centered at the level of the zzso zzso were selected for zzso zzso ratios were derived for cortical regions relative to zzso activity and were corrected for zzso with respect to regional cerebral blood zzso The cortical regions were classified as abnormal zzso ratio zzso zzso borderline zzso and normal zzso zzso based on the results of the first zzso zzso In abnormal zones, regional cerebral blood flow zzso increased zzso zzso zzso at 7 to 8 days and zzso zzso zzso at 17 to 29 days after initiation of zzso The increase in zzso was zzso zzso zzso (7 to 8 zzso and zzso zzso zzso (17 to 29 zzso in borderline zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso (7 to 8 zzso and increased only zzso zzso zzso (17 to 29 zzso in normal zzso The increase in zzso did not vary significantly by zzso The zzso defects observed in chronic cocaine zzso users are partially zzso with short-term zzso and zzso zzso
