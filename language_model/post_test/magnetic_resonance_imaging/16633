zzso spinal zzso injury should be suspected based not only on the mechanism of trauma but also on the age of the zzso The pediatric spine has unique zzso and anatomical properties that must be considered carefully when evaluating spinal zzso zzso For instance, the zzso and elasticity of the spinal column in children often lead to zzso injuries that can mask spinal zzso zzso 

We present the case of a zzso male patient who was found to have zzso injury detected by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the upper cervical spine but missed by zzso in the lower zzso zzso Furthermore, there was no spinal zzso injury in the upper cervical spine, but indeed a serious insult in the zzso zzso Since the advent of zzso spinal zzso injury without zzso zzso zzso has become increasingly rare but not altogether zzso 

We present a noteworthy example of the zzso of zzso in revealing zzso a term that is antiquated as we combine the latest imaging techniques with a better understanding of the zzso of trauma and spine zzso Based on the literature and our case zzso we believe that the zzso of the pediatric spine must be considered when children who may have sustained a zzso are zzso
