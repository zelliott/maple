Among 12 patients, 42 relapses were zzso zzso lasted a mean duration of zzso months, zzso frequent zzso zzso and zzso and were associated with a mean Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso score of zzso Besides typical findings of zzso magnetic resonance imaging showed zzso mass effect in 5 patients, extensive zzso in 3 patients, and closed ring enhancement in 1 zzso zzso zzso bands were found on zzso fluid investigation in 4 patients, with an increased zzso ratio of zzso to zzso Among 7 available brain biopsy zzso zzso was positive for zzso zzso T zzso in 5 zzso zzso of 42 relapses were treated with pulse zzso therapy, which led to improvement, with a mean residual zzso score of zzso zzso zzso In 1 patient with zzso zzso scores on the zzso progressively increased to a score of 10 at zzso Among 5 patients without long-term zzso therapy, the mean annualized zzso rate was zzso zzso zzso Among 7 patients taking oral zzso no relapses occurred in those whose daily dose was 20 zzso or zzso No progressive course of zzso was zzso Four patients with a final zzso score of 4 or higher had experienced previous severe relapses zzso score, zzso and zzso and spinal zzso zzso
