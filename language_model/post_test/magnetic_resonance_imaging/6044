zzso zzso strain patterns in zzso zzso are considered zzso but have not been investigated with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso strain zzso Left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain analysis is sensitive to regional zzso and is generated from sequential zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

Sixty normal human volunteers underwent zzso zzso zzso strain analysis to supply normal average and standard zzso values for each of three strain parameters at each of zzso individual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain data from each zzso zzso patient zzso zzso 10) were then subjected to a point-by-point comparison zzso zzso zzso zzso points) to the normal strain database for three individual strain components zzso database comparisons per zzso The resulting composite zzso zzso values zzso zzso from normal zzso were color zzso mapped over zzso zzso zzso geometry to detect the zzso regional zzso patterns associated with zzso zzso 

Average zzso strain zzso values varied significantly according to zzso level zzso zzso zzso and region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly less than those in both the base zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso wall zzso were less than those in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso walls zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso strain analysis suggests that zzso zzso strain in patients with zzso zzso has a zzso regional distribution and, on average, falls almost 2 standard zzso from zzso
