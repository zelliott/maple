Dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso provide zzso and cardiac surgeons with high-quality zzso images for diagnosis and therapy, yet the effective use of these high-quality anatomical models remains a zzso zzso zzso is a flexible imaging zzso but the US images produced are often difficult to interpret unless they are placed within their proper 3-D anatomical zzso The ability to correlate real-time 3-D US volumes zzso zzso with dynamic zzso images would offer a significant contribution to improve the quality of cardiac zzso In this paper, we present a rapid zzso method for registering zzso US to high-quality dynamic 3-D zzso images of the beating zzso This technique overcomes some major limitations of image registration (such as the correct registration result not necessarily occurring at the maximum of the mutual information zzso zzso using the zzso zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a dynamic heart phantom zzso study and a human subject zzso The achieved mean target registration error of zzso images in the phantom study is zzso zzso zzso using human zzso volumes shows a target registration error of zzso zzso We anticipate that this technique will substantially improve the quality of cardiac diagnosis and zzso
