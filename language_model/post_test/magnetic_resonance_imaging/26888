zzso magnetic resonance imaging can potentially assess the dynamics of left zzso zzso early zzso zzso 

Fifteen participants underwent zzso magnetic resonance imaging on a zzso zzso zzso scanner zzso zzso zzso zzso Left zzso zzso zzso were measured in 3 zzso zzso Imaging parameters included a repetition time of zzso zzso an echo time of zzso zzso a flip angle of 30 degrees, and a zzso range of 100 to 150 zzso 

The color zzso analysis provided a visual assessment of zzso zzso zzso In normal subjects, there was rapid organized early zzso flow that extended from the zzso valve to the zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso dysfunction, organized high-velocity flow stopped in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance can differentiate between normal and abnormal zzso flow propagation within the left zzso
