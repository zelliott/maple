The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model has been used to examine factors of zzso growth factor release, and zzso expression as well the effect of zzso zzso The present study systematically investigates the long-term course of zzso implanted zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso tumors were implanted into the zzso of 48 male zzso rats (32 zzso 16 zzso The animals were examined by zzso at zzso day zzso 7, 14, 21, 28, 32, 45, 60, and zzso The zzso protocol included a zzso and zzso zzso sequence before and after application of contrast medium and a zzso zzso sequence for zzso A total of six animals were selected after each MR exam from both groups and sacrificed for HE light zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 

The tumors progressed to reach a maximum volume on day zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso then consistently zzso to zzso completely by zzso zzso The influx of zzso zzso zzso correlated with tumor progression and the tumors reached a larger size in the zzso zzso However, the time course of tumor zzso was the same for both zzso 

The present data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso implanted into zzso rats will progress within a time span of approximately 4 weeks and can then zzso again zzso This finding has to be taken into account when deciding on a study protocol and the appropriate animal zzso The zzso zzso model may be suitable to study the cell biological steps involved in the phenomenon of spontaneous tumor zzso
