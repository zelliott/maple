DNA zzso zzso whose zzso zzso is zzso by zzso is responsible for zzso DNA synthesis during DNA zzso It carries out this synthesis with high zzso zzso to its intrinsic zzso to zzso activity, which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affecting the zzso domain of zzso have recently been shown to zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Here we report a recurring zzso zzso deletion in zzso affecting the zzso active site that zzso DNA zzso activity but only mildly zzso zzso to zzso zzso This zzso causes a distinct zzso disorder that includes subcutaneous zzso deafness, zzso zzso and zzso in zzso This discovery suggests that zzso the function of the zzso expressed zzso zzso has unexpectedly zzso effects in humans and argues for an important role for zzso function in zzso tissue zzso
