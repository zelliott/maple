Using zzso we have studied the changes induced by the performance of a complex sequential motor task in the cortical areas of nine zzso zzso patients and compared to that of healthy zzso Compared with normal subjects, zzso patients showed a reduction of zzso of motor and zzso areas, an increase of zzso of zzso areas and a bilateral zzso of zzso zzso which are likely to participate in the attempt to recruit parallel motor circuits in order to overcome the zzso defective zzso
