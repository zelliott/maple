Children with zzso disease zzso often undergo zzso imaging during clinical zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso is becoming the preferred zzso assessment due to the lack of radiation exposure; however, there are few data in children with CD comparing zzso with objective disease zzso The aim of the present study was to compare zzso with zzso zzso and laboratory evaluation in children with zzso 

We performed an institutional review zzso query of our prospective CD zzso database, which includes data in children with CD undergoing zzso since zzso 

A total of 147 zzso studies were performed in 119 different children with symptomatic zzso Of those, 53 zzso zzso studies were performed at diagnosis to evaluate small zzso disease zzso A total of 117 zzso zzso studies displayed active and/or chronic disease, whereas 30 zzso zzso studies were zzso When compared with normal zzso studies, active inflammation on zzso was associated with a higher mean zzso protein zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso higher zzso zzso rate zzso vs 22, P zzso zzso higher zzso value zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso demonstrated excellent agreement when zzso were present, and moderate agreement with zzso 

Active inflammation on zzso is associated with higher zzso zzso zzso zzso rate, zzso and lower zzso in children with zzso zzso displays excellent agreement with zzso disease described by zzso but poor agreement with mild zzso disease described by zzso and zzso The present study adds to a growing body of evidence that zzso provides excellent assessment of inflammation and measures disease activity in zzso
