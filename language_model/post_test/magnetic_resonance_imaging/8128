Spinal zzso zzso zzso is an zzso uncommon and potentially zzso devastating zzso zzso of blood products in magnetic resonance imaging is a very important clue for the diagnosis of zzso It is generally agreed that prompt surgical zzso should be performed before irreversible damage to the spinal zzso zzso However, conservative treatment still plays a role in the management of zzso 

To describe the clinical zzso characteristic zzso findings, and treatment of traumatic zzso 

A case of traumatic zzso at the zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging findings of high signal intensity zzso in both zzso and zzso sequences suggest the possibility of zzso zzso although it may be mistaken for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Although there is a place for conservative treatment of zzso zzso we believe that rapid surgical drainage of the zzso zzso will be associated with the best prognosis especially in the zzso zzso and zzso junctions of the spinal zzso 

Rapid surgical drainage of traumatic zzso affecting the zzso junction of the zzso will be associated in most of the cases with rapid zzso zzso
