To assess the role of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the prostate in evaluating local recurrence of prostate cancer, using zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso as a reference standard, in men treated with external beam zzso zzso for prostate zzso 

The study included 13 patients with evidence of zzso recurrence after zzso who had undergone zzso and prostate zzso Each zzso scan zzso of zzso zzso dynamic contrast enhancement and diffusion zzso was reported by two expert zzso Each prostate was divided into four regions of interest zzso generating 52 paired zzso for zzso 

The mean zzso age of the men was zzso zzso years, the mean zzso zzso zzso level before zzso was zzso zzso zzso the mean time from zzso to zzso recurrence was zzso zzso years and the mean zzso level at the time of recurrence was zzso zzso zzso Eleven men had zzso evidence of zzso with 23 of 52 zzso involved with zzso zzso zzso as expressed by the area under a zzso curve, was zzso and zzso for all cancer, with zzso of zzso and zzso for those zzso with zzso zzso biopsy core zzso zzso zzso was measured by calculating zzso zzso which showed fair and moderate agreement between zzso 

zzso of zzso of the prostate after previous zzso is zzso Our results show that the accuracy is good using an accurate reference zzso These results need zzso in more patients, but have implications for determining presence or absence of local recurrence and subsequent local salvage zzso
