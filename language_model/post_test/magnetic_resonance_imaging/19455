Recent research into the zzso assessment of zzso iron zzso using magnetic resonance imaging has shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso varies zzso with liver iron zzso However, the development of an zzso system for the assessment of zzso iron distribution has been zzso by the presence of motion induced artifacts in the zzso zzso We report on the development of a single zzso imaging methodology that enables the generation of zzso zzso maps over the zzso A simple smoothing technique is used to accommodate the image intensity zzso caused by abdominal zzso The zzso maps are consistent with the variation of iron concentration throughout the zzso A zzso density estimate and zzso of the zzso distribution are generated to assist in the visual assessment of the degree and zzso of zzso zzso with liver iron zzso It was found that one or two zzso functions could be used to characterize the zzso zzso with a small number of zzso We propose that this methodology may be used in the clinical setting to monitor zzso iron zzso in the advent of an accurate zzso zzso zzso zzso
