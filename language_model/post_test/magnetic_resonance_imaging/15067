The aim of this systematic review was to assess the current zzso and reliability of zzso methods used to measure zzso hip geometry in children with cerebral zzso 

A search was conducted using relevant zzso and zzso criteria of the zzso zzso Plus, zzso Web of Science, Academic Search zzso The Cochrane Library, and zzso zzso 

The migration percentage using zzso showed excellent reliability and concurrent zzso with three-dimensional zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso index, measured using zzso had good reliability but moderate concurrent zzso with zzso CT zzso zzso CT scan indexes had greater zzso The measurement of the neck zzso angle using zzso showed excellent concurrent zzso with zzso from zzso CT scans and excellent zzso Regarding zzso zzso one study found an excellent correlation between two-dimensional CT and clinical assessment and excellent zzso Two others showed less evidence for the use of CT zzso 

Most of the zzso zzso showed good to excellent zzso zzso More zzso evidence is needed for the assessment of zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging and zzso zzso have great potential although very little zzso evidence is zzso
