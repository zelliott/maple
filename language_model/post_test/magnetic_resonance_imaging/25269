zzso studies investigated the zzso systems of the human brain revealing two networks, one for voluntary allocation of attention and another for zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso of the latter system were supposed to lead to spatial zzso we show that such zzso rather are typical for the occurrence of visual zzso zzso describes the inability of zzso patients to detect a zzso target in the presence of a competing zzso zzso In a sample of zzso admitted patients with right zzso stroke, we found zzso cortical zzso for spatial neglect and visual zzso There was a surprising zzso between the typical zzso site in patients with extinction and the zzso clusters found in previous zzso studies of healthy zzso The results show that the zzso junction zzso considered to be a crucial part of the zzso zzso network, is the neural zzso of visual zzso
