To compare diagnostic accuracy of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging with that of zzso zzso MR imaging combining zzso imaging with zzso zzso MR imaging, dynamic contrast zzso zzso MR imaging, or both in the detection of locally zzso prostate cancer zzso after radiation therapy zzso 

This retrospective zzso study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent was zzso zzso men zzso age, 70 zzso suspected of having zzso recurrence of zzso underwent zzso MR imaging, including zzso and zzso zzso within 6 months after zzso Two readers independently evaluated the likelihood of zzso with a zzso scale for zzso imaging alone, zzso imaging with zzso imaging, zzso imaging with zzso imaging, and zzso imaging with zzso and zzso imaging, with at least a zzso zzso between zzso Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso were zzso zzso agreement was zzso and quantitative parameters zzso diffusion zzso zzso volume transfer constant zzso and rate constant zzso were assessed at zzso and zzso levels with generalized zzso equations and the zzso rank sum test, zzso 

At zzso recurrence was present in 35 zzso of 53 zzso In detection of zzso zzso zzso imaging with zzso imaging yielded higher zzso zzso 1, zzso reader 2, zzso than zzso imaging alone zzso 1, zzso reader 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso sequences did not contribute significant incremental value to zzso imaging with zzso imaging zzso 1, P zzso zzso reader 2, P zzso zzso zzso agreement was higher for combinations of zzso MR imaging than for zzso imaging alone zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso of quantitative parameters differed significantly zzso zzso zzso to P zzso zzso between benign tissue and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging has greater accuracy in the detection of zzso zzso after zzso than zzso imaging alone, with no additional benefit if zzso is added to zzso imaging and zzso zzso
