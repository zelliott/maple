An zzso zzso chronically implanted zzso zzso was used to obtain in zzso localized zzso zzso zzso and zzso images from a rat spinal zzso A 5 zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso shaped zzso zzso was implanted in rats at the site of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved solely by a 3 zzso 3 zzso external surface zzso and signal detection was achieved by zzso zzso the external zzso to the implanted zzso The image zzso ratio zzso obtained with the zzso implanted zzso was compared with that obtained using a linear or a zzso external surface zzso The implanted zzso provided a gain by over a factor of 3 in zzso The implanted zzso was used to measure localized zzso zzso in zzso at the zzso zzso level within a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With 256 averages, a approximately zzso repetition delay and respiratory zzso a high-quality spectrum was acquired in 13 zzso In addition, water zzso diffusion was measured in three zzso directions using a zzso imaging zzso with a short echo time zzso to produce a quantitative map of diffusion in a rat spinal zzso in zzso
