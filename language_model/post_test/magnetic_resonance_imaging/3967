zzso MR data obtained for 10 healthy control subjects have been used to build a brain zzso The zzso is built in four zzso First, a set of features that are zzso zzso and zzso relevant need to be zzso for each item in the zzso The chosen features are crest lines along which the zzso principal zzso of the surface of the brain is zzso in its associated principal zzso Second, a zzso registration zzso is used to determine the common crest lines among the subjects in the zzso These crest lines form the structure of the zzso Third, a set of crest lines is taken as a reference set and a modal analysis is performed to determine the fundamental zzso that are necessary to bring the individual data in line with the reference zzso The zzso are averaged and the set of mean crest lines becomes the zzso Finally, the standard zzso of the zzso between the zzso and the items in the database defines the normal variation in the relative positions of the crest lines in a healthy zzso In a fully automatic zzso the crest lines on the surface of the brain adjacent to the cerebral zzso in a patient with primary progressive zzso were compared to the zzso confirmation that the brain of this patient demonstrates zzso was provided by zzso analysis that showed that the volume of the left cerebral zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso less than the volume of the right cerebral zzso in the region of the zzso and frontal zzso When the zzso of the zzso necessary to register the crest lines obtained for the patient with the zzso were greater than three standard zzso beyond the zzso inherent in the atlas, the deformation was considered zzso Four of the main deformation modes of the longest crest line of the surface of the brain adjacent to the cerebral zzso were significantly different in the patient with primary progressive zzso compared to the zzso The zzso are zzso enlarged in the left cerebral zzso Furthermore, they are closer together zzso and further apart zzso than in the zzso These observations may be indicative of the zzso of the zzso and frontal zzso of the left cerebral zzso noted in the zzso Ultimately, the approach may provide a useful screening technique for identifying brain diseases involving cerebral zzso zzso studies of individual patients may provide insights into the processes controlling or affected by particular zzso
