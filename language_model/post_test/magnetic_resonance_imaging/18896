zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been a useful tool for the zzso mapping of brain function associated with various motor and cognitive zzso Because zzso is based on the blood zzso level dependent zzso effect, it does not directly record neural zzso With the zzso technique, distinguishing zzso signals created by cortical projection zzso from those created by zzso zzso appears to be zzso Two major experimental designs are used in zzso zzso block designs and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the steady state of regional cerebral blood flow and has been applied to examinations of brain zzso caused by tasks requiring sustained or repetitive zzso By contrast, the more recently developed zzso zzso with time resolution of a few seconds allows the mapping of brain zzso associated with a single movement according to the transient aspects of the zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that multiple motor areas are engaged in a networked manner to execute various motor zzso In order to understand functional brain zzso it is important that one understands sequential and parallel organizations of anatomical connections between multiple motor zzso In zzso studies of complex motor tasks, elementary parameters such as movement zzso force, zzso acceleration and frequency should be controlled, because inconsistency in those parameters may alter the extent and intensity of motor cortical zzso zzso interpretation of the findings zzso In addition to initiation of movements, termination of movements plays an important role in the successful achievement of complex zzso Brain areas exclusively related to the termination of movements have been, for the first time, uncovered with an zzso zzso zzso We propose the application of zzso to the zzso of the zzso of movement disorders, particularly zzso which exhibits zzso zzso of zzso and zzso muscles and zzso abnormal posture or slow repetition of zzso
