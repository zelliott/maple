zzso structures that form the floor of the third zzso zzso and neighboring zzso are important in the context of third zzso zzso zzso zzso knowledge of the anatomical and zzso organization of the region would be useful in understanding and preventing surgical zzso Taking the third zzso region as a model, we aimed to simulate TV and make zzso of 23 zzso zzso as well as perform zzso examinations of the third zzso floor on five zzso zzso During the zzso TV, we examined the degree to which the structures surrounding the zzso were affected by surgical zzso To make a clinical comparison, the distance between the center of the zzso and the zzso zzso was measured on zzso magnetic resonance images zzso of 15 subjects with normal zzso systems and 15 subjects with moderately enlarged zzso zzso examination revealed that the zzso cells and zzso membrane formed the inner and outer surfaces of the third zzso floor, respectively, whereas the zzso was made up of zzso cells zzso This region was zzso and zzso When zzso brains with normal and zzso zzso were zzso there were significant differences in the distance between the center of the floor and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of our study, the optimal site for TV zzso and balloon inflation is just anterior to the zzso bodies to avoid injury to neighboring zzso
