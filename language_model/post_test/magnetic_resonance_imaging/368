The ability to perform an appropriate response in the presence of competing alternatives is a critical facet of human behavioral zzso This is especially important if a response is prepared for execution but then has to be changed zzso A popular hypothesis of zzso zzso zzso function suggests that its direct and indirect pathways could provide a neural mechanism to rapidly switch from one planned response to an zzso However, if one response is more dominant or zzso than the other, the zzso might have a different role depending on switch zzso We built upon the zzso and zzso tasks, two models of automatic and voluntary behavior, respectively, and investigated whether the zzso are important for switching any planned response in general, or if they are more important for switching from a more automatic response to a response that is more difficult to zzso zzso prepared either a zzso or zzso but then had to switch it unexpectedly on a subset of zzso The results revealed increased zzso zzso for switching from a zzso to an zzso but this did not occur for switching from an zzso to a zzso This zzso pattern depended on the relative difficulty in zzso and it was distinct from frontal eye fields, an area shown to be more active for zzso trials than for zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso are important for zzso for differences in response difficulty, zzso the rapid switching of one response for zzso
