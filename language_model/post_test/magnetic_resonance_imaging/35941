The contribution of magnetic resonance zzso imaging was zzso evaluated in 24 patients in whom CT demonstrated a zzso mass effect without significant additional zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso spin echo zzso the MR images zzso the zzso with greater precision than CT in zzso of zzso Areas of contrast enhancement were visible on the zzso images in five of nine zzso patients assessed after intravenous zzso zzso acid, where no comparable enhancement was seen on zzso Twenty of the 24 patients subsequently underwent zzso eight had zzso and 12 had zzso zzso resonance accurately predicted the site of the zzso in all these zzso Three of the remaining four cases were treated with zzso on the basis of the MR findings without a tissue diagnosis being zzso zzso resonance produces better zzso than CT and provides a sound basis for further diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
