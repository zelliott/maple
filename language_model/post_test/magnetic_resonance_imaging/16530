A theoretical zzso model was developed for in zzso human liver fat zzso H MRS zzso using the number of double bonds zzso number of zzso double bonds zzso and average fatty acid chain zzso Five 3 zzso zzso zzso echo acquisition mode zzso zzso were acquired zzso at progressively longer zzso in a zzso emulsion phantom and in 121 human subjects with known or suspected zzso fatty liver zzso zzso peak areas were zzso Phantom data were used to validate the zzso Human data were used in the model to determine the complete liver fat zzso In the zzso emulsion zzso the spectrum predicted by the model (based on known fatty acid chain zzso agreed closely with zzso zzso In human subjects, areas of zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso were zzso correlated zzso zzso r zzso zzso as were the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso peak represented zzso of the total fat signal in zzso zzso These values predict that zzso of the total fat signal zzso the water zzso The zzso model can characterize human liver fat zzso This allows more accurate determination of liver fat fraction from zzso and zzso
