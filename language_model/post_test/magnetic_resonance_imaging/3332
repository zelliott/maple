zzso zzso zzso experiments rely on precise characterization of the blood oxygen level dependent zzso zzso As the spatial resolution of zzso reaches the zzso range, the need for quantitative zzso of zzso properties of this zzso signal has become zzso Here, we find that a detailed zzso model of zzso zzso responses predicts traveling waves with zzso and spatial ranges in zzso zzso zzso Two measurable zzso related to zzso characterize these zzso wave zzso and zzso zzso To test these predictions, high-resolution zzso data are acquired from subjects viewing discrete visual zzso zzso and experiment show strong agreement, in particular confirming zzso waves zzso for at least zzso zzso across the cortical surface at speeds of zzso zzso zzso These observations enable fundamentally new approaches to zzso analysis, crucial for zzso data acquired at high spatial zzso
