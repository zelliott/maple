zzso size is an important predictor of cardiac risk after acute zzso zzso The established zzso for its assessment is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In recent years, data are emerging demonstrating that zzso size as assessed by late zzso enhancement in cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging zzso as well as the presence of zzso obstruction zzso may also provide zzso information, however, so far no direct comparisons of both zzso have been zzso 

We zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso with acute zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso who underwent zzso and zzso on a zzso T scanner at a median of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso days after the acute event, zzso The primary zzso of the study was a composite of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso heart failure requiring zzso 

During a median follow-up of zzso zzso zzso years, 24 events zzso The best predictor was zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso size by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso size by zzso zzso zzso zzso (all zzso corrected for clinical zzso In a zzso model including clinical and zzso zzso zzso remained the only significant predictor in addition to clinical zzso 

The extent of zzso as determined by zzso has an excellent zzso value in predicting cardiac events following acute zzso zzso and may be used as an alternative to zzso size assessment by zzso
