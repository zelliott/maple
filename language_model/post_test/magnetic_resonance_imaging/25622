A new magnetic resonance zzso technique, zzso zzso MR imaging, was developed to evaluate the response of patients with zzso to zzso Ten patients, who had received chemotherapy for zzso of the lower zzso underwent MR imaging 3 days before zzso After routine MR imaging was performed, zzso MR was performed in the plane in which the tumor was best zzso With zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso on a standard MR zzso zzso images were created by zzso zzso images from zzso zzso zzso The time of zzso zzso vascular zzso was 1 1/2 minutes after injection, and, therefore, the zzso image obtained at this time was used for evaluation of viable zzso zzso zzso and zzso examined their respective studies for viable tumor to differentiate zzso from zzso Four of 10 zzso were classified as good zzso because they appeared as zzso masses, with or without enhancing thin lines, or small zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso At zzso examination, all were good zzso with less than zzso viable zzso Six of 10 zzso were classified as zzso because they appeared as enhancing zzso masses measuring more than 3 zzso in zzso Five tumors had between zzso and zzso viable tumor zzso
