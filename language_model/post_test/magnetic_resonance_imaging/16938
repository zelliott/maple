In zzso zzso stroke, the final size of the zzso zzso is the most important correlate of clinical functional zzso Using a set of zzso MR images zzso zzso zzso and zzso density zzso for zzso and the chronic zzso at 3 months as an outcome measure, an zzso zzso Network zzso was trained to predict the zzso outcome in the form of a zzso forecast of the chronic zzso The ANN was trained and tested using 12 subjects (with 83 slices and zzso zzso using a zzso zzso method with calculation of the Area Under the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for training, testing and zzso of the zzso After training and zzso the ANN produced maps of predicted outcome that were well correlated zzso zzso with the zzso at 3 months for all 12 zzso This result implies that the trained ANN can provide an estimate of zzso zzso zzso on zzso in a stable and accurate manner zzso
