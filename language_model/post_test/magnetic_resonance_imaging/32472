To compare the zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the detection of zzso zzso 

Twenty patients with known zzso zzso underwent MR imaging using zzso zzso and zzso in at least zzso zzso zzso zzso were confirmed either zzso or zzso Two zzso independently reviewed the zzso and zzso sets in a random zzso The sensitivity and accuracy of zzso detection and the ability to distinguish a benign zzso from a zzso zzso were compared by the areas zzso under the receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso The zzso zzso ratios zzso were compared by paired zzso 

The overall accuracy for detecting zzso was not significantly different between the zzso set zzso and zzso for reader 1 and 2, zzso and the zzso set zzso and zzso The zzso at the zzso images and the zzso images were not significantly different zzso 

Both zzso and zzso zzso have a comparable accuracy in detecting zzso zzso
