To describe the zzso findings of zzso changes in acute middle cerebral artery zzso zzso detected with three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and to compare the zzso and clinical value of this sign with those of the zzso zzso sign at zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso age, 55 zzso underwent CT and MR imaging within the first 6 hours after the onset of acute zzso zzso The zzso zzso sign at CT and the presence of zzso changes in acute zzso as depicted on zzso zzso zzso MR images were zzso The presence of each sign was correlated with clinical zzso 

The sensitivity of the zzso zzso sign at CT was zzso zzso zzso value, zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso value, zzso for the zzso changes at MR zzso There were no zzso CT or MR zzso The presence of the zzso zzso sign correlated positively with the initial clinical presentation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, neither of the signs was a predictor for clinical outcome in cases of spontaneous zzso zzso 

In addition to the information traditionally provided with reconstructed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images allow the identification of acute zzso zzso with a sensitivity higher than that of zzso
