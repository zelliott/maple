zzso is the first zzso agent that functions through exchange of zzso zzso with water zzso in zzso zzso The zzso spectrum of this complex is strongly pH dependent and modulated by the presence of zzso zzso as shown for zzso zzso and zzso zzso which form zzso and zzso complexes, respectively, with zzso The sensitivity of the alcohol zzso environment to interactions with these zzso shows that this complex has potential as a responsive zzso zzso contrast zzso
