zzso zzso zzso zzso is among the most common zzso of cortical development, and affected patients are frequently characterized by focal drug-resistant zzso Here we analyzed clinical, zzso and zzso findings in 54 zzso patients to zzso the zzso of zzso relate the zzso features to zzso outcome, and ascertain the contribution of zzso zzso to the onset of zzso zzso 

The patients were followed up for a prolonged period at the zzso Center of our zzso In all cases, we related zzso findings to clinical and zzso outcome and analyzed zzso and zzso zzso zzso In one patient, zzso and zzso zzso recordings of zzso were zzso 

We included cases with zzso zzso also extending to white matter and cortex, provided that zzso continuity was present between zzso and zzso zzso Based on imaging and clinical data, patients were subdivided into five zzso groups: zzso bilateral and zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso bilateral and zzso zzso zzso and zzso unilateral with extension to zzso The latter three groups were characterized by worse zzso zzso No differences in outcome were found between unilateral zzso patients regardless the presence of cortical zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso abnormalities were always related to zzso zzso 

The distinctive clinical features and zzso outcomes in each group of patients confirm the reliability of the proposed zzso zzso zzso and zzso recordings suggest that zzso are generated by abnormal zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and adjacent cortical zzso
