We have established a novel zzso model of the middle cerebral artery zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso was induced by the zzso reaction between Rose Bengal and green light, which causes zzso injury followed by zzso zzso zzso and formation of a zzso and zzso zzso at the site of the zzso zzso With this model, we have investigated the effects of zzso agents, zzso agents and zzso zzso In our model, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a key role in zzso formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could cause an opening of the zzso zzso zzso and reduced the size of the cerebral zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso enhanced the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso a zzso release inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso reduced the cerebral zzso 24 zzso after the zzso zzso This model is very useful for investigating the mechanisms of zzso and zzso agents and evaluating the effects of these zzso
