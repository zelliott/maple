zzso zzso are zzso of vulnerability to zzso as well as of the disorder zzso How these abnormalities relate to different probabilities for later transition to psychosis is zzso We investigated zzso versus zzso versus resilience zzso of psychosis during working memory zzso processing in individuals with an zzso mental state zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso short-term zzso zzso zzso zzso 17), long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated with an zzso zzso zzso We examined functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso data in conjunction using biological zzso mapping zzso zzso 

There were no differences in zzso but the zzso and the zzso group had longer reaction times compared with the HC and the zzso zzso With the zzso zzso zzso contrast, we found reduced functional zzso in zzso and zzso compared with the HC group in zzso and middle frontal zzso Relative to zzso individuals, zzso patients showed decreased zzso in the bilateral inferior frontal zzso and zzso and in the left prefrontal zzso Compared with the zzso the zzso subjects showed reduced zzso in the right inferior frontal zzso and zzso zzso insular and prefrontal zzso was associated with gray matter volume reduction in the same area in the zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that vulnerability to psychosis was associated with zzso zzso in zzso networks in a zzso zzso zzso differences within the zzso were related to different duration of the zzso state and resilience zzso
