The aim of the study was to zzso compare image findings of poorly enhanced areas zzso of pancreatic zzso that show almost no enhancement or obviously zzso area relative to the surrounding zzso on zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso with pathological zzso 

Thirty-nine patients with pancreatic zzso underwent dynamic CT and zzso zzso enhanced areas were classified according to their size, zzso value, position, and border on CT imaging and signal intensity on magnetic resonance zzso 

Of the 33 zzso 12 showed zzso zzso structure that contained both large tumor zzso and zzso pancreatic duct with zzso 11 showed zzso 4 showed retention cyst, 2 showed zzso pancreatic duct without zzso or with limited invasion, 1 showed zzso and 3 showed no remarkable differences in characteristics compared with surrounding zzso zzso zzso structures tended to be well defined zzso zzso zzso zzso portions tended to show a high zzso value zzso zzso zzso and central position zzso zzso zzso and were ill defined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to show a peripheral position zzso zzso zzso 

zzso enhanced areas corresponded to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Image findings demonstrated these zzso zzso component can be zzso and distinguished with other components and can be a zzso zzso
