To investigate the use of a zzso relaxation model to measure zzso zzso and mixed zzso zzso in white matter zzso during zzso 

zzso at zzso zzso and conventional zzso imaging were used to acquire zzso and zzso relaxation data in 15 normal children ranging in age from 3 months to 13 years 4 zzso Three equations with three unknowns were solved to calculate three zzso zzso for each child in a frontal zzso area and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso trend of the zzso was compared with a theoretical zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso level in the zzso area rose earlier than in the zzso area following the standard zzso zzso The zzso trend of the zzso zzso followed that predicted by the theoretical zzso model in both brain zzso The zzso and mixed pool sizes were significantly different in the two zzso areas following early zzso although their zzso pools were zzso zzso values correlated more highly with the zzso and mixed pool zzso than with the zzso pool zzso 

The zzso relaxation model provides zzso of zzso zzso in zzso that follow values predicted during zzso
