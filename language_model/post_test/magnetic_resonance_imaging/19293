zzso of the diagnostic efficacy and cost-benefit of contrast enhanced CT zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in focal zzso disease with consideration of therapeutic zzso 

In 52 patients with the suspicion of primary or secondary zzso zzso zzso spiral CT and zzso zzso zzso and fast zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide administration zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The number of zzso zzso and the related diagnoses resulting from each imaging zzso were recorded and statistically correlated to the final diagnoses established by zzso zzso long term follow-up of 12 months zzso and a consensus reading of all imaging zzso considering all clinical imaging zzso The most likely induced therapy resulting from each imaging test was correlated to the final zzso Based on data from the hospitals accountants, the zzso costs were estimated without hospitalization zzso 

In zzso zzso of the cases the correct diagnosis was primarily stated by CT zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso In additional zzso of the cases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enabled correct diagnoses, and in another 6 cases the diagnosis was established only by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Considering the possible therapeutic recommendation arising from each zzso CT would have induced needles therapy costs of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In comparison to the real therapy costs of zzso zzso this would have corresponded to an unnecessary increase of therapy costs of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In two cases (1 zzso 1 zzso zzso all zzso failed, causing unnecessary surgery in one zzso 

In this zzso scenario zzso and zzso zzso proved to be superior to CT regarding diagnostic zzso The cost-benefit resulted mainly due to preserving patients from unnecessary surgical zzso
