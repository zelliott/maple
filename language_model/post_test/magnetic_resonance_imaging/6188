zzso resonance imaging zzso is a standard of care in evaluating many disease zzso Given concerns about device damage or movement, programming changes, lead heating, inappropriate zzso and image artifact, zzso is zzso in zzso zzso Despite this, studies have demonstrated safety and efficacy of zzso in adults with acquired heart disease and zzso pacing zzso We sought to evaluate zzso use in zzso heart disease zzso patients with predominantly zzso pacing zzso 

From July 2007 to October 2008, zzso zzso zzso was performed in 11 patients without alternative imaging zzso who were not zzso dependent or possessing abandoned zzso zzso was disabled during zzso An zzso monitored zzso and zzso parameters throughout each zzso Device and lead function were evaluated before and after zzso and at subsequent clinic zzso 

Eleven zzso (four zzso seven zzso were performed in eight zzso Mean patient age was zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso with five patients under the age of 16 zzso zzso included structural zzso in six patients and long zzso syndrome and zzso heart block in one zzso There were three zzso and five zzso (three zzso two zzso chamber devices, two zzso and nine zzso zzso No inappropriate pacing or significant change in generator or lead parameters was zzso All zzso studies were of diagnostic zzso 

zzso quality zzso can be performed safely in zzso zzso patients with predominantly zzso zzso Further studies will define safe practice measures in this population, as well as in zzso patients with zzso zzso
