Even though the frequency of zzso repair of isolated zzso of the zzso zzso has increased, few studies have presented clinical and anatomical outcomes of this zzso We hypothesized that, after an zzso repair, structural outcomes in the muscle have an influence on functional zzso 

A retrospective study was performed on zzso patients who had undergone zzso repair of an isolated tear of the zzso zzso and had a mean follow-up of zzso zzso Patients were evaluated preoperatively and zzso with use of the zzso score, a zzso shoulder value, the zzso test, the zzso test, and magnetic resonance imaging or zzso zzso zzso The results were compared with those of a cohort of thirteen patients who underwent open repair of the zzso zzso zzso 

In the zzso group, the zzso score improved from a mean of 66 points preoperatively to a mean of 85 points zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was healed in zzso of the zzso Three patients zzso had a partial zzso limited to the superior zzso zzso progression of fatty zzso of the zzso muscle was observed in zzso of the zzso Ten patients zzso had a severe but localized fatty zzso area of the zzso muscle related to the larger zzso zzso and functional outcomes were not influenced by zzso or zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso Clinical testing was significantly improved, but incomplete corrections remained zzso Although open repair resulted in higher zzso shoulder scores and better strength scores, most other clinical zzso zzso zzso testing results, and structural outcomes were comparable between the zzso repair and the open repair zzso 

zzso repair of isolated zzso tears was associated with improved shoulder function and improved results on clinical zzso The zzso rate was high but resulted in incomplete correction of the results of clinical zzso zzso of fatty zzso in the zzso muscle was observed on magnetic resonance imaging but did not influence the clinical zzso
