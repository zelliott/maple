The primary pathological mechanisms in stroke and multiple sclerosis zzso are very different but in both diseases, impairment may arise from a final common zzso of zzso zzso We aimed to examine the relationship between motor zzso zzso transfer ratio zzso (an index of zzso and zzso zzso zzso loss (an index of zzso zzso zzso to the descending motor pathways in stroke and zzso Twelve patients between 1 and 10 months after first zzso stroke causing a motor deficit and 12 patients with stable zzso with zzso motor deficit were zzso zzso imaging of the brain together with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso MRS zzso to the zzso limb of the internal capsule were performed and correlated to a composite motor deficit zzso zzso and zzso in the internal capsule were reduced in both stroke and zzso patients compared to zzso zzso loss correlated with motor deficit score in both stroke and zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso were seen between zzso and motor deficit zzso zzso and zzso loss zzso zzso in stroke patients but not in zzso zzso zzso injury in the descending motor tracts would appear to be an important zzso of motor impairment in both stroke and zzso In stroke, zzso measures of zzso are closely related to zzso damage and thus also correlate with motor zzso However in zzso zzso measures of zzso do not correlate with zzso loss or motor deficit suggesting that zzso and zzso may occur independently of zzso damage and are less closely linked with functional zzso
