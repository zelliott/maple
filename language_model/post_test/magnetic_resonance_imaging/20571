The recent zzso in interest about pediatric bipolar disorder zzso has spurred the need for greater understanding of its zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have implicated zzso dysfunction in pediatric zzso However, recent data suggest that zzso neural changes account for a small fraction of the zzso energy zzso We now report the first use of zzso spontaneous resting state functional connectivity zzso to study the neural zzso of pediatric zzso 

We acquired zzso zzso blood oxygen zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging scans while participants were at rest and also a high-resolution anatomical image (both at three zzso in BD and control youths zzso zzso 15 of zzso We focused, on the basis of prior research, on the left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso amygdala, and zzso Image processing and zzso analyses followed that of prior zzso 

Our primary analysis showed that pediatric BD participants had significantly greater negative zzso between the left zzso and the right superior zzso zzso versus control zzso Secondary analyses using partial correlation showed that BD and control youths had opposite phase relationships between spontaneous zzso fluctuations in the left zzso and right superior zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that pediatric BD is characterized by altered zzso functional connectivity in a zzso circuit that is also implicated in working memory and zzso Further study is warranted to determine the effects of age, zzso development, and treatment on this circuit in pediatric zzso
