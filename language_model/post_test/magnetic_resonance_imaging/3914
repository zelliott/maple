To compare zzso zzso zzso with contrast zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the characterization of palpable breast zzso 

zzso patients zzso age, 51 zzso with a palpable breast mass were zzso examined with zzso MR imaging, and conventional zzso 2 weeks before zzso aspiration zzso 

In three patients, MR imaging was zzso Of the remaining 44 patients, 21 had zzso cancer and 23 had benign zzso The sensitivity of zzso was zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value zzso zzso and negative zzso value zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity of MR imaging was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In 11 patients with previous breast cancer, zzso findings were positive in all four with tumor recurrence and negative in all seven with benign zzso zzso were correctly characterized with MR imaging in eight of these 11 zzso 

Although both techniques accurately differentiate benign from zzso palpable breast masses, zzso is more accurate in the zzso zzso Because of lower cost, wider zzso and high patient zzso zzso may provide a valuable alternative to MR imaging for zzso characterization of palpable breast zzso
