The optimal advanced imaging method for detection and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso tears is zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of zzso zzso and MR imaging in the detection of surgically created zzso tears in zzso 

This was a prospective blinded study in which 16 fresh zzso foot and ankle specimens (3 men, 13 zzso average age at death zzso years; age range zzso zzso were scanned with both US and MR imaging before and after the surgical creation of 64 variable length zzso tears of the zzso zzso was performed with a 12 zzso linear zzso with independent interpretations of zzso and dynamic studies separately by two blinded and experienced musculoskeletal zzso MR imaging was performed at zzso T with a standard zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso and zzso fast spin echo zzso density and zzso zzso zzso TE zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were reviewed independently by two experienced musculoskeletal zzso who were blinded to the status of the zzso 

zzso zzso and accuracy of MR imaging in the diagnosis of zzso tears were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Dynamic US interpretation yielded values of zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso US interpretation was less reliable than dynamic zzso and the only significance of zzso imaging was a high specificity zzso for detection of zzso zzso The positive zzso value zzso for MR imaging and US was zzso and zzso respectively, and the negative zzso value zzso was zzso for both MR imaging and zzso 

Our results suggest that US and MR imaging perform at the same level for the detection of surgically created zzso zzso tears in a zzso zzso US has a higher specificity compared with MR zzso
