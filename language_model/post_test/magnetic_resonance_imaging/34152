To assess the efficacy of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the evaluation of complex abnormalities of zzso zzso 

Clinical and zzso findings were zzso reviewed in 24 patients who underwent MR imaging of a zzso zzso because zzso zzso findings were zzso or zzso with clinical zzso The final diagnoses were established with zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso or clinical and imaging follow-up zzso zzso zzso 

MR imaging diagnoses were correct in 16 patients zzso whereas US diagnoses were correct in six patients zzso zzso zzso zzso Five cases of zzso involvement by zzso zzso disorder zzso were found at zzso zzso at MR imaging, zzso appeared as zzso masses on zzso zzso images with minimal zzso In four of the five cases of zzso the masses occurred at the zzso zzso and encased zzso zzso zzso zzso was correctly diagnosed with MR imaging in five patients in whom a mass was suspected at zzso 

MR imaging results are often diagnostic in cases of complex abnormalities of zzso zzso Renal zzso involvement by zzso appears to have a relatively characteristic MR imaging zzso zzso MR imaging findings in cases of suspected masses at US may zzso zzso
