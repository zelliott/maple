zzso therapy for zzso zzso is technically difficult because of the complexity of the regional anatomy and the natural history of the zzso The results of a study are presented showing how detailed diagnostic information available from zzso is helpful in defining the target volume to be zzso and the critical normal zzso By using zzso planning techniques, an assessment was made of the relative merits of zzso beam therapy and of X ray treatment for patients with early stage and locally advanced zzso of the zzso For both types of patient, the study suggests that the use of zzso for the major part of treatment results in a more even distribution of dose to the tumor and an increase of approximately 5 zzso in median tumor dose with substantial reductions in doses to adjacent normal zzso The superior dose zzso possible with zzso should translate into improved local control and reduced zzso The difficulties of zzso treatment planning for this site are zzso
