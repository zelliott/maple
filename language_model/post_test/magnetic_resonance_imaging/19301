Recent advances in transgenic technology have made the mouse a particularly interesting small animal in cardiovascular zzso Increasingly sophisticated experimental methods and tools are needed for detailed characterization of cardiovascular physiology and zzso in the zzso The objective of this study was to develop a method for zzso evaluation of cardiac energy metabolism in the zzso zzso gated zzso magnetic resonance zzso using Image zzso in zzso zzso zzso method was applied in old mice zzso bovine growth hormone zzso zzso zzso 5) and control mice zzso zzso zzso The localized volumes of interest were 128 and 112 zzso zzso zzso ratio was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso in the control group zzso zzso zzso The study demonstrates the feasibility of application of zzso zzso MRS for evaluation of cardiac energy metabolism in the mouse under maintained zzso zzso
