During surgical clipping of zzso zzso reduction in zzso zzso is thought to indicate cortical zzso and subsequent neurological zzso Since the sensitivity of zzso is questioned, we investigated zzso with respect to zzso zzso 

In 36 patients with 51 zzso zzso clinical evaluation and zzso zzso zzso was performed before and within zzso after zzso During surgery, time of temporary zzso was zzso zzso images were reviewed for signs of zzso 

For 43 clip applications zzso we observed neither zzso zzso events nor zzso in zzso In two cases where reduction lasted zzso zzso after clip release, zzso events correlated with zzso in the zzso Only one of the zzso patients was symptomatic and developed a transient zzso 

While zzso zzso events correlated with visible zzso in zzso only in two cases with late zzso recovery, zzso in zzso may have been transient or may not have reached detection threshold in the other cases, in agreement with the absence of permanent neurological zzso 

In complex aneurysm cases, where prolonged temporary zzso is expected, zzso should be used to detect zzso at a zzso stage to improve the safety of aneurysm zzso
