Traditional methods of measuring zzso in magnetic fluid samples, such as vibrating sample zzso zzso are typically limited to maximum field strengths of about 1 zzso This work demonstrates the ability of zzso to measure the zzso associated with two commercial zzso contrast agents at 3 T by comparing zzso solutions to experimental imaging results for the field pattern associated with agents in zzso zzso The results of the zzso and fitted zzso data match zzso The method represents an improvement over zzso zzso since results are zzso at imaging field zzso The agents investigated are zzso a zzso iron oxide suspension used primarily for liver imaging, and zzso a zzso zzso compound used for tumors, inflammation and vascular zzso MR imaging of the agents took place in sealed zzso zzso in the presence of a surrounding volume of zzso water where the effects of the contrast agents had a measurable effect on the water's zzso in the vicinity of the compartment of contrast zzso A pair of phase images were used to reconstruct a zzso zzso The zzso zzso maps in the water region, corrected for zzso and container edge effects, were used to predict the agent's zzso at 3 zzso The results were compared with the results from zzso zzso up to zzso T and close correlation was zzso The technique should be of interest to those seeking zzso of the zzso associated with magnetic suspensions beyond the traditional scope of zzso The zzso needs to be sufficiently strong zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso for a measurable zzso field in the surrounding zzso For this reason, the technique is mostly suitable for zzso zzso
