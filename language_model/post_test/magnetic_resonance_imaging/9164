Previous studies have shown the safety and effectiveness of balloon zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso fractures zzso zzso and particularly the short zzso inversion recovery zzso sequence are very sensitive for detecting zzso zzso as a result of fresh fractures or zzso zzso it has a great therapeutic relevance in zzso zzso zzso seen by conventional X-ray and CT zzso Although an zzso scan is expensive, to my knowledge no study has evaluated the benefits of zzso zzso in evaluating a therapeutic plan for zzso This is a prospective study evaluating the benefit of a zzso zzso scan regarding changes of zzso zzso zzso patients were included in this zzso zzso patients were treated by balloon zzso in a total of 40 zzso zzso The mean age was 73 zzso All patients suffered from zzso As a first step, all patients got a CT zzso The individual therapeutic plan was then defined by the patients' history, complaints and the results of the CT zzso As far as all criteria for zzso were zzso an zzso examination including the STIR sequences was performed zzso The number of times a change was made in therapy as a result from the additional information from the zzso was then zzso By performing a preoperatively zzso examination, the therapy plan was changed in 16 out of 28 zzso zzso Eight patients underwent additional levels of zzso at the same zzso In five patients, zzso were found to be old fractures and therefore were not treated zzso Two of these patients received no zzso at zzso Another patient only a part of the originally intended levels was zzso The other two cases received a zzso at different zzso levels, as these zzso bodies showed signs of an acute fracture in the zzso zzso Additionally, an incidental diagnosis of zzso of the kidney was made in two zzso zzso was deferred and they were referred for further zzso One patient was found to have an zzso zzso zzso was performed and after that the patient was referred in order to treat the zzso This study confirms the diagnostic benefits of an zzso scan before performing a zzso For 16 out of 28 patients, the therapeutic plan was changed because of the information obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso helped to generate the correct surgical strategy, by demonstrating the correct location of injury and by detecting zzso zzso
