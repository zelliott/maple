To evaluate and compare zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso evaluation of patients with intractable zzso lobe zzso zzso and to correlate these quantitative zzso measures with the pathology of the zzso zzso 

Forty patients with intractable zzso who underwent zzso evaluation and subsequent zzso lobe zzso 

zzso zzso zzso volumes of zzso and zzso volume ratio zzso zzso of zzso with higher zzso divided by volume of zzso with lower zzso and qualitative zzso 

zzso patients had zzso zzso three patients had zzso zzso one patient had zzso zzso and four patients had a foreign tissue zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated zzso with the ratio of zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A high zzso signal in an zzso zzso was characteristic of zzso zzso All patients with zzso sclerosis had an zzso below control values, and only one of these had an zzso in the normal zzso zzso produced one zzso zzso The patients with zzso sclerosis had normal zzso and zzso The patient with zzso sclerosis had a normal zzso on qualitative and quantitative zzso Of the four patients with a zzso one had a mildly increased zzso and one had mild volume zzso zzso volume asymmetry could be reliably detected on visual inspection of the zzso with an zzso of zzso or less, and an increase of zzso with a zzso of 115 zzso or zzso 

zzso zzso combining zzso and zzso is a reliable method for diagnosing zzso sclerosis zzso zzso sclerosis and zzso sclerosis should be considered in patients with intractable zzso and negative findings on zzso studies, including quantitative measures of the zzso
