Growing demand for high spatial resolution blood zzso level dependent zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging faces a challenge of the spatial resolution versus coverage or zzso resolution zzso which can be addressed by methods that afford increased acquisition zzso zzso acquisition zzso have been shown to be superior to currently prevalent zzso imaging in terms of acquisition efficiency, and high spatial resolution can be achieved by employing zzso spiral zzso The zzso spiral zzso trajectory is preferred over zzso due to increased zzso signal zzso ratio zzso and higher acquisition efficiency than that of zzso or zzso spiral zzso zzso (Law & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but to date zzso of the zzso zzso spiral zzso for high spatial resolution imaging has not been zzso zzso we propose zzso zzso spiral zzso acquisition and investigate its zzso for high spatial resolution zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso Images reconstructed from zzso zzso and zzso zzso possess artifacts caused by differences in zzso zzso zzso and zzso errors associated with the two zzso We analyze the associated errors and demonstrate that application of zzso phase reconstruction and spectral filtering can substantially mitigate these image zzso After applying these processing steps, the zzso zzso spiral zzso pulse sequence yields high zzso zzso images at zzso resolution below 1 zzso 1 zzso while preserving acceptable zzso resolution (4 zzso and brain coverage (15 slices of 2 zzso zzso Moreover, this method yields sufficient zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso resolution for detection of zzso in zzso associated with cognitive tasks zzso memory zzso The zzso zzso spiral zzso acquisition is a promising technique for high spatial resolution zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso
