In this paper, the zzso goal was to determine whether benign zzso zzso have smooth walls or internal structure on high-resolution MR imaging and to evaluate their imaging characteristics on zzso zzso 

The authors zzso reviewed the MR imaging findings in 60 consecutive patients who were reported to have zzso zzso over a zzso zzso Patients were identified zzso using a word search of zzso zzso Of these 60 patients, 24 with stable follow-up imaging or pathological proof of a zzso zzso were included in this zzso In all cases, zzso or zzso zzso images were available, and in 10 of 24 patients the authors obtained zzso images using fast imaging employing zzso acquisition zzso For those cases in which FIESTA studies were zzso the authors classified the zzso into 1 of 4 categories based on their zzso zzso of 24 cases were performed with intravenous zzso 

Of the 24 cases, 21 had signal intensity on zzso images that differed from that of zzso Of the 10 cases with zzso 6 had evidence of internal structure within the zzso zzso The authors found it of interest that 20 of the 24 patients were zzso 

Although the presence of a thin wall supports the diagnosis of a benign zzso cyst, fine internal zzso or small internal zzso are common on high-resolution MR imaging and this finding should not be considered evidence of an underlying zzso It is typical for zzso zzso to have relaxation times that differ from zzso as determined by zzso zzso
