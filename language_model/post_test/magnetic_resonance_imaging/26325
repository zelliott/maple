After successful zzso coronary zzso zzso zzso to zzso of subjects have zzso a zzso coronary zzso narrowing at the site of the zzso At present, zzso is usually detected zzso with contrast coronary zzso This study was performed to determine if zzso zzso zzso could be used to detect zzso zzso in patients with zzso chest pain after zzso zzso 

zzso patients (15 men, 2 women, age 36 to 77 zzso with zzso chest pain zzso months after successful zzso intervention underwent zzso zzso of coronary artery flow reserve followed by assessments of zzso severity with zzso quantitative coronary zzso The intervention was performed in the left anterior descending coronary artery in 15 patients, one of its diagonal branches in 2 patients, and the right coronary artery in 1 zzso A zzso coronary flow reserve value zzso was zzso and zzso sensitive and zzso and zzso specific for detecting a zzso diameter narrowing of zzso and zzso zzso
