zzso in white matter have been linked to processing speed impairment in clinical populations zzso multiple zzso closed head zzso Recent studies indicate the presence of significant reduction in cerebral white matter volume in some patients with chronic zzso lobe zzso zzso The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between white matter volume and processing speed and performance efficiency on the zzso Memory zzso Test zzso The study groups included zzso subjects with white matter volume reduction zzso zzso subjects with normal white matter volume zzso and healthy controls zzso The groups did not differ in total cerebral gray matter zzso Compared with the controls, the reduced white matter volume zzso group exhibited a significantly steeper slope on the zzso This was characterized by a disproportionate increase in reaction time with increased processing demands zzso zzso particularly for negative probe zzso In contrast, no significant differences on the zzso were evident between controls and the normal white matter volume zzso zzso These findings suggest the presence of information processing speed and efficiency impairment in zzso and its relationship with white matter volume zzso
