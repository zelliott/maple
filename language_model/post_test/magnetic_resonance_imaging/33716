In a bovine cervical spine model, the ultimate and fatigue strengths as well as relative magnetic resonance imaging artifact produced by zzso zzso chrome, and stainless-steel wires in various zzso were zzso zzso and fatigue strength of wire zzso were zzso Although larger wires generally had greater zzso strength, fatigue strength was zzso zzso zzso and all stainless-steel models zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 10,000 cycles without failure, whereas all other zzso rarely could withstand a similar 10,000 zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed on calf cervical spines zzso with the various zzso zzso exhibited the least artifact, stainless-steel showed the greatest artifact, and zzso chrome an intermediate zzso Although titanium wire produces the least amount of magnetic resonance imaging artifact, it remains a poor choice for implant fixation because its notch sensitivity reduces its fatigue resistance compared with stainless steel, which remains the more dependable zzso
