zzso zzso have been reported in zzso to zzso of zzso Most previous studies have been retrospective and did not systematically perform cerebral magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

To determine the prevalence and zzso of zzso in a prospective zzso 

Prospective cohort zzso 

Stroke unit in an academic zzso 

Six hundred zzso consecutive individuals admitted to our stroke unit during an zzso period for suspected zzso 

zzso investigations systematically included cerebral zzso Among patients with zzso cerebral zzso individuals with zzso defined as occurring within 14 days of stroke, were zzso 

Three hundred zzso patients had zzso cerebral zzso and 178 had cortical zzso The zzso all initially partial seizures, occurred in 14 patients zzso and at stroke onset in 5 zzso The zzso occurred exclusively in patients with cortical involvement zzso zzso With zzso involving the cerebral cortex, there was a higher risk of zzso in watershed zzso than in territorial strokes (6 of 26 zzso vs 8 of 152 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed an almost zzso increased risk of zzso in patients with watershed zzso compared with other cortical zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Age, sex, diabetes zzso hypertension, smoking, National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso score, and zzso origin were not significant risk factors for zzso 

The cortical zzso location of zzso strokes is associated with a higher risk of zzso Among these patients, the watershed mechanism is a strong and independent zzso of zzso zzso
