The purpose of the study was to document the range of appearances of zzso cervical zzso zzso on zzso 

The MR images of nine patients who were subsequently found to have zzso were zzso zzso All patients were scanned on a zzso T unit using a neck zzso zzso zzso and a surface zzso (five zzso Each abnormal region was assessed separately for maximum size, pattern of disease, zzso zzso soft tissue zzso muscle involvement, and vascular zzso 

There were 17 abnormal zzso The zzso triangle was most frequently involved (six zzso followed by the zzso zzso (five zzso There were three patterns of disease, zzso discrete zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso occurred in 10 of the 17 abnormal zzso zzso areas were located peripherally in 7 of these zzso The percentage of zzso to solid areas ranged from zzso to zzso and was not related to the pattern of zzso zzso was present in four patients and was seen with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Muscle involvement and vascular zzso occurred in three zzso zzso was not zzso 

zzso revealed three patterns of disease in zzso discrete zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso when present, were more frequently peripheral rather than central, and this together with the soft tissue zzso may be of value in zzso zzso from zzso zzso
