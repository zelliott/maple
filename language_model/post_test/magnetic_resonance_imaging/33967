Several investigators have defined normal zzso values for the zzso zzso lobe structures in zzso normal elderly subjects, but, to our knowledge, no one has reported those values for a large sample of healthy zzso The purpose of our study was to define normal zzso values for the zzso formation, the amygdala, and the zzso horn of the lateral zzso by age group, ranging from 40 to 90 years, in order to generate a zzso for the quantitative MR diagnosis and differential diagnosis for early zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of the zzso formation, the amygdala, and the zzso horn, standardized by total zzso volume, were obtained from zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR images in 619 healthy volunteers and two zzso zzso 

zzso in standardized volumes of the zzso formation, the amygdala, and the zzso horn were significant among the zzso to zzso zzso to 80-year-old, and zzso to zzso groups, and were not significant between the zzso to 50-year-old and zzso to 60-year-old zzso We found no significant differences in side or sex among the age groups for any of the zzso 

zzso in the mean value and in the zzso normal range of standardized volumes of the zzso formation, the amygdala, and the zzso horn zzso to differences in age among healthy zzso therefore, age should be considered a factor in zzso research, especially in that involving patients in the early stages of zzso zzso
