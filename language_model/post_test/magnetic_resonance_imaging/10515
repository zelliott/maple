The zzso zzso zzso gene is considered to be a promising schizophrenia zzso zzso A common functional zzso zzso in the zzso gene affects zzso regulation in the prefrontal zzso zzso Recent studies suggest that this zzso contributes to poor prefrontal functions, particularly working memory, in both normal individuals and patients with zzso However, possible zzso changes underlying such functional zzso remain to be zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether the zzso zzso of the zzso gene has an impact on brain zzso in normal individuals and patients with zzso The zzso zzso zzso was obtained for 76 healthy controls and 47 zzso The diagnostic effects, the effects of zzso zzso and the zzso interaction on brain zzso were evaluated by using a zzso statistical analysis for high-resolution zzso a zzso zzso Patients with schizophrenia demonstrated a significant reduction of volumes in the zzso and zzso systems, zzso areas and the zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso demonstrated significant reduction of volumes in the left anterior zzso zzso zzso and the right middle zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction effects on brain zzso were noted in the left zzso the left zzso zzso and the left zzso No significant zzso effects or zzso interaction effects on zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were zzso In the control group, no significant zzso effects on brain zzso were zzso zzso zzso for the zzso showed a significant reduction of volumes in the bilateral zzso left zzso right zzso and left zzso compared to zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso zzso of the zzso gene might contribute to zzso abnormalities in zzso
