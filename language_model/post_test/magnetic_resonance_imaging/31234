To identify patterns of zzso extension of zzso zzso of the zzso 

Seven cases of zzso zzso of the hip were zzso zzso Imaging performed included conventional zzso ( zzso zzso ( zzso CT ( zzso and MR imaging ( zzso Disease extent on imaging was assessed for each patient and the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bodies zzso The presence and distribution of zzso spread was also assessed and correlated with the surgical zzso In all cases diagnosis was confirmed by zzso with all patients undergoing tumor zzso with or without zzso 

In five cases zzso disease extended beyond the hip zzso while the remaining two cases zzso were confined to the hip zzso These findings were confirmed at zzso Two distinct patterns of zzso spread were zzso The first pattern, noted in three cases, involved tumor extension along zzso The second pattern, noted in five cases, involved tumor extension along the zzso zzso fat zzso In three cases both patterns were zzso 

zzso spread of zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso spread may be predictable based on involvement of recognized zzso zzso of the hip zzso zzso patterns of zzso spread include extension into the zzso zzso as well as communication along the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso
