Integrated analyses of human anatomical and functional zzso offer a powerful paradigm for human brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso provide excellent zzso resolution of neural population dynamics as well as capabilities for source zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso provides excellent spatial resolution of head and brain zzso whereas functional zzso zzso techniques provide an alternative measure of neural zzso based on associated zzso zzso These zzso zzso and complement each other and can thereby improve our interpretation of functional neural zzso We have developed a number of zzso tools and techniques for the zzso comparison, and integrated analysis of multiple zzso zzso Construction of geometric anatomical models from zzso zzso data allows improved models of the head volume conductor and can provide powerful constraints for neural electromagnetic source zzso These approaches, coupled to enhanced zzso strategies for the inverse problem, can significantly enhance the accuracy of zzso zzso We have begun to apply these techniques for studies of the functional organization of the human visual zzso Such studies have demonstrated zzso functionally distinct visual areas that can be resolved on the basis of their locations, zzso zzso and differential sensitivity to stimulus zzso Our studies have also produced evidence of internal zzso organization in both zzso and zzso visual areas but have disclosed organizational departures from classical zzso Comparative studies of zzso and zzso suggest a reasonable but imperfect correlation between zzso and zzso zzso We have demonstrated a method for the integrated analysis of zzso and zzso and we outline strategies for improvement of these zzso By combining multiple measurement techniques, we can exploit the complementary strengths and transcend the limitations of the individual zzso zzso
