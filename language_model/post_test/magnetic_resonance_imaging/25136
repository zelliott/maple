Investigators have recently begun to examine the differential role of zzso of the zzso in episodic zzso Two distinct models have gained prominence in the zzso One model, outlined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso based mainly on animal studies, has proposed that episodic memory is zzso by the zzso two-thirds of the zzso zzso A second model, derived by zzso et zzso zzso zzso from their review of 52 PET studies, has suggested that the anterior zzso is activated by memory zzso while the zzso zzso is activated by memory zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have tended to show limited zzso in the zzso regions of the zzso providing support for the zzso and zzso zzso A potential zzso factor in these zzso studies, however, is that zzso artifact may zzso reduce signal in the anterior versus the zzso zzso In the present study, we examined zzso differences between zzso zzso during zzso and retrieval of words and interpreted our findings within the context of these two zzso We also examined the extent to which zzso artifact affects the analysis and interpretation of zzso zzso by demonstrating its differential effect on the anterior versus the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso analyses were conducted, allowing us to zzso differences between the anterior and zzso aspects of the zzso We detected significant zzso zzso in both the zzso and retrieval zzso Our data do not provide evidence for regional zzso differences in zzso between zzso and zzso The data do suggest that, even after accounting for zzso artifact, both zzso and retrieval of verbal stimuli activate the middle and zzso zzso more strongly than the anterior zzso Finally, this study is the first to zzso the effects of zzso signal loss on zzso zzso and suggests that this artifact has significantly biased the interpretation of earlier zzso zzso
