The detection of zzso zzso in brain zzso of Multiple zzso zzso patients is of great clinical interest since they are important markers of disease zzso However, many of the enhancing zzso are associated with normal structures zzso blood zzso or noise in the zzso making the detection of zzso zzso a challenging zzso Furthermore, these zzso are typically small and in close proximity to zzso In this paper, we present a zzso zzso zzso zzso Random Field zzso zzso capable of leveraging spatial and zzso information, for detection of zzso zzso zzso In the first level, a zzso based zzso with zzso of up to size three, is used to identify candidate zzso In the second level, higher order zzso are incorporated leveraging robust textural features which are zzso to rotation and local intensity zzso Furthermore, we show how to exploit zzso and zzso images, should they be available, into the zzso zzso The proposed zzso is tested on 120 zzso clinical zzso acquired from zzso zzso patients during zzso clinical zzso zzso show a sensitivity of zzso a positive zzso value of zzso and average False Positive zzso counts of zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso results show the same sensitivity as the zzso model while decreasing the zzso counts by zzso
