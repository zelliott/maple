Physical techniques have always had a key role in medicine, and the second half of the 20th century in particular saw a revolution in medical diagnostic techniques with the development of key imaging zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso and zzso These techniques use the full zzso of the electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma rays to radio waves, and zzso In most cases, the development of a medical imaging device was zzso many scientists in physics laboratories were experimenting with simple zzso images within the first year of the discovery of such rays, the development of the zzso and later nuclear zzso created the opportunity for nuclear medicine, and one of the zzso of zzso was initially attempting to develop an alternative to zzso zzso for the analysis of crystal zzso What all these techniques have in common is the brilliant insight of a few pioneering physical scientists and engineers who had the zzso to develop their zzso followed by a series of technical innovations that enabled the full diagnostic potential of these instruments to be zzso In this report, we focus on the key part played by these scientists and engineers and the new imaging instruments and diagnostic procedures that they zzso By bringing the key developments and applications together we hope to show the true legacy of physics and engineering in diagnostic zzso
