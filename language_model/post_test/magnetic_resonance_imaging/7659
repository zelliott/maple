zzso areas supporting cognitive control and zzso demonstrate different neural responses to visual food cues in patients with eating zzso This zzso cognitive control, which interacts with bottom-up zzso responses, is tightly integrated not only in task conditions but also in the zzso The zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso of a large-scale network that is involved in self-referential processing and cognitive zzso We investigated zzso functional connectivity of the zzso and hypothesized that altered connectivity would be demonstrated in cortical zzso structures involved in self-referential processing and cognitive zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity was analyzed in women with anorexia zzso zzso women with zzso zzso zzso and age matched healthy controls zzso Between group comparisons revealed that the anorexia zzso group exhibited stronger zzso activity between the zzso and zzso cortex, whereas the zzso zzso group showed stronger zzso activity between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both groups demonstrated stronger zzso activity between the zzso and zzso which correlated with higher scores of the Body Shape zzso The zzso zzso zzso might be associated with the zzso zzso on eating, weight and body shape in patients with eating zzso
