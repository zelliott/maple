We have used magnetic resonance imaging to examine five patients treated with zzso blood patches for persistent post zzso puncture zzso Images were obtained between 30 zzso and 18 h after zzso zzso blood patch injection produced a focal zzso mass around the injection site which initially compressed the zzso zzso and nerve zzso The main bulk of the zzso zzso extended only three to five spinal segments from the injection site, although small amounts of blood spread more zzso zzso from the injection site was principally zzso Mass effect was present at 30 zzso and 3 zzso but zzso resolution had occurred by 7 zzso leaving a thick layer of mature zzso over the zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso hours after injection only small widely distributed zzso adherent to the zzso zzso were zzso zzso leakage of blood from the injection site into the subcutaneous zzso was present in all zzso
