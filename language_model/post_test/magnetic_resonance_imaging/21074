zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso drug of the selective zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The aims of this study were evaluating its in zzso distribution and kinetic models in human zzso Also, this study was to determine optimal scan duration of dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso for accurate zzso kinetic parameters and the feasibility of zzso approach for assessing distribution volume ratio zzso zzso dynamic PET and magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans were performed in 5 healthy zzso Blood sampling were collected for the input zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained in 7 brain regions using zzso zzso for zzso using simple tissue compartment model zzso and zzso models with irreversible zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Total distribution volume zzso for each region of interest zzso and zzso were zzso Also, ratio between the standard zzso value zzso of each zzso and that of zzso zzso was zzso and correlated with the zzso zzso information criteria analysis showed that the zzso was the most suitable zzso Average values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso in zzso PET scan time longer than 50 zzso was required for the accurate zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was well correlated with zzso
