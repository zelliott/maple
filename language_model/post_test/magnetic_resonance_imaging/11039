The zzso zzso is being increasingly used in magnetic resonance imaging zzso and MR zzso imaging zzso to obtain zzso and zzso images of the prostate with high zzso ratio zzso In practice, however, the use of zzso probe inevitably zzso the prostate and other soft tissue zzso making the analysis and the use of the acquired image data in treatment planning zzso The purpose of this work is to develop a zzso image registration zzso to map the zzso information obtained using an zzso probe onto CT images and to verify the accuracy of the registration by phantom and patient zzso A mapping procedure involved using a thin plate zzso zzso transformation was implemented to establish zzso correspondence between a reference image and a floating image with zzso An elastic phantom with a number of implanted zzso markers was designed for the validation of the quality of the zzso zzso images of the phantom were obtained before and after a series of intentionally introduced zzso After mapping the distorted phantom to the original one, the zzso of the implanted markers were measured with respect to their ideal positions and the mean error was zzso In patient studies, CT images of three prostate patients were acquired, followed by 3 zzso (3 zzso MR images with a rigid zzso zzso Registration quality was estimated by the zzso position displacement and image coincidence index zzso Phantom and patient studies show that zzso registration has achieved significantly higher accuracy than the previously reported method based on a zzso transformation and zzso The technique should be useful to map the MR zzso zzso acquired with zzso probe onto the treatment planning CT zzso to guide zzso zzso
