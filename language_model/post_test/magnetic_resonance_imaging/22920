Giant cell tumor zzso of the bone has historically been regarded as an extremely unpredictable bone zzso The anatomical characteristics of spinal zzso still present challenges to zzso zzso remains regarding the proper treatment of patients with grade III zzso 

Eleven patients with grade III zzso of the zzso spine were treated between 1992 and 2002 at a medical center by the zzso Three patients were initially treated at other zzso zzso zzso was employed for local recurrence in these three zzso The other eight patients were initially treated with marginal zzso The site, size, and extent of each zzso dictated the surgical zzso 

Five patients had tumor zzso One patient, who received zzso had local zzso with zzso transformation and finally died due to zzso zzso One patient had a zzso tumor with multiple zzso throughout the zzso Neurological status, measured using the American Spinal zzso Association scale, of one patient was worse after undergoing the procedure than preoperatively and three patients showed zzso The other seven patients were classified as with the same grade zzso 

Wide zzso of zzso of the zzso spine is difficult and there is a risk of neurological deficit and spinal zzso zzso marginal zzso with associated reconstruction may obtain good local control and preserve functional zzso Early detection of zzso zzso during intensive follow-up can allow for treatment using en bloc zzso which has achieved favorable zzso
