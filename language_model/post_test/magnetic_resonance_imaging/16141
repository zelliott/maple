The purpose of the study was to determine if a positive association exists between zzso vessel wall thickness and generalized zzso zzso Our hypothesis is that generalized zzso is another facet of the zzso zzso 

The medical ethical review board of our institution approved the zzso Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to the zzso zzso resonance zzso images of the knee were obtained in 42 patients who had been diagnosed with generalized zzso at multiple joint zzso Another 27 MR images of the knee were obtained from a matched normal zzso reference zzso zzso wall thickness of the zzso artery was zzso measured by dedicated zzso Linear zzso models were used to investigate the association between vessel wall thickness and generalized zzso zzso were made for age, sex, and body mass index zzso zzso intervals zzso were zzso at the zzso level and a significance level of alpha zzso zzso was zzso 

Patients in the generalized zzso population had a significant higher average vessel wall thickness than persons from the normal reference population zzso zzso or zzso zzso even when correction was made for sex, age, and zzso The average vessel wall thickness of the zzso artery was zzso zzso in patients with generalized zzso and zzso zzso in the matched normal reference zzso 

The association found between increased zzso artery vessel wall thickness and generalized zzso suggests that generalized zzso might be another facet of the zzso zzso
