Medical charts of all patients with medically zzso partial zzso submitted to prolonged zzso monitoring in the zzso Unit at zzso during a zzso period were zzso in search of reports of zzso zzso The clinical, zzso and zzso data of the identified patients were zzso 

Among 136 patients evaluated with prolonged zzso monitoring, three zzso presented spitting zzso during complex partial zzso All of them were zzso and had clear signs of left zzso sclerosis on zzso In two patients, in all zzso in which zzso spitting was observed, zzso seizure onset was seen in the left zzso zzso In the third patient, zzso onset with scalp zzso was observed in the right zzso zzso but zzso monitoring with zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso onset in the left zzso zzso confirming false zzso in surface zzso The three patients became zzso following left anterior zzso zzso
