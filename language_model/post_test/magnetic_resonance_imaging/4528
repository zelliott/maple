This study was designed to zzso the motor function area related to finger movements in normal human brain using zzso zzso 640 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Seven healthy male volunteers performed zzso isolated baseline and task zzso The task was a right zzso opposition task, which was loaded for the initial 11 zzso of the zzso A zzso zzso zzso camera was zzso At each session, administration of 222 zzso zzso was followed by 16 serial zzso dynamic zzso zzso To obtain matched brain anatomical images, zzso was also performed using the same slice formation as in the zzso zzso After image zzso zzso were set on bilateral zzso hand areas zzso the supplementary motor area zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The percent increase of zzso activity zzso in the task session compared with that in the baseline session was calculated in each zzso after zzso to the global brain zzso 

There was significant zzso of the left zzso by the task, the zzso of which was zzso in the initial phase of dynamic images (the zzso zzso This area was located in the left zzso area identified on the analogous slice in the MR zzso The left zzso showed gradual and statistically significant decrease of zzso during the three zzso 

zzso zzso may be used to identify the primary motor zzso and to evaluate its function in some pathological zzso
