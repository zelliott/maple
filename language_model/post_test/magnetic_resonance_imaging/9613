To describe general movement in extremely premature infants and examine correlations with risk factors for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were followed zzso 

The zzso general movement was analyzed using video zzso zzso and quantitative assessments were performed during the writhing movement zzso period and zzso movement zzso zzso The quality of the general movements zzso and the scores achieved were then correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso motor activity zzso during the zzso period, especially in extremely premature infants where poor repertoire is often zzso No correlations were found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso age correlated with zzso quality zzso zzso correlated with factors of zzso morbidity such as chronic lung disease zzso zzso and zzso infections zzso At 3 months corrected age, the spontaneous movement quality are correlated with neurological explorations such as US brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and neurological follow-up assessments zzso 

zzso must be used when performing the analysis of general movement in extremely zzso zzso zzso may be influenced by zzso zzso and possibly by the severe brain zzso of these zzso zzso correlate with zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of general movement in infants of 3 months corrected age is a valuable means to detect neurological zzso
