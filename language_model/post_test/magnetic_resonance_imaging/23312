This study aimed to evaluate the ability of zzso signals at high zzso field (7 zzso to map zzso single-digit zzso in subdivisions zzso zzso and 1) of the human primary zzso zzso zzso in individual zzso We acquired zzso zzso data from cortical areas around the central zzso in six healthy human subjects while stimulating individual finger pads with zzso air zzso zzso single-digit responses were identified in an area along the zzso bank of the central zzso corresponding to area zzso and in an area along the crest of the zzso zzso corresponding to area zzso In single subjects, zzso of digits 1 to 4 in both areas zzso and 1 were organized in a zzso zzso The separation of zzso representations was measured for adjacent digits and was approximately zzso times greater in area zzso than in area zzso Within individual subjects, the cortical responses to single-digit zzso and the magnitude of the zzso signals were zzso across imaging runs and were comparable across zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso at 7 T is capable of revealing the zzso organization of single-digit zzso with good zzso reliability and zzso and zzso maps can be acquired within a reasonably short time window, which are essential characteristics for several neurological applications within patient zzso
