zzso and functional findings in schizophrenic patients with formal thought disorder zzso show abnormalities within zzso semantic zzso The present study investigate the network function of the involved brain regions as a function of zzso zzso 

We examined a group of 16 schizophrenia patients differing in zzso but not in overall symptom severity, and 18 matched healthy zzso A passive word reading paradigm was applied during functional zzso zzso A zzso independent component analysis approach separated the zzso signal into independent zzso and spatial similarity was used to estimate the individual differences in spatial zzso of zzso 

The semantic network was identified for both groups encompassing structures of the left inferior frontal zzso the left angular zzso and the left middle zzso zzso The differences between the semantic networks of patients and controls increased with increasing severity of zzso This difference was due to a decreasing contribution of the left inferior frontal zzso zzso area 45 and zzso 

zzso of zzso was correlated with a disruption of the left semantic network in schizophrenic zzso We suggest that zzso is a consequence of a zzso zzso due to a complex interaction between structural and functional abnormalities within the left semantic zzso
