To determine the effects on zzso blood pressure and cerebral blood flow of intravenous zzso injection of three MR contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso iron particles zzso 

A zzso laser zzso zzso probe was placed zzso in 56 zzso zzso zzso blood flow and mean zzso blood pressure were measured before zzso zzso and up to 30 minutes after intravenous zzso administration of the three contrast zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 per group), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Neither the higher nor lower dose of zzso zzso had any statistically significant effect on cerebral blood flow, and there was no change in blood pressure during administration of either dose of zzso zzso Administration of zzso caused a transient drop in blood pressure in two animals, marked in one zzso to zzso of baseline zzso and mild in the other zzso of zzso After administration of zzso a significant decrease in blood pressure occurred in one animal zzso of zzso Despite this decrease in mean zzso blood pressure, there were no statistically significant changes in cerebral blood flow after administration of zzso or zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso injection of these contrast agents at clinically relevant doses causes no significant zzso in cerebral blood zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is well suited for cerebral MR zzso imaging without inherent influence on cerebral blood flow and that the same is probably true for zzso and zzso
