The authors evaluated the impact of motion zzso on zzso mapping of the zzso zzso with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Different mapping zzso were compared with regard to the frequency of motion zzso and the resulting signal zzso 

94 surgical candidates with mass zzso near the central region were investigated using zzso zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso zzso echo sequences on a zzso T Philips zzso Three functional zzso were zzso a) repetitive zzso zzso of the hand to a fist zzso zzso b) repetitive zzso opposition zzso zzso c) sensory stimulation by repetitive brushing of the palm (15 zzso zzso zzso changes were identified by statistical analysis with the zzso MR signal increase in percent was calculated for each of the zzso Motion zzso were rated on a scale from 1 to zzso 

Severe motion zzso occurred in 8 hand zzso runs and in 2 finger opposition zzso zzso were more pronounced in hand zzso than in finger zzso There were no motion zzso in any of the sensory stimulation zzso zzso the percent MR signal change there was no significant difference between hand zzso and finger opposition zzso zzso but a highly significant difference zzso between both motor tasks and the sensory paradigm zzso zzso zzso finger zzso zzso sensory zzso zzso 

zzso stimulation causes by far less zzso than motor zzso but it also has to be considered less sensitive as it produces a smaller MR signal zzso Therefore in zzso evaluation sensory stimulation should be kept in reserve for cases in whom motion zzso are very likely to occur, zzso patients with severe forms of zzso
