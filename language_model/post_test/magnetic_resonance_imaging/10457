Silent cerebral white matter zzso are observed on magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans in elderly people, and they are related to vascular risk factors, particularly zzso No data on the prevalence and risk factors of white matter zzso in patients with chronic kidney disease zzso are zzso The aim is to analyze the prevalence of white matter zzso and their zzso in this zzso 

We studied 52 patients without diabetes with zzso zzso 3 or 4) aged 30 to 60 years zzso 49 zzso and a group of 32 zzso control zzso zzso studies were performed and zzso and zzso white matter zzso were evaluated by using zzso zzso Patients were classified into 2 groups depending on the presence or absence of white matter zzso zzso studies and measures of markers of systemic inflammation zzso protein and zzso 6) also were zzso 

White matter zzso were more prevalent in patients with zzso than controls zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso Patients with zzso who had white matter zzso were zzso had a greater history of cardiovascular disease and vascular zzso as a primary cause of zzso disease and greater levels of zzso blood pressure, pulse pressure, left zzso mass index, and zzso zzso and were administered more zzso drugs than patients with zzso without white matter zzso Stage and duration of zzso were not related to the presence of white matter zzso After adjusting for several factors, only vascular zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso independently predicted an increased risk for white matter zzso 

One third of middle-aged patients with zzso have silent cerebral white matter zzso zzso zzso seems to be the most important factor related to the presence of these zzso suggesting that white matter zzso reflect zzso brain damage caused by generalized vascular zzso
