zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso have described zzso loss involving zzso and zzso tracts in the spinal zzso This zzso study was intended to investigate in zzso diameter zzso of the spinal zzso in zzso including both pure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and complicated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Standard zzso examinations of the cervical and zzso spinal zzso in zzso patients and a control group zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by standardized spinal zzso zzso In zzso patients, significant zzso of the upper spinal zzso compared to controls was observed at p zzso zzso both at the cervical and at the zzso zzso zzso diameters at both levels were also significantly reduced in the two zzso zzso in an additional comparison with zzso zzso of controls each, but zzso and zzso groups themselves did not zzso zzso zzso of the upper spinal zzso seems to be associated with zzso zzso due to the zzso zzso However, the differences between zzso and zzso could not be zzso by structural zzso at spinal zzso zzso
