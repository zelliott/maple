The anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the two distinct zzso structures in the brain which are difficult to observe in detail with conventional zzso such as a zzso zzso zzso However, recent advances in zzso resolution zzso have enabled us to examine the zzso and PC zzso The objective of the present study is to zzso the shape and size of the zzso and PC using a zzso zzso and to propose a new brain reference zzso 

zzso 21 males and 13 zzso healthy volunteers were enrolled in this zzso After determining the center of each zzso and PC, we defined the connection of these centers as the central zzso line zzso We compared the known zzso and zzso reference lines with the zzso to determine the difference in the zzso Additionally, we obtained horizontal line from flat ground line of look front zzso 

The difference in angle of the zzso and the zzso zzso line zzso from the horizontal line was zzso zzso zzso (11 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees in males and zzso zzso The difference in angle between the zzso and zzso line was zzso in both male and female, and there was no difference between both zzso Likewise, there was no significant difference in angle between the zzso and zzso between both sexes zzso zzso zzso in male and zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

In this study, we have used zzso zzso to define the zzso and PC zzso and in a more robust zzso We have showed that the zzso is a zzso reference line and serves as a standard for the zzso images of the human zzso
