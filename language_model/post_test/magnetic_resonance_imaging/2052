To assess the diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging for detecting bone zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso underwent MR imaging and bone zzso zzso In 80 zzso zzso of the 53 patients (13 positive specimens in 9 patients and 67 negative specimens in 44 zzso biopsy results and the signal intensity characteristics were zzso MR sequences included zzso SE, zzso zzso with fat suppression, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with fat suppression at zzso zzso 

To detect zzso zzso zzso zzso had the highest sensitivity zzso and zzso zzso with fat suppression and zzso STIR had the highest specificity zzso and zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso and zzso STIR yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity zzso and zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso and zzso STIR sequences seems to be the current choice of imaging protocol for detecting bone zzso zzso by zzso zzso
