This study demonstrates the in zzso displacement and strain of zzso cartilage in a zzso and intact joint using zzso imaging with zzso echoes zzso and fast spin echo zzso zzso and strain fields exhibited complex and zzso zzso The zzso in the loading direction ranged from zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso cartilage and from zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso strains ranged from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso The displacement and strain precision were determined to be 65 zzso and less than zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging is capable of determining the zzso zzso and strains in the zzso cartilage of an intact joint to a high zzso zzso of these zzso strains is critical for the in zzso characterization of normal and diseased zzso as well as the comprehensive evaluation of repair zzso designed using zzso zzso
