zzso and alcoholism are characterized by brain volume zzso Despite the frequent zzso of these conditions, the potentially compounded effects of zzso on brain structure have seldom been rigorously zzso 

To determine the compounding effect of schizophrenia and alcoholism on regional brain volumes, we performed retrospective quantitative analysis of magnetic resonance images from men who participated in research protocols at the Veterans Affairs Palo zzso Health Care System, Palo Alto, zzso Participants were selected on the basis of diagnostic criteria, yielding 4 comparison groups: 35 men zzso for zzso schizophrenia or zzso disorder and lifetime alcohol abuse or zzso 64 men with zzso schizophrenia or zzso zzso 62 men with Research zzso zzso zzso and 62 healthy men screened to exclude any Axis I diagnosis or heavy alcohol zzso The zzso group matched the schizophrenia group on age and illness severity but was younger and drank 5 times less alcohol in their lifetimes than the alcoholism zzso Gray and white matter volumes from 6 cortical regions were expressed as zzso and head zzso zzso scores and were subjected to zzso profile zzso 

Gray matter volume deficits were present in all 3 patient groups but were greatest in the zzso zzso In the zzso group, the most prominent volume deficits were in the prefrontal and anterior superior zzso zzso 

Despite lower alcohol exposure than in pure alcoholism, the zzso of schizophrenia with alcoholism has a particularly profound effect on prefrontal gray matter volume, compounding the prominent prefrontal deficits present independently in schizophrenia and zzso
