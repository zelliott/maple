To determine how zzso variation in children and adolescents with fragile X syndrome is linked to reduced levels of the fragile X mental zzso protein and to zzso zzso and zzso 

This study included 84 children and adolescents with the fragile X full zzso and 72 typically developing control subjects matched for age and zzso Brain zzso was assessed with zzso zzso and zzso modeling zzso Intelligence zzso was evaluated with standard cognitive testing, whereas abnormal behaviors were measured with the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso increased size of the zzso nucleus and decreased size of the zzso zzso zzso amygdala, and superior zzso zzso were present in the fragile X zzso zzso with fragile X also demonstrated an abnormal profile of cortical lobe zzso A receiver operating characteristic analysis identified the combination of a large zzso with small zzso zzso zzso amygdala, and superior zzso zzso as distinguishing children with fragile X from control subjects with a high level of sensitivity and zzso Large zzso and small zzso zzso zzso were associated with lower fragile X mental zzso protein levels and more pronounced cognitive deficits and zzso zzso 

zzso development of specific brain regions characterizes a zzso zzso associated with fragile X syndrome and may mediate the effects of zzso gene zzso on the cognitive and behavioral features of the zzso zzso X syndrome provides a model for zzso critical linkages among zzso brain, and zzso in children with serious zzso zzso
