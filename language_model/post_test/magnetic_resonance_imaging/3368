To date, magnetic resonance imaging zzso has made little impact on the diagnosis and monitoring of zzso in individual zzso In this study, we used a support zzso machine zzso zzso zzso approach to predict future illness course at the individual level from zzso data obtained at the first psychotic zzso 

One hundred patients at their first psychotic episode and 91 healthy controls had an zzso zzso Patients were re-evaluated zzso years zzso later, and were classified as having a zzso episodic or intermediate illness zzso zzso subjects with a continuous course were compared with 28 patients with an episodic course and with 28 healthy zzso We trained each zzso zzso independently for the following zzso continuous versus zzso continuous versus healthy controls, and episodic versus healthy zzso 

At zzso patients with a continuous course were already zzso with significance above chance level, from both patients with an episodic course zzso zzso zzso and healthy individuals zzso zzso zzso Patients with an episodic course could not be distinguished from healthy zzso When patients with an intermediate outcome were classified according to the discriminating pattern episodic versus zzso zzso of those who did not develop other episodes were classified as zzso and zzso of those who did develop further episodes were classified as continuous zzso 

We provide preliminary evidence of zzso application in the individualized prediction of future illness course, using a simple and automated zzso zzso When zzso and validated in larger groups, this could enable targeted clinical decisions based on imaging zzso
