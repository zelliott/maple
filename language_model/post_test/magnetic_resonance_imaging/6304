Since considerable expansion of zzso zzso occurs in patients with zzso cell anemia zzso magnetic resonance images of 20 hips in 10 patients with known zzso zzso were reviewed to determine a) if low signal zzso zzso extended into the zzso capital zzso and b) if the MR characteristics of avascular necrosis zzso differed depending on the type of zzso zzso Our results revealed variable zzso zzso type; mixed zzso and zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso AVN occurred irrespective of the underlying zzso zzso areas of low signal intensity in variable shapes zzso band, zzso or large homogeneous zzso was the most consistent MR manifestation of AVN in zzso A low signal intensity peripheral rim surrounding a central zone, zzso with zzso zzso on zzso and zzso weighted images, was most frequently observed similar to that described in patients without zzso The notable difference, however, was of zzso areas within the same zzso head that demonstrated variable central zone signal on zzso weighted zzso Further, while an increase in hip joint fluid is commonly seen with both early and advanced AVN in patients without zzso it was increased in only one hip in patients with zzso The observed differences in MR characteristics may be due to different zzso of AVN in patients with zzso
