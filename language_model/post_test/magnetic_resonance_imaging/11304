zzso iron oxide zzso particles are used as a contrast agent in liver magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso particles exert their greatest influence on zzso MR signal zzso The zzso zzso value that provides optimal contrast has not been systematically studied over the range of clinically relevant field zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso evaluate the TE dependence of the zzso tumor to liver zzso ratio zzso The hypothesis was that there is a TE that provides an optimal zzso zzso having probable zzso zzso zzso secondary to zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso images were acquired at zzso zzso equal to 46, 76, and 106 zzso by using a zzso spin echo pulse sequence at zzso T and zzso zzso The zzso for all zzso greater than 1 zzso in diameter was determined in zzso and zzso zzso A paired statistical design was used to identify zzso zzso zzso The primary findings were as zzso zzso zzso differences attributable to zzso variation over the range of zzso zzso were less than zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso 46 zzso yielded a statistically significantly greater zzso than did zzso zzso 76 or 106 zzso The same was true at the higher field strength, but differences were not zzso zzso zzso measures suggested that zzso reduced the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater at zzso T than at zzso zzso The observations indicate that over the field strength range of zzso zzso zzso differences attributable to the zzso variation, while being statistically significant in some cases, are small relative to those resulting from the zzso zzso
