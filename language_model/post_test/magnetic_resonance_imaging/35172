Since the zzso of zzso subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso is associated with decreased zzso risk, we evaluated whether reductions in zzso independent of changes in visceral AT zzso and abdominal SAT are associated with zzso in diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk zzso 

zzso and obese men zzso zzso zzso and zzso women zzso zzso 49) with elevated zzso risk underwent 3 months of diet and/or exercise induced weight-loss zzso regional body composition assessment by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso risk assessment, including an zzso 

After control for potential zzso reductions in zzso abdominal SAT and zzso were all associated with improvements in selective zzso risk factors, including zzso zzso levels, zzso status and zzso zzso and zzso Independent of changes in the other AT zzso reductions in zzso and abdominal SAT, but not zzso remained associated with improvement in zzso zzso levels, zzso tolerance and zzso zzso 

Among overweight and obese adults with increased zzso risk, the selective reduction of zzso is not associated with zzso in risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular zzso Thus, the reduction of excess AT conveys health benefit regardless of zzso
