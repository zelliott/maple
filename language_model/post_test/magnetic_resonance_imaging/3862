In this study, our purpose was to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of the dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso method in the patients with zzso duct zzso 

108 consecutive patients zzso men, 55 women, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso were included in this zzso All the patients underwent conventional upper abdomen zzso using intravenous contrast material zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were evaluated together with the zzso and zzso images, and both zzso ducts and surrounding zzso were examined for possible zzso that may cause zzso 

zzso findings compared with final diagnoses, zzso in the demonstration of zzso duct obstruction sensitivity zzso the specificity zzso and accuracy zzso in the detection of presence and level of zzso the sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and accuracy zzso in the diagnosis of zzso the sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and accuracy zzso and in the determination of the character of the zzso sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and accuracy zzso were zzso 

The combination of dynamic zzso zzso and zzso techniques in patients with suspected zzso obstruction gives the detailed information about the presence of zzso location, and causes and is a highly specific and sensitive zzso
