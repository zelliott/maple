Using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the functional connectivity throughout the entire brain in zzso The abnormalities in functional connectivity were identified by comparing the correlation zzso of each pair of 116 brain regions between 15 patients and 15 zzso Then, the global distribution of the abnormal functional zzso was zzso Experimental results zzso in general, a decreased functional connectivity in schizophrenia during rest, and such abnormalities were widely distributed throughout the entire brain rather than restricted to a few specific brain zzso The results provide a quantitative support for the hypothesis that schizophrenia may arise from the disrupted functional integration of widespread brain zzso
