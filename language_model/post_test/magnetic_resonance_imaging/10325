zzso from zzso studies have shown that the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso processes critical for organizing items in working memory zzso Based on its role in zzso we hypothesized that the zzso should contribute to long-term memory zzso formation by strengthening associations among items that are organized in zzso We conducted an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study to test this hypothesis by investigating prefrontal activity during performance of two different zzso tasks: on zzso trials, participants actively maintained triplets of words during a brief zzso whereas on zzso trials, participants actively organized each zzso during the zzso After zzso subjects performed an zzso test on words presented during both zzso zzso zzso results showed that zzso processing in the zzso condition enhanced zzso by strengthening zzso zzso zzso results showed that zzso activity specifically during zzso trials was zzso of subsequent zzso In contrast, activity in the zzso zzso prefrontal zzso was zzso of zzso for words studied on both zzso and rehearse zzso These results support the view that the zzso contributes to zzso formation through its role in organization of information in zzso
