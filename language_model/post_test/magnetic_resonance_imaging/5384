The objective of our study was to investigate the feasibility and zzso of blood zzso zzso zzso zzso using different zzso echoes at 3 T in patients with zzso zzso and healthy volunteers and to evaluate whether zzso zzso can be used to distinguish between cases of acute zzso rejection and normally functioning zzso 

zzso zzso at 3 T was performed of eight patients with normal zzso four patients with acute zzso zzso and 10 healthy zzso Multiple zzso echo sequences were performed at zzso echoes of 8, 16, and 20 to obtain zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was evaluated in patients with normal zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso values were not significantly different between healthy volunteers and patients with normal zzso but zzso zzso values were significantly greater than cortical zzso values in both groups for all three protocols zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values were significantly lower in cases of acute zzso rejection than in normal zzso for all three protocols zzso zzso zzso The mean difference in cortical or zzso zzso values was zzso or less in all zzso 

zzso zzso performed using different zzso echoes at 3 T is feasible and zzso in patients with zzso zzso and can show significant changes in zzso zzso in patients with acute zzso
