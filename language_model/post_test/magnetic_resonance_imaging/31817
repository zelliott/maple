zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso are currently regarded as standard zzso for the zzso of left zzso volumes and ejection zzso With the recent introduction of zzso zzso zzso the increased zzso resolution of 83 zzso should also improve the assessment of cardiac function in zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of zzso in the assessment of left zzso functional parameters with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso as standard of zzso Fifteen patients zzso female, 13 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent CT and zzso examinations on a zzso zzso zzso zzso Medical zzso zzso zzso and a zzso MR scanner zzso zzso zzso Medical zzso zzso zzso zzso CT images were zzso with a semiautomatic region growing zzso zzso zzso zzso Medical zzso by two independent blinded zzso In zzso dynamic zzso zzso of short axis slices were evaluated with semiautomatic zzso detection software zzso zzso Medical zzso independently by two zzso zzso volume zzso zzso volume zzso ejection fraction zzso and stroke volume zzso were determined for both zzso and correlation zzso systematic error, limits of agreement and zzso zzso were zzso In zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Thus, zzso was overestimated by zzso zzso zzso of agreement zzso while zzso was underestimated by zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso resulting in an zzso of zzso by zzso with limits of agreement at zzso and zzso Rank correlation zzso values were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso zzso were amounted to zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso offers the possibility to zzso left zzso function from coronary CT zzso zzso with sufficient diagnostic zzso adding to the value of the zzso in a comprehensive cardiac zzso The observed differences in the measured values may be due to different zzso methods and zzso reactions to contrast material injection without zzso zzso
