Enlargement of the zzso zone zzso on zzso resonance imaging of the zzso has recently been established as the major criterion for zzso in patients with zzso This study was conducted to zzso the extent of zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and relate it to the duration of zzso 

This was a prospective study of 70 patients presenting with the complaint of severe zzso Forty patients zzso reported zzso as their major complaint and 30 patients zzso suffered additionally from zzso Group I zzso consisted of patients with zzso of between 1 and 10 years' zzso group II zzso consisted of patients with zzso of longer than 11 years' zzso All patients underwent zzso to detect the presence and degree of zzso and all patients underwent zzso resonance imaging of the zzso to detect the extent of zzso by measurement of the zzso zzso 

In group I, zzso could be detected via zzso in 21 patients zzso while 19 patients zzso showed no signs of zzso By contrast, in group II a distinct enlargement of the zzso as the major zzso criterion of zzso could be observed in 26 patients zzso while only 4 patients zzso revealed no signs of zzso zzso The mean thickness of the zzso was significantly enlarged in group II zzso zzso compared with group I zzso zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso in zzso after zzso of more than 11 years' duration was zzso 

In deep zzso zzso a correlation between a specific zzso and zzso can often not be zzso Recently, zzso and zzso have been believed to result from a common zzso disease, the dislocation of the zzso zzso Our data clearly show that zzso of long duration in patients who have had zzso for over a threshold value of 11 years is significantly related to zzso of the zzso zzso evaluation of zzso using zzso should become a standard procedure in cases of zzso and zzso Severe zzso of long duration should always focus clinical interest on zzso of the zzso
