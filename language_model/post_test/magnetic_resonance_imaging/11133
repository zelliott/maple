Alzheimer's disease zzso and zzso zzso vascular disease zzso are common causes of zzso often zzso and can present quite similarly, making differential diagnosis clinically zzso This study tested the hypothesis that patients with zzso retain information better than zzso zzso Participants were 35 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso group), 27 zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso group), and 56 normal zzso zzso indicated that despite comparable levels of initial zzso zzso patients showed more rapid zzso Further analysis indicated that memory patterns within the zzso group were heterogeneous, with some participants exhibiting rapid forgetting and some exhibiting good zzso zzso participants with good retention showed a trend for greater executive zzso relative to zzso participants with rapid forgetting and zzso zzso zzso suggest that rapid forgetting in zzso may imply zzso zzso whereas the zzso in patients with good retention may be purely vascular in zzso Three zzso patients with rapid forgetting followed to autopsy all had zzso pathology, further supporting the link between memory patterns and zzso
