A new approach based on the calculation of the phase zzso in a region of interest on the phase images of a simple zzso echo zzso was used to assess the properties of zzso bone in the zzso zzso The phase zzso reflects the distribution of field zzso due to the difference in magnetic zzso between bone and zzso in a way similar to zzso However, the phase zzso monitors the zzso differences, whereas zzso studies the zzso zzso In this study of the radius of seven volunteers, both techniques were compared with parameters characterizing zzso bone structure derived from high resolution MR zzso zzso such as the apparent bone area zzso zzso number, thickness and zzso and zzso zzso dimension were zzso
