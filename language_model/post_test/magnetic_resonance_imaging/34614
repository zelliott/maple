When receiver operating characteristic zzso studies involve multiple detection tasks in the same patient, the correlations among the zzso interpretations and the shortage of patients raise several zzso zzso The authors propose methods for both zzso and zzso analysis of this type of zzso 

First, they zzso one accuracy statistic for each zzso Then one zzso zzso was calculated for each task and each zzso Then, they formed a summary index from the accuracy statistics and calculated the standard error of this summary index on the basis of the observed correlations among the zzso zzso The method was extended to comparisons of two diagnostic systems and illustrated by using data from a clinical zzso 

This approach can be used with rating or quantitative data and with any index of zzso whether calculated zzso or zzso
