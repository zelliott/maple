The zzso has been identified as a key region involved in zzso zzso zzso imaging studies have investigated the neural zzso patterns in this region involved in zzso and zzso zzso the underlying zzso mechanisms still remain zzso In order to investigate these, a well-established zzso task targeting zzso awareness zzso zzso and zzso awareness zzso zzso was combined with magnetic resonance zzso zzso Controlling for zzso noise, neural activity in the zzso during zzso and zzso awareness was confirmed in an independent data sample using the same zzso zzso zzso on MRS values from the left zzso and combining them with neural activity during zzso and zzso awareness in the same healthy individuals, we demonstrated that zzso concentration in a region highly involved in zzso processing is correlated with neural responses to zzso zzso as opposed to zzso zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso signal changes in the zzso predicted the degree of depressed zzso as measured by the zzso zzso zzso On the one hand, the association between zzso concentration and neural activity during zzso awareness provides novel insight into the zzso zzso of zzso function and zzso On the other, through the additional association of both zzso and neural activity during zzso with depressed zzso these data also bear potentially important implications for psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety, where zzso deficits, altered zzso function and abnormal affect zzso
