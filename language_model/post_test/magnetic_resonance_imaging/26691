zzso zzso and zzso are difficult to distinguish by using MR zzso zzso is useful before any zzso zzso or zzso Our hypothesis was that zzso and zzso tumors differ in zzso Shape analysis was proposed as an indicator for discriminating these 2 types of brain zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of this approach in the discrimination of zzso and brain zzso 

The zzso consisted of 33 brain MR imaging sets of zzso patients, of which 18 patients were diagnosed as having a zzso and 15 patients, as having solitary zzso brain zzso The MR imaging was segmented by using the zzso zzso The resulting set of classes (also called zzso represented the variety of zzso zzso A zzso approach allowed discrimination of the 2 types of zzso This approach was validated by a zzso zzso 

A method was developed for the discrimination of zzso and solitary zzso Two masses out of 33 were wrongly zzso the overall results were accurate in zzso of the observed zzso 

A zzso method based on a zzso analysis was zzso Its application was found to be useful in the discrimination of zzso from solitary zzso
