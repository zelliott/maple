zzso zzso occurs at an early age and has a high disability zzso Unfortunately, confirmed diagnosis in most patients is done at a very late stage, when the patients have shown typical symptoms and signs, and when treatment does not produce any desirable zzso It has become urgent to find a method that would detect early bone diseases in zzso to obtain time for the ideal zzso This study evaluated the accuracy of high field magnetic resonance imaging zzso combined with spiral zzso zzso zzso scan in detecting early bone diseases in zzso through imaging techniques and zzso examinations on an animal model of zzso 

Eighty adult rabbits were randomly divided into two groups with zzso in zzso The control group was fed normal diet zzso zzso zzso the experimental group was fed high zzso diet zzso zzso zzso for 3, 4, 5, or zzso intervals to establish the animal model of zzso The staging and imaging findings of the early bone diseases in zzso were determined by high field zzso and zzso scan at the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th zzso Each rabbit was sacrificed after high field zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso and bones were removed for pathological examination to evaluate the accuracy of imaging zzso 

zzso zzso studies revealed zzso osteoporosis and early cortical bone zzso The bone diseases in zzso displayed different levels of low signal intensity on zzso and low to intermediate signal intensity on zzso in bone of stage 0, I, II or III, but showed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cortical zzso on zzso zzso 

High field zzso combined with zzso scan not only detects early bone diseases in zzso but also indicates staging, and might be a reliable method of studying early bone diseases in zzso
