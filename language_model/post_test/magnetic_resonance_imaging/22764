Patients with early zzso zzso have repeatedly been reported to show spared language functions (which are then zzso by the right zzso but exhibit deficits in zzso zzso The zzso zzso explains these deficits by a zzso zzso in the right zzso for the original right zzso zzso An alternative hypothesis suggests direct zzso effects as the sole reason for the zzso zzso The scope of this study was to examine the relations between zzso skills and zzso preference for language, and between zzso skills and cerebral zzso zzso 

In a sample of young adults with zzso or zzso acquired focal zzso of the left zzso and unilateral zzso cerebral zzso on the right side, we assessed intelligence and zzso functions in the verbal and zzso zzso The zzso data was correlated with structural zzso information and language preference as assessed using zzso 

Patients with right zzso language production were impaired in zzso functions, compared not only to normal controls, but also to patients without right zzso language zzso Additionally, the degree of right zzso language correlated zzso with performance in zzso zzso zzso size correlated zzso only with performance zzso which again correlated zzso with motor impairment of the patients and thus does not seem to reflect true cognitive zzso 

zzso deficits in patients with early zzso zzso are a consequence of zzso right zzso language organization, thus lending further support to the zzso zzso
