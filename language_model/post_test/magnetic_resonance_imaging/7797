Bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso are increasingly being investigated in the field of zzso zzso In zzso monitoring of zzso can be performed with zzso which is a zzso zzso and clinically acceptable zzso In order to track these zzso cells must be labeled with zzso magnetic zzso However, they zzso from labeled cells, limiting their surveillance to a zzso zzso Li et zzso developed a zzso model in order to evaluate zzso monitoring of zzso injected zzso iron zzso zzso Both in zzso tracking and zzso analysis were zzso zzso zzso demonstrated increased zzso signal in the labeled test group over 3 weeks compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso blue zzso of zzso zzso confirmed these zzso The authors conclude that successful labeling of zzso is possible with zzso - magnetic zzso and that these cells can be monitored in zzso They offer this form of labeling as an alternative to more common zzso magnetic zzso
