zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso scans in gross tumor volume zzso zzso for zzso zzso is subject to zzso This study aims to evaluate contributions of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and physical examination zzso to zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso 

zzso patients with zzso were zzso All underwent zzso CT simulation scans zzso that were registered with zzso zzso and zzso For each patient, three sets of primary and zzso zzso were zzso First, reference zzso zzso were contoured by the treating radiation zzso zzso using CT, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additional zzso were created using fused zzso scans zzso and zzso scans zzso by two other zzso blinded to zzso To compare zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated by dividing the respective overlap volumes by overall zzso To evaluate the contribution of zzso composite zzso derived from CT, zzso and PET zzso were compared with zzso 

For primary tumors, zzso was significantly larger than zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Although no significant difference in size was noted between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso there was poor zzso between them zzso zzso zzso In addition, although zzso zzso zzso zzso was low, it was significantly higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that neither zzso should be used zzso zzso analyses to explain the low zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso disease when zzso was contoured without knowledge of zzso zzso Similar trends were observed for zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were high zzso indicating that although the zzso were zzso the added benefit was small in the context of zzso In addition, zzso did not aid greatly in zzso zzso zzso 

PET and zzso are complementary and combined use is zzso However, the low zzso zzso zzso zzso particularly for primary tumors underscores the limitations of defining zzso using imaging zzso zzso is invaluable and must be zzso
