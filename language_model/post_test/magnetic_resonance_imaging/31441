Variations in zzso barrier zzso opening after zzso have been suggested by some zzso and zzso transfer studies, although direct in zzso proof is still zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is also often used to zzso zzso damage in zzso We hypothesized that MR contrast agents of different sizes enhance differently when zzso openings vary in size and that zzso transfer zzso measured by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in these regions reflect such zzso 

Male zzso rats ( approximately 300 zzso zzso were subjected to 3 hours of zzso zzso of the middle cerebral artery followed by zzso zzso of the zzso at 24 hours after the zzso was assessed first by zzso zzso zzso zzso and then by zzso serum zzso linked to Evans blue zzso approximately 68 zzso zzso for contrast zzso zzso changes, cerebral blood flow, and zzso transfer zzso zzso for the 2 contrast agents were zzso After zzso rats were injected with fluorescent zzso and brains were studied by zzso zzso 

The zzso areas were always smaller zzso zzso than those for zzso zzso zzso and were contained within the zzso The difference between the 2 areas was significant zzso Changes in zzso were larger in zzso areas zzso to zzso zzso than in zzso areas zzso zzso The differences in cerebral blood flow values between the 2 regions were not significant zzso but those for the zzso values of the 2 zzso were different zzso to zzso Excellent agreement between regions of zzso enhancement and zzso zzso was also zzso 

These results substantiate earlier reports of regional differences in zzso opening after stroke and provide the first in zzso evidence for this zzso They also support the possible use of zzso in zzso zzso graded zzso damage in the absence of zzso zzso
