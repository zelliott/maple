Echo zzso imaging, a development of magnetic resonance imaging, can produce snapshot images of the stomach and zzso segment in as little as 64 zzso and can be more useful than conventional techniques when assessing zzso The aim of this study was to compare zzso zzso measured by simultaneous zzso tube zzso and echo zzso zzso Ten volunteers were studied following the zzso of 500 zzso water or 500 zzso zzso zzso images, with acquisition times of 130 zzso were taken at zzso zzso synchronized with zzso traces and presented as a zzso zzso This allowed direct visual comparison of gastric wall movement and zzso to be zzso zzso were confined to either the stomach or the zzso or zzso across the zzso zzso Over zzso images were available for zzso A larger number of zzso zzso were recorded with echo zzso imaging in both water zzso zzso zzso and food zzso zzso zzso groups, whereas zzso detected a greater number of isolated zzso pressure waves zzso zzso zzso The contraction rate for water and food studies was similar, but direct zzso indicated that the zzso technique zzso zzso zzso The ability of echo zzso imaging to record zzso zzso activity provides a new insight into the role of zzso and zzso zzso during gastric zzso
