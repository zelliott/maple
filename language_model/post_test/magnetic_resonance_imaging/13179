To evaluate right zzso zzso volume and ejection fraction zzso in adult normal subjects and repaired zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso border detection zzso 

Fourteen healthy volunteers and 20 patients with repaired zzso zzso age 31 zzso zzso underwent zzso and zzso within the same zzso Right zzso zzso volume zzso and zzso volume zzso and zzso were measured by two observers using zzso and compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and agreement between both methods were evaluated using zzso zzso Over or zzso of zzso in comparison to zzso was assessed using paired zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was excellent with zzso zzso of correlation zzso ranging from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso underestimated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but agreement between zzso and zzso was excellent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fraction was zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso agreement between both methods was good zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso combined to zzso zzso software shows fair agreement with zzso for RV volumes and zzso measurement in patients with repaired zzso and adequate zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest zzso for serial follow-up of patients with right heart zzso zzso However, the accuracy of zzso echo diminishes with larger RV volumes, in part due to current difficulty to include the entire RV in the zzso zzso Technical progress in zzso beam geometry is likely to address this zzso
