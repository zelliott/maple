The neural mechanisms underlying the integration and segregation of motion signals are often studied using plaid zzso These stimuli consist of two zzso zzso dynamic zzso of differing zzso which are either perceived to move in two unique directions or are integrated by the visual system to elicit the zzso of a zzso moving in a single zzso zzso pertaining to the motion of the individual component zzso are thought to take place in zzso zzso zzso whereas motion integration is thought to involve zzso in zzso stream zzso visual areas, particularly zzso By combining a zzso task that employed plaid stimuli with 1 zzso zzso repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso we demonstrated a double zzso between zzso and zzso visual zzso in terms of their contributions to motion zzso zzso over zzso zzso increased coherent motion zzso whereas zzso over zzso zzso had the opposite zzso These effects were robust directly after the stimulation administration and gradually returned to baseline within 15 zzso This double zzso is consistent with previous patient data and the recent hypothesis that both coherent and transparent motion zzso are supported by the visual system simultaneously and compete for zzso zzso
