There is no single test that is diagnostic of zzso including zzso The zzso detected with zzso are zzso zzso The principles of zzso diagnosis are based on showing dissemination of white matter zzso in space and zzso zzso is the most sensitive method for revealing zzso dissemination of zzso in space and zzso The pattern and evolution of zzso zzso in the appropriate clinical setting, has made zzso abnormalities invaluable criteria for the early diagnosis of zzso The first important role for zzso in the diagnosis of zzso allows for an early diagnosis of zzso for zzso patients using the zzso diagnostic criteria, including zzso for dissemination in space zzso and time zzso The sensitivity of diagnosing zzso within the first year after a single attack is zzso with a specificity of zzso The zzso evidence required to support the diagnosis varies, depending on the strength of the clinical zzso zzso a new zzso zzso to substitute for a clinical attack doubles the number of zzso patients who can be diagnosed as having zzso within 1 year of symptom zzso zzso the sensitivity of the test with more zzso criteria, as recommended by the zzso subcommittee, can result in decreased zzso The second important role for zzso in the diagnostic zzso of suspected zzso patients is to rule out alternative diagnoses obvious on zzso such as spinal zzso and most brain zzso zzso zzso that favor zzso include Dawson zzso zzso zzso corpus zzso zzso and zzso spinal zzso zzso However, other white matter diseases can have similar appearances on zzso zzso zzso enhancement greater than three months, zzso with mass effect, and zzso enhancement suggest other zzso A standardized zzso protocol for brain and spinal zzso is crucial for comparing across studies or between zzso zzso zzso cannot distinguish between acute and chronic zzso zzso provides useful information about new zzso activity and is helpful in ruling out alternative diagnoses such as zzso vascular zzso and zzso zzso A single zzso zzso can potentially provide evidence for dissemination in space and zzso Spinal zzso imaging is equally valuable to rule out spinal zzso or zzso and for detecting zzso zzso when brain imaging is zzso in patients suspected of having zzso zzso criteria may be too suggestive that zzso can be diagnosed by zzso and a negative zzso at the time of zzso does not rule out zzso zzso evidence plays a supportive role in what is ultimately a clinical diagnosis of zzso in the appropriate clinical situation, and always at the exclusion of alternative zzso
