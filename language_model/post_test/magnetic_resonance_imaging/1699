We investigated whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso is able to detect zzso manifestations of advanced bacterial meningitis in zzso Meningitis was induced in nine animals by injecting 150 zzso zzso colony forming units per zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso was performed 24 h zzso zzso 5) and 48 h zzso zzso 4) after zzso zzso included zzso animals that were injected zzso with 150 zzso zzso saline or zzso animals without puncture of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR images before and after administration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso zzso was found in 7 of 9 infected animals, but not in the control zzso zzso zzso enhancement was found in all infected animals, but in none of the zzso The animals zzso after 48 h showed a more pronounced zzso and a more intense zzso enhancement than animals zzso after 24 zzso Even in small animals such as rats, zzso can be used to detect the presence of bacterial meningitis and its associated zzso zzso may be a useful zzso method for monitoring the possible effect of zzso therapeutic strategies in experimental studies of zzso
