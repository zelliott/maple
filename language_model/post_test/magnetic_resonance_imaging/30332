Breast MR imaging has emerged as a highly sensitive zzso for the imaging of breast zzso However, there have been no reports concerning the usefulness of bilateral breast zzso to evaluate the zzso breast in zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of primary bilateral breast cancer, and to investigate the role of bilateral breast zzso in the detection of zzso breast zzso 

A retrospective review was performed of 556 consecutive women who had undergone surgery for the primary breast zzso MR imaging was performed on a zzso zzso Both the breasts were examined in the zzso plane on the zzso zzso and zzso dynamic images, acquired at 30, 90 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The affected single breast was zzso examined on images obtained in the third phase at 3 zzso 

zzso zzso patients had bilateral breast cancer, 14 zzso had zzso cancer and 10 patients zzso had zzso zzso In the 14 cases with zzso cancer, bilateral breast zzso was suspected at the time of the initial diagnosis in 6 zzso The detection rate of 18 zzso breast cancer cases by only zzso only zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For 8 of these cases with a second zzso cancer, the corresponding rates were 75, 88, 100 and zzso zzso For the 10 cases with a second zzso cancer, the rates were 30, 50, 60 and zzso zzso 

zzso breast zzso is a more sensitive for the detection of zzso breast zzso compared with conventional imaging zzso In particular, bilateral zzso also allows detection of zzso zzso zzso at an earlier stage during the zzso follow-up zzso
