This study was designed to seek the appropriate scanning parameters for zzso and zzso weighted images of rat head by use of a high zzso zzso magnetic field strength magnetic resonance imaging zzso The optimum values of variables for zzso weighted images were considered to be a time of repetition of 1,000 zzso and for zzso weighted images, 8 zzso When the zzso images of a healthy rat head were scanned using these optimum values, the zzso zzso zzso bulb, zzso zzso zzso zzso spinal cord, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fluid were clearly observed in either zzso or zzso weighted zzso Moreover, a primary brain tumor induced by zzso was depicted as a high signal intensity mass in zzso and zzso zzso weighted zzso
