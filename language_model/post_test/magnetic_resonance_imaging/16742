To determine the natural history and management for patients with zzso zzso 

zzso case series of zzso zzso confined to the zzso zzso 

zzso referral zzso 

Ten patients were found to have zzso limited to the zzso from 1998 to zzso 

All subjects underwent at least 1 magnetic resonance imaging zzso study and had at least 1 zzso Two patients underwent a zzso zzso for intractable zzso 

zzso symptoms, initial and follow-up zzso findings, zzso testing results, and need for surgical intervention were recorded for each zzso 

Hearing loss was present in all 10 patients at their initial zzso zzso was present in 50% of patients, and vertigo was present in zzso of zzso No patient presented with zzso fullness or facial zzso The pattern of hearing loss seemed to correlate with the location of the zzso within the zzso Of the 9 patients that had follow-up zzso 3 patients showed tumor zzso Two of the 10 patients underwent surgical zzso for intractable vertigo that resulted in resolution of zzso 

Hearing loss is the most common finding in patients with zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso If the patient does not have symptoms of intractable zzso observation with serial zzso scans is zzso zzso zzso should be reserved for patients with intractable vertigo or with significant tumor zzso
