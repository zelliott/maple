To evaluate the usefulness of the zzso device in patients affected by low back pain due to degenerative disc zzso 

Recently a number of zzso devices for dynamic zzso zzso have entered the clinical practice in zzso All of these devices have a common property of acting on the zzso part of the functional spinal unit by distracting the zzso processes and avoiding extension of the treated zzso zzso these systems seem to improve the zzso area of the zzso zzso and enlarge the diameter of the zzso zzso What was found as a collateral observation after zzso of these devices was that those patients affected by low back pain, improved significantly in their pain zzso 

zzso consecutive patients were included in the zzso There were 29 females and 23 zzso aged between 29 and 77 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso symptom duration ranged from 6 to 84 months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso median 24 zzso following diagnostic measures were performed in each zzso zzso dynamic zzso and provocative zzso positive for pain zzso patients were followed for pain by zzso and for functional status by zzso zzso zzso zzso The minimum follow-up was 24 months zzso The intermediate follow-up at 6, 12 and 18 months was tested for, zzso 

To determine the number of improved patients we have arbitrarily selected a zzso criteria based on a zzso of improvement as calculated on the Roland Morris zzso zzso scale comparing the 24 months values to the baseline zzso zzso patients zzso were considered as success and 2 zzso were considered as zzso No long-term complications were zzso 

This preliminary report indicates that the zzso device could possibly be useful in the treatment of zzso due to zzso Further research with zzso is necessary to confirm these preliminary zzso
