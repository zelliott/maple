zzso and zzso zzso was performed in patients with zzso zzso to evaluate factors influencing motor function after zzso 

The study population consisted of 9 right-handed patients zzso age, zzso years; range, zzso 2 zzso zzso affected by high-grade zzso growing within or adjacent to the zzso zzso Patients had a diverse onset and evolution of their zzso All patients underwent zzso imaging and zzso on a zzso scanner before and after zzso zzso imaging data were analyzed zzso using zzso 

zzso of zzso in real-time maps and zzso were similar when zzso head motion artifacts did not exceed more than 50% zzso size of the zzso imaging zzso zzso of the hand opposite the affected zzso showed zzso of the zzso in all zzso zzso of the zzso occurred in 5 zzso The zzso was activated in 4 patients, all with excellent zzso motor zzso The zzso and zzso were activated in patients with a good functional zzso When the unaffected hand was tested, this zzso pattern was zzso zzso zzso were comparable with the zzso zzso 

zzso evaluation is feasible and may add zzso information to zzso findings in selected zzso zzso zzso of primary and secondary motor areas may be the correlate for zzso recruitment of additional functional areas and a predictor for better functional zzso
