zzso assessment of zzso function is subject to zzso errors caused by angle sensitivity and a fixed location of the sample zzso We used zzso phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging zzso to evaluate these errors in 10 patients with hypertension and in 10 healthy zzso The single zzso and triple zzso component zzso was measured at early zzso and late zzso inflow along zzso sample lines or zzso particle traces generated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso underestimated zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso the effect on the zzso ratio was larger and more zzso zzso early and late zzso inflows from a single line demonstrated the error caused by their zzso spatial zzso Both errors were minimized by calculating the zzso ratio from zzso E and A values without constraint to a single zzso zzso and spatial offset are important sources of error in zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy may be achieved with the use of zzso E and A zzso from wherever they occur in the left zzso
