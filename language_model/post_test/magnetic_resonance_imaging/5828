To explore zzso zzso particles of iron oxide zzso as a marker for diffuse inflammation in multiple sclerosis zzso zzso white matter zzso using quantitative zzso Disease activity in the zzso of zzso patients partly explains why zzso zzso burden zzso only moderately with zzso zzso have been shown to zzso the cellular component of inflammation in focal zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to explore zzso as a marker for the more diffuse inflammation in zzso zzso using quantitative zzso 

In this prospective zzso study, 16 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and eight zzso zzso zzso zzso and five healthy control zzso subjects were zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were generated before and 24 hours after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso characteristics were compared between both time points using zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed zzso zzso after zzso injection in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This exploratory study suggests that zzso zzso may be a new potential marker for subtle inflammatory activity in zzso zzso Further studies should focus on relating diffuse inflammation to clinical disease activity and treatment zzso
