zzso zzso zzso acid zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been suggested as a useful zzso method for characterizing the zzso zzso of zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso zzso has the potential to provide zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso melanoma zzso were used as experimental tumor zzso zzso was used as a zzso zzso A total of 60 tumors were zzso and zzso images of zzso zzso transfer constant of zzso and zzso zzso distribution volume of zzso were produced by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso The host mice were killed immediately after zzso and the primary tumor and the lungs were zzso and prepared for zzso assessment of the fraction of zzso hypoxic tissue and the presence of lung zzso zzso 

zzso were found in 11 of 26 mice with zzso tumors and 14 of 34 mice with zzso zzso The primary tumors of the zzso mice had a greater fraction of hypoxic tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso a lower median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a lower median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso than the primary tumors of the zzso zzso 

These findings support the clinical attempts to establish zzso as a method for providing zzso for tumor aggressiveness and suggests that primary tumors characterized by low zzso and low zzso values could have a high probability of zzso zzso zzso
