To compare two zzso zzso zzso zzso carotid artery wall imaging techniques at zzso T and zzso zzso and to investigate the feasibility of higher spatial resolution carotid artery wall imaging at zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso band zzso and rapid extended coverage double zzso zzso zzso carotid artery wall imaging was performed on six healthy volunteers at zzso T and zzso T using zzso zzso and spatial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso imaging zzso To investigate whether improved zzso ratio zzso at zzso T could allow for improved spatial resolution, higher spatial resolution imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso was performed at zzso zzso zzso artery wall zzso carotid zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso were zzso 

Signal gain at zzso T relative to zzso T was observed for carotid artery wall zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in all acquisitions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were found to have different levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso values observed to be zzso zzso to a common imaging time, the higher spatial resolution imaging at zzso T and the lower spatial resolution imaging at zzso T provided similar levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso carotid wall imaging at zzso T with zzso and zzso benefits from improved zzso and zzso relative to zzso zzso and allows for higher spatial resolution carotid artery wall zzso
