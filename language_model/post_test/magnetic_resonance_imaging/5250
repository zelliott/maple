Using zzso we evaluated the default mode network zzso and the zzso visual resting state network zzso in 14 patients with Parkinson's disease zzso zzso as compared with 18 patients with Parkinson's disease zzso without zzso and 18 healthy controls zzso 

We analyzed the zzso functional connectivity of both resting state data and zzso during a visual complex zzso zzso 

Using the zzso zzso zzso as a seed for the zzso analysis, we observed significant decreases of connectivity in the right inferior frontal zzso in zzso as compared to zzso and zzso Using the zzso nucleus as a seed for the zzso analysis, we found significant decreases of connectivity in the left and right inferior zzso zzso in zzso as compared to zzso 

zzso in functional connectivity patterns between zzso and zzso were observed in areas known to be engaged in zzso zzso of attention and in visual zzso
