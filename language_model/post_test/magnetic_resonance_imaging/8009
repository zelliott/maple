zzso zzso disease zzso patients generally present with heartburn as the main zzso zzso might help to relieve heartburn by acting on the zzso zzso We aimed to assess the effect of zzso on behavioral and brain responses to painful zzso acid infusion in zzso patients evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In a zzso zzso crossover design, 20 zzso patients off zzso pump zzso zzso zzso zzso were assigned to zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso order, with a zzso zzso period in between both treatment zzso Changes in zzso brain response on zzso and heartburn perception were assessed and at the end of each zzso 

zzso significantly reduced the zzso brain response in prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso vs zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso vs zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso vs zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso vs zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso vs zzso zzso to zzso zzso in comparison with zzso However, there was no significant difference between zzso and zzso in clinical outcomes and side zzso 

zzso decreased the brain response to zzso acid infusion more markedly than zzso but without clinical zzso
