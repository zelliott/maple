The anterior zzso zzso zzso is a key region for the zzso and treatment of zzso However, it remains unclear whether and how the zzso of the zzso is altered in subjects with mood zzso 

A post zzso zzso study of the zzso zzso zzso area zzso in seven subjects with mood disorder and nine comparison zzso We measured zzso and zzso density, and zzso size and zzso We also zzso the zzso marker, zzso zzso zzso protein zzso using zzso 

zzso and layer thickness did not differ between zzso zzso with mood disorder had a decreased density of zzso cells across all zzso and a reduction in zzso in white zzso The density of zzso zzso was decreased selectively in layer zzso and their size was increased in layers V and zzso The shape of zzso zzso also differed in mood disorder, in layers Va and zzso 

These data provide further evidence for zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in mood zzso They represent a possible cellular basis for the zzso functioning and connectivity of the zzso apparent from zzso and other zzso
