Using zzso the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow zzso changes during visual stimulation and the prevailing baseline global and regional flow levels was evaluated in 22 zzso The absolute increase in zzso was not correlated with baseline zzso values zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso however, the percentage change in zzso showed a negative correlation zzso zzso Both absolute and relative changes in zzso were independent of baseline global zzso zzso These results indicate that caution should be exercised when comparing relative flow changes during focal brain zzso especially in functional zzso studies dealing with altered baseline flow zzso
