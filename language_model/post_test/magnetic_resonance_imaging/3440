zzso of cortical zzso between healthy controls zzso zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso have been repeatedly investigated using zzso zzso zzso However, the results obtained using mainly zzso remain difficult to interpret as they can be explained by various zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the differences of cortical zzso between zzso zzso and zzso patients using a new zzso method based on reconstruction and identification of cortical zzso Thirty zzso 33 zzso and 30 zzso patients were randomly selected from the zzso zzso For each subject, cortical zzso were reconstructed and automatically identified using zzso zzso zzso and fold opening of nine large zzso were compared between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Fold opening of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on both sides strongly differed between the 3 groups, with gradual increase from HC to zzso of about 1 zzso and from zzso to zzso of about 2 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso left zzso p zzso zzso right zzso p zzso zzso left zzso p zzso zzso zzso were left unchanged after adjustment for age, zzso and level of zzso These variables were also strongly linked to zzso scores, independent of age, zzso and level of zzso In the present study, we found important regional differences of cortical zzso with gradual deterioration from HC to zzso to zzso The most important differences were found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further studies are needed to understand the involved underlying zzso
