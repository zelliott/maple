Relative to individuals who do not have addictive disorders, drug abusers exhibit greater devaluation of rewards as a function of their delay zzso zzso The present study sought to extend this finding to methamphetamine zzso abusers and to help understand its neural zzso MA abusers zzso zzso zzso and control subjects who did not use illicit drugs zzso zzso 17) participated in tests of delay zzso with hypothetical money zzso We then used a derived estimate of each zzso delay zzso to generate a functional magnetic resonance imaging probe task consisting of three conditions: zzso zzso requiring selections between zzso zzso and zzso zzso alternatives that were similarly valued given the zzso delay zzso zzso zzso in which alternatives differed dramatically in value; and a zzso zzso control zzso MA abusers exhibited more delay zzso than control subjects zzso zzso zzso Across groups, the zzso choice zzso no zzso contrast revealed significant effects in the zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso cortex, and areas surrounding the zzso zzso zzso With group comparisons limited to these zzso the zzso choice zzso easy zzso contrast indicated significant group differences in zzso activity within the left zzso and right zzso zzso similar zzso effects were present in the other clusters zzso Whereas control subjects showed less recruitment associated with easy than with hard choices, MA abusers generally did zzso zzso analysis did not indicate a relationship between this anomaly in zzso recruitment and greater degree of delay zzso exhibited by MA zzso zzso while apparent inefficiency of cortical processing related to decision-making in MA abusers may contribute to the neural basis of enhanced delay zzso by this population, other factors remain to be zzso
