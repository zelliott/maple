In this work, a zzso model of magnetic resonance zzso flow imaging is zzso The first model component provides fluid dynamics maps by applying the lattice zzso zzso The second one uses the flow maps and couples MR imaging zzso modeling with a new zzso transport zzso based on the zzso coordinate zzso zzso modeling is based on the discrete time solution of the Bloch equation by zzso local zzso transformations zzso zzso and zzso Model is validated by comparison of experimental and simulated MR images in two three-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso zzso with steady flow under comparable zzso zzso zzso presented in literature, were also zzso In both cases, a good agreement is zzso zzso analysis shows in detail the model zzso zzso time is noticeably lower to prior zzso These results demonstrate that the discrete time solution of Bloch equation coupled with the new zzso transport zzso naturally incorporates flow influence in zzso zzso As a result, in the proposed model, no additional mechanism (unlike in prior zzso is needed to consider flow artifacts, which implies its easy zzso In combination with its low zzso complexity and efficient zzso the model could have a potential application in study of flow disturbances (in zzso in various conditions and in different zzso
