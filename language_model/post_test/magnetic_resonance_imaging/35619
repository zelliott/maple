Brain zzso represents a key marker of disease progression in cerebrovascular zzso The zzso changes of zzso zzso occurring during the course of small vessel diseases of the brain zzso remain poorly zzso The objective of this study was to assess the changes affecting depth and surface area of cortical zzso and their clinical and zzso zzso in a cohort of patients with cerebral zzso dominant zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso a genetic zzso Data were obtained from a series of 69 zzso zzso zzso methods were used to determine depth and surface area of four cortical zzso The ratio of brain to zzso cavity volumes zzso zzso zzso volume of zzso zzso zzso and of white matter zzso number of cerebral zzso and mean apparent diffusion zzso were also zzso Association between depth and surface area of the cortical zzso and zzso clinical status and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and surface area of cortical zzso obtained in 54 patients were strongly correlated with both cognitive score and disability zzso zzso was related to the extent of zzso zzso surface area was related only to zzso In additional zzso the depth of the zzso zzso was independently associated with the volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso and that of the superior frontal zzso with the mean apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso important zzso changes of cortical zzso occur in association with clinical zzso extension of zzso tissue damage and progression of global cerebral zzso These results suggest that the examination of cortical zzso may be of high clinical relevance in zzso
