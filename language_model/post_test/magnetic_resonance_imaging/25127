To evaluate the current status of care and cost of acute zzso stroke in Japan, we performed a zzso analysis at a zzso emergency hospital with a 24-hour zzso team and care zzso 

During the 12-month period of October 2000 to September 2001, we collected data on 179 patients zzso hospitalized with acute zzso stroke within 7 days of zzso We examined demographic data, zzso care, length of hospital stay, outcome at zzso and hospital zzso The medical cost data were collected from official hospital medical cost charts, which calculated direct medical costs for beds, staff, zzso medications, and zzso 

The mean age was 70 years, and zzso were zzso Hospital arrival was within 3 hours of onset in zzso of the zzso A history of stroke was present in zzso The mean initial National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso score was zzso points zzso 6 zzso Using the Trial of zzso zzso in Acute Stroke Treatment zzso zzso were zzso zzso were zzso zzso were zzso and zzso were of unknown zzso All patients underwent zzso studies during zzso zzso and zzso underwent CT and zzso with MR zzso zzso zzso medications were given in zzso none of whom received zzso A newly licensed zzso agent, zzso was given in zzso More than half of the patients zzso were initially admitted to the neurological intensive care zzso Overall, zzso received zzso zzso Mean length of stay was 33 zzso zzso mortality rate was zzso On the modified Rankin zzso zzso zzso were independent zzso 0 to 2) and zzso were dependent zzso 3 to 5) at zzso Two thirds of the patients zzso went directly back zzso The mean hospital cost per patient was zzso zzso of which zzso was attributable to the costs for beds and staff, zzso for medications, zzso for rehabilitation, zzso for imaging studies, zzso for laboratory zzso and zzso for other zzso
