Modern cognitive zzso often thinks at the interface between anatomy and function, zzso that one structure is important for a task while another is zzso A flexible and sensitive way to test such hypotheses is to evaluate the pattern of activity in the specific structures using zzso zzso zzso These methods consider the zzso patterns across groups of zzso and so are consistent with current theories of how information is zzso in the brain: that the pattern of activity in brain areas is more important than the activity of single zzso or zzso zzso techniques can identify many types of zzso patterns, and patterns unique to each subject or shared across zzso This paper is an introduction to applying zzso methods to functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data, particularly for region of interest zzso based zzso The first section describes the main steps required for such analyses while the second illustrates these steps using a simple zzso
