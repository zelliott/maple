We investigated the usefulness of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso The examination was performed by comparing the images during the zzso phase of zzso with zzso iron oxide magnetic resonance zzso 

The subjects were 48 zzso zzso which were zzso diagnosed zzso zzso zzso moderately differentiated zzso zzso poorly differentiated zzso zzso We performed zzso and zzso on all zzso In the zzso phase of zzso the differences in the contrast agent zzso between the zzso and zzso areas were zzso as the zzso phase ratio and zzso In the zzso it was zzso as the zzso zzso We then compared these results with the zzso differentiation of zzso 

The zzso phase ratio decreased as the zzso became less differentiated zzso zzso zzso The zzso index also decreased as zzso became less differentiated zzso A positive correlation was found between the zzso phase ratio and the zzso index zzso In the zzso phase of zzso all of the moderately and poorly differentiated zzso appeared zzso and were detected as a zzso zzso whereas the majority (9 of 13 cases, zzso of the zzso zzso had an zzso zzso The zzso phase images of zzso and zzso matched perfectly zzso in all of the moderately and poorly differentiated zzso 

zzso is useful for zzso zzso grading of zzso It is a zzso that could potentially replace zzso
