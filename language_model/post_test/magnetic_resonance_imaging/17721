It is widely reported that patients with schizophrenia exhibit decreased zzso zzso However, no study has evaluated relationships between the zzso anatomical and functional asymmetry in language zzso The present study aimed to determine whether decreased zzso zzso zzso could be related to asymmetry of the zzso matter volume in patients with zzso This investigation was the first to use a functional index of zzso to analyze the global functional network specifically involved in the language zzso 

zzso right-handed patients with schizophrenia and 54 right-handed control subjects underwent a session of a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with a speech listening zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a new zzso to assess zzso in functional zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of asymmetry in the volume of zzso matter zzso were zzso from the functional language zzso 

Patients with schizophrenia exhibited significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso There was a positive correlation between zzso and zzso in healthy subjects, while no such correlation was seen in patients with zzso 

This study reports for the first time a significant relationship between the anatomical and functional asymmetry in healthy subjects, but not in patients with zzso While decreased zzso functional zzso for language was observed in patients with schizophrenia compared to the control group, this functional zzso was not related to asymmetry in the volume of zzso zzso
