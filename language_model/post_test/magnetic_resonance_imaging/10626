There are only anecdotal and small reports on brain systematic magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies in mountain zzso The purpose of our work is to study the risk of brain zzso in mountain zzso by means of conventional zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

We recruited 35 zzso zzso (12 were professional and 23 were zzso in 4 zzso without supplementary zzso 12 professionals and one amateur went up to zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso to Mont zzso zzso zzso and 7 zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean age was zzso years zzso zzso All of them underwent general medical examination, standard blood tests, and zzso of the brain after the zzso zzso also was carried out in a control group of 20 healthy zzso zzso MR zzso was carried out in 14 amateur subjects after the zzso and in 10 healthy zzso As outcome measures, we evaluated changes in the zzso value, presence of cerebral zzso on zzso as well as zzso and zzso of zzso spaces, and differences in the zzso ratios obtained from brain MRS in comparison with zzso 

Only 1 in 13 of the zzso zzso had a normal zzso the amateur showed frontal zzso zzso and the remainder had cortical zzso and enlargement of zzso spaces but no zzso Among the remaining zzso 13 showed symptoms of high-altitude illness, 5 had zzso irreversible zzso and 10 had innumerable widened zzso zzso zzso we did not see any zzso in the control zzso We found no significant differences in the zzso ratios between zzso and zzso 

We conclude that there is enough evidence of brain damage after high altitude zzso the amateur zzso seem to be at higher risk of suffering brain damage than professional zzso
