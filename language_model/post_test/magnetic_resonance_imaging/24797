Iron zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques for assessing iron loading in liver and heart have greatly improved survival of zzso patients suffering iron zzso zzso However, the correlation between liver iron concentration and zzso zzso is zzso Using an objective metric of time zzso scientists have demonstrated a lag in the loading and unloading of cardiac iron with respect to that of the zzso In the present study, we further tested this hypothesis with different zzso zzso We analyzed the effect of three zzso treatment approaches on liver and cardiac iron content in 24 highly zzso patients who underwent 3 or more zzso under each zzso zzso Of the 84 zzso considered, 32 were performed on zzso zzso - 8 zzso 24 on zzso zzso - 7 zzso and 28 on combined therapy zzso - 9 zzso In patients treated with zzso changes in cardiac iron significantly lagged changes in liver iron but the opposite pattern was observed in patients treated with zzso zzso while combined therapy showed a pattern zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that the zzso of changes of cardiac and liver iron is zzso so that zzso therapy can be tailored to balance iron elimination from the liver and the zzso
