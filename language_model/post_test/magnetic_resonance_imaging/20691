Healthy adults carrying the short zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso gene linked zzso zzso show increased zzso zzso during visual processing of emotionally negative stimuli compared to healthy adults zzso for the long zzso zzso To determine whether abnormal brain responses during negative emotion appear early in life in S zzso carriers, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to measure brain activity during a transient state of sadness in children carrying the S zzso zzso zzso or zzso for the L zzso zzso zzso zzso dependent zzso signal changes were measured while subjects viewed blocks of neutral film excerpts and sad film zzso During the sad condition zzso to the neutral zzso there was significantly greater zzso in the S group compared to the L group in brain regions known to be involved in normal sadness and major zzso Given that the zzso zzso has been associated with mood disorders, it is plausible that the abnormal pattern of regional brain activity detected here, in children carrying the S zzso increases zzso to emotional zzso and depressive zzso
