Although zzso has been administered to adults by intramuscular injection for zzso zzso and zzso this route in children has not been zzso to our zzso Our hypothesis was that intramuscular zzso can be used to achieve sedation for zzso and CT of zzso 

The quality assurance data on all children who zzso received intramuscular zzso between August 1, 2007, and September 30, 2009, were zzso A single or repeated doses of zzso zzso intramuscular zzso had been administered to achieve a minimum zzso sedation score of zzso Patient zzso medical diagnosis, vital signs, adverse events, and outcome measures were zzso 

zzso children received consecutive intramuscular zzso injections and successfully completed imaging zzso The zzso group received a total mean of zzso zzso zzso and the CT group received a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no statistically significant relation between the total dose of zzso received, mean time to achieve sedation zzso zzso or time to meet discharge criteria after arrival in the recovery unit zzso zzso Nine patients zzso experienced zzso defined as a decrease in blood pressure to less than zzso of the zzso awake normal zzso The dosage of zzso was not a predictor of zzso None of the patients had zzso hypertension, or oxygen zzso 

The intramuscular route is an alternative approach to zzso delivery for pediatric zzso zzso studies are warranted to evaluate the zzso safety, and zzso outcome associated with the intramuscular use of zzso in the care of zzso
