A study to test the ability of an additional zzso zzso scan to decrease zzso zzso in the identification of zzso segments in magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso zzso 

To investigate whether zzso zzso segments can be identified correctly from zzso magnetic resonance zzso scans, the degree of zzso zzso and the value of an additional zzso zzso zzso 

In magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso spine, it may be difficult to identify transitional zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso zzso scans of 141 consecutive patients referred for magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso spine were reviewed independently by two zzso with the aim of locating the zzso zzso An additional zzso zzso zzso scan also was performed in each zzso The final study group consisted of 129 zzso The zzso vertebra was identified by counting zzso from C2 using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the 54 most recently studied patients, cod liver oil capsule surface markers were placed near the zzso junction to zzso any marker shift between the two zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso segments could be identified consistently by counting zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso scans alone, the zzso zzso segments could be identified correctly in only zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso scans produced similar results zzso The accuracy fell to zzso when using a combination of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a zzso zzso zzso in assessment of these zzso zzso transitional zzso were identified in 17 patients zzso including 8 zzso zzso and 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shift between zzso and zzso zzso scans was zzso averaging only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The addition of a zzso zzso scan in magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso spine is highly zzso
