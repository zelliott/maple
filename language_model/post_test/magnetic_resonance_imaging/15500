To compare 2 zzso training strategies, repetitive tracking movements versus repetitive simple movements, to promote brain reorganization and recovery of hand zzso 

Twenty subjects with chronic stroke and 10 degrees of voluntary finger extension were randomly assigned to receive zzso zzso trials over 2 weeks of either computerized tracking training zzso zzso with the affected finger and wrist involving zzso processing to achieve accuracy or movement training zzso zzso with no attention to zzso Following movement training, the move group crossed over to receive an additional 2 weeks of tracking zzso zzso changes were measured with the Box and Block test, zzso Taylor test, and finger range of motion, along with a zzso zzso paradigm during zzso 

The track group showed significant improvement in all 4 behavioral tests; the move group improved in the Box and Block and zzso Taylor zzso The improvement for the track group in the Box and Block and zzso Taylor tests did not surpass that for the move zzso A consistent group pattern of brain reorganization was not zzso The move group, after crossing over, did not show further significant zzso 

zzso may be effective in improving performance in subjects with chronic zzso Tracking training with reinforcement to enhance learning, however, did not produce a clear advantage over the same amount of practice of random zzso Two weeks of training may be insufficient to demonstrate a behavioral advantage and associated brain zzso
