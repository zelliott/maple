zzso resonance zzso imaging is used widely for assessment of patients with cognitive zzso but the pathological zzso are zzso especially when multiple zzso are zzso 

This report includes 93 subjects from a zzso followed cohort recruited for the study of Alzheimer's disease zzso and zzso cerebrovascular disease zzso MR images were analyzed to zzso cortical gray matter volume, zzso volume, white matter zzso and zzso zzso examination zzso zzso zzso pathology, zzso pathology zzso as zzso to zzso a zzso for Alzheimer's Disease scores and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso classified as 12 healthy control subjects, 46 zzso 14 zzso 9 mixed zzso and 12 cognitively impaired patients without significant zzso zzso zzso models tested associations between magnetic resonance and pathological findings across the entire zzso 

zzso zzso of cortical gray matter volume were zzso zzso vascular pathology, and zzso zzso volume was related to zzso pathology and zzso zzso and the effects of zzso sclerosis were greater for subjects with low levels of zzso zzso White matter zzso were related to age and to white matter zzso Number of zzso zzso was related to zzso vascular zzso 

In this clinical setting, the presence of zzso and white matter changes provide a good signal for vascular zzso The zzso basis of MR defined cerebral cortical and zzso zzso in aging and zzso is complex, with several pathological processes zzso on similar brain structures that mediate cognitive zzso
