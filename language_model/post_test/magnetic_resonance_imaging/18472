This study was intended to correlate the appearance of the cavernous segment of the carotid artery on MR images with the presence of significant zzso or zzso of the cervical carotid artery as seen on zzso in 37 patients with cerebrovascular disorders who had brain zzso and zzso Three patients demonstrated an zzso signal within the carotid zzso cavernous segment, zzso with complete carotid zzso as seen zzso Ten patients had variable signal intensity and/or zzso narrowing in the carotid zzso seven of these findings correlated with zzso evidence of carotid zzso while carotid branch zzso was seen zzso in the other zzso The demonstration of normal signal void within a zzso cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery in the remaining 24 patients correlated with an absence of significant zzso within the cervical segment in 21 zzso In the remaining three, significant disease of the internal carotid artery was zzso zzso or zzso zzso within the zzso carotid artery can indicate complete zzso or slow zzso The presence of normal flow void in the zzso segment does not exclude significant zzso of the cervical segment of the carotid zzso
