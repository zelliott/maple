We investigated zzso MR signal changes in the peripheral lung and zzso pulmonary vessels during the entire cardiac cycle in order to evaluate the characteristics of the zzso zzso method in the zzso In eight healthy volunteers free of lung diseases, changes in the MR signal during one zzso were investigated with the multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso echo zzso zzso The signal zzso course curve in the lung showed that zzso signals decreased zzso to zzso at zzso and zzso to zzso at zzso measured against the maximum signals at late zzso This signal decrease in the peripheral lung was correlated to that in the zzso pulmonary vessels during an entire cardiac cycle zzso to zzso The best zzso of the lung was obtained at late zzso when the zzso flow in the lung was expected to be zzso Compared with the late zzso zzso images, the late zzso zzso zzso images improved the zzso ratio in the lung as well as the zzso ratio of the peripheral lung to surrounding zzso Although the zzso signal zzso in the lung was completely unavoidable and its amount was unpredictable even at late zzso the zzso zzso zzso images showed the relative differences in flow zzso during the cardiac cycle between the images at zzso and those at zzso The main characteristic of zzso zzso zzso was the enhancement of visibility of zzso signal changes in the lung due to the zzso in zzso zzso
