The feasibility of in zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso of fine zzso structures of human toes was zzso Five healthy subjects were investigated on an experimental 3 zzso whole body zzso using standard zzso zzso echo zzso A zzso surface zzso was used for signal zzso zzso toes and surface zzso were comfortably fixed using a home built device for positioning and reduction of motion zzso The spatial resolution of 117 zzso 313 zzso 375 zzso allowed detailed zzso of zzso structures like skin zzso vessels and zzso In addition, oval structures with diameters ranging from 500 to 1000 zzso were observed in all subjects, which could represent the sensory nerve endings of zzso zzso Thus, high resolution MR zzso at 3 zzso may provide improved zzso information in zzso zzso of humans in zzso
