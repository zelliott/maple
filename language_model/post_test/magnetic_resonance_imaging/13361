Previous nuclear magnetic resonance zzso imaging studies have indicated that coronary zzso does not produce sufficient changes in standard tissue relaxation times to allow the detection of acute zzso To identify acute zzso zzso zzso the use of the zzso agent zzso zzso combined with calcium zzso zzso was investigated in canine models of acute coronary artery zzso In zzso studies showed that zzso was a more efficient relaxing agent than zzso zzso of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated affinity for normal zzso The distribution of zzso as measured by zzso zzso studies was zzso to zzso blood flow in both normal and zzso zzso Hearts excised from dogs after coronary artery zzso and administration of zzso zzso zzso were zzso ex zzso using a relatively zzso relaxation time zzso zzso reversal technique zzso time zzso 50 zzso and echo time zzso 9 zzso These images showed increased signal intensity in the normally zzso zzso with a mean signal intensity ratio of zzso to normal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso images obtained in nine dogs after coronary artery zzso and administration of the same dose of zzso demonstrated the region of zzso zzso in six dogs with a signal intensity ratio of zzso to normal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso versus zzso When a higher dose of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and in zzso imaging was performed using a relatively zzso relaxation time zzso zzso zzso TE 60 zzso zzso sequence in six dogs, the signal intensity of normal zzso was zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
