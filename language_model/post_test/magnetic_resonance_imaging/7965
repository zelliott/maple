We assessed the accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso zzso in monitoring response to therapy in patients with Crohn's disease zzso using zzso as a reference zzso 

We performed a prospective zzso study of 48 patients with active CD and zzso in at least one zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso and zzso at baseline and 12 weeks after completing treatment with zzso zzso or zzso necrosis factor zzso Disease activity was zzso using Crohn's Disease zzso Index of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Index of zzso zzso The primary analysis was to determine the accuracy of zzso in identification of healing, defined as the disappearance of zzso in zzso zzso Additional analyses established the accuracy of zzso in determining zzso zzso (a zzso score zzso and change in severity based on consideration of all zzso 

zzso determined zzso healing with zzso accuracy and zzso zzso with zzso zzso The mean zzso and zzso scores significantly changed at week 12 in segments with zzso healing, based on zzso examination zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline vs zzso zzso zzso at 12 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline vs zzso zzso zzso at 12 zzso P zzso zzso The zzso score accurately detected changes in zzso severity zzso zzso zzso and standardized effect size: zzso zzso was as reliable as zzso in assessing zzso no significant changes in zzso or zzso scores were observed in segments with persistent ulcers, based on zzso examination zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline vs zzso zzso zzso at 12 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline vs zzso zzso zzso at 12 zzso P zzso zzso The magnitude of change in zzso scores correlated with those in zzso scores zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso evaluates zzso healing with a high level of accuracy when zzso is used as the reference zzso The zzso is a zzso responsive, and reliable index assessing response to therapy in patients with zzso
