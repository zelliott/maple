The objective of this study was to evaluate whether patients with surgically zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso exhibit a distinct pattern of structural network organization involving the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We zzso studied 18 healthy controls and 20 patients with medication zzso unilateral zzso who underwent anterior zzso zzso for treatment of zzso Patients were classified as zzso or not zzso at least 1 year after zzso The zzso brain zzso was calculated through zzso connectivity from zzso zzso imaging from 83 zzso defined regions of interest encompassing the whole zzso The connectivity patterns were analyzed regarding group differences in regional connectivity and network graph zzso 

Compared with controls, patients exhibited a decrease in connectivity involving zzso zzso regions, with a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso insular, and frontal zzso Among patients, those not zzso exhibited a higher connectivity between structures in 1) the zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso 2) the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 3) the zzso zzso pole and zzso zzso Patients not zzso also exhibited lower zzso in the zzso within the zzso zzso zzso with higher zzso integration at the expense of zzso 

zzso is associated with network zzso zzso but not restricted to, the zzso lobe zzso to the onset of zzso Networks involving key components of the zzso zzso lobe and structures traditionally not removed during surgery may be associated with seizure control after surgical treatment of zzso
