zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso of gaseous atoms realized by using a zzso technique is an attractive research tool used in a wide range of areas, such as physics, chemistry, material science and biomedical zzso One of the most promising applications of this technology is the use as a zzso diagnostic tool for pulmonary diseases, where zzso zzso noble zzso zzso and zzso play a role as gaseous zzso zzso contrast agents of magnetic resonance imaging zzso During the last two decades, lung zzso with zzso gases has become widely zzso from mouse to zzso In this review we present a brief overview of recent progress made by our group in the development of zzso zzso MR zzso while focusing on the methodology for probing pulmonary zzso in zzso
