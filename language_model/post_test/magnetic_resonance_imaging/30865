This paper presents a fast method for zzso of activated areas of the brain from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso time series zzso The steps of the work accomplished are as zzso 1) It is shown that the detection performance evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is directly related to the zzso ratio zzso of the composite image generated in the detection zzso 2) zzso and zzso of activated areas are formulated in a zzso space zzso In this zzso a linear transformation zzso combination zzso is shown to be desirable to maximize the zzso of the activated areas subject to the constraint of removing inactive zzso 3) An zzso solution for the problem is zzso 4) Image zzso zzso and expected time series pattern zzso for inactive zzso are used to calculate weighting zzso and identify activated zzso 5) zzso of the activated regions are used to segment different zzso 6) zzso images by the proposed method are compared with those generated by the conventional methods zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso performance and zzso of the images are zzso The proposed approach zzso the conventional methods of zzso zzso In addition, it is zzso and does not require a zzso knowledge of the zzso response to the zzso Since the method is linear and most of the work is done zzso zzso zzso and execution of the method are much faster than the conventional zzso
