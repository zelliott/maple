We developed a new zzso technique to zzso the anatomical structure of the nerve fiber system in zzso and named this technique magnetic resonance zzso zzso and the acquired image an MR zzso MR zzso has two zzso One is to obtain zzso images zzso along axes appropriate for depicting the intended nerve fibers with zzso water diffusion MR zzso The other is to extract the anatomical structure of the nerve fiber system from a series of zzso images by the maximum intensity projection zzso To examine the clinical usefulness of the proposed technique, many contiguous, thin (3 zzso zzso two-dimensional sections of the brain were acquired zzso in normal volunteers and selected patients with zzso on a zzso zzso MR system zzso zzso with an zzso zzso pulse zzso The structure of the nerve fiber system of normal volunteers was almost the same as the zzso The zzso of patients with zzso clearly showed the zzso of nerve fibers and were correlated with clinical zzso MR zzso showed great promise for the study of zzso and zzso
