zzso based on the analysis of zzso and zzso zzso correlations have been used in zzso research, yet zzso and zzso zzso correlations for identical regions of interest have never been compared in the same group of zzso zzso resonance and zzso zzso zzso zzso brain images were acquired in 59 healthy zzso zzso zzso for relative zzso zzso rates during a verbal learning task and for relative gray matter volumes were compiled between the manually traced zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and 39 cortical zzso zzso zzso correlations between the zzso and these zzso zzso followed the known patterns of anatomical connectivity in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso nucleus were widespread with the prefrontal zzso (9 out of 10 zzso areas in the left zzso and zzso lobe (10 out of 11 zzso areas in the left zzso while the zzso correlated only with the zzso and zzso cortical zzso Different correlation patterns were observed for the regional gray matter volumes zzso only the zzso yielded extensive cortical zzso primarily with the zzso zzso anterior cingulate, and zzso areas in the right zzso zzso zzso correlations were much more extensive for the zzso and zzso zzso whereas structural correlations were more extensive for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso methods are sensitive to different aspects of zzso relations in the brain and their comparison in the same group of subjects may render complementary and only partially overlapping connectivity zzso
