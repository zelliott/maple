MR imaging is the optimal imaging technique to study the normal and abnormal conditions of the zzso major muscle and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to use MR imaging to provide an zzso survey of the normal zzso major zzso and its zzso and to compare these findings with surgically proven cases of zzso 

MR imaging shows the normal zzso major zzso unit has low signal intensity on both zzso and zzso zzso Reliable zzso landmarks for zzso and examination of injuries to the muscle and zzso unit include the zzso space, or the origin of the lateral head of the zzso as the superior boundary and the zzso zzso as the inferior boundary of the intact zzso of zzso Failure to zzso a normal zzso within these boundaries should prompt a dedicated search by the zzso for zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso
