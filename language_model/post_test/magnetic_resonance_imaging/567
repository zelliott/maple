To evaluate the potential of zzso of finger and wrist zzso for diagnosing early zzso zzso was evaluated as a zzso tool and in combination with zzso criteria and serum markers such as zzso 

Ninety-nine patients zzso men, 68 zzso median age 46 zzso with unspecified arthritis or suspected zzso and negative X-ray findings were zzso MR images of the hand and wrist of these patients were zzso evaluated for the presence of zzso zzso and zzso The clinical diagnosis zzso zzso or zzso was made by a rheumatologist after clinical follow-up for zzso zzso Clinical and laboratory data were collected from all zzso 

zzso patients had a clinical diagnosis of zzso and 41 were diagnosed as zzso zzso zzso zzso of all MR parameters evaluated identified zzso of the zzso zzso to be the most powerful predictor of early zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso Including zzso criteria in the analysis, positive serum zzso and zzso were the strongest zzso of early zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso When serum zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso were included as additional zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the strongest zzso of early zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso 

zzso zzso diagnosed by zzso of the hand is a strong predictor of early zzso Combining zzso zzso on zzso with positive serum zzso or positive zzso is an even stronger predictor of early zzso
