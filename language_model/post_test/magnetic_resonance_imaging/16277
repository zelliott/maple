Few zzso investigations of pain in elderly adults have focused on the zzso a brain structure involved in zzso processing that is also subject to zzso associated with zzso zzso The goal of this pilot study was to examine zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso of pain in older zzso 

A subset of 20 zzso older adults was drawn from the Einstein Aging zzso a community-based sample from the Bronx, zzso zzso was measured on 3 time zzso 1) acute pain right now zzso zzso 2) pain over the past 4 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) chronic pain over the past 3 months zzso zzso zzso zzso data included volume data zzso to zzso area and zzso to zzso ratios zzso 

Smaller zzso volume was associated with higher ratings on the Short zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a zzso trend was noted for higher ratings of acute pain severity zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Lower levels of zzso zzso were associated with higher acute pain severity zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso with chronic pain had a zzso trend for smaller zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and lower levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Older adults who report more severe acute or chronic pain have smaller zzso volumes and lower levels of zzso zzso a marker of zzso zzso Future studies should consider the role of the zzso and other brain structures in the development and experience of pain in healthy elderly and individuals with zzso zzso
