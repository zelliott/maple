Progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso can occur after an injury to the spinal zzso Traditional treatment of zzso consists of inserting a shunt into the zzso However, some authors have advocated a more zzso approach to this zzso The authors of the present study describe their surgical treatment protocol and outcome in a series of patients with zzso 

Medical records of 34 patients undergoing surgical treatment for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso In patients without focal zzso of the spinal zzso and in whom only a zzso zzso had been revealed on zzso a zzso shunt was zzso in those with both zzso and a zzso zzso cyst, an zzso procedure was performed zzso When a significant reduction zzso in the size of the zzso was shown after the zzso zzso no shunt was zzso When no changes in zzso size were demonstrated on zzso a short zzso shunt was zzso The mean follow-up period was zzso months zzso zzso zzso The zzso between the mechanism of injury and the operation ranged from 5 months to 37 years zzso 11 zzso zzso was the most frequent zzso which was followed by motor deterioration and zzso zzso improvement was noted in zzso of patients who experienced motor function deterioration and in zzso of those who demonstrated worsening zzso In 14 of 18 patients with an associated zzso spinal cord, zzso alone caused significant collapse of the zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated zzso collapse in zzso of patients who had undergone zzso alone and in zzso of those who underwent zzso shunt zzso Treatment failure was observed in zzso of the former group and in zzso of the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can occur with or without the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can readily demonstrate this distinction to aid in surgical decision zzso zzso alone in patients with zzso zzso syndrome and zzso formation can reduce the zzso size and alleviate symptoms and signs of zzso zzso zzso in the majority of these zzso zzso procedures in which zzso is performed to expand the zzso space may be a more zzso effective way of treating zzso zzso with associated zzso
