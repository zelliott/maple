The rationale for this case report is to assess the degree of zzso between the results of several advanced functional, zzso and structural zzso techniques used in patients with zzso focal zzso 

We investigated the zzso evaluation and zzso outcome of a patient with intractable, zzso zzso Because the habitual zzso in this patient could be easily zzso six, advanced, zzso techniques were successively applied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, zzso zzso and MRS zzso 

The findings for the zzso methods investigated, within the left central region, were fairly zzso zzso invasive zzso recordings revealed a zzso zone at the site where most of the zzso had shown abnormal zzso The surgical removal of the zzso zone, as defined by zzso zzso and zzso data, resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso findings revealed mild focal cortical zzso 

Great efforts should be made to combine most of the advanced zzso methods in the zzso assessment of zzso zzso surgery zzso
