A zzso current source zzso design using a zzso metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor zzso that enables independent current control for parallel transmit applications is zzso The design of an zzso integrated with a series tuned zzso loop and its associated control zzso is zzso The current source is operated in a gated class AB zzso zzso for linear operation at high zzso The zzso zzso current zzso driven into the low zzso zzso loop was found to be relatively insensitive to the various loaded loop zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso confirming current mode zzso The suppression of current induced by a neighboring loop was zzso as a function of zzso loop distance, and was measured to be 17 zzso for zzso adjacent zzso zzso manipulation of the zzso field pattern was demonstrated by the independent control of zzso phase and zzso in a zzso zzso volume transmit zzso It was found that a zzso rated zzso power zzso with a minimum load resistance, exhibits current source behavior, which aids in transmit array zzso
