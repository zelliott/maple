To compare conventional zzso zzso reception techniques with parallel zzso array acquisition methods in adrenal tissue zzso and to evaluate the dependence of zzso resolution on image quality in adrenal magnetic resonance magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

Using a zzso T MR zzso conventional and parallel sampled sequences were acquired in 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with adrenal zzso The imaging protocol consisted of: conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso 150 zzso zzso 1; AT 25 zzso and two parallel imaging zzso techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso 150 zzso zzso 1 resulting in an AT of 12 zzso as well as zzso 2 resulting in an AT of 24 zzso with generalized zzso zzso zzso spin echo sequences with 5 zzso slice zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution, and an acceleration factor zzso zzso of breathing motion and zzso artifact and overall image quality were rated on zzso scales and evaluated with student's zzso zzso a differential receiver operating characteristic zzso analysis was zzso 

zzso zzso findings included zzso zzso and zzso zzso of conventional zzso spin echo sequence with one signal average led to an increase in diagnostic power zzso zzso as well as significant improvement in overall image quality zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduction of breathing motion artifact in patients zzso zzso while improving the zzso zzso Parallel imaging with two signal averages resulted in further improvement of image quality over conventional imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same acquisition time as the conventional zzso 

Parallel acceleration of sequences used for adrenal tissue zzso leads to a significant increase in diagnostic quality by significantly reducing breathing motion artifacts without sacrificing contrast indispensable for adrenal zzso zzso
