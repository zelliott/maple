zzso necrosis zzso of two zzso zzso along with the intervening disc is zzso 

AVN of two zzso zzso and the intervening disc is a rare entity and can be confused with zzso and zzso zzso We present the role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnosis of zzso 

AVN of zzso bodies is a known zzso however, involvement of two zzso zzso along with the intervening disc is zzso The imaging features can be confused with an zzso zzso which involves the disc more commonly as compared to zzso zzso destruction of zzso also needs to be ruled out in appropriate clinical zzso 

zzso and lateral zzso of the zzso spine were performed followed by an zzso zzso zzso fine needle aspiration zzso was zzso 

These zzso features were correlated with the clinical and zzso zzso The zzso findings of a zzso zzso with classic fluid intensity zzso zzso like that of zzso fluid on zzso zzso are characteristic of zzso Fine needle aspiration zzso confirmed the diagnosis and excluded an zzso or a zzso zzso 

The zzso findings described in this report are very characteristic of AVN of zzso Clinical and zzso correlation could help in making the diagnosis and avoid unnecessary zzso
