zzso zzso cause considerable difficulty in the quantitative analysis of magnetic resonance zzso zzso Thus, bias field zzso is a necessary step before quantitative analysis of MR data can be zzso This paper presents a zzso level set approach to bias correction and zzso for images with intensity zzso Our method is based on an observation that zzso in a relatively small local region are zzso despite of the zzso of the zzso in the whole image caused by the overall intensity zzso We first define a localized zzso zzso objective function for image zzso in a neighborhood around each zzso The cluster centers in this objective function have a zzso factor that estimates the bias within the zzso The objective function is then integrated over the entire domain to define the data term into the level set zzso Our method is able to capture bias of quite general zzso Moreover, it is robust to zzso and thereby allows fully automated zzso The proposed method has been used for images of various zzso with promising zzso
