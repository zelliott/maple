zzso is an established investigation in the evaluation of zzso with suspected zzso zzso zzso However, its role as a predictor of zzso outcome remains zzso 

To establish zzso simplified MR criteria and evaluate their role in predicting zzso outcome in term zzso with zzso 

Term zzso with suspected zzso had zzso at zzso days of zzso MR scans were interpreted according to new simplified criteria by two zzso blinded to the clinical course and zzso The new simplified criteria allocated grade 1 to cases with no central and less than zzso peripheral change, grade 2 to those with less than zzso central and/or zzso peripheral area change, and grade 3 to those with more than zzso central or peripheral zzso zzso changes were compared with clinical zzso outcome evaluated zzso at 1 year of zzso zzso outcome was based upon the zzso score zzso zzso and cerebral zzso on neurological zzso 

Of 20 subjects, all those showing severe zzso 3) MR changes zzso died or had poor zzso zzso zzso with a normal MR scan or with scans showing only mild zzso 1) MR changes zzso had normal zzso One subject showing moderate zzso 2) changes on zzso had a moderate outcome zzso while another had an zzso pattern of MR changes with a normal outcome zzso 

Assessment of zzso zzso with suspected zzso using the simplified MR criteria is highly zzso of zzso zzso
