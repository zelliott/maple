zzso has been associated with disturbances in brain zzso however the exact nature of these disturbances is not fully zzso zzso zzso correlations between the functional zzso time courses of zzso disparate brain regions obtained during rest has recently emerged as a popular paradigm for zzso brain zzso Previous resting state studies in schizophrenia explored connections related to particular clinical or cognitive symptoms zzso within zzso selected zzso or connections restricted to functional networks obtained from resting state zzso Relatively little has been done to understand global brain connectivity in zzso 

zzso patients with chronic schizophrenia and 18 healthy volunteers underwent a resting state zzso scan on a zzso zzso Whole brain zzso correlations have been estimated using zzso zzso data and free surfer cortical zzso A zzso zzso method was then used to zzso brain connections that distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy zzso 

The zzso procedure achieved a prediction accuracy of zzso in zzso between groups on the basis of their functional zzso Relative to controls, schizophrenia patients exhibited zzso patterns of increased connectivity between zzso and frontal regions, and decreased connectivity between zzso and zzso regions, and between the zzso zzso zzso The decreased zzso connectivity was associated with the severity of patients' positive symptoms, while increased zzso connectivity was associated with patients' negative and general zzso 

Our analysis revealed two zzso patterns of functional connectivity abnormalities in zzso each related to different clinical zzso Such results provide further evidence that abnormalities in brain zzso characteristic of zzso are directly related to the clinical features of the zzso
