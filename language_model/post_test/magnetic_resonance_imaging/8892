In this article, we develop a zzso method, called adjusted zzso zzso zzso likelihood, and apply it to the analysis of zzso zzso The adjusted exponential tilting zzso is shown to have the same zzso zzso properties as that of the original zzso zzso The adjusted zzso likelihood ratio statistic is applied to test linear hypotheses of unknown zzso such as the associations of brain measures zzso cortical and zzso zzso with zzso of interest, such as age, zzso and zzso zzso studies show that the adjusted exponential zzso likelihood ratio statistic performs as well as the zzso when the imaging data are zzso distributed, while it is superior when the imaging data have skewed zzso We demonstrate the application of our new statistical methods to the detection of statistically significant differences in the zzso of the zzso between two schizophrenia groups and healthy zzso
