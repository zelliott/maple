Multiple myeloma zzso is consistently preceded by its zzso states, zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso and/or smoldering multiple myeloma zzso By definition, precursor conditions do not exhibit zzso disease zzso zzso zzso failure, skeletal zzso zzso or a combination of zzso However, new imaging methods are demonstrating that some patients in the zzso or zzso category are exhibiting early signs of zzso Although zzso patients are currently defined as low-risk versus high-risk based on clinical zzso we currently lack the ability to predict the individual patient's risk of progression from zzso to zzso Given that the presence of gross zzso bone zzso is a hallmark of zzso it is reasonable to believe that less severe bone changes defined by more sensitive imaging may be zzso of zzso zzso Indeed, since bone disease is such an essential aspect of zzso imaging techniques directed at the detection of early bone zzso have the potential to become increasingly more useful in the setting of zzso Current guidelines for the zzso assessment of zzso still recommend the traditional skeletal survey, although its limitations are well zzso especially in early zzso of the disease when zzso can significantly underestimate the extent of bone zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso more advanced imaging zzso with higher sensitivities, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are being zzso Also various imaging techniques have been used to provide an assessment of bone involvement and identify zzso zzso This review emphasizes the current state of the art and emerging imaging methods, which may help to better define high-risk versus low-risk zzso Ultimately, improved imaging could allow more tailored clinical management, and, most likely play an important role in the development of future treatment strategies for high-risk precursor zzso
