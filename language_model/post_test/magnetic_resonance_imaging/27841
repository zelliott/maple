Standard zzso of the cervical spine is performed in a different anatomical position to that zzso for traditional contrast zzso Those well zzso in zzso are familiar with the considerable changes in zzso of the zzso and soft zzso of the cervical spine that may occur with changes in the degree of neck zzso and zzso We set out to compare the findings in a select group of patients with zzso who had undergone zzso and zzso in both standard and zzso zzso These findings were correlated with the clinical zzso 

29 patients underwent zzso with CT zzso and zzso in neutral and zzso zzso The imaging was assessed for the degree of zzso zzso and neural zzso zzso zzso using a simple grading scheme suitable for routine clinical zzso The degree of neck extension was assessed using an angular zzso 

For both zzso and zzso scanning with the neck extended significantly increases the severity of zzso zzso compared with the standard zzso position, to a degree similar to that shown during conventional prone zzso The degree of perceived zzso zzso is related to the degree of neck extension zzso zzso of standard zzso findings and the clinical level of zzso is zzso This correlation improves when the neck is zzso 

The most appropriate position for routine zzso of the cervical spine in degenerative disease remains unknown, but in selected patients imaging with the neck extended may provide important additional zzso
