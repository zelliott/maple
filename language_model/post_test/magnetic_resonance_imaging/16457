The impact of zzso disease zzso on the structure of the zzso is uncertain, with evidence of both cortical enlargement and zzso in this structure in early clinical zzso We sought to determine differences in zzso volume between zzso zzso disease and early zzso disease groups compared with controls using detailed manual zzso Thirty controls, 30 subjects with zzso zzso disease, and 30 subjects with early zzso disease were selected from the zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso underwent 3 zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was manually delineated and subdivided into zzso zzso and zzso zzso Group differences in volume and associations with performance on 4 tasks thought to zzso zzso function were zzso with adjustment for appropriate zzso zzso volumes were, on average, zzso zzso smaller in early zzso disease zzso and zzso zzso smaller in zzso zzso disease zzso compared with zzso Smaller volumes in zzso of the zzso were associated with impaired recognition of negative emotions zzso heightened depression zzso and worse visual working memory performance zzso There was no evidence of associations between volume and ability on a zzso zzso This study disputes previous findings of enlargement of the zzso zzso in zzso disease and instead suggests that the zzso zzso structural zzso during early zzso disease with zzso consistent, zzso differences seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may contribute to deficits in mood, emotional processing, and visual working memory in zzso zzso
