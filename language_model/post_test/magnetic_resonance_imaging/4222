Fast spin echo zzso and fast fluid attenuated inversion recovery zzso MR sequences were compared with conventional spin echo zzso in zzso multiple sclerosis zzso zzso zzso For each zzso the total number and volume of zzso zzso were calculated in 38 zzso zzso patients using a zzso zzso detection zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were reported on randomly and at different times by two expert zzso zzso differences, the time needed to zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal intensity zzso ratio and overall zzso were zzso The zzso were classified by site into zzso white matter and zzso A total of zzso zzso with a volume of zzso zzso was calculated on zzso zzso zzso images depicted fewer zzso p zzso zzso and smaller zzso p zzso zzso zzso and the differences were statistically zzso Despite an overall zzso reduction for zzso images zzso and zzso for zzso number and volume, respectively), significantly lower values zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were observed for zzso zzso while significantly higher values were seen for zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A higher zzso matter contrast zzso zzso zzso a significant time saving for zzso burden zzso zzso zzso zzso and very low zzso zzso were found in favor of zzso Our data suggest that, despite the limitations regarding zzso zzso zzso sequences are indicated in zzso studies because of their good identification of zzso zzso almost complete zzso agreement, higher zzso ratio and the limited time needed for zzso zzso
