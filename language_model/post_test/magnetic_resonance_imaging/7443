zzso connectivity refers to zzso activity between zzso zzso brain regions and can be studied by measuring correlation between functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso time zzso These correlations can be caused either by direct communication via active zzso pathways or indirectly via the interaction with other zzso It is not possible to discriminate between these two kinds of functional interaction simply by considering the zzso zzso However, the zzso elements of its zzso the precision zzso can be naturally related to direct communication between brain areas and interpreted in terms of partial zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso model for functional connectivity analysis which allows zzso of a zzso density over precision zzso and, consequently, allows one to zzso the uncertainty about estimated partial zzso In order to make model zzso feasible it is assumed that the zzso structure of the precision zzso is given by an estimate of structural connectivity obtained using diffusion imaging zzso The model was tested on simulated data as well as zzso zzso data and compared with a zzso lasso zzso The presented approach provides a theoretically solid foundation for zzso functional connectivity in the presence of zzso
