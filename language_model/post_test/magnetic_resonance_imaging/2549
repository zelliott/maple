To determine the value of the zzso and zzso zzso technique as compared with the fast zzso and conventional zzso techniques in MR imaging of the zzso 

zzso patients with zzso and zzso brain zzso were examined with zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso zzso Three independent observers evaluated the contrast characteristics of zzso and zzso structures and of zzso zzso image analysis included zzso zzso of zzso structures and zzso 

The contrast of zzso structures was superior in images obtained with conventional and fast zzso techniques as compared with those obtained with the zzso zzso zzso zzso such as tumors and territorial zzso were identified equally with all zzso For zzso of small zzso zzso zzso was slightly inferior to fast and conventional zzso zzso zzso artifacts were considerably reduced with fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso artifacts were significantly reduced, but ringing artifacts were more pronounced with zzso 

Fast zzso remains the standard technique in MR imaging of the zzso However, zzso might be useful in special cases, such as with uncooperative patients whose conventional or fast zzso images show severe motion zzso
