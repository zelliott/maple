Beyond pulmonary vein isolation zzso zzso zzso at the sites of complex zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to improve the long-term success of zzso zzso of persistent zzso zzso zzso However, this approach often requires extensive zzso due to the widespread distribution of zzso within the left zzso An optimal strategy would identify areas of zzso which, when selectively targeted with zzso result in zzso termination with an acceptable long-term freedom from zzso It is possible that the zzso administration of an zzso drug may help accomplish zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso by zzso Use in zzso zzso zzso Study is an international zzso prospective zzso zzso clinical trial assessing the utility of the zzso administration of zzso zzso of intravenous zzso before performing zzso zzso The primary efficacy zzso of this study will be the freedom from zzso at 1 year after a single procedure off zzso zzso Safety zzso will include procedural and zzso zzso time as well as overall procedural complication zzso 

Patients undergoing a first ever zzso zzso procedure for persistent zzso will be zzso zzso with zzso zzso complex zzso heart disease including zzso zzso zzso and ejection fraction zzso will be excluded from the zzso All patients will first undergo zzso Those patients who remain in zzso will then be zzso in a zzso fashion to receive either zzso zzso intravenous zzso or saline zzso followed by a zzso based zzso zzso Two hundred zzso patients will be enrolled in this zzso in each study zzso 

The zzso study will assess the utility of a combined zzso strategy in patients with persistent zzso undergoing a zzso based zzso zzso
