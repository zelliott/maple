zzso motor learning is preserved after stroke, but how the brain compensates for damage to facilitate learning is zzso We used a random effects analysis to determine how stroke alters patterns of brain activity during implicit zzso motor learning as compared to general improvements in motor zzso Nine healthy participants and nine individuals with zzso right focal zzso stroke performed a continuous zzso tracking task during an initial functional magnetic resonance images zzso session, over 5 days of practice, and a retention test during a separate zzso zzso zzso implicit motor learning was differentiated from general improvements in motor control by comparing tracking performance on a novel, repeated tracking sequence during early practice and again at the retention zzso Both groups demonstrated implicit zzso motor learning at the retention test, yet substantial differences were zzso At zzso healthy control participants demonstrated increased blood zzso level dependent zzso response in left zzso zzso zzso zzso BA 6) but decreased zzso response left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso BA 9) during repeated sequence zzso In contrast, at retention individuals with stroke did not show this reduction in zzso during repeated zzso Instead implicit zzso motor learning and general improvements in motor control were associated with increased zzso response in the left middle frontal zzso BA 8, regardless of sequence type after zzso These data emphasize the potential importance of a zzso zzso network for implicit motor learning after zzso This study is the first to highlight the importance of the prefrontal zzso for implicit zzso motor learning after zzso
