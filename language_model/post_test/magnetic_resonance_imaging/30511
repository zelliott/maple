zzso zzso zzso labeled with zzso can be zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso after transplantation into the zzso However, there is still no accurate method of zzso the signal loss caused by the iron contrast agent within transplanted zzso The aim of this study was to test a new method for zzso signal loss during the early zzso zzso 

zzso mouse zzso zzso and zzso were labeled in zzso culture media supplemented with zzso Two hundred zzso zzso were injected directly into the right liver zzso of zzso diabetic zzso 220 zzso recipients zzso zzso zzso 3; zzso zzso zzso zzso Animals were scanned at 3 zzso on a whole body scanner equipped with a zzso zzso insert and using the zzso FIESTA zzso on days 1, 7, and zzso Signal loss was zzso by comparison of liver tissue with and without labeled zzso Signal loss detected on the first scan was rated as zzso and subsequent zzso were zzso as relative zzso 

While the function of the zzso remained stable throughout the study, the zzso failed on days 5 and zzso A decrease in the amount of signal loss was observed in all animals and was comparable after the first week in both zzso However, there was a difference between groups after the second week zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of signal loss is comparable in all animals during the first week and seems to be independent of acute zzso
