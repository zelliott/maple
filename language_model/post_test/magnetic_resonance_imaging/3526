zzso situations, the zzso of events, or increases in task difficulty zzso zzso have repeatedly been shown to be capable of triggering zzso control zzso In the present study we tested whether the zzso of an zzso testing environment zzso zzso zzso might result in such increases of the cognitive control zzso We found that participants were more effective in controlling episodic retrieval of previous zzso zzso zzso 1), in switching to a new task zzso zzso and shielding a current goal from distracting response tendencies zzso 3) if they were exposed to challenging task situations, such as 70 zzso echo zzso imaging noise sampled from an zzso zzso These findings have considerable theoretical implications in questioning the widespread assumption that people are equally devoted to easy and more challenging tasks, and zzso implications in raising the possibility that experiments carried out in zzso scanners or under otherwise challenging conditions systematically overestimate contributions from cognitive control zzso
