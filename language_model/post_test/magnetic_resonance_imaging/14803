zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of recognition memory zzso demonstrate zzso activity in left lateral zzso zzso zzso when contrasting studied zzso items with zzso zzso zzso Recent work demonstrates that there is considerable zzso zzso in zzso One implication of this observation is that zzso or zzso models fall short of characterizing zzso contributions to memory zzso Instead of considering zzso as a single entity, functional accounts must be given for each of the distinct regions that show zzso zzso we zzso there are a minimum of four such regions and very likely zzso Identification of these zzso regions requires careful analysis to map the boundaries and the extent of the regions zzso In addition, characterizing the functional responses as zzso or zzso relative to baseline will be crucial in understanding the underlying cognitive zzso Considering zzso in both memory and zzso zzso will also illuminate the contribution of these regions, because it is certainly unlikely they serve only the domain of memory zzso
