MR images of four young wrestlers were reviewed by two attending zzso and one zzso and zzso clinical data were collected using the electronic medical zzso 

MR images in all cases showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso collection extending beyond the normal boundaries of the zzso zzso No zzso fat or blood products were identified in the zzso zzso pathology proving the absence of zzso tissue was available for one case, and differentiation of the collection from the adjacent zzso was confirmed visually by the surgeon in a second zzso 

Although zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso share many imaging features, making a specific diagnosis in most cases is not necessary, as treatment is often similar for both zzso
