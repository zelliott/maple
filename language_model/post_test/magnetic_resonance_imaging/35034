To assess magnetic resonance zzso zzso for detection of zzso zzso using two different zzso three-dimensional zzso echo zzso and integrated parallel data acquisition zzso at a zzso zzso zzso 

In this prospective study, 34 symptomatic patients underwent dark zzso zzso at a zzso zzso unit before conventional zzso zzso After colon zzso with tap water, 2 high-resolution zzso zzso zzso fast low angle shot zzso zzso factor 2 and zzso zzso zzso examination zzso zzso zzso sequences were acquired without and after zzso injection of zzso Prospective evaluation of zzso was zzso Image quality of the different sequences was assessed zzso and zzso The findings of the same day zzso served as standard of zzso 

zzso identified all zzso zzso zzso (16 of zzso in size and all zzso (4 of 4) zzso Fifty percent of the small zzso zzso zzso (4 of 8) were zzso by zzso zzso quality was excellent in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso using the zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso The zzso sequence showed a zzso increase in zzso ratio (8 zzso zzso standard zzso zzso in zzso without contrast enhancement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso For the zzso zzso zzso ratio doubled in the detected zzso zzso zzso 54 zzso without and zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso Although image quality was ranked lower in the zzso the image quality score of both sequences showed no statistical significant difference zzso zzso zzso 

zzso using zzso and zzso is feasible at zzso zzso The high-resolution zzso was slightly preferred over the zzso because of better image quality, although both used sequences showed no statistical significant zzso
