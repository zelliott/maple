zzso zzso of the zzso zzso typically result in a zzso syndrome in which some patients develop central zzso zzso pain zzso zzso to the zzso tract zzso is assumed to be a prerequisite for zzso zzso At the nuclear level, it remains a matter of debate whether the zzso zzso nucleus zzso or the zzso portion of the zzso zzso nucleus zzso constitutes the decisive zzso zzso The hypothesis of the study was that zzso location in zzso zzso patients differs from that in zzso stroke patients without pain, and the aim was to identify whether this difference comprises the zzso and/or the zzso 

30 patients with chronic zzso stroke and a persistent zzso zzso syndrome were zzso zzso patients zzso were compared with zzso control zzso By zzso of a zzso zzso zzso with zzso weighted MR images, zzso clusters were allocated to the zzso zzso 

zzso was affected in both groups, but zzso zzso clusters comprised the more zzso inferior and lateral parts of the zzso compared with zzso Additional partial involvement of the zzso was seen in only three pain zzso In three other pain patients, zzso involved neither the zzso nor the zzso but mainly affected the anterior zzso 

This study specifies the role of the zzso in zzso zzso and shows that the zzso and inferior parts in particular are critically zzso in pain zzso In this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tract are known to zzso In contrast, the data do not support a pivotal impact of the zzso on zzso zzso
