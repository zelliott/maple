zzso factors associated with favorable or zzso outcomes would provide patients with accurate expectations of the zzso zzso stimulation zzso 

To investigate the zzso significance and optimal measures of zzso size in zzso zzso of the zzso as treated with zzso 

A critical, or zzso zzso size may exist at which clinical outcomes become poor in the treatment of zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso study; Level of evidence, zzso 

In sum, 120 zzso underwent zzso zzso stimulation treatment for zzso zzso of the zzso and were evaluated for zzso zzso Clinical failure was defined as patients' having zzso transplantation or an American zzso Foot and zzso Society zzso zzso zzso score less than zzso Linear zzso analysis and the zzso method were used to identify optimal zzso values of zzso zzso 

Eight zzso zzso required zzso zzso and 22 zzso zzso were considered failures because of zzso scores less than 80, which indicated fair or poor zzso Linear zzso analysis showed a high zzso significance of zzso area and suggested a zzso zzso size of 150 zzso for the optimum identification of poor clinical outcomes zzso zzso zzso Only 10 of 95 zzso zzso with a zzso area zzso zzso showed clinical failure, whereas in patients with an area zzso zzso the clinical failure rate was significantly higher zzso zzso There was no association between outcome and the patient's age, duration of symptoms, zzso associated zzso and location of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso size is an important and easily zzso zzso factor in zzso zzso of the zzso and so may serve as a basis for zzso surgical zzso A zzso point exists regarding the risk of clinical failure at a zzso area of approximately 150 zzso as calculated from magnetic resonance zzso
