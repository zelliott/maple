To establish an experimental setting for monitoring zzso and metabolism in zzso prostate cancer at zzso T using dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso rat prostate cancer cells were injected into the prostate by open zzso Twelve zzso rats (5 of these zzso and 6 healthy controls were followed up using zzso acid zzso dynamic zzso and zzso zzso and the exchange rate constant zzso were calculated zzso zzso From zzso zzso ratios of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso All tumors were examined zzso 

On zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors showed increased zzso zzso and zzso density were correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso showed elevated zzso and an unexpected zzso fraction zzso parts per zzso zzso slowed tumor growth zzso Changes of zzso and metabolism could be detected in all tumors during follow zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso has potential to characterize zzso zzso prostate cancer in rats, which is a promising model similar to human prostate zzso
