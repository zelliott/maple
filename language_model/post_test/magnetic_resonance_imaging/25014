zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was applied to five older zzso with zzso zzso before and after zzso zzso During the experiment, images were acquired in two runs with visual stimulation delivered through the sound and the zzso eyes, zzso The experiment was performed on each of the subjects, before and after their oral administration of zzso zzso zzso three times per day for 7 zzso Our study demonstrated that there was no effect on the spatial extent of the visual cortical zzso during the sound eye stimulation zzso but some improvement during the zzso eye stimulation zzso The volume ratio between the zzso and sound eye stimulation significantly increased after the treatment zzso This finding supports the previous studies of zzso effect on zzso at the visual cortical level, and suggests that zzso can be a useful tool in assessing changes of visual cortical activity after the treatment
