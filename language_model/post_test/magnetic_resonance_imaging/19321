This paper introduces a zzso zzso functional neurosurgery methodology and describes zzso a software system which supports zzso zzso provides four groups of zzso 1) zzso for data reading, zzso zzso and image zzso 2) zzso for multiple zzso reading, zzso global and local registrations, zzso anatomical indexing, and multiple labeling in two and three zzso 3) zzso zzso for three-dimensional zzso display and real-time manipulation of cerebral structures, continuous zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso 3-D presentations, and zzso interaction in four views; and 4) zzso for zzso trajectory planning, zzso simulating the zzso of zzso and simulating therapeutic zzso All operations, excluding zzso and data reading, are real zzso The combined anatomical index of the multiple brain zzso database containing complementary zzso and 3-D zzso has about 1000 structures per hemisphere, and over 400 zzso zzso zzso planning with mutually zzso multiple brain zzso in all three zzso zzso is zzso The approach is validated with 24 zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Its potential benefits include increased accuracy of target definition, reduced time of the surgical procedure by decreasing the number of zzso facilitated planning of more sophisticated zzso lowered cost by reducing the number of zzso used, reduced surgical zzso and the extra degree of confidence given to the zzso
