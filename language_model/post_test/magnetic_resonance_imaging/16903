In this work, we show that zzso responses during pitch perception are best explained by distributed activity in a hierarchy of cortical sources and, crucially, that the effective connectivity between these sources is modulated with pitch zzso Local field zzso were recorded in two subjects from primary auditory zzso and adjacent auditory cortical areas along the axis of zzso zzso zzso while they listened to stimuli of varying pitch zzso Dynamic zzso modeling was used to compare system zzso that might explain the recorded zzso The data show that representation of pitch requires an interaction between zzso and primary auditory zzso along zzso that is consistent with the principle of zzso zzso
