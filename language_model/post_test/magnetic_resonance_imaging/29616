Case reports display similarities between multiple sclerosis and acute intermittent zzso zzso This study examines whether patients with zzso in general demonstrate zzso zzso on brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso and/or abnormalities in plasma and/or zzso fluid zzso when examined outside zzso We looked particularly for the presence of zzso bands zzso of zzso zzso in zzso 

Eight zzso gene carriers without previous episodes of zzso mean age zzso years zzso zzso and 8 zzso gene carriers with previous episodes of zzso mean age zzso years zzso zzso were examined with brain zzso zzso blood samples and zzso zzso 

Two male zzso gene carriers with previous episodes of zzso 58 and 35 years of age, had multiple zzso zzso zzso on zzso weighted zzso zzso Two zzso gene carriers without previous episodes of zzso 1 male and 1 female, had less than 5 such zzso No zzso were seen in the zzso in any patient, but 1 carrier had an increased level of protein in the zzso Seven of 16 subjects zzso had increased levels of zzso zzso suggesting protracted zzso and 3 further subjects had borderline levels zzso 

zzso zzso sequences demonstrated multiple zzso zzso zzso in 4 out of 16 zzso gene carriers zzso No carrier demonstrated zzso of zzso in zzso making it unlikely that zzso zzso play a pivotal role in the zzso of zzso symptoms in zzso Only 1 zzso gene carrier had an increased level of protein in zzso this contrasts with studies during acute attacks of zzso Seven subjects zzso had zzso high levels of zzso in spite of the fact that no patient had a previous diagnosis of diabetes zzso
