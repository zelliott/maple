zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso of cortical development often associated with drug resistant focal onset zzso The link between zzso and zzso have been demonstrated with depth zzso investigations showing that zzso may arise from both zzso In the last years zzso zzso zzso have received a surge in interest due to its capability to track zzso zzso and pathological relevant differences in brain network zzso We performed a zzso zzso and zzso resting state zzso zzso functional connectivity analysis in a zzso zzso patient with a zzso in the right zzso zzso Our finding confirms a spontaneous synchronization between zzso and its surrounding cortex, specifically in the inferior zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also found a significant connectivity with bilateral zzso more intense and widespread on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed its potential as a promising tool for zzso mapping of cortical and zzso brain functional zzso
