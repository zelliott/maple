We report robust zzso techniques for reconstructing the zzso properties of living zzso such as zzso zzso zzso capacity and zzso zzso for the diagnosis, monitoring and planning of zzso zzso Internal temperature zzso can be measured using zzso imaging or magnetic resonance zzso zzso that the reference zzso properties are given in the region of interest as initial conditions, by solving zzso transfer equations as simultaneous zzso partial differential equations having temperature zzso as zzso zzso we can determine zzso property zzso A novel zzso zzso solution is also presented to realize useful, unique, stable reconstructions of the zzso property zzso To verify the feasibility of the zzso solution, simulations and zzso phantom experiments are zzso The reconstruction of zzso by blood flow and zzso zzso by this approach is also zzso
