This study was conducted to determine whether zzso tissue or zzso fluid zzso sampling is valuable for risk zzso in children with zzso zzso brain zzso 

zzso tissue and zzso from the zzso magna zzso was sampled at the time of primary tumor zzso zzso were compared with conventional staging methods zzso zzso and correlated with patient zzso 

zzso patients were enrolled in the zzso zzso zzso was identified in 11 of 80 zzso and zzso was positive in 20 of 77 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found in zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso zzso survival zzso was zzso influenced by either zzso zzso zzso zzso positive versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso positive versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso for patients with primitive zzso tumor who had positive zzso sampling was zzso compared with zzso in patients who had no evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso for patients with primitive zzso tumor who had positive zzso was zzso compared with zzso in patients who had negative zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sampling were zzso with M stage in zzso and zzso of patients, zzso 

zzso evidence of zzso zzso or zzso dissemination in patients with zzso zzso brain tumors occurs at a variable frequency that is dependent on tumor type, zzso with conventional M stage, and may be zzso of zzso
