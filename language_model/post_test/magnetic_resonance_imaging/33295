To investigate the relationship between chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso and cerebral zzso parameters and to disclose any possible involvement in the zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso 

The study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all zzso The diagnosis of zzso was assigned by using specific color zzso zzso zzso zzso blood volume zzso cerebral blood flow zzso and mean transit time were assessed with dynamic zzso contrast zzso magnetic resonance imaging in zzso white matter zzso in 39 patients with zzso Of these, 25 had zzso and 14 did zzso Twenty-six healthy control subjects were also zzso and of these, 14 had zzso and 12 did zzso zzso analysis of zzso testing was used for statistical analysis, with zzso correction for multiple zzso zzso analysis was performed by calculating zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso showed cerebral zzso anomalies, such as decreased zzso and zzso as compared with individuals without zzso without any delay in mean transit zzso No significant interaction between zzso and zzso was found for any zzso zzso Furthermore, no correlations were found between zzso and zzso values in zzso or for severity of disability in patients with zzso The zzso group showed prolonged mean transit time in the zzso zzso as compared with the control group, and positive correlation was found between mean transit time values and disability scales in patients with zzso 

The data support a role of zzso in cerebral zzso changes, such as a decrease of zzso and zzso regardless of the presence of zzso zzso had no effect on zzso function and disability progression in patients with zzso
