zzso resonance imaging of short zzso musculoskeletal zzso such as ligaments, tendon, and cortical bone often requires specialized pulse sequences to detect sufficiently high levels of zzso as well as additional techniques to suppress unwanted long zzso zzso We describe a specialized zzso technique for imaging short zzso zzso based on applying hard zzso zzso zzso zzso to achieve simultaneous short zzso tissue zzso and long zzso tissue signal suppression for three-dimensional zzso echo time zzso A criterion for the pulse duration of the zzso zzso zzso is derived that allows simultaneous water and fat zzso This opens up possibilities for direct imaging of short zzso zzso without the need for additional suppression zzso Bloch simulations and experimental studies on short zzso zzso and zzso were used to test the sequence zzso
