A method is presented that converts dynamic zzso zzso zzso echo zzso image zzso into estimates of zzso without the errors associated with imperfections in the slice profile and zzso zzso magnetic field zzso The method involves zzso zzso performed before and after a series of dynamic zzso zzso These zzso serve to zzso and correct the zzso signal strength equation used to estimate zzso zzso and phantom experiments were performed to test the method for zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging, as well as for imaging performed with zzso and zzso zzso For nearly all test conditions, zzso was estimated accurately zzso zzso over a range of zzso values expected in zzso ( approximately 1200 zzso 300 zzso This method should be useful for zzso dynamic zzso imaging for many different applications including breast MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
