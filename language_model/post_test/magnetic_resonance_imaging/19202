The functional zzso of overt movements and dynamic imagery is of fundamental importance in zzso Here, we investigated the participation of the zzso motor areas in a classic task of dynamic imagery, Shepard and zzso mental rotation task, by zzso zzso functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso The subjects performed the zzso task 16 times, each time with different object zzso zzso images were acquired for each pair zzso and the onset times and zzso of the zzso zzso in each area of interest were compared to the response zzso We found a bilateral involvement of the superior zzso zzso lateral zzso area, and supplementary motor area in all zzso we found, zzso that those areas likely participate in the very act of mental zzso We also found an zzso in the left primary motor cortex, which seemed to be associated with the right-hand button press at the end of the task zzso
