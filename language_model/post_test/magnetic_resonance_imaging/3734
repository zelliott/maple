Previous zzso research indicates that brain zzso in Huntington disease zzso begins many years before movement abnormalities become severe enough to warrant zzso Most clinical trials being planned for individuals in the zzso stage of HD propose to use delay of disease onset as the primary outcome zzso Although formulas have been developed based on age and zzso repeat zzso to predict when HD motor onset will occur, it would be useful to have additional measures that can improve the accuracy of prediction of disease zzso 

The current study examined magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures of zzso and white matter volume in 85 individuals zzso followed from zzso stage through zzso motor onset zzso zzso and 85 individuals individually matched with incident cases on zzso repeat zzso sex, and age, who were not diagnosed with HD during the course of the zzso 

Volumes of zzso and white matter were significantly smaller in individuals who would be diagnosed 1 to 4 years following the initial zzso zzso compared with those who would remain in the zzso zzso zzso volume was the measure that best distinguished between the two zzso 

zzso suggest that zzso zzso measures may be helpful in selecting individuals for future clinical trials in zzso where HD motor onset is the primary outcome zzso In planning for zzso clinical trials in zzso investigators may also want to consider using more objective measures, such as zzso volumes, in addition to onset of zzso movement disorder, as major outcome zzso
