The objectives of this study were to zzso compare zzso rates associated with normal aging and zzso disease zzso using the zzso zzso Shift zzso zzso method and manual tracing of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso calculate power of zzso zzso zzso and zzso volume changes for clinical trials in zzso We zzso whole brain and zzso zzso zzso rates and zzso and zzso zzso rates from zzso zzso data in 20 zzso patients and 22 zzso healthy zzso All methods revealed significant brain zzso in controls and zzso zzso zzso patients had approximately zzso times greater whole brain zzso zzso rates and more than 5 times greater zzso and zzso zzso rates than zzso zzso and zzso zzso rates were higher in both groups than whole brain zzso zzso rates, but lower than zzso zzso zzso zzso Effect size and power calculations suggest that zzso and zzso zzso may be more sensitive than zzso or whole brain zzso for detecting zzso progression and the potential effects of disease zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that combined rates of zzso and zzso zzso were the best explanatory variables for zzso zzso from zzso
