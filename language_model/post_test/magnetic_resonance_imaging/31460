The use of zzso for intervention and real-time imaging has seen many changes since its inception in the late zzso zzso zzso zzso researchers made great strides in building this new specialty, creating devices, zzso and applications to push the field zzso More recently, researchers have gained more access to the systems themselves, and have taken advantage of this situation to create truly interactive zzso zzso zzso such as fully interactive scan adjustments and device tracking can be accomplished in real time due to increased transparency between vendors and zzso Additionally, pulse sequences have undergone an evolution as well, with the constant emergence of novel acquisition schemes to generate image contrast quickly, increase zzso resolution and cover zzso with zzso zzso We will look at both emerging system interface concepts and novel pulse sequences that we believe will continue to push innovation in the field of zzso zzso
