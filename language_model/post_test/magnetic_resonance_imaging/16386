Evidence so far indicates the consistent association between brain structural abnormalities and schizophrenia already present at the early zzso of the zzso This study investigates the specificity of brain structural abnormalities in schizophrenia by using zzso method of zzso analysis in a zzso sample of schizophrenia spectrum patients at their first break of the zzso 225 subjects, zzso 82 schizophrenia patients, 36 zzso disorder patients and 24 patients with zzso zzso psychoses, and 83 healthy individuals underwent a magnetic resonance imaging brain zzso zzso brain zzso variables were zzso cortical zzso lateral zzso total brain zzso white matter and cortical and zzso gray matter zzso The contribution of zzso cognitive and clinical characteristics was zzso Compared with controls, schizophrenia zzso and zzso disorder zzso patients showed an increase in cortical zzso zzso zzso patients had also markedly enlarged lateral zzso volume compared to controls zzso The patients with zzso zzso zzso did not significantly differ in lateral zzso and cortical zzso volumes from zzso Compared with controls, schizophrenia and zzso disorder patients demonstrated a significant decrease in total brain tissue zzso and zzso zzso zzso volume was reduced zzso in schizophrenia patients compared to controls zzso Clinical and cognitive variables were not significantly related with zzso zzso The brain changes found in patients with a first episode of schizophrenia spectrum disorders are robustly associated with the diagnoses of schizophrenia and zzso disorder and are independent of relevant intervening zzso
