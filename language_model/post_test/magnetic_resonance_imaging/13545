zzso zzso and zzso development in zzso zzso columns have been studied by magnetic resonance imaging zzso The columns studied included zzso an zzso zzso column packed with either 50 zzso diameter porous zzso or 99 or zzso zzso diameter zzso polystyrene zzso and zzso a zzso zzso column commercially packed with 10 zzso zzso zzso The packing methods included gravity settling, slurry zzso zzso and dry packing with zzso The magnetic resonance method used averaged apparent fluid zzso over both column zzso and fluid zzso greater than one particle diameter and hence permits assessment of zzso flow zzso The results confirm that now zzso induced by the zzso distributor of the zzso zzso column or the presence of voids at the column entrance relax on a length scale of the column zzso All of the zzso zzso columns examined exhibit near wall channeling within a few particle diameters of the zzso The origins of this behavior are demonstrated by imaging of the zzso dependence of the local zzso for a column packed with zzso zzso zzso zzso packed with the zzso beads exhibit reduced flow in a region extending from ten to zzso particle diameters from the zzso This zzso reduction is consistent with a reduced zzso of zzso in this region as compared to approximately zzso in the bulk of the zzso zzso and zzso columns exhibit enhanced flow in a region located between approximately eight and 20 particle diameters from the zzso This enhancement maybe caused by packing density zzso and/or particle size segregation caused by zzso during the packing zzso No significant zzso on length scales of 20 zzso or greater were observed in the commercially packed column packed with 10 zzso zzso
