The role of iron overload as cause of liver dysfunction has never been studied in detail in patients without zzso zzso infections who receive multiple zzso We therefore investigated the relationship between the extent of zzso injury as reflected by serum levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and several iron status zzso in 39 zzso C zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso iron overload zzso to acquired zzso In 12 patients, we monitored zzso levels and zzso of iron status during iron zzso zzso Before treatment, elevated zzso activity was seen only at liver iron zzso more than 300 zzso During treatment all zzso values were normal if the liver iron concentration returned below 350 zzso At the start of treatment, zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso zzso P zzso were closely related to urinary iron zzso reflecting the size of the zzso or the zzso iron zzso During treatment, a comparable pattern was seen and the urinary iron zzso was also directly related to the liver iron concentration at zzso above approximately 400 zzso All elevated zzso values were associated with a urinary iron zzso more than 15 zzso zzso In conclusion, our data suggest the existence of a critical liver iron concentration range, above which zzso injury is zzso The extent of the injury seems to be determined mainly by the size of the zzso or zzso iron pool, supporting the concept of the zzso iron pool as the compartment directly involved in iron zzso Our findings may be helpful in establishing criteria for safety from complications of zzso iron zzso
