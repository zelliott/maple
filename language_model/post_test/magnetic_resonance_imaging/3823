zzso hypersensitivity zzso is characterized by a short, sharp pain arising from exposed zzso Most published literature reports on peripheral neural aspects of this pain zzso The current investigation focused on differential cerebral activity zzso by stimulation of sensitive and insensitive teeth by means of natural air zzso 

Five graded stimulus strengths were randomly applied by means of a zzso air jet delivery system, each followed by an individual rating of perceived stimulus zzso Brain activity was zzso by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso of sensitive teeth induced significant zzso in the thalamus, zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso middle and zzso insular zzso anterior mid zzso cortex, zzso anterior zzso zzso and frontal regions zzso and zzso zzso responses to zzso and painless perceptions were observed in the anterior zzso and anterior zzso zzso 

For the first time, this zzso study demonstrates the feasibility of investigating cerebral processes related to zzso evoked by natural zzso zzso Our zzso data additionally provide evidence that differential activity in the anterior zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso may represent clinically relevant pain experienced by zzso zzso
