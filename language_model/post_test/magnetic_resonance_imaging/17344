The aim of this paper is to compare diameter of healthy and affected zzso nerve determined by ultrasound with brain zzso in acute zzso zzso in patients with multiple zzso In this prospective study 20 patients with multiple sclerosis and acute zzso zzso were zzso zzso nerve diameter was measured by zzso Brain zzso were detected by magnetic zzso zzso between zzso zzso of the brain in multiple sclerosis and zzso nerve diameter was tested by zzso zzso zzso difference in diameter between healthy and affected zzso nerve in acute zzso zzso was zzso zzso brain changes examined by magnetic resonance revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in corpus zzso There is statistically significant correlation between zzso nerve diameter and number of brain zzso in multiple zzso p zzso zzso zzso of zzso nerve in zzso zzso measured by ultrasound zzso with brain zzso detected by magnetic resonance in multiple zzso
