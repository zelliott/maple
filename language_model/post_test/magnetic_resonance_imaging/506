To propose a novel strategy for more efficiently measuring changes in cartilage thickness in zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging, and to zzso that determining the magnitude of thickness change independent of the zzso location provides improved discrimination between healthy subjects and zzso participants zzso 

A total of 148 women were zzso 90 were zzso zzso grade 0, 30 were zzso grade 2, and 28 were zzso grade zzso zzso resonance images zzso were acquired at baseline and at 24 zzso Changes in zzso cartilage thickness were determined in 5 zzso and 3 zzso zzso and lateral zzso respectively zzso zzso The new strategy provided ordered values of zzso change in each zzso ranked according to the direction and magnitude of zzso 

Using the new ordered values approach, the minimal P value for the differences in zzso change in zzso cartilage thickness of zzso grade 3 and zzso grade 0 participants was zzso zzso zzso with 4 ordered zzso zzso differing significantly between both zzso With the conventional approach, only 1 zzso zzso differed significantly between zzso grade 3 and zzso grade 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater in zzso grade 2 versus zzso grade 0 participants in 1 zzso zzso using the conventional approach zzso zzso zzso and in 2 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso using the ordered values zzso 

The novel ordered values approach is more sensitive in detecting cartilage thinning in zzso grade 3 and cartilage zzso in zzso grade 2 versus zzso grade 0 zzso The new method may be particularly useful in the context of other zzso zzso a group treated with a zzso zzso drug versus one treated with a zzso
