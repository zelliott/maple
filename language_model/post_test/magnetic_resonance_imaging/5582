The purpose of this study was to use dynamic zzso zzso to ascertain the relation between zzso disk zzso and zzso zzso zzso blood zzso 

We recruited 25 patients zzso zzso zzso who underwent dynamic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The peak signal enhancement of each zzso body was calculated from the time signal after curve fitting of a zzso zzso We controlled for other variables that might have affected blood zzso by assessing two zzso bodies in each zzso The 25 patients were divided into three zzso In group 1, one of the zzso bodies zzso or zzso evaluated was between two adjacent normal disks and the other was between two adjacent zzso zzso In group 2, each of the two zzso bodies evaluated was between two normal zzso In group 3 each of the two zzso bodies evaluated was between two zzso zzso 

Without zzso by zzso of other zzso there were no statistically significant differences in original peak enhancement values among groups 1, 2, and 3 zzso zzso zzso After zzso the peak enhancement in group 1 zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than that in group 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or group 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

After zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated well with zzso disk zzso evaluated with dynamic zzso zzso Blood zzso was zzso less in the zzso body zzso between two zzso disks than in zzso zzso between two normal zzso
