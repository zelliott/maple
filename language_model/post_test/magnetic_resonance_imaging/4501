zzso zzso and zzso dynamic enhancement studies were performed in an animal tumor model for the comparison of regional zzso and zzso parameters measured by these two different sizes of contrast zzso The early zzso enhancement arises from the vascular zzso and the averaged signal enhancement derived from the first 3 to first 6 images zzso can be reliably used to assess zzso The signal intensity in the images during the period of zzso zzso zzso injection shows a steady linear zzso The intercept of the linear relationship is another indicator of the zzso and the slope represents the tumor zzso to zzso The zzso enhancement study was analyzed by a zzso zzso model to calculate the regional zzso and zzso The zzso parameters measured from zzso and zzso show an excellent zzso The zzso parameters measured from zzso show good linear correlation with the low zzso groups measured by zzso but show zzso for the high zzso zzso The enhancement mechanisms for both contrast agents are discussed to relate the imaging parameters to the zzso zzso
