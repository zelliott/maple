Although visual attention is known to zzso brain activity in the zzso zzso zzso and visual sensory areas, the unique roles of these areas in the control of zzso resources have remained zzso Here, we report a zzso in the response profiles of these zzso In a zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study, subjects performed a covert zzso task, in which we manipulated zzso zzso by varying the number of tracked zzso While strong effects of zzso of zzso zzso zzso robust linear increases of brain activity with number of balls tracked were seen primarily in the zzso zzso areas, including the zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso Thus, variations in zzso load revealed different response profiles in sensory areas as compared to control zzso Our results suggest a general role for zzso zzso areas in the deployment of visual of zzso zzso
