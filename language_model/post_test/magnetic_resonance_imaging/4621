A new zzso zzso imaging technique is introduced that uses only one dimension of zzso zzso The second dimension is zzso in time, rather than using phase zzso The data is acquired in the form of a closely spaced echo train with each echo produced from a different physical line in the zzso A zzso zzso transform is applied to each echo for image zzso Because only the desired lines are excited, there can be no zzso in the time zzso direction even when the object is much larger than the field of zzso This technique is also very insensitive to motion, as zzso artifacts do not zzso in the time zzso zzso
