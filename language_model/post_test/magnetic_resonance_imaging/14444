The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a volume zzso MR zzso zzso technique with that of zzso digital zzso zzso zzso zzso in the identification of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was examined in 47 patients by zzso and compared with zzso zzso findings in 19 of these patients who had zzso or giant zzso zzso The remaining 28 patients, in whom no aneurysm was found, served as a control zzso zzso was performed with the use of a zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a 15 degree flip zzso The sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the evaluation of the zzso zzso reconstructions zzso zzso only, zzso zzso + inspection of the individual zzso and zzso zzso + individual partitions + zzso zzso Of 21 zzso of which three were missed in two patients, the sensitivity varied from zzso for zzso zzso only to zzso for the zzso zzso + partitions + zzso zzso of the 19 patients, among whom it was assumed that the diagnosis of any one aneurysm in a patient would lead to zzso and detection of additional zzso the sensitivity varied from zzso for the zzso zzso only to zzso for the zzso zzso + partitions + zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso can define the circle of Willis sufficiently to allow detection of zzso zzso as small as zzso zzso zzso holds promise as a truly zzso screening examination of zzso zzso in patients at risk for zzso
