To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso detection zzso for breast zzso zzso zzso recommended for biopsy in a high-risk zzso 

zzso consecutive Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System zzso 3-5 zzso with zzso correlation zzso invasive zzso 13 zzso zzso in zzso zzso and 34 zzso were zzso evaluated using a breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluation was performed separately and in consensus by two zzso specializing in breast imaging, blinded to the zzso zzso of 50, 80, and zzso and delayed enhancement were independently assessed with zzso zzso were rated as zzso or benign according to threshold and delayed enhancement only and in zzso zzso zzso and negative zzso values zzso were determined for zzso assessments versus zzso zzso zzso zzso interpretation without zzso versus zzso assessments were compared using paired zzso diagnostic zzso 

zzso levels for zzso enhancement were: 50% to include all zzso (and all zzso zzso and zzso for all invasive cancer and high-grade zzso Combined use of threshold and enhancement patterns for zzso assessment was best zzso sensitivity, zzso specificity and zzso zzso for all zzso zzso and zzso were better for invasive cancer zzso than for all zzso zzso zzso zzso interpretation was more sensitive than zzso zzso but less specific zzso for cancer zzso 

The breast zzso zzso system used could not improve the zzso accuracy for distinguishing all zzso from benign zzso due to the poor sensitivity for zzso zzso
