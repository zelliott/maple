We aimed to setup a zzso and zzso methodology for evaluation of the cerebrovascular response in mice zzso 12 zzso Therefore we applied a zzso zzso and hyperventilation paradigm combined with zzso spin labeling and monitoring of the expired zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the tidal volume by zzso and the respiratory rate by zzso resulted in zzso zzso from 33 zzso 6 zzso to 64 zzso 16 zzso zzso the respiratory rate by zzso and the tidal volume by zzso decreased zzso to 22 zzso 5 zzso zzso blood flow zzso was 82 zzso 21, zzso zzso 41 and 64 zzso 18 zzso zzso during zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso The correlation of zzso and zzso levels resulted in a cerebrovascular response of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cortex, zzso and thalamus, zzso As zzso levels were correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a cerebrovascular response based on simultaneously recorded zzso and zzso levels could be derived zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso order as zzso A zzso experiment resulted in similar zzso In conclusion, this protocol allows evaluating zzso zzso and cerebrovascular response in mice under zzso conditions by simply changing zzso settings and zzso zzso with zzso and/or simultaneously obtained zzso
