The purpose of the study is to determine the amount of zzso fluid of the zzso nerve in normal adults using magnetic resonance zzso imaging and to investigate whether the zzso fluid is displaced in abduction as assumed by the 30 degree zzso zzso 

The design was a prospective observation zzso 

zzso healthy zzso adults zzso Ten zzso were men and 11 zzso were women with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso nerves were examined in primary and 45 degrees right and left gazes with zzso zzso echo zzso zzso MR imaging in zzso head zzso Four MR images, 4 zzso apart, starting from 4 zzso zzso to the globe were obtained for both nerves simultaneously with an imaging time of 2 minutes and 24 seconds per zzso 

zzso nerve and sheath diameters were zzso 

Mean nerve diameters were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean sheath diameters were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sheath diameters did not change significantly in abduction or zzso 

zzso resonance imaging can be used effectively to determine the amount of zzso fluid of the zzso zzso In normal adults, the amount of zzso nerve zzso fluid is variable and may be zzso The zzso MR findings show that zzso nerve zzso fluid is not displaced significantly with abduction or zzso
