We aimed to determine the diagnostic value of zzso zzso zzso zzso and CT zzso zzso including zzso source images zzso in comparison with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in acute stroke zzso zzso 

zzso CT, zzso zzso stroke zzso including zzso and zzso and MR zzso zzso were performed in patients with symptoms of acute stroke lasting zzso zzso We analyzed zzso zzso volumes on patients' arrival as shown on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared them to the zzso extent as shown on day 5 zzso 

Twenty-two stroke patients underwent CT and zzso scanning within 6 zzso zzso time to peak zzso volumes did not differ from zzso zzso for patients who did not undergo zzso for patients who underwent zzso nor did zzso cerebral blood volume zzso differ from zzso zzso zzso volumes did not differ from zzso volumes zzso zzso volumes measured in zzso maps significantly correlated with zzso volumes on zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Also, zzso zzso volumes significantly correlated with follow-up CT zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso stroke, the combination of zzso and zzso can render important diagnostic information regarding the zzso extent and the zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso do not differ from zzso on zzso and zzso zzso on zzso source images do not differ from zzso on zzso The combination of zzso CT zzso zzso CT zzso and CT zzso zzso can render additional information within zzso minutes and may help in therapeutic decision-making if zzso and zzso are not available or cannot be performed on specific zzso
