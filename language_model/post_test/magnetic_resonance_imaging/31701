In higher functioning individuals with zzso a striking disparity exists between impaired social and emotional abilities and relatively preserved sustained attention and zzso cognitive zzso As these two functional zzso appear to map onto two distinct large-scale brain networks, the zzso Network and the zzso Network, respectively, we examined their zzso defined functional organization in individuals with zzso Using resting functional connectivity zzso zzso we found that, in zzso there was altered functional organization of the network involved in social and emotional processing, but no group difference in the functional organization of the network involved in sustained attention and zzso zzso We suggest that these findings might serve to relate the seemingly disparate strengths and weaknesses of the zzso zzso zzso and cognitive zzso into a zzso zzso zzso These results also highlight the usefulness of resting zzso for studying the brain in zzso and zzso zzso
