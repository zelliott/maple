To evaluate the effectiveness of zzso in preventing recurrence after zzso zzso for Crohn's disease in high-risk zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso study was conducted from June 2009 until June zzso We zzso included high-risk Crohn's disease patients who had undergone an zzso zzso zzso patients were defined as two or more criteria: smokers, penetrating pattern, one or more previous surgical zzso or prior extensive zzso zzso zzso was administered 2 zzso zzso 5 zzso after surgery at a dose of 40 zzso zzso with an initial induction dose of zzso zzso at weeks 0 and zzso zzso data, previous and zzso treatments zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso smoking status at the time of diagnosis and after the index operation and number of previous zzso zzso and reason for zzso were all zzso Biological status was assessed with zzso zzso zzso zzso rate and zzso zzso One year zzso 3 zzso after surgery, an zzso and/or magnetic resonance zzso was zzso zzso recurrence was defined as zzso score zzso zzso zzso recurrence was based on magnetic resonance zzso score zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso smokers at diagnosis and zzso after the index zzso mean age zzso years and mean duration of the disease zzso years were included in the zzso A mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso previous to zzso administration and in zzso was considered extensive zzso zzso had previously received zzso zzso were given zzso to zzso of zzso Four of the 29 zzso developed clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso recurrence and zzso zzso zzso recurrence after zzso All patients with clinical recurrence showed zzso and zzso zzso A high degree of zzso was found between zzso recurrence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso recurrence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso findings was good zzso the zzso zzso score with the 4-point MR score, a score of zzso was classified as zzso zzso as zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso five zzso patients needed zzso dose zzso (40 zzso Mean time to zzso after the introduction of zzso treatment was 8 zzso zzso 5 to 11 zzso In three cases zzso a biological change was needed due to a worsening of the disease after the dose zzso to 40 zzso One patient suffered an adverse zzso 

zzso seems to be effective and safe in preventing zzso recurrence in a selected group of patients who had undergone an zzso zzso for their zzso
