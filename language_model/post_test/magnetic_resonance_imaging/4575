zzso zzso and zzso differ substantially between tumors, but the tumor properties causing zzso in zzso and zzso have not been fully zzso The purpose of the study reported here was to investigate whether differences in zzso and zzso between tumors are mainly a consequence of differences in the fractional volume of the zzso zzso The study was performed using a single human tumor zzso line showing large naturally occurring zzso zzso in the size of the zzso zzso The size of the zzso compartment was calculated from the volume and the density of the tumor zzso Cell volume was measured by an electronic particle zzso Cell density was determined by zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso in zzso both in the absence and presence of zzso Two zzso pulse sequences were used, one with a repetition time zzso of 600 zzso and echo times zzso of 20, 40, 60, and 80 zzso and the other with a zzso of 2,000 zzso and zzso of 20, 40, 60, and 80 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso were performed in a state of zzso between zzso and clearance of zzso zzso and zzso preparations of tumor zzso homogeneous in zzso volume were zzso in zzso The zzso volume differed between tumor zzso from 5 to zzso zzso and zzso measured in the absence of zzso differed between tumor zzso by a factor of approximately zzso and increased with increasing zzso zzso The relative decrease in zzso caused by zzso represented by zzso zzso zzso control, also increased with increasing zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
