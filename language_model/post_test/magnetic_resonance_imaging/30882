When you look into a mirror and move your eyes left to right, you will see that you cannot observe your own eye zzso This demonstrates the phenomenon of zzso zzso during zzso eye movements, visual sensitivity is much zzso Given that humans make more than 100,000 eye movements each day, it is clear why suppression is zzso without it, the motion on the zzso would prevent us from seeing anything at zzso zzso data show that suppression is stimulus zzso it is strongest for the kind of stimuli that zzso activate zzso zzso zzso This has led to the hypothesis that zzso suppression selectively targets the zzso zzso We used zzso to find brain areas with a zzso suppression of the zzso signal that matches the zzso zzso We found such a neural correlate of zzso suppression in the zzso stream zzso zzso and in zzso area zzso These areas receive zzso zzso hence our findings are consistent with the zzso zzso The range of effects in our data and in single cell data, however, argues against a single zzso mechanism that suppresses all cortical zzso Instead, we speculate that zzso suppression relies on multiple mechanisms operating in different cortical zzso
