It remains uncertain if closure of a zzso at zzso changes the neurological condition at birth in an infant born with zzso zzso The authors conducted a study to provide a detailed analysis of the zzso of the spinal zzso with the zzso at the time fetal surgery usually is zzso 

The zzso of a zzso fetus was zzso and data were compared with those obtained in a zzso intact zzso of the same zzso In zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso was used to examine the fetal zzso zzso MR zzso provided images in the three zzso planes with a resolution comparable with zzso optical zzso The authors observed that the fetal zzso of the zzso zzso was tapered and zzso at zzso while the zzso zzso in the normal fetus reaches zzso No zzso defects were zzso The zzso MR images clearly revealed the zzso of the zzso zzso The absence of zzso defects suggests that at least in some cases of zzso zzso the spinal zzso initially is well developed but is damaged later on chemically and zzso This might be an argument in favor of zzso zzso zzso By 20 zzso zzso however, the deformation of the zzso inside the zzso is zzso An zzso of the zzso assessment by means of MR imaging therefore might be considered a valuable contribution to zzso zzso The in zzso zzso MR microscopic findings of this study could be used as references for clinical zzso MR zzso 

The detailed in zzso zzso MR analysis of a zzso fetus with zzso zzso demonstrated that an improvement of the zzso zzso imaging should be pursued to detect those cases without zzso defects and with minimal deformation of the spinal zzso
