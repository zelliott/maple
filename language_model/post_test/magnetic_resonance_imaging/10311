zzso appliances have been a popular treatment option for subjects with zzso sleep zzso However, little information is available on how brain zzso induced by respiratory challenge is modulated by zzso advancement with these zzso We hypothesized that the brain zzso caused by respiratory stress may be alleviated by zzso zzso Respiratory stress was induced in 12 healthy subjects by zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso advancement during zzso zzso loading were assessed zzso by using a visual analog zzso These effects were also evaluated zzso by using blood zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso The score for the visual analog scale significantly decreased with zzso zzso zzso zzso in association with zzso zzso was localized to several specific regions, including the left zzso zzso and the bilateral prefrontal zzso These regions are known to be involved in respiratory zzso Our results suggest that zzso advancement with an oral zzso appears to be useful for reducing respiratory stress, based on both zzso and zzso zzso
