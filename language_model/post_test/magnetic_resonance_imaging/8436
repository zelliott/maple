zzso cancer zzso and cervical zzso cancer zzso are aggressive tumors with a poor zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso often occur in the upper zzso as well as in the neck, and thus upper zzso dissection zzso is crucial to improving the cure zzso However, excessive MD can increase zzso morbidity and zzso making it important to employ the proper technique and appropriate extent of zzso In the present retrospective study we aimed to determine the proper extent of upper MD according to tumor site and zzso The benefit and risk of upper MD are also zzso 

zzso review was completed for patients who underwent upper MD, including 64 patients with zzso 21 patients with zzso and 9 patients with zzso extending to involve the upper zzso esophagus zzso The zzso and distribution of zzso zzso zzso in the upper zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso complications of upper MD, as well as the impact on survival and zzso control, were also zzso 

Upper zzso zzso were detected in zzso of zzso patients, zzso of zzso patients, and zzso of zzso zzso In zzso patients, zzso zzso were usually associated with T4 primary tumors zzso whereas positive zzso in the upper zzso were detected regardless of T stage in both zzso and zzso Only 1 zzso patient with a T4 tumor developed late zzso zzso in the lower zzso The zzso zzso survival and zzso control rates were zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the greater vessels after MD was observed in 5 cases zzso 

The present results indicate excellent zzso control rates following upper MD, while major complications such as zzso breakdown were zzso It is suggested that upper MD may be an essential and adequate procedure for patients with zzso or zzso tumors, and may also be required for cases of zzso with a T4 primary to improve zzso control of the zzso
