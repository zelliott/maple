Using zzso parameters as a zzso in the General Linear Model zzso is becoming an increasingly popular method for zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso used to zzso or to differentiate brain regions involved in the response to a particular task varies across studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reaction zzso Furthermore, the way in which the zzso information is used in the zzso analysis is also zzso For example, the zzso parameters can be used as zzso in the zzso or to modify the duration of the events zzso in the zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso response to a target detection task when including zzso zzso zzso zzso and reaction time parameters in the zzso zzso zzso was recorded from zzso subjects in response to a visual choice reaction time zzso Including zzso zzso as a zzso in the zzso yielded zzso in left central zzso cortex, left zzso zzso left zzso left middle frontal zzso left zzso and left zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and reaction time as an additional zzso yielded no additional zzso in comparison with the conventional zzso zzso However, when zzso zzso or reaction time was used to determine the duration of events at a zzso level, additional zzso was observed in the left zzso zzso left zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso can yield different zzso patterns when used to modify relevant aspects of the zzso
