To investigate the corrective results of zzso zzso with type II split spinal zzso zzso 

By reviewing the medical records and zzso of zzso zzso patients with type II split spinal zzso zzso that underwent corrective surgery, zzso location and zzso curve type, zzso and zzso zzso angles, zzso zzso rotation and translation, and trunk shift were measured and zzso 

A total of 23 zzso zzso patients with type II split spinal zzso zzso were zzso 6 cases were due to failure of zzso 8 cases due to failure of formation, and the remaining 9 cases due to mixed zzso The zzso zzso were located in the zzso spine in 8 patients, zzso spine in 4 patients, zzso and zzso spine in 10 patients, and from cervical to zzso spine in 1 patient The zzso extended an average of zzso zzso Corrective surgeries included anterior correction with zzso in 2 patients, zzso correction with zzso in 11 patients, anterior release and zzso correction with zzso in 6 patients, anterior and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso correction with zzso in 4 zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso angles, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trunk shifts were zzso degrees and zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The average correction rate of zzso zzso angle was zzso The zzso balance was also well zzso The zzso zzso were all left in zzso There was no neurological zzso 

For zzso zzso with type II split spinal zzso zzso positive correction results with no neurological complication may be obtained without zzso of the zzso zzso
