zzso We report two patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Patient 1: a 74-year-old man developed blurred vision in each eye, zzso over a zzso In the first episode, visual acuity in the right eye was reduced to no light perception, and in the second episode, the vision in the left eye fell to zzso Brain and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso revealed abnormal enhancement in the zzso and the zzso zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso were found along the outer rim of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and multiple pulmonary zzso suggested the diagnosis of zzso zzso therapy was initiated 3 months after the first zzso but with no clinical zzso At the 2nd episode, rapid administration of steroid ameliorated visual zzso and zzso zzso zzso Patient zzso a zzso man developed blurred vision in each zzso Visual acuity measured no light perception in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso disclosed enhancement in the zzso and both zzso nerve zzso zzso imaging displayed zzso zzso along the outer rims of zzso zzso zzso examination, zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso supported the diagnosis of zzso zzso and zzso treatment improved visual dysfunction and zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso nerve zzso 

The zzso similarity and the anatomical continuity between the zzso and the zzso zzso suggest that extension of zzso inflammation along such tissue planes accounted for visual loss in these two patients with zzso
