zzso of the zzso magnetic field and the different zzso of the various types of tissue are a serious problem for all imaging methods of spectral separation of fat and zzso In the Dixon method this problem is solved by using the absolute values of the image signals for the zzso In image regions where the fat signal is greater than the water zzso however, this results in an incorrect assignment of the zzso zzso A modified Dixon method was developed to easily carry out the spectral separation completely over the entire image by zzso building up a phase correction zzso after the data zzso The spectral zzso of the fat tissue finds an interesting application in the treatment planning with fast zzso in accounting for the increase in zzso
