Imaging studies have shown disparities in resting metabolism and in functional zzso between cognitively normal individuals at high and low risk for zzso A recent study has shown increased zzso zzso in high-risk subjects during a paired associates recall task, which the authors zzso might overlap zzso typically observed in verbal zzso 

To determine whether zzso zzso is altered in a letter zzso task in cognitively normal individuals at high risk for zzso 

zzso was used to compare cortical zzso between two groups of cognitively normal women differing in their risk for developing zzso A letter zzso task was used, which activates left frontal and zzso zzso The risk groups differed in family history of zzso and zzso zzso status but were matched in age, education, and measures of cognitive zzso Average age of the study participants was 53 zzso 

The regional patterns of brain zzso were similar between groups and similar to patterns observed by other zzso However, the high-risk group showed significantly increased zzso in the left zzso region despite identical letter zzso performance between risk zzso 

zzso normal individuals at high risk for zzso show increased brain zzso in the left zzso region with letter zzso a region adjacent to that observed by others using a recall zzso This convergence of results indicates disruption of functional circuits involving the left zzso lobe in zzso individuals at increased risk for zzso
