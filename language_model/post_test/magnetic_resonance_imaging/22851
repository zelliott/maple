A method is presented for zzso zzso in an extended field of view zzso based on continuous motion of the patient table and an efficient acquisition zzso A zzso MR pulse sequence is applied with lateral zzso zzso zzso direction and slab selection along the direction of zzso zzso for the table motion is achieved by a combination of slab tracking and data alignment in hybrid zzso The method allows fast zzso coverage to be zzso especially when a short sampling zzso is chosen along the direction of table motion, as is desirable for good image zzso The method can be incorporated into different acquisitions schemes, including segmented zzso zzso which allows for contrast variation with the use of zzso zzso zzso images of volunteers were obtained with good quality using zzso zzso zzso zzso As an example of zzso imaging, zzso separated images were acquired using chemical shift selective zzso zzso zzso
