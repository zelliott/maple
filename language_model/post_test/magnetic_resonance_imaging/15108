In the past zzso years, zzso cough zzso zzso was recognized as a new type of addictive zzso However, the exact zzso mechanisms underlying zzso are still zzso The aims of this study are to identify zzso zzso of neural activity during the zzso in zzso individuals and to investigate whether these changes of neural activity can be related to duration of zzso use, the first age of zzso use and impulse control deficits in zzso zzso We also want to observe the impact of gray matter deficits on these functional zzso 

Thirty zzso individuals and 30 control subjects zzso zzso functional zzso was performed by using zzso zzso imaging zzso Regional zzso zzso was calculated by using zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso maps between controls and zzso groups was performed using zzso zzso tests zzso corrected for multiple zzso The zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso was surveyed to assess zzso zzso trait soon after MR zzso zzso clusters revealed by group comparison were extracted and correlated with zzso duration of zzso use, and age of first zzso zzso zzso was diminished in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso and left zzso zzso in zzso zzso There were negative correlations between mean zzso in the bilateral zzso zzso left zzso zzso and duration of zzso use, zzso total scores, and the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso There was a significantly positive correlation between mean zzso in the left zzso zzso and age of first zzso use in zzso zzso zzso these results still remain significant after statistically controlling for the regional gray matter zzso 

zzso abnormalities in zzso individuals revealed in the present study may further improve our understanding about the neural zzso of impulse control dysfunction in zzso zzso
