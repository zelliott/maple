zzso top is a rotating black-and-white pattern that zzso to form concentric rings of different colors zzso zzso colors zzso The underlying mechanism has been explained as resulting from local retinal cell zzso yet the cortical processing of this illusion is largely zzso We used rapid zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural mechanisms of this SC zzso The zzso induced when zzso top rotated at 5 zzso were compared with zzso matched physical color zzso stimuli to reveal differences in both the neural zzso and their dynamic interactions by means of effective zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, all with normal zzso were required to judge whether or not they perceived color in each zzso The zzso patterns for each condition were almost zzso but the effective connectivity from zzso to V2 and V2 to zzso was stronger during SC perception than when viewing zzso matched zzso All subjects perceived SC when the rotation speed of zzso top was greater than or equal to 3 zzso which was coupled with enhanced effective connectivity between zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso from zzso to V2 to zzso plays a significant role in SC perception during the zzso top zzso
