To explore the development and prognosis of the acute zzso paralysis zzso associated with zzso 71 zzso infection through clinical follow-up study for clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso features based on the research progress of zzso and zzso 

Sixteen children with zzso associated with zzso in hospital from May 1, 2011 to August 31, 2011 were investigated and the patients received intensive rehabilitation zzso The 16 cases were divided into two groups (the recovery or the zzso by if the muscle strength recovered to level 4 after intensive zzso The zzso findings of 15 children were analyzed and among them, 6 patients were zzso after one zzso The clinical markers were compared between groups including course of disease, zzso zzso in zzso fluid zzso zzso support, therapy, the worst muscle strength, the initial zzso zzso the muscle zzso and zzso zzso The data were analyzed by zzso test and zzso test with zzso 

All the 16 children were infected with zzso 71 zzso The zzso of 7 children were level 0, 4 children had serious upper limbs zzso The neck muscle in 3 cases and the brain stem motor ruckus in 4 cases were zzso The ankle zzso of zzso paralyzed limbs in 14 cases occurred during zzso Eight children had the better zzso the other 8 children had zzso 0 level muscle strength zzso case zzso 7 cases, zzso the initial zzso zzso (2 cases zzso 8 cases, zzso obvious muscle zzso zzso case zzso 8 cases, zzso were significantly different in the children with the recovery when compared to the zzso zzso The severe upper limbs paralysis had the worse prognosis than the severe lower limbs zzso MR imaging showed signs of spinal nerve root inflammation and the bilateral zzso zzso symmetrical in the zzso portions of the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso horns of cervical spinal zzso Signal enhancement occurred only in the early zzso zzso 

In the evolution of zzso due to zzso infection, the upper motor zzso damage is common, the prognosis is related with the severity of early paralysis and zzso zzso MR imaging is helpful to understand the pathological mechanism of zzso
