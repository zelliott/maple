One hundred painful zzso zzso in 100 patients were studied with zzso zzso MR zzso zzso flip angle or zzso zzso acquisition in steady zzso and either zzso or zzso long zzso TE imaging techniques were used to assess the relative sensitivity and accuracy of these techniques in detecting joint zzso zzso fluid, interpreted to represent joint zzso was observed in 88 of the 100 painful zzso zzso zzso scans were obtained with the mouth closed, partially opened, and fully zzso zzso and zzso images were obtained only with the mouth zzso Long zzso TE zzso images were the most sensitive to fluid detection within the joint zzso zzso images were highly sensitive to zzso fluid, although the thicker scan section and local artifacts associated with these techniques resulted in lower accuracy compared with the zzso long zzso TE zzso Joint fluid was directly observed in many of the 28 zzso operated on from the series, and two of two zzso were successfully zzso zzso zzso and avascular necrosis are best demonstrated and staged with a combination of short zzso TE and long zzso TE weighted images, although a zzso long zzso and long TE pulse sequence is more practical for this zzso We recommend long zzso and long TE zzso zzso zzso images combined with zzso zzso and zzso views whenever inflammatory zzso joint disease is zzso
