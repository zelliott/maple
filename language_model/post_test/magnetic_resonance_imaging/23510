We zzso investigated the efficacy of an external pancreatic duct zzso to prevent pancreatic zzso in the zzso zzso after zzso in which the degree of pancreatic zzso was assessed zzso by using dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Among the 67 consecutive patients who underwent pancreatic head zzso 45 patients were judged to have a normal zzso without zzso based on the zzso assessment of pancreatic zzso based on zzso The patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups with zzso or without zzso use of an external pancreatic duct zzso in performing a zzso 

zzso zzso developed in 8 zzso patients in the zzso group: 3 grade A and 5 grade zzso whereas in the zzso group, 9 zzso patients developed pancreatic zzso 3 grade A and 6 grade zzso There were no significant differences in the zzso or severity of pancreatic zzso between the 2 zzso 

The utility of the external pancreatic duct zzso after zzso was not found in the zzso zzso which were sorted according to the degree of pancreatic zzso using the pancreatic zzso intensity curve analysis from zzso
