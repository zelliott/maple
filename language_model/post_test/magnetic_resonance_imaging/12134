Based on the phase difference method as described by zzso et zzso we developed a zzso zzso which zzso zzso phase zzso With regard to the higher peak zzso and higher acceleration in zzso we reduced the echo time zzso to 5 zzso This is effective in zzso the flow signals even for faster heart zzso Phase shifts are further minimized by reducing the zzso zzso The slice thickness down to 2 zzso also improves zzso zzso A repetition time zzso of 15 zzso provides high zzso resolution for dynamic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence allows blood flow zzso in the great arteries and the calculation of blood flow volume to assess left and right zzso stroke zzso This can also be achieved by calculating the zzso volume from zzso slices of the whole zzso however, it results in excessive measuring zzso Compared with conventional zzso techniques, anatomical analysis is zzso The size of zzso zzso defects zzso can be measured more zzso Small zzso or zzso zzso defects zzso which are not zzso on zzso images, are demonstrated on the zzso images and zzso zzso of the pressure in the right and left zzso can be zzso Pulmonary arteries and veins are clearly differentiated from zzso structures and are traced to zzso zzso Without zzso zzso slices of interesting parts of the cardiovascular system can be obtained and successfully used for secondary zzso zzso
