Recent advances in brain imaging have improved the measure of neural processes related to zzso cognitive and affective functions, yet the relation between brain activity and zzso experience remains poorly zzso In part, it is a challenge to obtain reliable accounts of zzso experience in such zzso Here we addressed this limitation by utilizing experienced zzso who are expert in zzso We tested a novel method to link objective and zzso data, using real-time zzso zzso to provide participants with feedback of their own brain activity during an ongoing zzso We provided real-time feedback during a focused attention task from the zzso zzso cortex, a hub of the default mode network shown to be activated during zzso and zzso during zzso In a first experiment, both zzso and zzso reported significant correspondence between the feedback graph and their zzso experience of focused attention and zzso When instructed to zzso decrease the feedback zzso zzso but not zzso showed significant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We were able to replicate these results in a separate group of zzso using a novel zzso zzso discovery protocol in which participants were not provided with prior knowledge of the expected relationship between their experience and the feedback graph zzso focused attention versus zzso These findings support the feasibility of using zzso to link objective measures of brain activity with reports of ongoing zzso experience in cognitive zzso research, and demonstrate the zzso of expertise in zzso awareness to novel zzso
