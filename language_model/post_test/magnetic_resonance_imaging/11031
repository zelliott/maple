To present the magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of zzso zzso in suspected cases of zzso zzso with true fast imaging with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Five patients underwent zzso with zzso zzso zzso 5) and/or True zzso zzso zzso 4) sequences for suspected zzso zzso zzso review of zzso was performed to define the location and extent of the zzso zzso 

The zzso interface was zzso as three zzso inner low signal intensity layer, middle high signal intensity layer of zzso and outer low signal intensity layer of zzso zzso Three cases were diagnosed with zzso zzso on zzso and focal zzso of the inner layer was zzso 

The finding of focal zzso of the inner layer between the zzso and zzso by zzso with True zzso and zzso sequences was the diagnostic finding for zzso zzso
