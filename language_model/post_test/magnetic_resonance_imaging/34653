Using magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging zzso we recently demonstrated the presence of zzso fluctuations zzso zzso zzso in MR signal intensity from the resting human brain that have a high degree of zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso within and across associated regions of the zzso zzso These fluctuations in MR signal intensity are believed to arise from fluctuations in zzso blood flow and zzso A substantial overlap between the zzso map generated by bilateral finger tapping and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso obtained during rest was zzso In the work reported here, we investigated whether respiratory zzso which is known to suspend spontaneous zzso in regional cerebral blood flow, influences these zzso zzso The magnitude of zzso fluctuations was zzso diminished during zzso resulting in a substantial decrease of the zzso correlation both within and across zzso zzso of the zzso zzso After the breathing mixture was returned to ambient air, the magnitude and spatial extent of the zzso correlation of zzso fluctuations returned to zzso zzso of this study support the hypothesis that zzso zzso fluctuations observed by MR in the human zzso and spontaneous flow zzso observed in early studies by zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the rat are identical and are secondary to fluctuations in zzso zzso
