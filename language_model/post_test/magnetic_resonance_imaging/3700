zzso in zzso oxygen zzso a technique that allows measurement of regional brain tissue oxygen zzso has been previously shown to bear relationship to the zzso signal measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso was applied to the study of reward processing in the rat nucleus zzso to validate the technique with a zzso process known to cause robust signals in human zzso zzso After acquisition of a zzso pressing task a robust increase in zzso tissue levels was observed in the nucleus zzso specifically following a correct lever press to the rewarded zzso This zzso signal was modulated by cue reversal but not lever zzso by differences in reward zzso and by the motivational state of the animal consistent with previous reports of the role of the nucleus zzso in both the anticipation and representation of reward zzso Moreover, this zzso by reward value was related more to the expected incentive value rather than the hedonic value of zzso also consistent with previous reports of zzso coding of zzso of zzso Altogether, these results show striking similarities to those obtained in human zzso studies suggesting the use of oxygen zzso as a valid surrogate for zzso in animals performing cognitive tasks, and a powerful approach to bridge between different techniques of measurement of brain zzso
