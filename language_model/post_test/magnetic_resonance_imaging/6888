In the present study, we used zzso to investigate whether zzso zzso processes of zzso and zzso triggered movements zzso Twenty subjects were examined with 1000 zzso images in two consecutive zzso During the first session subjects performed zzso zzso of the right index zzso For the second session subjects were instructed to perform the movements in response to visual zzso Number and timing of movements were matched between zzso For statistical zzso on zzso level, random effects analyses were zzso zzso enhanced activity during zzso compared to zzso triggered movements was found within the left zzso the left zzso and zzso cortex, the right zzso the left anterior zzso zzso and the left inferior zzso zzso The significantly increased activity during zzso in comparison to zzso triggered movements might represent differential demands of the two conditions on the zzso motor net during movement preparation, reflecting zzso of precise knowledge when to move in zzso zzso Our results emphasize a possible role of the primary motor zzso for movement preparation as observed in zzso studies, but do not support a specific involvement of the zzso prefrontal zzso as suggested by former block design zzso
