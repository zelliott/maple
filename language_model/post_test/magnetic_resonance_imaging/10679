We describe two sisters with a zzso zzso of zzso disease who presented at age 50 and 19 months with zzso delay but without zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso both patients had zzso head control, gross motor development, and muscle zzso There were very mild deficits in fine motor skills, zzso and zzso Both sisters had a history of zzso but otherwise vision was zzso The older child showed evidence of mild cognitive and social zzso whereas language and behavior were normal for age in the zzso Both patients were found to be compound zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso Like all other known zzso zzso this previously unknown zzso zzso appears to have low absolute zzso zzso Nevertheless, it is associated in these patients with an extremely benign zzso that is highly zzso of zzso zzso zzso and clinical data were evaluated using a generalized linear mixed model generated from 25 other subjects with zzso zzso There were statistically significant differences in brain chemistry and clinical evaluations, supporting a distinct zzso of zzso zzso Future studies of zzso zzso structure and gene regulation in these subjects could lead to a better understanding of zzso zzso and improvements in zzso gene zzso
