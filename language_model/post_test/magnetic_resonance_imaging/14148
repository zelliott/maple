The development of zzso imaging equipment and reporter zzso has improved our ability to study animal models of disease, such as transgenic and knockout zzso These technologies can now be used to continuously monitor in zzso zzso development, the effects of zzso on individual populations of cells, or even specific zzso If these techniques prove effective in mice, they might be translated into the clinic in the future, where they could be used to zzso detect and monitor treatment of human zzso
