A method is presented for rapid simultaneous zzso of the zzso zzso relaxation, the zzso zzso relaxation, the zzso density zzso and the zzso of the local radio frequency zzso zzso All four parameters are measured in one single scan by means of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is based on a previously reported method, which was substantially improved for routine clinical zzso The improvements comprise of the use of a zzso zzso technique, a background phase zzso and a spin system simulation to compensate for the zzso zzso pulse profile zzso The aim of the zzso was to achieve the optimal result for the zzso of magnetic resonance parameters within a clinically acceptable zzso One benchmark was high-resolution coverage of the brain within 5 zzso In this scan time the measured zzso standard zzso zzso in a group of volunteers was zzso to zzso depending on the tissue zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso As an example, the method was applied to a patient with multiple sclerosis in whom the diseased tissue could clearly be distinguished from healthy reference zzso zzso it was shown that, using the approach of synthetic zzso both accurate conventional contrast images as well as zzso maps can be generated based on the same zzso
