zzso fluid leaks from defects in the anterior zzso zzso present a difficult management zzso Particularly when the defects are large, conventional techniques may not be sufficient to close zzso We describe a new technique for treating such zzso leaks using a composite zzso zzso from the zzso zzso 

We treated five patients with the composite zzso zzso All patients were women aged zzso zzso Two patients had an zzso one had an zzso and one had zzso one leak was zzso 

The zzso leak was successfully closed in all five zzso No patients have experienced zzso the longest follow-up has been 39 zzso The donor site on the zzso healed without complication in all zzso 

The composite zzso is useful for repairing large defects or after zzso or zzso The advantage of skeletal support to counter the pressure exerted by zzso seems zzso
