zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to monitor the response of patients undergoing zzso chemotherapy for breast cancer with the aim of undergoing zzso surgery zzso Patients were zzso recruited to undergo zzso as well as conventional methods of clinical examination, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and response was assessed by each of these zzso zzso patients with primary breast cancer were zzso zzso resonance imaging correlation with zzso size zzso was superior to zzso zzso and to zzso where zzso size was not measurable following chemotherapy in zzso of zzso zzso resonance imaging had zzso sensitivity zzso zzso and 50% specificity zzso zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for the detection of residual invasive zzso zzso resonance imaging displayed zzso sensitivity zzso zzso and zzso specificity zzso zzso to detect pathological zzso in the zzso zzso per cent of recruited patients were identified as potentially suitable candidates for zzso following chemotherapy and of those choosing to accept zzso breast conservation was achieved in zzso or zzso of all zzso Of those who proceeded to zzso zzso required a zzso mastectomy because of positive zzso however, no residual zzso was found on zzso examination of mastectomy zzso zzso resonance imaging appears to be superior to conventional methods for assessing pathological response and the low rate of zzso for positive margins indicates a valuable role in aiding the decision to undergo zzso or zzso
