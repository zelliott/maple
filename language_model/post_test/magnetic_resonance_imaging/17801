To evaluate the accuracy of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to detect deep zzso invasion in patients with zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed 66 cases of women with zzso cancer, who underwent zzso zzso assessment and surgical staging between January 2006 and October zzso The zzso findings were then compared with the pathology zzso The diagnostic zzso sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso of zzso in detecting deep zzso invasion were zzso 

The sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso results of zzso for the detection of deep zzso invasion were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, with a zzso of zzso In the zzso group, the values were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso women, they improved to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The sensitivity zzso was better than the specificity zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso value was markedly higher in the zzso women than the zzso women zzso zzso zzso 

In patients with zzso cancer, a zzso zzso contributes to accurate staging, allowing planning for the scale of surgery and zzso zzso In our study, the zzso identification of zzso invasion provided the opportunity for small-scale surgery in the zzso women with early zzso zzso However, for the zzso patients, the standard surgical procedure is indicated even if the degree of zzso invasion is zzso
