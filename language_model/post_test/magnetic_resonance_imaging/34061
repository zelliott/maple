It is now accepted that zzso zzso impair episodic zzso However, the precise functional role of the zzso in episodic memory remains zzso Recent functional imaging data zzso the zzso in processing novelty, a finding supported by human in zzso recordings and zzso potential zzso Here we measure zzso responses to novelty, using functional zzso zzso during an zzso paradigm generated from an artificial grammar zzso During learning, two distinct types of novelty were periodically zzso zzso novelty, pertaining to the physical characteristics of stimuli (in this case visual zzso and zzso novelty, reflecting semantic characteristics of stimuli (in this case grammatical status within a rule zzso We demonstrate a left anterior zzso response to both types of novelty and adaptation of these responses with stimulus zzso By contrast to these novelty effects, we also show bilateral zzso zzso responses with increasing zzso zzso These results suggest a functional zzso within the zzso with respect to the relative familiarity of study zzso zzso responses in anterior zzso index generic novelty, whereas zzso zzso responses index familiarity to stimuli that have behavioral relevance zzso only zzso zzso These findings add to recent evidence for functional segregation within the human zzso during zzso
