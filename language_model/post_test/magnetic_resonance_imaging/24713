At zzso strengths zzso zzso of the radio frequency zzso field and zzso power deposition become increasingly zzso Parallel zzso zzso use of segmented transmission zzso with independently driven zzso the ability to combat both of these zzso There are a variety of existing designs for zzso zzso ranging from systems with two channels to systems with eight or zzso In this work, we have investigated the impact of the number of independent channels on the achievable results for both zzso improvement and power reduction in zzso 

A zzso Philips zzso zzso system fitted with an zzso zzso body zzso was driven so as to emulate zzso with 1, 2 4 and 8 independent zzso zzso zzso was used in two different zzso in order to assess improvements in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso improvements were observed when increasing from 1 to 2, 2 to 4, and 4 to 8 channel zzso zzso in zzso power requirements and local zzso were predicted for increasing numbers of zzso 

zzso the number of zzso transmit channels adds extra degrees of freedom which can be used to benefit zzso improvement or power reduction for body imaging at zzso
