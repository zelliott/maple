Because of the impact warm zzso time may have on zzso function, various surgical techniques have been proposed to minimize or eliminate warm zzso The purpose of this study is to evaluate our initial zzso functional outcomes of zzso zzso partial zzso zzso while assessing the safety profile of this unconventional surgical zzso 

We performed a retrospective review of our zzso zzso experience between August 2007 and January zzso All patients with baseline and zzso serum zzso zzso were zzso Patient zzso operative information, zzso zzso and zzso functional outcomes were evaluated for this zzso 

zzso patients with a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso zzso had a median follow-up of 100 days zzso zzso zzso In all cases, warm zzso time was 0 zzso Mean operative time was 143 minutes zzso and median estimated blood loss was zzso zzso zzso No zzso complications were encountered, and all surgical margins were zzso Our zzso complication rate was zzso At the most recent zzso the mean estimated zzso zzso rate zzso was zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso preoperatively zzso zzso the mean zzso decline of zzso zzso was not zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with minimal morbidity and minimal decline in zzso function on short-term zzso Further studies and continued monitoring of zzso function are needed to determine if zzso zzso provides any advantage in zzso function preservation relative to the traditional zzso with vascular zzso
