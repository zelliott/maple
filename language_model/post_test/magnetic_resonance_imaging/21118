The association between common zzso markers of multiple sclerosis zzso and clinical disability is weak, a phenomenon known as the zzso zzso Here, we investigated to which degree it is possible to predict individual disease profiles from conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso using zzso analysis zzso Specifically, we conducted zzso zzso correlation analyses to investigate the zzso information contained in conventional zzso data of 40 zzso patients for the following clinical zzso disease zzso motor disability zzso Peg zzso Timed zzso Walk zzso cognitive dysfunction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the expanded disability status scale zzso It turned out that the information in the spatial patterning of zzso data predicted the clinical scores with correlations of up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso information for disease duration was identified in the zzso and zzso zzso Areas in the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso for motor zzso zzso dysfunction could best be predicted using data from the angular zzso and superior zzso zzso For zzso the inferior frontal zzso was zzso zzso In conclusion, conventional zzso is highly zzso of clinical disability in zzso when zzso zzso are used for zzso Thus, the so-called zzso paradox is not apparent when using suitable analysis zzso
