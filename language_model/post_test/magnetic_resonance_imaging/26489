To compare the performance of three pulse sequences commonly used at magnetic resonance zzso zzso in the diagnosis of zzso 

MR zzso was performed in 57 patients who were suspected of having zzso and referred for zzso retrograde zzso zzso three-dimensional fast zzso zzso zzso zzso rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were zzso Two zzso independently interpreted the MR zzso zzso diagnostic performance parameters included sensitivity, zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso curves, and zzso agreement zzso zzso zzso retrograde zzso was the standard of zzso 

Eight patients were excluded because of incomplete MR examinations zzso zzso 4) or failure in the zzso of the zzso duct at retrograde zzso zzso zzso zzso In 49 patients, the three MR zzso sequences were completed zzso In 24 zzso of these patients, retrograde zzso demonstrated zzso zzso and specificity of MR zzso exceeded zzso and the area under the zzso curve was greater than zzso for both zzso and for the three zzso zzso agreement for presence of zzso duct stones was at least zzso zzso zzso for the three zzso 

The three MR zzso sequences had similarly high sensitivities and zzso for the detection of zzso
