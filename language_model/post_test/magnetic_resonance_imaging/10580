To test the hypothesis that the technical success rates, complication rates, and procedural times for magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso zzso zzso for treatment of zzso artery zzso are zzso 

The study was animal care and use committee zzso After surgically inducing bilateral zzso artery zzso in 11 zzso the authors performed baseline digital zzso zzso They transferred each animal to a zzso MR imaging unit and randomly decided which artery would be treated with zzso zzso With MR imaging guidance, zzso devices were tracked by using active and passive zzso zzso depiction was achieved by using zzso MR zzso zzso vessels were zzso by using zzso balloon zzso zzso was then performed in the zzso artery by using conventional zzso zzso With the intention to treat, the authors compared the technical success zzso zzso zzso zzso rates, complication rates, and procedural times for each guidance zzso They compared technical successes and complications by using the zzso test and procedural times by using a paired zzso test, with P zzso zzso indicating a significant zzso 

The authors successfully zzso nine zzso of 11 zzso arteries with MR guidance and all 11 arteries zzso with conventional zzso zzso The difference was not significant zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in three zzso arteries with MR guidance and in one zzso artery with zzso guidance, with no significant differences zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso procedural time was 46 minutes longer than the zzso zzso procedural time; this difference was significant zzso zzso zzso 

In a small cohort of zzso the authors did not observe a significant difference between MR zzso and conventional zzso zzso artery zzso in terms of success and complication zzso However, no evidence of similarity between the techniques should be zzso zzso times differed zzso
