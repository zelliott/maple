In the cardiovascular system, zzso and functionality are closely zzso The observation that zzso zzso appear with different zzso in the various sites and prefer zzso suggested that vascular architecture might be an important zzso zzso zzso geometry deals with the evaluation of the zzso element from a theoretical point of a view, pointing out the angles and diameters which can make the zzso system zzso more zzso The key element of the system is the zzso depending on whether zzso are considered as a single entity or as a whole, either zzso or zzso geometry is zzso The zzso of the zzso directly affects blood flow patterns, influencing both blood flow zzso and wall zzso zzso Experimental studies evidenced that high blood flow zzso and low wall zzso stress have, respectively, a preventive or favorable role in zzso zzso By observing these altered flow sites, the areas which are most likely to develop zzso damage have been detected in the various zzso the areas zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Based on their experience, the authors discuss the contribution that the different imaging techniques can give to the study of vascular zzso
