zzso and coronary arteries can occasionally be affected in patients with systemic zzso zzso however, such involvement has not been systematically assessed using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso resonance zzso and zzso zzso were applied for the assessment of coronary arteries (the left anterior descending zzso left zzso zzso and right coronary artery zzso and zzso respectively, in 39 patients with zzso who were zzso for cardiac disease (16 with microscopic zzso zzso 11 with zzso zzso zzso 9 with zzso syndrome zzso and 3 with zzso zzso zzso Data were compared with zzso zzso patients with zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso or systemic lupus zzso zzso zzso zzso and with healthy control individuals with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso and zzso (but not with zzso were found to display significantly increased zzso diameters of coronary arteries compared with healthy controls (for zzso and zzso P zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and P zzso zzso for zzso and with both zzso groups (for only zzso P zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and P zzso zzso for zzso zzso coronary zzso were detected in patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas coronary zzso were evident in patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso necrosis (by assessment of late zzso zzso was identified only in patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso assessment of patients with systemic zzso revealed coronary zzso disease in the majority of patients with zzso and zzso as well as in several patients with zzso zzso necrosis can be detected in zzso and zzso
