University hospital and zzso zzso 

Twenty-five patients with primary zzso cell zzso of the external auditory canal and middle zzso

zzso survival zzso 

The zzso estimated survival for zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The zzso estimated survival for zzso and T4 zzso was zzso and zzso zzso The zzso estimated survival improved up to zzso for T4 tumors with operation and zzso for those without operation after 47 zzso The zzso surgical margin is significantly related to patient survival in zzso and T4 zzso zzso analysis predicted that zzso chronic zzso media and positive zzso zzso were significantly associated with poorer zzso 

The zzso surgical margin was important to zzso When T4 zzso did not involve the zzso zzso carotid canal, zzso or any zzso zzso the surgical intervention improved the estimated survival rate to a level as good as zzso zzso
