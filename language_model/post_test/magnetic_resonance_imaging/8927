Recent advances in zzso resonance imaging zzso now allow zzso assessment of mechanical properties of zzso bone zzso in zzso by zzso zzso zzso The first aim of this work was to address the implications of limited resolution and zzso ratio on elastic properties of zzso derived under conditions of in zzso imaging via simulation at various resolutions and noise levels on the basis of models derived from zzso images at 21 zzso zzso zzso size from zzso of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso from three zzso zzso The second aim was to compare how elastic zzso derived from actual MR images at zzso zzso at 50 zzso zzso zzso size compare with those from high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso from simulated in zzso zzso images were highly correlated with those obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso and the data were relatively immune to zzso zzso of similar strength were obtained between estimated zzso from zzso and acquired zzso MR zzso zzso errors zzso in significant zzso of the slopes from unity are caused by higher apparent zzso fraction of the MR images but can potentially be corrected with appropriate zzso zzso
