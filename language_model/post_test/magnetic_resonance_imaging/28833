To determine the frequency of several zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging features observed in bone zzso zzso zzso of the zzso head and to determine their value for differentiation of irreversible from transient zzso 

The authors reviewed MR images of 72 zzso head zzso in 42 men and 25 women zzso age, 48 zzso with zzso zzso findings and bone zzso zzso seen at MR imaging zzso and zzso images in all patients and contrast zzso zzso images in 39 zzso zzso MR images showed 57 zzso to be transient and 15 to be zzso The presence and size of subtle zzso features observed on initial MR images were compared for both types of zzso 

Lack of any additional zzso change on zzso or zzso zzso images had zzso positive zzso value for transient zzso For irreversible zzso presence of a zzso area of low signal intensity at least 4 zzso thick or zzso zzso long had positive zzso values of zzso and zzso respectively, on zzso images and zzso and zzso respectively, on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso assessment of zzso changes enables confident differentiation between early irreversible zzso and transient bone zzso zzso zzso
