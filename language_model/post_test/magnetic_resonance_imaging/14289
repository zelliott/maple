zzso agents are being used with increasing frequency to produce zzso of acute zzso zzso in zzso This study was designed to assess the potential of a magnetic resonance zzso contrast agent, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso between zzso and irreversible zzso injury during zzso zzso was produced in rats by zzso of the left coronary artery for either 15 minutes zzso zzso 10) or 2 hours zzso zzso 10), followed in both cases by 30 minutes of zzso Signal intensity zzso was measured before and after zzso 15 minutes for 1 zzso the administration of zzso Prior to intravenous injection of the contrast agent, no significant difference in zzso was observed between normal and zzso or zzso injured zzso zzso produced greater enhancement of zzso of the zzso injured region compared with normal zzso There was no differential enhancement of the zzso injured region compared with normal zzso Thus, zzso is useful in discriminating zzso from irreversible injury in zzso zzso
