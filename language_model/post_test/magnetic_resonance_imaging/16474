zzso zzso or zzso of zzso and zzso cortical brain regions are routinely observed in human functional zzso studies that compare periods of zzso cognitive performance with passive states, such as zzso It is now widely held that such zzso zzso index a highly organized zzso zzso zzso a large-scale brain system whose discovery has had broad implications in the study of human brain function and zzso In this work, we show that common zzso zzso from rest also occur outside of the zzso as a function of increased task zzso Fifty healthy adult subjects performed two distinct functional magnetic resonance imaging tasks that were designed to reliably map zzso from a resting zzso As primary findings, increases in task demand consistently modulated the regional anatomy of zzso zzso At high levels of task demand, robust zzso was observed in zzso regions, most notably, the zzso insular zzso zzso of this region was directly implicated in a zzso analysis of experienced task zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso from rest are not limited to the zzso and extend to brain regions typically associated with zzso sensory and zzso zzso
