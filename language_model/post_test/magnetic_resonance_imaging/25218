Continuous monitoring of zzso pressure zzso still plays a key role in the management of patients at risk from zzso zzso Numerous zzso devices are zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and the magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of the recently developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso monitoring zzso 

In a prospective zzso study, a total of 98 patients with severe head injury, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso underwent zzso monitoring of zzso using the zzso A control group zzso 50 patients underwent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zero drift of the zzso was determined before and after the zzso recording zzso Technical and medical complications were zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso probe was investigated by evaluating artifacts caused by the probe, probe function and temperature changes during zzso and probe movement caused by the magnetic zzso 

The mean zero drift was zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso No significant correlation was identified between the extent of zero drift following the removal of the zzso and the length of zzso zzso zzso zzso related to the probe occurred in 1 out of 50 zzso patients with a zzso probe and in 1 out of 98 zzso with a zzso zzso of the probe due to zzso or zzso of the cable or glass fiber occurred in 4 of the 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso and in 5 of the 98 zzso zzso zzso On zzso MR images, the zzso zzso probe induced only small artifacts with very good discrimination of the surrounding zzso On zzso MR images, there was a good imaging quality but zzso local disturbances in signal zzso There was no temperature change in the zzso probe and in the surrounding brain tissue during MR zzso 

The zzso zzso measuring system is a safe and reliable tool for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system is safe when performed zzso
