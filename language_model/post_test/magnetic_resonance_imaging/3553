zzso simulations on detailed realistic head models are necessary to gain a better understanding of the response to zzso magnetic stimulation zzso zzso head models with simplified zzso and constant zzso material properties are often used, whereas some biological zzso have zzso characteristics which vary naturally with zzso Moreover, most zzso methods do not take the tissue zzso into zzso zzso we calculate the electromagnetic zzso due to zzso in a head model with realistic geometry and where realistic zzso zzso tissue properties are zzso based on zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso This paper studies the impact of tissue zzso zzso and frequency zzso using the zzso independent zzso zzso The results show that zzso yields differences up to zzso and zzso of the maximum induced currents and electric field, zzso zzso the zzso values leads to a decrease of about zzso and zzso of the maximum currents and field, zzso zzso the zzso effects of biological zzso results in a difference of zzso of the maximum zzso The cerebral zzso show limited sensitivity of the induced electric field to changes in zzso and zzso whereas the field varies approximately zzso with zzso These findings illustrate the importance of including each of the above parameters in the model and confirm the need for accuracy in the applied zzso method, which can be used in zzso zzso
