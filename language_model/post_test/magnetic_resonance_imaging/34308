The authors performed a prospective study to determine whether cervical zzso without simultaneous fusion results in spinal zzso 

Because of clinical and zzso signs of zzso zzso 15 patients with zzso arthritis (including one with zzso disease) and severe involvement of the cervical spine underwent zzso zzso without fusion performed on one or more zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated dislocation but no signs of instability at the level of zzso zzso Clinical and zzso zzso were performed twice at a median of 15 months zzso zzso and 43 months zzso zzso zzso One patient developed severe vertical zzso 28 months after undergoing a zzso zzso which led to sudden zzso She required zzso in which zzso fusion was zzso No signs of additional instability at the operated levels were found in the remaining 14 zzso In three patients increased but stable dislocation was zzso The results of clinical examination were favorable in most patients, with improvement of neurological symptoms and less zzso 

The authors conclude that zzso zzso in which the facet zzso are preserved can be performed in the zzso zzso cervical spine in selected patients in whom signs of zzso zzso are demonstrated, but in whom zzso and zzso signs of instability are zzso Performing a simultaneous fusion procedure does not always appear zzso zzso zzso must be detected early, and if present, a zzso zzso should be followed by zzso zzso
