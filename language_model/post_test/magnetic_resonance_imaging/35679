To identify surgical zzso factors and to characterize clinical features according to the location of the zzso zzso onset zone of frontal lobe zzso zzso in order to assess the role of various diagnostic zzso including zzso with zzso zzso 

We studied 71 zzso patients who underwent zzso surgery and whose outcomes were followed for more than 2 zzso zzso were established by standard zzso zzso 

Clinical manifestations could be zzso into six zzso initial focal motor (9 zzso initial zzso seizure zzso frontal lobe complex partial seizure zzso complex partial seizure mimicking zzso lobe zzso zzso initial zzso zzso of arms zzso and sudden secondary generalized zzso seizure zzso zzso patients became zzso after zzso Five patients were deleted in the analysis because of incomplete zzso of zzso onset zzso The positive zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the negative zzso value were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso No significant relationship was found between the diagnostic accuracy of these zzso and surgical outcome, with the exception of zzso zzso zzso zzso of two or more zzso was observed in patients who became zzso zzso We could not find any clinical characteristic related to surgical outcome besides seizure zzso No zzso relationship was found between the location of zzso zzso onset zone and clinical zzso 

Although various diagnostic methods can be useful in the diagnosis of zzso only zzso can predict surgical zzso zzso between zzso evaluations indicates a better surgical zzso
