zzso aging is often associated with the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases leading to zzso Animal models are critical to zzso mechanisms associated to zzso and to evaluate zzso zzso zzso that received zzso injection of zzso zzso have been reported as a model of zzso In these animals, this drug zzso zzso stress and brain zzso metabolism zzso associated to insulin signal zzso zzso These mechanisms are reported to be involved in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease and other zzso zzso rats also display memory zzso However, little is known about the precise location of the zzso induced by zzso zzso In this context, the present study characterized the cerebral zzso induced by zzso of zzso by using zzso magnetic resonance imaging to easily and zzso detect cerebral abnormalities and by using zzso to evaluate zzso loss and zzso zzso and zzso We showed that, at high doses, zzso zzso severe and acute neurodegenerative zzso in the zzso and corpus zzso The zzso are associated with an inflammation zzso They are less severe and more progressive at low zzso The relevance of high and low doses of zzso to mimic zzso and evaluate new drugs is discussed in the final part of this zzso
