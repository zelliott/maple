zzso movement disorders and zzso zzso abnormalities of the zzso have been sporadically reported as a rare syndrome associated with diabetes zzso Despite characteristic imaging findings and clinical manifestations, the mechanism underlying this syndrome is still zzso 

Six patients with this syndrome were studied clinically and subjected to zzso zzso one underwent biopsy of the zzso and another underwent additional MR zzso at zzso and zzso 

zzso findings were characterized by a zzso unilateral zzso restricted to the zzso zzso to the symptomatic zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso severe zzso of all layers of zzso and marked narrowing of vessel zzso zzso zzso of the zzso walls, zzso of zzso and prominent zzso proliferation were also zzso together with zzso zzso and zzso zzso In one patient, PET examination revealed decreased zzso of zzso in the zzso The MR spectrum for the diseased zzso revealed a decrease in the zzso ratio zzso normal zzso ratio zzso and a peak for zzso while the spectrum on the zzso site revealed a decrease in the zzso ratio zzso increase in zzso zzso but no peak for zzso 

The constellation of signs and symptoms and zzso characteristics in previous reports and the six additional cases described here with zzso data and findings of MR zzso appears unique enough to be termed zzso zzso This syndrome appears in poorly controlled diabetics due to zzso zzso with prominent vascular zzso vulnerability to which is restricted to the zzso
