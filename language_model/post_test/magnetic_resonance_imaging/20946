zzso zzso is an zzso occurrence in the setting of adult trauma zzso It is typically associated with diffuse abdominal injury, and its presence is commonly correlated with high injury severity and zzso 

To discuss the recognition of adrenal zzso as a cause of right upper zzso zzso 

We present the case of a 23-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department zzso with acute right upper zzso pain after blunt trauma to the area; he was initially diagnosed with an abdominal zzso with an incidental adrenal zzso After experiencing continued pain for 2 days, the patient returned to the zzso for zzso zzso imaging revealed that the adrenal mass had zzso and it was determined that this patient had suffered an acute adrenal zzso The zzso was determined to be zzso and the patient was treated with supportive zzso zzso images 8 weeks later revealed resolution of the zzso and the patient reported complete resolution of zzso We also discuss adrenal zzso in the trauma setting and explain that in our patient, given the clinical scenario and statistical evidence, an initial diagnosis of adrenal zzso should be favored over abdominal zzso with incidental zzso 

We describe a case of a traumatic isolated adrenal zzso that presents acutely as right upper zzso zzso This unusual presentation highlights the need for recognition of the adrenal zzso as a potential cause of right upper zzso pain in the trauma zzso
