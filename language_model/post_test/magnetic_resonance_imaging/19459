zzso and detached flow patterns close to the carotid zzso are thought to play an important role in the development of carotid zzso by promoting zzso The aim of this study was to investigate a flow regime with strong transient zzso including vortex shedding and transport to develop zzso appropriate to the analysis of carotid zzso The existence of a regular periodic vortex street behind a zzso flow obstruction was predicted and zzso in detail by Theodore van zzso in the early 20th zzso This model was chosen in our study for both ease of phantom construction and of theoretical zzso using finite element zzso fluid dynamics zzso The results of the theoretical calculations have been compared with two methods of flow zzso sheet imaging and real-time echo zzso magnitude MR zzso zzso was investigated over a range of zzso number from 40 through 400 through which vortex shedding is zzso Good overall agreement was obtained between the theoretical (16 zzso and experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso estimates of the zzso zzso street wavelength for a Reynolds number of zzso
