The study objective was to correlate the magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso with the zzso features and disease zzso 

Institutional review board approval for this retrospective study was zzso patient consent was not zzso The initial staging zzso scans of 75 patients with zzso confirmed zzso were zzso zzso The imaging was assessed by 2 zzso for the presence of tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso fat, zzso zzso zzso and zzso vein zzso zzso analysis for the zzso presence of zzso zzso within tumors was zzso zzso findings were correlated with zzso findings of clear cell percentage, zzso and zzso growth pattern, and disease zzso zzso associations were evaluated with zzso zzso analyses and multivariable zzso zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso features was performed in 75 patients, whereas follow-up data were available for progression analysis in 68 zzso The presence of tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso vein zzso on zzso was significantly associated with a low percentage of tumor cells with clear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease at presentation or disease progression zzso zzso zzso At multivariable analysis, necrosis remained the only feature statistically associated with disease progression zzso zzso zzso adjusted odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for reader 1 and P zzso zzso adjusted odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for reader zzso 

zzso in zzso on zzso zzso with the zzso finding of lower percentage of tumor cells with clear zzso and is a poor zzso indicator irrespective of tumor zzso
