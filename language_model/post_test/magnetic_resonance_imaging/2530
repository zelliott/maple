Using statistical zzso mapping and zzso zzso PET we have previously shown reduction of central zzso zzso zzso binding restricted to the zzso in zzso zzso lobe zzso due to unilateral zzso zzso However, bilateral zzso pathology can be present in up to 50% of patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso Additionally, the limited spatial resolution of PET results in a partial volume effect that affects quantitative analysis of zzso and such an effect can mask zzso zzso We zzso changes in the zzso volume of distribution zzso before and after correction for partial volume effect in six patients with zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso and a quantitative zzso diagnosis of bilateral zzso zzso which appeared either symmetrical on zzso zzso symmetrical zzso zzso three zzso or bilateral but zzso zzso zzso zzso three zzso and in nine patients with zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso and unilateral zzso sclerosis on zzso than was subsequently zzso zzso Fifteen healthy controls were also studied for zzso Before correction for partial volume effects, significant unilateral reductions of zzso were found in one of the three patients with bilateral symmetrical zzso zzso in one of the three zzso zzso sclerosis patients and in six of the nine unilateral zzso sclerosis zzso No significant bilateral reductions of zzso zzso were zzso After correction for partial volume effect, all three patients with bilateral symmetrical zzso sclerosis showed significant bilateral reductions of zzso and these were zzso in zzso All three patients with zzso zzso sclerosis and all nine patients with unilateral zzso sclerosis on zzso showed unilateral reductions of zzso zzso with the side of the zzso zzso In addition one of the three patients with zzso zzso sclerosis and three of the nine patients with unilateral zzso sclerosis showed significant reductions of zzso in the zzso zzso to the side of the zzso zzso Absolute zzso of zzso corrected for partial volume effect, within multiple zzso volumes of interest was necessary in order to detect bilateral changes of zzso in zzso zzso lobe zzso due to zzso sclerosis with optimal zzso This zzso approach was able to demonstrate subtle zzso abnormalities in one-third of patients thought to have unilateral or bilateral zzso zzso sclerosis on zzso Reduction of zzso binding was consistently over and above loss of zzso volume indicating that zzso is not the sole zzso of zzso loss in zzso zzso lobe zzso
