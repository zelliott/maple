To assess the efficacy of zzso motor zzso stimulation zzso on zzso zzso pain, and quality of life in patients with zzso secondary to a focal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In this zzso zzso zzso study, 5 patients with zzso secondary to a focal zzso zzso were zzso Two zzso leads were implanted zzso over the primary motor zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the most zzso zzso The leads were placed parallel to the central zzso Only the zzso lead over zzso was activated in this zzso The most lateral or zzso contact of the lead zzso on whether the zzso predominated in the upper or lower zzso was selected as the zzso and the other 3 as zzso One month zzso patients were randomly assigned to zzso or zzso for 3 months each, with a zzso zzso between the 2 zzso zzso frequency, and pulse zzso were fixed at zzso zzso 40 zzso and 60 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pain intensity zzso analog zzso and quality of life zzso Short Form Health zzso were performed before surgery and after each period of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso score, pain intensity, and quality of life were not statistically significantly modified by zzso 

zzso zzso zzso failed to improve any clinical feature in zzso secondary to a focal zzso zzso 

This study provides Class I evidence that bipolar zzso zzso with the zzso placed over the motor representation of the most affected limb failed to improve any clinical feature in zzso secondary to a focal zzso zzso
