Clinical and molecular characterization of patients with horizontal gaze zzso with progressive zzso zzso to extend existing knowledge of the zzso caused by zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso 

Four patients zzso 6 months to 13 zzso two of them siblings, with features of horizontal gaze zzso and their parents were examined clinically and by molecular testing of the zzso zzso The three families were zzso but parents in each family were zzso 

We identified three novel zzso zzso zzso in four patients with typical zzso signs of zzso We found an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a 31 zzso deletion including the donor zzso site of zzso 17 and adjacent zzso and zzso sequences zzso zzso and a zzso zzso located next to a zzso donor site zzso resulting in skipping of zzso 22, as shown by zzso zzso 

We describe three novel zzso in the zzso gene and the detailed clinical zzso of zzso One patient displayed marked convergence upon attempting smooth pursuits to both zzso In one patient, the typical zzso zzso the zzso findings, and molecular testing led to the diagnosis even before zzso zzso In addition to the typical magnetic resonance imaging brain signs of zzso this patient had marked zzso of the frontal zzso and corpus zzso In zzso diagnosis of zzso may be established by zzso and molecular investigation early in life, allowing ongoing orthopedic surveillance from an early zzso
