zzso graft placement in anterior cruciate ligament zzso reconstructions is considered to be a critical factor affecting the successful clinical outcome of the zzso Many current zzso instrument systems rely on zzso landmarks to guide the zzso tunnel zzso However, most of these instrument systems use mobile soft zzso as zzso We zzso that consistently identifiable zzso zzso landmarks can be established that can be used to improve the zzso of graft tunnel placement in zzso and zzso zzso zzso For the zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans showed the average zzso attachment site to be projected at zzso on a line extending from the anterior to the zzso zzso zzso zzso images were checked for the zzso of this line and its clinical zzso For the zzso lateral zzso demonstrated a consistent relationship between the zzso roof line zzso line) and the nearly circular profile of the zzso and inferior zzso of the lateral zzso zzso The middle of this circular profile is consistently projected on zzso line at zzso of its zzso zzso zzso images were used, which showed the aiming drill at the point of entering the lateral zzso zzso Instead of determining the zzso attachment site relative to zzso line, we can thus determine its position relative to the center of the zzso Based on zzso zzso the proposed zzso zzso attachment site can be projected on a line parallel with the zzso line from the circle center in the zzso zzso Our results indicate that there are consistently identifiable zzso features on the zzso and zzso contours that can be used for zzso and zzso guidance of zzso graft zzso
