The zzso marginal zone zzso of the zzso zzso is a key embryonic region involved in body axis organization and neural zzso Using zzso microscopic magnetic resonance imaging zzso we follow the zzso movements that lead to the formation of the zzso of the stage 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso series reveal that zzso movements change the tissue architecture of the zzso at earlier stages and in a different fashion than previously zzso Beginning at stage 9, zzso of the animal cap moves tissue into the zzso but not into the zzso marginal zone, resulting in an asymmetry between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso imaging of labeled zzso shows that the animal cap tissue moves into the superficial zzso zzso the deeper zzso of the zzso The zzso of superficial tissue over the deeper zzso creates the zzso arrangement of zzso outside of zzso within the zzso which is independent of zzso and prior to the formation of the zzso zzso zzso This tilting of the zzso is distinct from, but occurs zzso with, the vegetal rotation of the vegetal cell mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a new zzso movement involved in the zzso of the zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We present a revised model of zzso movements in zzso zzso
