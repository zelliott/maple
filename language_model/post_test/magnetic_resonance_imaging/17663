It remains unclear whether direct vessel wall imaging can identify carotid high-risk zzso in symptomatic subjects and whether carotid plaque characteristics are more effective indicators for cerebral zzso severity than zzso This study sought to determine the associations of carotid plaque characteristics by MR imaging with zzso and acute cerebral zzso zzso sizes on diffusion weighted imaging zzso 

One hundred and zzso symptomatic patients underwent carotid and brain zzso zzso volume was determined from symptomatic internal carotid artery territory on zzso zzso zzso carotid plaque zzso and compositional zzso and zzso were also zzso The relationships between carotid plaque zzso zzso and zzso size were then zzso 

In carotid arteries with zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to have zzso zzso core zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of carotid arteries with zzso zzso developed zzso zzso zzso zzso such as % wall volume, and the zzso size were significantly associated with zzso zzso volume before and after adjustment for significant demographic factors (age and zzso or zzso in patients with carotid plaque (all zzso 

A substantial number of high-risk plaques characterized by vessel wall imaging exist in carotid arteries with lower grade zzso In addition, carotid plaque zzso particularly the % wall volume and zzso size, are independently associated with cerebral zzso as measured by zzso zzso Our findings indicate that characterizing zzso plaque by MR vessel wall imaging might be useful for zzso of plaque risk and zzso zzso
