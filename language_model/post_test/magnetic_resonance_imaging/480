Image analysis has been strongly present in several zzso initiatives from the start, and today we find many imaging projects with successful grid zzso and zzso An example is the analysis of functional zzso data on grids, which has been successfully realized by several projects and that could be of interest for zzso However, crossing the borders of existing zzso is not trivial because the zzso being created for these projects zzso each adopting a zzso different software zzso This paper describes our early attempts to cross the borders between the German and Dutch grid zzso for medical imaging, motivated by a true wish to share expertise about zzso analysis on zzso between these two zzso We describe how we used zzso zzso grid technology to implement supporting mechanisms for cooperation in zzso at several levels zzso data, software, zzso and computing zzso This simple exercise provided us valuable insights into the problems of crossing the borders of real zzso from a user's zzso Besides technical aspects, we observed that security and zzso are very important for the success of zzso of zzso
