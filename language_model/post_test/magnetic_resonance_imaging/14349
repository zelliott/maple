Two patients with zzso zzso and zzso are zzso In both there are magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities of the zzso zzso In one patient, increased magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity is present in the zzso lobe zzso to zzso and zzso In the other, there is zzso lobe asymmetry with the smaller zzso lobe zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The relevant human and experimental literature related to cortical control of zzso size and lid movement is zzso Based on the available literature and the findings in these two patients, it is proposed that the increased signal intensity in the zzso lobe of one patient represents an zzso stimulus causing zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso lobe zzso in the second patient permitted impulses from the zzso normal zzso lobe to zzso resulting in zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
