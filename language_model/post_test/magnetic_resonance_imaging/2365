The point spread function is a fundamental property of magnetic resonance imaging methods that affects image quality and spatial zzso The point spread function is difficult to measure precisely in magnetic resonance even with the use of carefully designed zzso and it is difficult to calculate this function for complex sequences such as zzso zzso This report describes a method that measures the point spread function with high spatial resolution at each zzso in samples of uniform intensity zzso This method uses additional phase zzso zzso before the zzso acquisition that are constant in length but vary in zzso The additional zzso are applied to image the contents within each individual zzso This method has been used to measure the point spread function for zzso imaging to demonstrate the effects of limited zzso sampling and zzso relaxation, as well as the effects of object zzso By considering the displacement of the point spread function, local zzso due to zzso and chemical shift effects have been zzso and zzso The method allows rapid assessment of the point spread function in zzso imaging, in zzso and may also be applied to other rapid imaging sequences that can be modified to include these additional phase zzso zzso
