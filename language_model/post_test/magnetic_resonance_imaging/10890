Our objective was to determine the diagnostic yield of laboratory testing, zzso imaging, and zzso zzso screening in a large cohort of patients with differing zzso of idiopathic zzso hearing loss zzso 

We undertook a retrospective study of patients presenting with zzso at our institution from 1993 to zzso 

Laboratory testing had an extremely low zzso Patients with unilateral zzso had a significantly higher imaging yield than those with zzso The diagnostic yield of zzso screening was significantly higher in patients with severe to profound zzso than in those with less severe zzso However, a relatively large number of patients with mild to moderate zzso had positive zzso zzso 

Based on diagnostic yields, we propose a cost-effective zzso diagnostic paradigm to replace the more commonly used and costly simultaneous testing zzso
