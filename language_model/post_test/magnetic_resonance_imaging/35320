To present the ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging findings that may allow for a prospective diagnosis and expectant management of zzso zzso because the rare occurrence of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of an zzso during pregnancy can mimic zzso cancer at zzso 

zzso zzso mural zzso with prominent internal zzso were noted in an apparent right zzso zzso on serial ultrasound studies in a 34-year-old woman at 12, 21, 27, and 30 weeks of zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated the zzso to be zzso similar in intensity and texture to the zzso zzso in the zzso on zzso zzso A provisional diagnosis of zzso zzso allowed for expectant management with immediate zzso zzso and confirmation of the zzso 

zzso zzso can mimic zzso zzso during pregnancy, but a prospective diagnosis may be possible when solid smoothly zzso zzso with prominent internal zzso within an zzso are seen from early in pregnancy, and the zzso demonstrate marked similarity in signal intensity and texture with the zzso zzso in the zzso at magnetic resonance zzso
