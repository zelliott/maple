The authors compared zzso zzso zzso and zzso retrograde zzso zzso techniques commonly used to study the zzso tree, with zzso and zzso zzso fast low angle shot zzso and fat suppressed zzso in 28 consecutive patients with zzso duct abnormalities detected on zzso including 11 patients with zzso disease and 17 patients with benign zzso zzso CT, and magnetic resonance zzso images were zzso interpreted in a blinded fashion and reviewed by zzso zzso characterized all cases of zzso disease by the presence of a narrowed zzso duct zzso with irregular zzso CT and zzso detected all cases of zzso disease and characterized nine of 11 as zzso In seven of these cases, CT and zzso showed zzso of zzso zzso duct walls greater than 5 zzso zzso images showed zzso zzso tissue in four cases, which was not seen on CT images, and which was zzso tumor zzso zzso disease was characterized on zzso images by the demonstration of smooth tapered zzso in 16 cases, whereas on CT and MR images it was characterized by mild to moderate zzso of the zzso zzso ducts and wall thickness less than 5 zzso in 13 zzso zzso zzso correctly characterized 27 cases as benign or zzso and CT and zzso both characterized zzso The results of this study show a trend that zzso is superior to CT and zzso for characterizing zzso duct zzso
