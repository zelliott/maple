zzso of cortical functional connectivity in normal infants were examined during natural sleep by observing the time course of very low frequency zzso Such zzso represent fluctuations in blood zzso level and cortical blood flow thus allowing zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso information were acquired for 11 zzso with a mean age of zzso months, using a GE zzso T MR zzso zzso data were processed and significant functional connectivity within the zzso area was identified using independent component zzso zzso functional connectivity in the developing zzso zzso was zzso Power spectral analysis showed that slow frequency zzso dominated the zzso signal at this age, with, on average, a peak frequency for all subjects of zzso zzso Our data suggest that there is more zzso than zzso connectivity in the zzso area of naturally sleeping zzso This zzso imaging technique, developed to allow reliable scanning of normal infants without zzso enabled zzso of zzso connectivity for the first time in naturally sleeping zzso Such techniques permit zzso of the role of slow cortical zzso during early brain development and may reveal critical information regarding the zzso development and zzso of brain networks across zzso
