zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso is zzso zzso with complex genetic zzso In addition to zzso E zzso zzso the major genetic risk factor, recent zzso association studies zzso have identified a growing list of sequence variations associated with the zzso Building on a prior large-scale zzso zzso we used a recently developed zzso method to zzso a zzso score that involves up to 26 independent common sequence zzso and is associated with zzso zzso above and beyond zzso We then examined the associations between the zzso score and the magnetic resonance zzso thickness zzso across zzso zzso in clinically normal zzso human subjects (N zzso zzso zzso cortical thickness was correlated with the zzso risk score, even after controlling for zzso zzso and zzso fluid zzso levels of zzso zzso Furthermore, the association remained significant in zzso subjects with levels of zzso zzso in the normal range and in zzso zzso zzso The observation that genetic risk zzso are associated with thickness across zzso regions of interest in zzso older individuals, suggests that the combination of zzso risk profile, zzso and zzso zzso may hold synergistic potential to aid in the prediction of future cognitive zzso
