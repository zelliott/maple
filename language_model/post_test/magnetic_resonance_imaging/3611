zzso zzso with cortical stimulation is the standard for language mapping in patients with tumors near or within the language zzso Reliable identification of the speech zzso is difficult, however, and zzso zzso and zzso techniques have inconsistent zzso 

We describe a technique based on direct cortical stimulation which zzso speech areas by zzso vocal zzso zzso in the zzso patient with speech arrest in the awake zzso 

zzso cortical stimulation is applied to the patient and the vocal cords are zzso by zzso zzso The cortical site that produces vocal zzso zzso is zzso Once the patient is zzso cortical stimulation is repeated and sites that produce speech arrest are zzso 

We have performed this technique in 3 patients and have consistently correlated vocal zzso zzso with speech arrest in all zzso These areas of zzso also correlate with areas of functional zzso zzso zzso obtained from the expressive language zzso 

zzso of the site of vocal zzso zzso in the asleep patient to the site of speech arrest in the awake patient represents an adjunct for defining speech zzso This technique is useful for patients unable to tolerate awake zzso
