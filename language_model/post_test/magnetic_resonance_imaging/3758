In zzso magnetic resonance image zzso zzso models have been introduced to calculate zzso plaque stress and strain conditions for possible zzso zzso However, zzso vessel material properties are lacking in those models, which affects the accuracy of their zzso zzso A zzso approach of combining in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso modeling was introduced to zzso zzso carotid artery material properties and the zzso shrinkage rate between vessel in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso carotid plaque data were acquired from 12 patients after informed zzso For each patient, one zzso slice and an zzso procedure were used to zzso zzso values in the modified zzso model for the vessel and the vessel zzso shrinkage zzso A sample artery slice with and without a zzso core and three material zzso sets representing stiff, zzso and soft materials from our patient data were used to demonstrate the effect of material zzso and zzso shrinkage process on zzso zzso zzso values of the zzso models for the 12 patients were zzso The effective Young's zzso zzso unit: zzso values varied from 137 zzso 431 zzso to zzso zzso and corresponding zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using the sample slice without the zzso core, the maximum plaque stress values zzso zzso from the soft and median materials were zzso and zzso which are zzso and zzso higher than that zzso from the stiff material, while the maximum plaque strain values from the soft and median materials were zzso and zzso which are about zzso and zzso higher than that zzso from the stiff material, zzso Without zzso zzso the maximum plaque stress values zzso zzso from the soft, zzso and stiff models were inflated to zzso zzso and zzso which were zzso zzso and zzso higher than those from models with proper zzso The effective Young's zzso from the 12 human carotid arteries studied varied from 137 zzso to zzso zzso The vessel zzso shrinkage to the zzso condition varied from zzso to zzso The inclusion of proper shrinkage in models based on in zzso geometry is necessary to avoid zzso the stresses and strains by up zzso zzso zzso had a greater impact on strain (up to zzso than on stress (up to zzso zzso zzso zzso material properties and zzso shrinkage could considerably improve the accuracy of in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
