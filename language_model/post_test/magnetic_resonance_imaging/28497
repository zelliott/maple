Data of the zzso studies of the zzso ligament are controversial because of the number, complexity, and zzso of the structures present in the zzso zzso The objective of this work was to study the anatomy of the zzso ligament to resolve some clinical problems: zzso do zzso bases exist that can explain the zzso painful syndrome termed zzso zzso zzso do zzso ligament varieties exist that can influence zzso joint zzso zzso resonance was used to analyze the zzso structure of the zzso ligament of live human zzso Thirty zzso ligaments of 15 volunteers were analyzed with magnetic zzso The images were acquired along the zzso and zzso planes zzso zzso and zzso The portion of the zzso ligament originating from the zzso zzso process is made up of two bands zzso and zzso The anterior band is broad and flat and has two different zzso zzso Type 1 originates from the anterior aspect of the zzso portion of the zzso zzso process and fans out widely before inserting on the anterior portion of the zzso zzso Type 2 originates zzso zzso and zzso from zzso aspect of the zzso zzso process and fans out before inserting on the anterior portion of the zzso zzso The zzso band of the zzso ligament originates from the zzso of the zzso zzso process and is zzso Just before inserting on the anterior margin and zzso of the zzso crest it zzso assuming the aspect of a small zzso On the zzso plane, the anterior band of the zzso ligament was placed along the horizontal line passing through the zzso zzso whereas the zzso band formed an angle of approximately 45 to 55 degrees opened zzso with this zzso On the zzso plane, the spatial disposition of the zzso ligament varies greatly with the size of the zzso vertebra and its position in the zzso zzso when zzso is situated low in the zzso the bands of the zzso ligament are longer and zzso zzso when zzso is situated high in the zzso the bands of the zzso ligament are shorter and zzso The zzso manner of zzso ligament zzso band in the zzso crest allows us to confirm the possibility of existence of the zzso painful syndrome termed zzso syndrome and confirms the possibility of examining its zzso site zzso Being accessible zzso various drugs can be injected directly into it or deep friction can be zzso This zzso band is thinner than the zzso with a smaller zzso base on the zzso zzso which explains its lesser resistance to zzso overloading and also explains the frequency of this painful zzso It is probable that the spatial disposition of the zzso ligament influences its zzso zzso Further zzso and zzso studies are zzso
