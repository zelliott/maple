To evaluate effects of zzso on zzso zzso muscle paths in middle and deep zzso 

The effect of various zzso procedures was assessed in five patients, using surface zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso performed with controlled gaze before and after zzso zzso changes were compared with those expected under conventional concepts of functional zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of 6 to 10 zzso produced changes in muscle paths of 3 zzso or less, assessed zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as large as 10 zzso resulted in almost no movement of muscle zzso Conventional modeling predicted much larger zzso 

The authors observed less movement of zzso muscle zzso relative to zzso walls than would be expected under the traditional assumption that zzso muscles follow the shortest path from origin to zzso This implies that middle and deep zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the paths of zzso muscle zzso preventing them from sliding freely to follow their zzso zzso The authors propose that these zzso function as zzso zzso coupled to the zzso wall, and that they are important zzso of zzso muscle zzso
