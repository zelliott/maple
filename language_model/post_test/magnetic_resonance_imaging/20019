To examine the effects of illness duration on the neural processing of memory in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso by using functional zzso 

zzso zzso patients (16 left, seven right) performed a complex visual zzso task during functional zzso zzso zzso analyses were used to quantity functional zzso in the zzso zzso and frontal zzso The patients' verbal and visual memory performances were evaluated by standardized zzso zzso zzso included group comparison and correlations of duration of zzso with functional zzso and memory zzso 

Compared with normal controls, zzso patients demonstrated reduced zzso zzso in the zzso zzso lobe zzso and the reduction was more pronounced on the zzso side of the seizure zzso Moreover, a longer duration of illness was associated with fewer zzso activated in both the left zzso and right zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the duration of illness was found to be significantly and zzso correlated with both verbal zzso and visual zzso memory zzso 

zzso seems to affect the memory processes in the zzso zzso zzso progressively zzso the longer the duration of illness, the lower the brain zzso In turn, the reduction of brain zzso zzso affects memory zzso Finally, the reduction is not limited to the side of seizure but also is observed in the zzso zzso
