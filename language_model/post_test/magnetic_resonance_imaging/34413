Although zzso zzso zzso provides a major imaging advance over conventional zzso and zzso in examining the whole body, the development of magnetic resonance zzso imaging has proven to be an even greater breakthrough in diagnostic medical zzso The zzso detail demonstrated in a MR image is a representation of at least three physical properties of zzso zzso density, and zzso and zzso relaxation zzso zzso differences in zzso density and, in particular, in zzso relaxation times of zzso allow excellent image contrast between various normal structures and high sensitivity in detecting pathological zzso This article discusses imaging features of zzso with particular emphasis on the potential of MR zzso
