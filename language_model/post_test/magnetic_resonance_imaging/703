An important aspect of auditory scene analysis is sequential grouping of sounds that are similar to one another in preference to sounds that follow one zzso This grouping problem is captured by stream segregation tasks with alternating distinct zzso We examined human auditory zzso activity with low noise zzso in a stream segregation experiment relying on timbre differences of alternating harmonic tones zzso and zzso We found that stream segregation performance in comparison to monitoring a zzso control stream increased zzso exclusively in left auditory zzso and particularly in zzso zzso Our results suggest that left auditory zzso is selectively involved in this complex sequential task although the available cue for sequential grouping was timbre, usually attributed to right zzso zzso
