Absolute and relative growth of cerebral structures was assessed zzso in 34 zzso normal zzso infants surviving up to 1 year of age, 20 infants with fatal zzso zzso and 4 with zzso zzso In the normal brain, cerebral zzso grew zzso faster than white matter throughout zzso Thus, to achieve the normal adult size and zzso ratio of zzso to white matter, white matter must continue to grow for several years after zzso of cortical zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso accelerated growth of zzso structures compared with zzso In addition, brains with zzso zzso had markedly depressed rates of zzso growth compared with controls of similar age, whereas brains with zzso zzso had disproportionate zzso The findings suggest that zzso zzso growth is accelerated in premature infants with zzso zzso or zzso zzso perhaps reflecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with impaired growth of white matter during a critical zzso and zzso sequential quantitative assessment of zzso size following zzso zzso may assist in early recognition of progressive zzso zzso
