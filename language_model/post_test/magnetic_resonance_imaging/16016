zzso zzso is a fundamental feature of sensory processing, both on zzso and on zzso zzso When the diameter of a visual stimulus is increased, the firing rate of a cell typically first increases zzso zzso and then decreases zzso zzso Such an area zzso function draws a comprehensive profile of the receptive field structure of a zzso including areas outside the classical receptive zzso We investigated area zzso in human vision with zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The stimuli were drifting sine wave zzso similar to those used in previous zzso zzso area zzso studies zzso A model was developed to facilitate comparison of area zzso in zzso to area zzso in zzso and single zzso The model consisted of units with an zzso receptive field structure found in single cells in the primary visual zzso The receptive field centers of the model zzso were distributed in the region of the visual field covered by a single zzso The measured area zzso functions were zzso similar to earlier zzso zzso The model with parameters derived from zzso captured the spatial structure of the zzso field in the primary visual zzso as measured with zzso The model also generalized to a novel situation in which the neural population was displaced from the stimulus zzso The current study shows that contextual zzso arises from similar zzso zzso and overlapping zzso and zzso mechanisms, both in single cells and in human zzso
