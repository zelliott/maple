zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures neural activity indirectly via its slow zzso zzso At a zzso resolution on the order of seconds, zzso does not reveal the real zzso of zzso zzso out by fast electrical zzso zzso which occur on a time scale of zzso In animal studies, these limitations have been addressed by adding invasive zzso zzso to zzso Here, we propose to circumvent this zzso problem of zzso by zzso a zzso spike measure from recordings of zzso zzso zzso signals during zzso We demonstrate how in response to median nerve stimulation 600 zzso zzso zzso signals can be measured reliably during zzso These zzso bursts zzso are supposed to reflect population spikes in the zzso and the zzso cortex, zzso We show that distinct zzso zzso in these two generator structures can be attributed to spontaneous zzso zzso Thus, our approach allowed the zzso identification of neural processes along the zzso zzso unfolding at a zzso time zzso
