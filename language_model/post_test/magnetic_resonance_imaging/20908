High sensation seeking is associated with strong approach behaviors and weak avoidance zzso The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to further characterize the zzso zzso of this behavioral profile using a zzso zzso Analysis of brain zzso associated with response zzso zzso versus response initiation and execution zzso revealed the commonly reported right lateral zzso zzso cingulate, and supplementary motor area zzso However, right lateral zzso was associated with greater zzso than Go responses only in low sensation zzso High sensation seekers showed no differential zzso in these regions but a more pronounced Go compared to zzso response in several other regions that are involved in zzso detection zzso motor initiation zzso zzso and attention zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso response for Go and zzso conditions revealed that the stronger response to Go than zzso trials in high sensation seekers occurred in in the earliest time window in the right middle frontal zzso right zzso and right zzso In contrast, the greater zzso than Go response in low sensation seekers occurred in the later time window in these same zzso These findings indicate that high sensation seekers more strongly attend to or process Go trials and show delayed or minimal zzso responses on zzso trials in regions that low sensation seekers use for response zzso Failure to engage such regions for response zzso may zzso some of the risky and impulsive behaviors observed in high sensation zzso
