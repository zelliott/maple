There is a lack of studies mapping zzso zzso zzso zzso to structural zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to integrate zzso zzso activity with cortical and zzso volume, as well as zzso memory performance, in a zzso zzso More specifically, we wanted to investigate the functional significance of the zzso frontal shift of zzso zzso with increasing age and whether zzso characteristics can explain this zzso Sixty six healthy participants zzso zzso went through a zzso examination, zzso scans, and a visual recognition zzso task with verbal zzso The results showed that zzso zzso in the recognition memory task (the zzso zzso correlated significantly with cortical volume, but not with zzso zzso Large zzso predicted more differentiated zzso activity and not just larger zzso in general, zzso more distinct and efficient zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cortical volume, and zzso volume all predicted scores on a composite memory zzso All these relationship were dependent upon the common influence of zzso Finally, the participants with the most anterior distribution of activity showed the poorest recognition memory zzso Neither cortical nor zzso volume were related to this frontal zzso It is concluded that the distribution of activity along the zzso axis in a memory paradigm may have functional but not zzso zzso zzso The functional zzso need not be restricted to the older age zzso
