The contribution of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso is zzso We recorded zzso from six zzso zzso strips placed over the frontal zzso in a 13-year-old girl being monitored prior to surgery for intractable zzso zzso were recorded prior to two types of zzso zzso random zzso movements which involve zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso decision making on every trial and prior to zzso movements in a fixed forward direction triggered by a tone which does not involve any zzso decision zzso zzso random zzso movements were associated with an increased zzso zzso starting from 1000 zzso prior to onset of zzso movement at zzso over the zzso zzso zzso 6) and zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso as evident from a magnetic resonance imaging zzso These results suggest that in addition to the zzso area, the zzso zzso also contributes to the generation of zzso in conditions involving decision making about the precise nature zzso to zzso and timing zzso to zzso of the zzso These preliminary results require replication in a larger series of zzso
