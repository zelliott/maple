To determine if comparison of zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images enables detection of zzso in zzso clear cell zzso 

A retrospective search of MR and zzso records identified 43 patients with zzso zzso masses who underwent zzso and zzso MR zzso zzso patients had zzso cell zzso (27 with clear cell zzso and 10 patients had other zzso zzso With MR images, a zzso measurement of signal intensity of the zzso mass was divided by that of reference zzso In each patient, a ratio of these zzso zzso on the zzso images to those on the zzso images was calculated and termed the zzso signal intensity ratio zzso 

The mean zzso of clear cell zzso was significantly different from that of other zzso masses zzso zzso zzso in 16 zzso of 27 patients with clear cell zzso the zzso was less than 2 standard zzso below the mean zzso of other zzso In cases of clear cell zzso focal signal intensity on zzso images was less than that on zzso zzso 

On zzso images, some clear cell zzso show relative focal and diffuse loss of signal zzso In zzso masses, this signal intensity zzso is consistent with zzso not necessarily indicate zzso
