zzso zzso navigation techniques are used in many centers for zzso zzso zzso In this study, we assessed the accuracy and the clinical usefulness of a zzso system based on the optical zzso in a variety of zzso zzso 

The optical zzso zzso zzso zzso Memphis, zzso was used to perform 170 zzso zzso Its accuracy was judged before and after each operation by comparing the zzso error with the real estimated error measured on the patient's zzso Several objective factors were evaluated to assess the clinical usefulness of the optical zzso For zzso the zzso extent of zzso based on computer-generated images was compared with that on zzso images, and the length of hospital stay of patients undergoing zzso procedures was compared with that of patients undergoing conventional zzso For needle zzso clinical usefulness was based on the rate of success in establishing a zzso zzso 

The optical zzso was accurate to within 2 zzso for all zzso The zzso error was not significantly different from the real estimated zzso The zzso extent of zzso was accurate in 58 of 60 tumor zzso patients, as confirmed on zzso zzso Patients undergoing zzso procedures had a significantly shorter hospital stay than those undergoing conventional procedures zzso zzso 1 versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso All zzso were zzso 

The optical zzso is an accurate zzso device that offers clinical zzso These include precise surgical zzso decreased hospitalization time, and accurate tissue zzso
