For acoustic zzso zzso 2 zzso the sensitivity of zzso evoked auditory zzso zzso to detect the zzso zzso is 100 % as for magnetic resonance imaging zzso According to the literature the sensitivity for detection of zzso pathology in zzso zzso 1 zzso is estimated to be between 75 % and 95 zzso In the zzso the sensitivity and specificity in such smaller zzso is reported to be 100 zzso A normal result of the zzso examination and for additional zzso tests helps to increase the rate of safe exclusion of zzso zzso By at this time not yet routinely available modifications of the zzso examination and by additional zzso tests the sensitivity of the zzso screening procedure can be brought up to nearly 100 zzso Thereby their important role as the primary screening procedure can be zzso Besides a possible detection of a zzso zzso the zzso together with the additional zzso test provide important information on the functional status of the hearing and equilibrium zzso zzso safe indications for inclusion and for exclusion criteria of an zzso screening for individual patients will be provided and zzso
