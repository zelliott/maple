High spectral and spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso yields information on the local environment of suspicious zzso Previous work has demonstrated the advantages of zzso zzso zzso improved image contrast, no required contrast agent, zzso leading to initial investigations of water resonance zzso for the purpose of breast zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate a quantitative imaging zzso which characterizes zzso components of the water resonance in zzso zzso zzso for zzso diagnosis zzso 

The zzso broadening and zzso or zzso components seen in the water resonance of zzso zzso of breast zzso images are analyzed by zzso a zzso fit from the water peak zzso and evaluating the difference spectrum or zzso The zzso of these zzso zzso to zzso as zzso zzso tend to be larger in magnitude in zzso zzso indicating increased broadening in zzso zzso The authors considered only those zzso with the highest magnitude off-peak components in each zzso with the number of selected zzso dependent on zzso zzso Our zzso method compared the zzso and zzso of off-peak components of all zzso from all zzso in a database that included 15 zzso and 8 benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was accomplished by comparing the average off-peak component zzso and zzso in zzso and benign zzso The area under the zzso curve zzso was used as a figure of merit for both the zzso and zzso zzso 

In the zzso task of distinguishing zzso from zzso and benign zzso off-peak magnitude yielded an zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso In the zzso task of distinguishing zzso and benign zzso average off-peak magnitude yielded an zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

These promising zzso values suggest that analysis of the zzso in each zzso image zzso using zzso zzso could have high diagnostic utility and could be used to enhance current zzso methods and allow detection of breast cancer without the need to inject contrast zzso
