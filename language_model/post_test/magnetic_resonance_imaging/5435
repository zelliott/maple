Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a valuable tool for assessing treatment response to novel cancer zzso With appropriate data zzso quantitative functional zzso estimates can be obtained by fitting a model to the zzso This research focuses on applying a zzso zzso zzso model to zzso zzso imaging of the zzso In this paper, the use of two zzso providing greater zzso information, is compared with a single zzso zzso Computer simulations are used to assess the zzso precision and sensitivity to input function errors obtained for parameters estimated from the two imaging zzso Data from ten patients were zzso to assess the noise statistics obtained from the two zzso zzso The noise statistics were used with a zzso liver model to simulate data, from which the zzso zzso precision and sensitivity for the two protocols were zzso Data from the ten patients were also zzso and the estimates were compared with literature zzso This work demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining functional liver zzso estimates over a zzso volume using a sequential zzso zzso The simulation results show that the protocol consisting of two images per zzso is to be preferred as it requires identical patient zzso but provides zzso estimates that have superior accuracy and zzso
