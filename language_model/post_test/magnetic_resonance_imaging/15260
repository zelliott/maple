zzso hybrid zzso with a zzso zzso core were applied as contrast agents for both in zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso These hybrid particles were obtained by zzso zzso zzso within a zzso shell which carries organic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these particles are higher than the positive contrast agents like zzso which are commonly used for clinical magnetic resonance zzso zzso these particles can be followed up by zzso zzso This study revealed that these particles suited for dual zzso imaging freely circulate in the blood vessels without zzso zzso in lungs and zzso
