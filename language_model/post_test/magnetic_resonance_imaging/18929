Response properties of auditory cortical zzso measured in zzso preparations have provided important information on the zzso differences between zzso in different auditory cortical zzso Studies in the awake animal, however, have been much less common, and the zzso differences noted may reflect differences in the influence of zzso on zzso in different cortical zzso Because the behaving monkey is gaining popularity as an animal model in studies exploring auditory cortical function, it has become critical to zzso define the response properties of auditory cortical zzso in this zzso This study documents the response properties of single cortical zzso in the primary and surrounding auditory cortical fields in monkeys performing an auditory discrimination zzso We found that zzso with the shortest zzso were located in the primary auditory zzso zzso zzso in the zzso field had the longest zzso and the zzso intensity and frequency zzso zzso in the zzso field had the broadest frequency zzso and zzso in the lateral field had the most zzso zzso functions of the four cortical areas zzso These trends were revealed by comparing response properties across the population of studied zzso but there was considerable zzso between zzso for each response zzso other than characteristic frequency zzso in each cortical zzso Although the zzso zzso showed a systematic spatial organization across zzso no such systematic organization was apparent for any other response property in zzso or the adjacent cortical zzso The results of this study indicate that there are zzso differences between auditory cortical fields in the behaving monkey consistent with previous studies in the zzso animal and provide insights into the functional role of these cortical areas in processing acoustic zzso
