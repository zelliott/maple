zzso zzso transfer was studied by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso tests in a patient who underwent zzso of the corpus zzso zzso for drug-resistant zzso in two zzso The first zzso involved the anterior half of the body of zzso and the second, its zzso half and the zzso For the zzso study, the hand was zzso with a rough zzso The zzso tests zzso zzso Naming Test zzso zzso zzso Test zzso and zzso Finger zzso Test zzso and zzso tasks, zzso The patient was studied 1 week before and then 6 months and 1 year after the second zzso Before this operation, unilateral tactile stimulation of either hand activated zzso the first zzso and second zzso zzso areas and the zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso All three tests were performed without zzso In both zzso sessions, zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cortex, but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Performance was zzso correct in the TNT for the right hand, but below chance for the zzso in the other tests, it was below chance except for zzso in the zzso zzso This case provides the direct demonstration that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso to stimulation of the zzso hand and normal zzso transfer of tactile information require the integrity of the zzso body of the zzso
