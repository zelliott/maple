The purpose of this study was to establish the diagnostic reliability of anterior displacement of the zzso disk in the zzso joint on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients were examined through use of both zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso On zzso zzso zzso anterior disk displacement was defined as the presence of an area of soft tissue density that was zzso in shape and located in front of the zzso zzso 

With magnetic resonance imaging taken as the diagnostic gold standard in evaluation of zzso disk position, the sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the closed mouth position and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the open mouth zzso 

The zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of anterior displacement of the zzso disk in the zzso joint in the open mouth position was almost equal to that on magnetic resonance zzso It is recommended that the open mouth position be added when zzso zzso zzso is used to evaluate patients with zzso joint zzso
