To zzso the zzso changes in the zzso ear barriers of guinea pigs with acute zzso dysfunction and in patients with acute hearing loss using contrast zzso zzso 

An animal model of acute zzso zzso hearing loss was created by introducing zzso acid zzso zzso in guinea zzso zzso disorder and hearing loss were zzso An zzso was performed at 2 h after either intravenous zzso or zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso The inner ears of patients with acute hearing loss were zzso using a zzso sequence with a 3 T zzso machine at 2 h zzso injection with zzso at a routine zzso 

zzso pigs treated with zzso showed severe hearing loss and zzso zzso MR imaging with a zzso sequence at 2 h zzso injection of zzso was an optimal method for visualizing transport zzso through the zzso ear zzso zzso appeared in the zzso zzso and zzso membrane of zzso treated with zzso Similar zzso changes were observed in patients with zzso and zzso disease 2 h zzso injection with zzso using the zzso zzso 

Variations of zzso transport through the zzso ear barriers induced by zzso toxin was zzso in guinea pigs using a clinical zzso T zzso IV injection of zzso with 2 h of waiting time and imaging with zzso are optimal zzso The zzso observation of the inner ear in the animal model was zzso to patients with acute hearing loss, using an IV injection of zzso at the routine zzso
