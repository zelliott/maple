To assess whether zzso zzso zzso and its treatment is followed by volume loss in zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso consecutive patients with zzso zzso were randomly assigned to surgical or zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in 77 zzso patients with good or moderate clinical outcome 1 year after zzso A comprehensive zzso test battery was used to evaluate the cognitive performance of the zzso Thirty healthy individuals were zzso as zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso volumes were zzso zzso and the zzso zzso volumes were zzso in the matched control zzso In zzso patients, the corresponding volumes were smaller, HC zzso zzso zzso zzso and AM zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the AM zzso to the zzso aneurysm was smaller in patients who had undergone surgical treatment zzso vs zzso treatment zzso p zzso zzso Treatment zzso did not significantly affect the measured HC zzso The zzso but not zzso volumes correlated with the scores of several zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and its treatment may be followed by zzso in zzso zzso A clear correlation was demonstrated between zzso performance and reduced zzso zzso
