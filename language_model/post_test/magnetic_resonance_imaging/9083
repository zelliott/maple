zzso failure is an important clinical problem in patients on maintenance zzso dialysis zzso and is associated with high morbidity and zzso Acute zzso failure zzso is usually secondary to mechanical problems with the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso leakage zzso is an important cause of zzso and often poses diagnostic zzso zzso we analyze the zzso of zzso secondary to zzso in our centers and study its associated risk zzso 

After excluding causes due to mechanical problems with the zzso zzso patients complicated by zzso underwent computerized zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso cavity zzso to determine any zzso Other patients on maintenance zzso without zzso served as controls for comparison of risk zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso including history of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

During the zzso study period, 36 patients in a cohort of 743 patients on maintenance zzso developed zzso 23 of these 36 patients were found to have zzso which was confirmed by either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The duration of zzso at the time of zzso and the zzso ratio of zzso at 4 hours were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso months and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso communication zzso were significantly higher than in zzso patients without zzso zzso and zzso respectively, p zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso and zzso communication as the risk factors for zzso The odds ratios for zzso with zzso and zzso communication were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso - zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso p zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was not uncommon in patients with zzso A high index of suspicion for zzso is needed in the management of patients with history of zzso or zzso communication presenting with zzso
