Emerging data on the neural mechanisms of impulse control highlight brain regions involved in emotion and decision making, including the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso Variation in the development of these regions may influence one's propensity for zzso and, by extension, one's vulnerability to disorders involving low impulse control zzso substance zzso Here we test the hypothesis that lower impulse control is associated with structural differences in these regions, particularly on the right side, in 61 normal healthy boys aged zzso We assessed zzso and zzso behavioral ratings of impulse control zzso zzso and zzso zzso in relation to zzso zzso and zzso volume, measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging and zzso A zzso analysis showed that the right zzso was a significant predictor of impulse control zzso zzso tests showed zzso a significant correlation between low impulse control and decreased right zzso volume, especially the zzso sector of the zzso and zzso significantly lower right zzso volume in a zzso of 20 impulsive boys relative to 20 zzso zzso These results are consistent with the notion that right zzso provides a zzso correlate of the normal zzso in impulse control observed in zzso
