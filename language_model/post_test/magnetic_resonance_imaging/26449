zzso motion in the polar organic zzso zzso induced by an electric field is studied by magnetic resonance zzso zzso pulse sequences that correlate images obtained at two different times under conditions of both continuous and zzso electric fields are zzso The zzso image correlation zzso indicate that the time scale of motion in a zzso zzso electric field is tens of zzso zzso of the results to an zzso solution for the zzso probability function for one-dimensional bounded diffusion yields an electric field dependent effective diffusion zzso for zzso zzso of D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at room zzso zzso of this zzso and its consequences for combining zzso nuclear magnetic resonance with electrical orientation are also zzso
