Previous studies in primates have shown that chronic systemic administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso replicates most of the zzso zzso and zzso features of zzso zzso In the present study, serial zzso zzso zzso assessment of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained every zzso during the entire course of a chronic zzso treatment in zzso A zzso increase in zzso was detected in the zzso of the zzso animals, either immediately before or in conjunction with a zzso in the zzso zzso detected by zzso zzso Absolute zzso zzso demonstrated a progressive and zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as early as 3 weeks before the first detection of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso can be used to monitor early stages of brain zzso zzso In addition, given that zzso zzso zzso following systemic injection similarly affects all brain regions, the zzso selective decreases in zzso or zzso zzso are not simply related to the level of zzso impairment but to a preferential vulnerability of the zzso to zzso zzso
