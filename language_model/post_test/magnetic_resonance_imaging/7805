A zzso zzso network zzso has been proposed to support understanding others' actions and zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso in human subjects who are sharing a third person's zzso During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 20 volunteers watched movies depicting boxing matches passively or while simulating a zzso boxer's zzso zzso zzso phase synchronization zzso was zzso to derive zzso zzso similarity of zzso activity and zzso functional zzso During passive viewing, subjects' brain activity was synchronized in sensory projection and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced widespread increase of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso primary and secondary zzso zzso and the zzso attention circuits zzso eye fields, zzso zzso Moreover, interconnectivity of these regions strengthened during zzso We propose that sharing a third person's feelings zzso the zzso own brain mechanisms supporting sensations and motor planning, thereby likely promoting mutual zzso
