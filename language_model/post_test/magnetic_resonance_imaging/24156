Animal models suggest that the asymmetry of zzso zzso zzso zzso in young infants can be explained by a direct zzso from zzso to the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso However, earlier studies with zzso infants showed no evidence for zzso responses towards the damaged zzso that could be ascribed to this zzso zzso In zzso testing of two infants with very extensive unilateral cortical damage, we have now shown that zzso responses in both directions do occur before 10 months of zzso zzso towards the damaged cortex, indicating functioning of the direct pathways in the absence of cortical control, drops out in the later zzso The neural zzso responsible for zzso in humans appears to undergo a plastic zzso
