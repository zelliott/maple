Brain activity patterns during face processing have been extensively explored with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso source zzso adds a spatial dimension to the zzso time series recordings, which allows for a more direct comparison and integration with zzso zzso The goals for this study were zzso to compare the spatial descriptions of zzso activity during face processing obtained with zzso and zzso source zzso using zzso electromagnetic zzso zzso and zzso to use the combined information from source zzso and zzso to explore how the zzso sequence of brain activity during face processing is summarized in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso data were acquired in separate sessions for 17 healthy adult males for a face and object processing zzso zzso statistical maps for the comparison of viewing faces and viewing houses were zzso and compared to zzso statistical maps for the same zzso The spatial locations of face zzso activity measured by zzso and zzso were found to overlap in a number of areas including the bilateral zzso zzso the right superior, middle and inferior zzso zzso and the bilateral zzso Both the zzso and zzso solutions additionally demonstrated activity in regions that did not zzso zzso and zzso statistical maps of face zzso brain activity were found to zzso zzso primarily at zzso solution zzso that were within 18 zzso of the zzso zzso The combination of data from these techniques suggested that electrical brain activity at the zzso of the zzso is highly represented in zzso statistical zzso
