zzso zzso disorder zzso is a prevalent disorder in the spectrum of affective illness, and is associated with significant zzso The zzso of this zzso and zzso illness is poorly zzso A functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso probe of zzso function was used to advance understanding of zzso zzso 

We applied zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to study neural response to emotional words in the context of an emotional zzso zzso control zzso We examined zzso in this response across the zzso cycle, in the zzso zzso zzso phase and the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso phase, zzso subjects, compared with zzso subjects, showed an increased zzso response to negative zzso neutral zzso and a decreased zzso zzso response to positive zzso neutral zzso zzso subjects failed to show the zzso subjects' patterns of increased zzso and decreased lateral zzso zzso zzso response to negative zzso neutral stimuli in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This decreased zzso zzso zzso response to negative stimuli in zzso subjects was further enhanced in the context of behavioral zzso 

Further studies with larger numbers of subjects are zzso 

The results support a zzso model of enhanced negative emotional processing, diminished positive emotional processing, and diminished zzso control of zzso activity in zzso during the zzso zzso These findings provide a basis for a zzso model of zzso and have implications for studies of zzso regulation across the human zzso cycle in health and zzso
