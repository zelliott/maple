zzso zzso of higher order motor systems can be obtained by modulating the processing demands imposed onto relevant motor zzso Here we performed zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso statistical analyses in eight healthy volunteers to study zzso recruitment of motor circuits associated with unilateral finger movement sequences of increasing length and complexity, but with equal basic motor zzso zzso zzso mapping software was applied for zzso zzso analysis of the main effect of motor action showed cerebral zzso in the established cortical and zzso motor zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso contrast revealed significant signal increases zzso to sequence length and complexity in a subset of activated areas, notably zzso zzso and zzso zzso cortex, bilateral superior zzso cortex, left inferior frontal zzso area, right zzso nucleus, and left visual association zzso These data underscore the importance of zzso zzso circuits in processing length and complexity of sequential finger zzso
