zzso zzso studies in human subjects using zzso zzso zzso or functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso are typically conducted by collecting data over extended time periods that contain many similar trials of a zzso Here methods for acquiring zzso data from single trials of a cognitive task are zzso In experiment one, whole brain zzso was used to reliably detect zzso responses in a prefrontal region within single zzso In experiment two, higher zzso sampling of a more limited spatial field was used to measure zzso zzso between zzso zzso maps produced solely from the zzso data were comparable to those produced from blocked zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso will be able to exploit the high zzso resolution of zzso Such zzso will provide experimental flexibility and zzso data for individual brain regions on a zzso zzso
