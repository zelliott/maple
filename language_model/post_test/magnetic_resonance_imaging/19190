zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in young children may provide information about the development of the visual cortex, and may have zzso value for later visual zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of zzso for examining cerebral processing of vision in very young infants and in infants with brain zzso We examined 15 zzso zzso 12 children suspected of having a cerebral visual impairment and 10 children with a normal visual system, all of whom were either spontaneously asleep or zzso with zzso zzso zzso response to zzso light stimulation could be demonstrated in all technically acceptable data sets from children with a zzso age zzso of zzso 41 weeks, but not in younger zzso Children zzso 60 weeks zzso showed either a blood zzso zzso zzso signal increase or decrease, while all older children showed a signal zzso The activated cortical volumes showed a linear relation to age for healthy children younger than 90 weeks zzso but were small in children with visual zzso In two children with unilateral damage to the zzso zzso zzso was strongly zzso with greatest zzso on the healthy zzso In future prospective studies, results from the period from birth to six months of age should be interpreted with caution, as zzso variation of cortical development may be confused with functional zzso
