We have recently proposed a zzso organization based on resolution needs, in which objects engaging in recognition processes requiring zzso zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso while objects requiring large-scale feature integration zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso Here we tested this hypothesis by comparing the zzso organization with zzso to five object zzso faces, buildings, tools, letter strings, and zzso We found that faces, letter strings, and words were mapped zzso within the zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso opposite to that of letter strings and zzso In contrast, buildings were mapped mainly to the zzso zzso while tools activated both central and peripheral zzso The results are compatible with the notion that zzso organization allows the optimal allocation of cortical zzso to the specific requirements of various recognition zzso
