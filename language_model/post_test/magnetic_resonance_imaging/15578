To study the zzso base of voice familiarity zzso and the mechanism of auditory verbal zzso zzso in the patients with schizophrenia zzso 

Twenty-six schizophrenic patients, 13 with and 13 without zzso and 13 healthy control subjects were instructed to passively listen to familiar or unfamiliar voices and to give their judgment and underwent zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso based on blood zzso zzso zzso signal zzso The functional images were collected by using a zzso zzso and were analyzed by using statistical zzso mapping 2 zzso 

The total score of positive symptoms of the zzso patients with zzso was zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than that of the zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In comparison with unfamiliar voices, familiar voices zzso greater responses in the left superior zzso zzso right frontal lobe and zzso lobe among the zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IN comparison with healthy control group, when the patients with zzso zzso the familiar voices their left zzso zzso were activated more significantly, and when they zzso unfamiliar voices their right frontal zzso were activated more significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In comparison with the zzso patients without zzso when the zzso patients with zzso zzso the familiar voices their right frontal lobe were activated more significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), however, when they zzso unfamiliar voices there was not significantly difference in the zzso of the right frontal lobe between these zzso 

The zzso results of the zzso comparison support the inner speech disorder hypothesis that the zzso of inner speech in the zzso patients with zzso zzso the zzso of external voice on the corresponding cerebral zzso In addition, zzso patients may have significant change of zzso zzso zzso
