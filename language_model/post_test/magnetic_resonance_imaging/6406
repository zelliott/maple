zzso from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso were used to identify the sources of the visual zzso zzso potential zzso Healthy subjects performed a visual zzso oddball paradigm with a difficult discrimination task while zzso and zzso zzso data were acquired in separate zzso This paradigm allowed us to differentiate the zzso component of the zzso which has been implicated in the detection of rare events in general (target and zzso from the zzso zzso which is mainly evoked by zzso zzso The zzso source model explained zzso of the zzso of the scalp zzso for both zzso The zzso was mainly produced by zzso and inferior zzso areas, whereas frontal areas and the zzso contributed mainly to the zzso This source model reveals that both higher visual and zzso association areas contribute to the visual zzso and that the zzso has a strong frontal contribution, which is compatible with its more anterior distribution on the zzso The results point to the involvement of distinct zzso zzso in target and zzso zzso
