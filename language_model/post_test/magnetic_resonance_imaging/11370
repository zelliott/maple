A new method is introduced to detect magnetic field zzso arising from brain zzso zzso zzso This approach uses a two-dimensional zzso high-resolution conventional zzso zzso imaging sequence known as zzso The ability to zzso changes in oxygen zzso comes from the fact that the method is sensitive to the local zzso As is well known, as the oxygen zzso changes so does the local field associated with the zzso zzso We demonstrate that it is possible to zzso not only zzso blood with this approach on a zzso level for major zzso but also to measure conventional zzso like signal changes during activated and resting zzso Unfortunately, the method has two major zzso First, a long zzso is needed to maximize signal changes and, second, the field must be very well zzso or numerous experiments need to be run to find the zzso as the signal response is sensitive to the starting frequency in the resting zzso Nevertheless, these images can be compared directly with anatomical images collected with the same method without the need for distortion zzso
