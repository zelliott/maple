To compare zzso complex zzso movement and zzso location patterns of sequential swallowing in patients with stroke and healthy adults, and to determine whether these patterns affect swallowing zzso

No significant group differences were observed for zzso movement pattern, zzso location, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso movement patterns and zzso location were not associated with a higher zzso zzso zzso A significant correlation between zzso movement pattern and zzso location was zzso zzso location was typically inferior to the zzso between swallows when the zzso was partially zzso Across all groups, zzso zzso scores were significantly higher during sequential swallowing than single zzso 

zzso movement pattern and zzso location do not appear related to airway invasion, at least in persons without significant zzso Given higher zzso zzso scores during sequential swallowing as compared with single zzso sequential swallowing should always be evaluated in all zzso
