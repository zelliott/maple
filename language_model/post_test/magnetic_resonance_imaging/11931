A zzso structure of an zzso heart, formed by the zzso provided by the zzso loop, is defined and zzso initially, to normal zzso To define the sequence of normal progressive muscular activity, cardiac pressure, magnetic resonance imaging zzso and multiple gated acquisition zzso records are zzso This novel format of structure for the zzso heart is then compared with historic studies of zzso zzso New concepts will show how the zzso zzso cause initial zzso contraction, together with factors responsible for zzso zzso lengthening responsible for filling by zzso The interaction of these zzso changes are correlated to basic studies of zzso zzso to set the stage for zzso produced by changing the zzso zzso to a sphere during zzso heart zzso zzso changes in heart failure, which convert the zzso to a globe, are defined as the underpinning of zzso zzso It is our hypothesis that the zzso of this zzso left zzso zzso becomes responsible for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
