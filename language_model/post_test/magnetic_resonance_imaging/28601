To describe the characteristic features of pulmonary zzso zzso to evaluate the usefulness of various imaging zzso and to find a rational approach to accurate zzso 

zzso patients with zzso proved by operation and pathology were reviewed zzso Plain chest films were done in all patients, zzso in 3, zzso in 14, CT in 6 (including CT zzso in 1 zzso MR in 8 (including MR zzso in 1 zzso and zzso in 12 (including zzso in 1 zzso 

Plain chest films demonstrated a solid mass in 14 patients and a zzso mass in zzso zzso showed displacement of adjacent zzso with no filling of contrast medium within the zzso in 2 cases, while another case had a blind intermediate portion of the right zzso zzso of middle and lower zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a solid lung mass in 12 cases and a solid mass with zzso areas in 2, and detected zzso structures within the mass or in its surroundings in zzso zzso analysis showed zzso spectral wave confirming a feeding zzso CT revealed a solid mass in all patients, a mass with low density area in 4, and zzso surrounding the mass in zzso MR imaging depicted anomalous arteries in all patients and zzso drainage in 4 zzso zzso demonstrated anomalous systemic zzso supply to the zzso in all zzso In this series, 21 cases zzso were correctly diagnosed preoperatively by the imaging zzso 

Plain chest films can provide a diagnostic clue to zzso zzso CT and MR are helpful for showing zzso blood supply and for making a zzso zzso We recommend a rational imaging approach for the diagnosis of zzso
