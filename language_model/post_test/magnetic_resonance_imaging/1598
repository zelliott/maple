To compare findings of zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in stress injuries of bone and evaluate changes of these findings with time correlated with clinical zzso 

Prospective zzso 

A primary care hospital zzso orthopedic zzso 

All 31 patients with stress injuries of bone who visited our clinic from July 1996 to June zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and clinical examinations were performed on the same day or at least within 1 week of each other, and the findings were zzso If symptoms of stress injury of bone continued, these examinations were repeated at intervals of 2 months until symptoms zzso These zzso findings were assessed by an independent zzso who was blinded to the clinical symptoms of the zzso 

zzso accuracy of zzso and zzso findings with clinical zzso 

Even with negative initial zzso findings, all initial zzso and zzso indicated stress injury of zzso There were no patients with zzso zzso Grade of zzso and zzso were closely zzso and these findings also correlated with the degree of clinical zzso Compared with zzso zzso showed more diagnostic information, such as fracture line and zzso zzso Areas of increased activity in zzso were consistent with the grades of zzso especially high signal intensity areas of STIR (short zzso inversion zzso zzso 

From these zzso zzso is less zzso provides more information than zzso and is recommended for initial diagnosis and assessment stages of stress injury of zzso
