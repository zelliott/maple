zzso triggered by either observed or imagined actions suggests that the zzso zzso zzso zzso provides an action vocabulary that allows us to detect and anticipate basically zzso zzso states in observed zzso In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the same zzso region is also recruited by zzso zzso stimulus sequences as long as the zzso order of stimuli has to be zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we instructed participants to assess expected outcomes in observed actions zzso biological cues zzso motor imagery zzso biological cues zzso or geometrical figure sequences zzso zzso cues zzso As hypothesized, we found that each condition zzso significant zzso within zzso zzso hemisphere, zzso Area zzso zzso in contrast to a sequential target detection control zzso In addition, zzso zzso were identified in areas that were only engaged for biologically zzso cued zzso zzso and zzso cued zzso zzso zzso cued tasks zzso zzso within inferior frontal zzso adjacent to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso wall, the zzso body area, zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso whereas the zzso cued task engaged zzso motor area, middle frontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In sum, findings point to a basic zzso contribution to the representation or processing of zzso structured events, supplemented by different sets of areas in the context of either biological or zzso zzso
