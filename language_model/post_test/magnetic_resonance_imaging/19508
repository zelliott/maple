To determine the structural and functional integrity of the brain in a sample of zzso individuals diagnosed with fetal alcohol zzso 

The sample consisted of zzso individuals who met the diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol zzso 

Intellectual function was assessed using the zzso Adult Intelligence zzso zzso integrity of the brain was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging whereas functional integrity was assessed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The mean Full zzso zzso was zzso 2 zzso zzso Only 1 magnetic resonance imaging was found to be zzso This zzso was found for the subject with the lowest zzso zzso in relative regional cerebral zzso rates were found in 5 brain regions zzso the zzso and zzso zzso 

These results when coupled with previous findings suggest a zzso of zzso in fetal alcohol zzso For cases with relatively mild intellectual deficits, the cause of the deficit is at a zzso rather than a zzso
