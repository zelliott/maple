zzso is a complex cognitive function involving different types of information, such as knowledge about landmarks and direction zzso This variety of processes suggest that multiple neural mechanisms are involved, zzso the zzso system, the zzso zzso and zzso cortical zzso Although patient studies and imaging studies have given important insights in the exact neural zzso underlying zzso many controversies zzso zzso the current study sets out to further examine the zzso zzso of zzso in a sample of 31 stroke patients with unilateral zzso tested with a series of different zzso tasks, including landmark recognition, landmark ordering, route reversal and route zzso For all patients, the exact location of their zzso was determined using CT or zzso zzso Based on existing literature, a number of relevant brain areas were zzso after which the extent of damage to these areas was determined for each patient zzso Performance on the landmark recognition task was impaired by damage to the right zzso formation, whereas a weak correlation was found between damage to the zzso prefrontal zzso and processing the order of the zzso Several brain areas were found to be involved in retracing a route from the end to the beginning, including the right zzso formation, the right zzso zzso cortex, the right zzso prefrontal zzso and the right zzso zzso Finally, damage to the right zzso lobe impaired the ability to draw the zzso
