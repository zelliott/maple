zzso protein zzso has emerged as an important indicator of risk for cardiovascular zzso The impact of gender on the relationship between zzso and other cardiovascular risk factors, however, has not been thoroughly zzso 

zzso men and 75 women participated in this zzso Age, resting zzso and zzso blood pressure, resting heart rate, body mass index, total cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso oxygen consumption was obtained via treadmill testing, and zzso zzso was measured using magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso zzso level was significantly higher in the female subjects compared with the males subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the male group, zzso product moment correlation analysis showed that log zzso was not significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso with any of the other variables of zzso In the female group, however, log zzso was significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso with total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and body mass index zzso zzso zzso Linear zzso analysis determined that zzso and body mass index explained zzso of the zzso in log zzso 

These results indicate that the relationship between zzso and other cardiac risk factors is different between apparently healthy men and zzso The zzso characteristics of zzso and the impact of zzso therapy on zzso may therefore differ between men and zzso Future research should be directed toward resolving this zzso
