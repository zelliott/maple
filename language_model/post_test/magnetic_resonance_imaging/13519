Fifteen zzso specimens of human descending zzso and from eight patients with zzso vascular disease were studied by magnetic resonance imaging at zzso zzso Images were acquired in zzso and zzso planes to zzso protruding zzso and then chemical shift imaging was performed by techniques described by Dixon and by zzso These techniques produce images in which signal strength is zzso to zzso zzso The signal was expressed as a percentage of that from zzso zzso The total zzso content and its distribution within the plaques were zzso After imaging, the zzso specimens were examined zzso and the zzso content of the plaque was assessed on a zzso zzso The distribution of zzso within the plaque and between zzso and media was also zzso The findings of chemical shift imaging agreed well with zzso examination both for total zzso content and for distribution within each zzso Chemical shift imaging also provided an assessment of the zzso content of the plaques measured in living patients, but validation was more zzso The usefulness of the technique in routine clinical practice remains to be zzso
