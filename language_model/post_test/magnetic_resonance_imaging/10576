To zzso determine the feasibility of using zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging to distinguish between zzso segments in patients with coronary artery disease zzso of different degrees of obstruction and those in patients with zzso coronary zzso 

The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and all patients provided informed zzso zzso contrast zzso MR imaging was performed at rest and after the infusion of zzso in 37 patients (29 men, eight zzso mean age, zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso who had positive exercise test results or a clinical history of zzso zzso segments were divided into five groups according to the degree of obstruction in the zzso zzso Signal intensity zzso peak signal intensity, and time to peak signal intensity, as well as zzso zzso ratios for each of these three zzso were analyzed for each segment by using a generalized linear zzso 

Signal intensity zzso in patients with normal coronary arteries at zzso was significantly higher than that in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso Signal intensity zzso for segments in patients without zzso was significantly different from that for zzso segments in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso Signal intensity zzso zzso zzso zzso and peak signal intensity zzso zzso zzso enabled the differentiation of segments with more than zzso reduction in zzso diameter from those in all other zzso zzso ratios demonstrated findings that were similar to those obtained by using each signal intensity variable zzso 

zzso MR imaging can be used to distinguish segments with different degrees of zzso zzso zzso MR imaging can help identify segments with impaired zzso and zzso coronary arteries in patients with zzso and can demonstrate zzso zzso in other zzso
