zzso peripheral nerve sheath zzso zzso are difficult to detect in zzso 1 zzso zzso The purpose was to evaluate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and PET zzso zzso zzso as a diagnostic tool for zzso in zzso patients with symptomatic zzso zzso and to verify the diagnosis by pathology and clinical zzso 

zzso individuals with symptomatic zzso zzso underwent clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso PET and PET CT associated with zzso maximum standard zzso value zzso assessed possible zzso zzso zzso verified the diagnosis when possible and clinical follow-up was undertaken in all zzso 

In all, 116 zzso were detected in 105 patients aged zzso years, including 80 zzso zzso five zzso zzso 29 zzso and two other zzso zzso confirmed the findings in 59 zzso and no zzso was diagnosed on clinical follow-up of 23 zzso diagnosed as benign on zzso PET and PET zzso zzso PET and PET CT diagnosed zzso zzso with a sensitivity of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso but the zzso level did not predict zzso zzso 

zzso PET and PET CT is a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for zzso zzso Other PET zzso will be required to solve the problem of predicting zzso zzso
