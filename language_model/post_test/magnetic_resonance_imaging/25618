Six patients with clinical histories and physical examination results consistent with zzso band friction syndrome zzso were examined with magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso decreased signal intensity on zzso images and increased signal intensity on zzso images was present deep to the zzso band, adjacent to the lateral zzso zzso zzso fast imaging with zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were essential in zzso the zzso signal intensity zzso associated with zzso from fluid in the lateral knee zzso None of these patients were found to have lateral zzso tears, and all responded to conservative measures directed at treating zzso The authors conclude that MR imaging may be useful in confirming or establishing the diagnosis of zzso in patients with the appropriate clinical history and zzso lateral thigh or lateral knee zzso
