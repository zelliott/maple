The goal of this study was to determine the zzso and clinical value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso performed within hours after cervical spinal zzso injuries in human zzso 

Fifty-five patients with acute cervical zzso column and spinal zzso injuries underwent zzso as part of their initial treatment at the University of Michigan Medical zzso All images were obtained within 21 hours after injury zzso zzso zzso and were interpreted by an attending zzso who was blinded to the clinical status of the zzso Neurological function at presentation and in long-term follow-up examinations was compared with zzso characteristics assessed immediately after the zzso 

The presence and zzso length of zzso zzso the zzso length of spinal zzso zzso the presence of spinal zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso by zzso zzso were each significantly associated with poor neurological function at presentation and in long-term follow-up zzso Although the best single predictor of long-term improvement in neurological function was the neurological function at zzso four zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso the extent of spinal zzso zzso the extent of spinal zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso by zzso zzso provided significant additional zzso zzso zzso data demonstrated spinal zzso zzso for 27 of 55 patients zzso leading to emergency zzso Among patients who underwent imaging after restoration of normal zzso alignment using closed cervical zzso 13 of 26 zzso underwent emergency surgery for treatment of persistent, zzso spinal zzso zzso 

Emergency zzso after spinal zzso injury provides accurate zzso information regarding neurological function and aids in the diagnosis and treatment of persistent spinal zzso zzso after zzso zzso
