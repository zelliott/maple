In magnetic resonance zzso imaging, excellent reconstructions are obtained on large data sets using the inverse discrete zzso transform zzso Modeling procedures have been proposed to overcome the image artifacts from the zzso of small data zzso In this paper, a relationship between image reconstruction using modeling and the standard zzso is zzso A comparison of the assumptions behind the Smith and zzso models is given and an experimental evaluation of the zzso of the models zzso Various methods of evaluating model zzso are zzso Images are reconstructed from both models using the zzso zzso reconstruction approach zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso data information components that cannot be zzso useful when the assumed model characteristics do not completely match all portions of the zzso Although very different in their basic zzso both the Smith and zzso models were found to reduce zzso artifacts and improve resolution when used with the zzso zzso
