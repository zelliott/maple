The zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso recently have been proposed to regulate the directional trafficking and invasion of breast cancer cells to sites of zzso However, effects of zzso on the growth of primary breast cancer tumors and established zzso and survival have not been zzso We used stable zzso to reduce expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells, a highly zzso zzso cancer cell line that is a model for stage IV human breast zzso Using zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that zzso of zzso significantly limited the growth of zzso transplanted breast cancer zzso Mice in which parental zzso cells were implanted had progressively enlarging tumors that spontaneously zzso and these animals all died from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso prevented primary tumor formation in some mice, and all mice transplanted with zzso zzso cells survived without developing zzso zzso To analyze effects of zzso on zzso to the zzso an organ commonly affected by zzso breast cancer, we injected tumor cells zzso and monitored cell growth with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso or the specific zzso zzso substantially delayed the growth of zzso cells in the zzso although neither zzso nor zzso prolonged overall survival in mice with experimental lung zzso These data indicate that zzso is required to initiate proliferation and/or promote survival of breast cancer cells in zzso and suggest that zzso zzso will improve treatment of patients with primary and zzso breast zzso
