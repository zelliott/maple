Medical intervention for major depressive disorder zzso can be more appropriately focused through the identification and characterization of zzso markers that are specific to the disorder, and this study aims to examine the zzso in the fractional zzso of zzso fluctuation zzso and the zzso of zzso fluctuation zzso in currently depressed and zzso female zzso patients and to correlate these fluctuations with clinical markers of zzso zzso currently depressed female patients, 19 zzso female patients, as well as 19 zzso and zzso healthy females participated in the zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso We compared the zzso maps among the three groups and investigated the correlation between clinical zzso and statistically significant differences in the zzso of various brain zzso Compared with healthy controls, both currently depressed and zzso patients showed increased zzso in the right zzso Currently depressed zzso patients showed increased zzso in the right zzso median frontal zzso relative to both the zzso zzso group and the healthy control zzso The zzso of the right zzso was found to be positively correlated with the number of depressive episodes and the zzso of the right zzso to be positively correlated with the disease duration in currently depressed zzso zzso An abnormal zzso in the right zzso median frontal zzso was found only in currently depressed patients, suggesting that such an anomaly may play a critical role in depressive zzso and may be a therapeutic target for zzso An abnormal zzso in the right zzso is a potential candidate as a zzso marker of vulnerability to major zzso
