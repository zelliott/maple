The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of 6 commercially available magnetic resonance contrast media zzso on human zzso vein zzso cells zzso and the induction of transforming growth zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso as a possible model for the zzso of zzso systemic zzso 

zzso were incubated with zzso and zzso of the zzso standard blood concentration achieved with CM applications for magnetic resonance imaging examinations zzso and zzso zzso for 24 hours using zzso CM zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colony formation, and viability zzso were zzso Additionally, human zzso zzso zzso were incubated for 24 hours with zzso and zzso concentration in all 6 zzso and zzso levels were assessed directly after the incubation period as well as on days 3 and 8 zzso 

zzso zzso data show similar gains in cell numbers for all 6 CM in both concentration groups over the zzso assessment zzso Only cells incubated with zzso and zzso differed from the other groups on days 3 and 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso After day 7, a cell regain occurred in the zzso and zzso groups reaching the numbers of the other groups in zzso zzso in colony formation were consistent with zzso results with a statistically significant reduction in zzso activity for zzso and zzso in zzso cells, P zzso zzso No reduction in viability was seen for all groups and zzso zzso expression of zzso cells incubated with zzso concentration and all CM did not differ significantly from control cells for any point in time zzso At zzso concentration directly after zzso zzso was significantly reduced for the zzso and zzso group as 3 compared with control and all other CM groups, P zzso zzso On day 3 zzso only zzso zzso cells showed a significant reduction of zzso zzso standard zzso zzso as compared with the control group zzso standard zzso 30) and the other zzso zzso was slightly reduced for all CM groups 8 days after incubation (not statistically zzso P zzso zzso 

After 24 hours of incubation with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso considerable short-term zzso effects in zzso were zzso zzso cells zzso zzso showed a reduction of zzso for zzso and zzso directly after zzso whereas zzso levels in zzso cells were slightly reduced for all CM 8 days after zzso zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso or on collagen synthesis potentially leading to zzso systemic zzso may mainly be triggered by tissue zzso and zzso in the peripheral blood instead of zzso zzso
