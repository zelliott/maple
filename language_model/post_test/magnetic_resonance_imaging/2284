This report examines a technique for measurement of zzso zzso rotation using magnetic resonance zzso 

To assess the zzso of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging in the measurement of zzso rotation at individual zzso in patients with adolescent idiopathic zzso 

zzso in the zzso and zzso planes in patients with adolescent idiopathic zzso can be readily assessed from plain zzso but the degree of zzso in the zzso plane is more difficult to zzso Plain film techniques have inherent zzso because of loss of definition of zzso landmarks, and the use of zzso zzso is limited by the high radiation dose zzso zzso resonance imaging provides a means of imaging zzso zzso that allows zzso reconstruction and that involves no use of zzso zzso 

Ten patients with adolescent idiopathic zzso were zzso in a zzso zzso impact zzso zzso volume images of the zzso five zzso were obtained in the zzso plane and were zzso through zzso zzso Sections through the superior and inferior zzso of each vertebra were selected in the zzso and zzso planes, allowing zzso reconstructions to be obtained in the plane of each zzso zzso rotation was measured by identifying zzso points on the inner surfaces and at the junction of the zzso and comparing the angle zzso by these points with a vertical drawn by the zzso zzso were obtained from the single scanning sequence on two occasions by one observer and on one occasion by a second zzso zzso and zzso error was evaluated and correlation with readings obtained from plain films using zzso zzso method zzso 

The zzso variation had a mean of zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso and a zzso confidence zzso of zzso degrees, zzso zzso The zzso variation had a mean of zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso and a zzso confidence zzso of zzso degrees, zzso zzso The mean difference between zzso obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and plain film was zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso with a zzso confidence zzso of zzso degrees, zzso zzso 

The degree of zzso rotation can be accurately and zzso assessed by three-dimensional magnetic resonance zzso zzso can be made through individual zzso that allow assessment of the relative amount of zzso and zzso zzso
