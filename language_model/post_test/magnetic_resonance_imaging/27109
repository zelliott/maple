zzso zzso is thought to be one source of zzso zzso zzso of zzso tracking are frequently obtained during zzso knee zzso however, pain typically arises during highly loaded activities, such as zzso stair climbing, and zzso It is unclear whether zzso joint zzso during lightly loaded tasks replicate zzso joint motion during zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to: evaluate differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso joint zzso in patients with zzso zzso and evaluate whether the zzso in subjects with zzso respond differently to zzso than those in zzso We used real-time magnetic resonance imaging to zzso the zzso joint during dynamic knee extension from zzso to zzso of knee zzso during two conditions: zzso zzso and zzso zzso We compared zzso zzso measured from the zzso The zzso translated more zzso during the zzso task compared to the zzso task for knee zzso angles between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso responded differently to joint loading than those of the zzso In subjects with excessive lateral zzso translation, the zzso translated more zzso during zzso zzso knee extension for knee zzso angles between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in subjects with normal zzso translation, the zzso translated more zzso during zzso zzso knee extension near full extension zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso measured during zzso unloaded tasks do not accurately represent the joint motion during zzso zzso
