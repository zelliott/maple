Brain slices provide a useful nervous tissue model to investigate the relationships between magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast mechanisms and tissue zzso yet, these acutely isolated zzso remain viable for only zzso zzso To study slower biological zzso this work describes the first zzso zzso characterization of zzso rat zzso slice cultures that can be maintained for several zzso zzso images of slice cultures acquired with a zzso magnet demonstrated the zzso anatomy of the zzso with relatively high zzso zzso zzso data analyzed using a zzso model with exchange indicated that cultured slices had a comparable zzso to acute brain slices and to in zzso zzso zzso indicated that slice cultures tolerated the conditions required for zzso study zzso zzso of cultured tissue slices is highly amenable to zzso zzso techniques and offers great promise for future zzso investigations of pathological tissue zzso molecular imaging and stem cell zzso
