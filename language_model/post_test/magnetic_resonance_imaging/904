Biological research about zzso has been conducted using various zzso methods like functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso or zzso zzso Since language functions are characterized by both distributed network activities and speed of processing within zzso high zzso as well as high spatial resolution of zzso profiles are of zzso zzso can zzso specific zzso be detected and zzso do language processes start to diverge between zzso and controls? Due to the network character of language processing, zzso distributed source models based on zzso were zzso for zzso data zzso First zzso results show that this method could be a promising approach for the understanding of a repeatedly described experimental finding for zzso like that of an zzso in inferior frontal language zzso zzso data analysis for the subjects presented here could probably demonstrate that inferior frontal zzso are the consequence of a zzso deficit and could represent ongoing articulation processes used to solve zzso challenging zzso
