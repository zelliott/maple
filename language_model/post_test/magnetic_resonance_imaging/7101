MR imaging and zzso were used to investigate whether two calcium channel zzso zzso and zzso zzso would reduce zzso brain damage in zzso cats subjected to permanent unilateral zzso of the middle cerebral artery zzso The evolution of cerebral injury was assessed in zzso in a total of 38 cats using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR imaging and zzso 31 zzso and zzso zzso MR zzso for up to 12 h following zzso zzso Immediately thereafter, the volume of zzso zzso brain tissue was determined zzso In zzso control animals, zzso MR images obtained with strong zzso strengths zzso zzso displayed increased signal intensity zzso in the zzso zzso territory less than 45 zzso after zzso These changes were closely correlated with the appearance of abnormal zzso and zzso zzso levels evaluated with surface zzso MR zzso Cats injected with zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significant reduction in zzso injury in the zzso cerebral cortex, internal capsule and zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that these calcium entry zzso protect against brain damage induced by acute stroke by stabilizing cellular zzso zzso reducing zzso formation in zzso zzso and attenuating zzso and zzso zzso
