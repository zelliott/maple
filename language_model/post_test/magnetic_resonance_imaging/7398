zzso zzso of the zzso zzso occurs in zzso of patients with zzso heart zzso After successful relief of zzso patients remain at risk for zzso aneurysm formation at the site of the zzso We sought to determine the diagnostic utility of zzso compared with advanced arch imaging zzso in diagnosing zzso zzso in pediatric patients after zzso zzso The zzso Heart zzso from 1996 and 2009 were zzso All patients treated for zzso who had zzso defined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso Data collected included the zzso type, timing, and number of interventions, presence and time to aneurysm diagnosis, and zzso Patients were subdivided into surgical and zzso groups for zzso Seven hundred and zzso patients underwent treatment for zzso during the study zzso Three hundred and zzso patients had at least one zzso zzso were diagnosed by zzso in 28 of 399 patients at a mean of zzso after zzso zzso reports were available for 380 of 399 patients with zzso The sensitivity of zzso for detecting zzso was zzso The prevalence of zzso was significantly greater in the zzso group zzso compared with the surgery zzso zzso was also diagnosed earlier in the zzso group compared with the surgery group zzso zzso analysis showed a significantly increased risk of aneurysm diagnosis in patients in the zzso zzso and in patients requiring more than three zzso zzso zzso continue to be an important complication after zzso zzso Although serial zzso are the test of choice for zzso most zzso cardiac zzso in zzso our data show that zzso is inadequate for the detection of zzso after zzso zzso Because the time to aneurysm diagnosis was shorter and the risk greater in the zzso group zzso for patients requiring more than one zzso surveillance with cardiac zzso or CT should begin earlier in these zzso
