Although early interventions in individuals with bipolar disorder may reduce the associated personal and economic burden, the zzso markers of enhanced risk are zzso 

zzso studies involving individuals at enhanced genetic risk for bipolar disorder zzso were included in a systematic zzso We then performed a region of interest zzso analysis and a zzso zzso combined with a formal zzso zzso in a subset of zzso 

There were 37 studies included in our systematic zzso The overall sample for the systematic review included zzso controls and zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were detected between zzso individuals and controls in the selected zzso zzso amygdala, zzso zzso and frontal zzso The zzso group showed increased zzso matter volume compared with patients with established bipolar zzso The zzso individuals showed increased neural response in the left superior frontal zzso zzso frontal zzso and left zzso compared with controls, independent from the functional magnetic resonance imaging task zzso There were no publication zzso zzso analysis confirmed the zzso of these zzso 

As the included studies were zzso it remains to be determined whether the observed zzso and structural zzso represent risk factors that can be clinically used in preventive interventions for zzso bipolar zzso 

zzso structural and functional imaging evidence supports the existence of zzso trait abnormalities in individuals at genetic risk for bipolar disorder at various scales of zzso
