Using high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso we have recently described the normal pattern of zzso zzso in 11 anatomical regions of the human zzso In the present study, we evaluated the phenomenon of crossed zzso zzso in 40 patients zzso zzso with unilateral cerebral injury sustained at various periods of brain zzso zzso refers to a functional impairment at a remote site following injury to an zzso connected area of brain and, presumably due to a loss of zzso input to the remote zzso Of the 40 patients, 11 had sustained their cerebral injury prenatally, 7 in the zzso period zzso 24 hours of zzso and 22 zzso (1 day to 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen in 22 zzso zzso zzso metabolism was found in 16 zzso The presence of crossed zzso zzso was typically associated zzso of zzso with a zzso injury, while zzso zzso metabolism was seen only in patients with injury occurring prior to 4 weeks of age (13 of the 16 had prenatal or zzso zzso A third pattern of zzso zzso consisting of paradoxical crossed zzso zzso was seen in two zzso both had sustained their cerebral injury at 4 months of zzso These findings suggest the presence of considerable zzso which is dependent on age at injury, in the zzso zzso of developing zzso
