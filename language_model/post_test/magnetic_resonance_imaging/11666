To zzso three methods for assessing the productivity of zzso zzso a) simple count of zzso zzso b) method proposed by zzso c) method used by zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the characteristics of these methods and to find a common method of zzso 

On the zzso examinations performed at our unit over a period of 12 months were zzso The different types of examinations were clustered into five zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT, zzso The data were assessed by a) number of zzso per zzso b) zzso according to the zzso method and c) zzso according to the zzso method, and then compared for the percentage of the single zzso 

a) The total number of examinations was zzso with zzso being accounted for by general zzso mean numbers of examinations our ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso b) The total score according to the zzso method was zzso The zzso weight per hour ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso was the most relevant examination in the unit accounting for zzso of total zzso c) The total score according to the zzso method was zzso The zzso weight per hour ranged from 159 zzso to zzso zzso CT was the most relevant examination zzso of total zzso 

According to the simple count of zzso general zzso and ultrasound were the most relevant examinations together accounting for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, whereas by zzso standards the two techniques represent zzso and zzso zzso The simple count method therefore fails to give adequate weight to technologically advanced imaging zzso The zzso method adequately takes into account the combination of zzso and patient zzso The zzso method gives excessive weight costly technology as it considers the total weight of the examination and not only the zzso zzso
