The relationship between zzso tears and zzso zzso formation is zzso We investigated whether the development of a zzso zzso is related to the size of the zzso tear by using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

On the basis of a retrospective review of an zzso database, we identified zzso zzso in 34 patients with adjacent zzso tears extending to the zzso zzso The size of the zzso tear was measured by dividing the length of the tear along two zzso zzso and zzso We compared zzso such as the size of the zzso zzso the location of the zzso the pattern of each zzso and any associated zzso injury and zzso zzso between the 34 patients and the 30 control patients who only had zzso tears with torn components extending to the zzso zzso 

Compared with the controls, patients with zzso zzso had significantly larger zzso tears along the zzso axis zzso A critical size of the zzso tear along the zzso axis of zzso was associated with the formation of a zzso zzso 

A larger zzso tear extending into the zzso junction is more likely to be associated with the occurrence of a zzso zzso The critical size of the zzso zzso zzso along the zzso axis as identified using zzso is a discrimination value for zzso zzso zzso
