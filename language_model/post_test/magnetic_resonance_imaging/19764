zzso and zzso studies strongly suggest that the inferior zzso zzso is important for zzso However, the evidence from zzso experiments for a left zzso dominance in calculation is not as clear as one would expect from the studies of zzso Often a zzso zzso of the zzso inferior zzso region of the right zzso is reported in the same zzso The objective of this study was to replicate basic findings of zzso patients and to investigate discrepancies between data from patients and results from zzso studies in an addition zzso zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso was applied over inferior zzso areas and the adjacent zzso zzso zzso while subjects solved double-digit addition zzso From studies of zzso patients it was zzso that left zzso zzso stimulation should result in longer reaction times zzso in the addition zzso On addition trials without zzso subjects showed the classical problem size effect with longer zzso the larger the sum of the two zzso zzso stimulation over left inferior zzso areas disrupted performance zzso The effect was specific to the left zzso zzso There was no increase in zzso for zzso stimulation over the right zzso
