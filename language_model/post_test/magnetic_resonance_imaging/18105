zzso stress is considered to be related to the onset and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease zzso but there is insufficient evidence of its zzso In this study, we evaluated the relationships between the brain zzso state and cognitive function using a triple transgenic mouse model of zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso One group of 3 zzso zzso mice started to receive an zzso diet at 2 months of age and another group of 3 zzso zzso mice was fed a normal zzso The levels of zzso reduced zzso oxidized zzso and zzso zzso were decreased in the cerebral zzso and zzso at 4 months of age in the 3 zzso zzso mice fed a normal zzso These reductions were zzso by the supplementation of zzso in the zzso During Morris water maze testing, the 3 zzso zzso mice did not exhibit cognitive impairment at 4 months of age, but started to show cognitive dysfunction at 6 months of age, and zzso supplementation suppressed this zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso using zzso as a probe showed decreases in the signal intensity in the brains of 3 zzso zzso mice at 4 months of age, and this reduction was clearly attenuated by zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso stress can be associated with the cognitive impairment in 3 zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso might be a powerful tool to zzso evaluate the increases in zzso zzso especially those occurring during the early stages of zzso
