High spatial resolution zzso MR images of the human brain were obtained at zzso zzso An zzso fast zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso zzso were used to obtain zzso images in 4 to 9 minutes with an zzso resolution of zzso zzso and slice thicknesses from zzso to 3 zzso zzso zzso of surface coils were used as receivers, providing increased sensitivity but image zzso dependent on the reception profile of the zzso This image zzso was removed by analyzing the data with a theoretical intensity correction zzso developed in this zzso The zzso zzso the specialized phased zzso of surface zzso and the intensity correction zzso allowed improved zzso of nerves within the inner auditory canals and surface anatomy of the cerebral zzso It is expected that this technique will be useful for clinical applications that require high resolution imaging of small, superficial structures of the zzso
