To determine whether there are differences in the distribution of zzso and zzso zzso contrast agents by evaluating contrast enhancement of the zzso zzso cartilage, secondary zzso center, and zzso in the knees of normal zzso 

Following approval from the zzso on Research Animal Care, knees of 12 zzso zzso were zzso at zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging after intravenous injection of zzso zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso 6) or zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso Early enhancement evaluation with zzso MR imaging was zzso and compared zzso zzso zzso by means of enhancement zzso Distribution of contrast material was assessed and compared zzso zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso obtained before and at three 15-minute intervals after contrast agent zzso The relative visibility of the zzso zzso cartilage, secondary zzso center, and zzso was zzso assessed by two observers and compared zzso signed rank zzso zzso in zzso content and zzso that might explain the imaging findings were studied at zzso zzso 

Enhancement ratios were significantly higher for zzso than for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cartilage, and secondary zzso center zzso zzso zzso After contrast agent administration, zzso values decreased sharply for both zzso more so for zzso Additionally, there was less zzso in zzso values across structures with this contrast zzso zzso resulted in greater visibility of the zzso while zzso zzso resulted in greater contrast between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest different roles for the two zzso contrast zzso The zzso contrast medium is better suited for evaluating zzso and zzso definition in the immature zzso while the zzso contrast medium is better for evaluating cartilage zzso zzso
