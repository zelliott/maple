Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging has been recently shown to be effective for diagnostic zzso zzso zzso images can be acquired with zzso contrast agents for the kidney and urinary tract with minimal noise in the zzso Currently, clinical contrast agents are low molecular weight agents and can rapidly zzso from blood zzso leading to slow contrast agent elimination through kidney and consequently providing limited contrast enhancement in urinary zzso In this study, a new zzso zzso contrast agent, zzso was prepared by zzso zzso zzso on the surface of a generation 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso where the carrier had a precisely defined zzso that is far smaller than the zzso zzso zzso The in zzso contrast enhancement and dynamic imaging of the urinary tract of the agent was evaluated in nude mice using a low molecular weight agent zzso as a zzso The agent eliminated rapidly from blood circulation and accumulated more abundantly in urinary tract than zzso The fast elimination zzso is ideal for functional evaluation of the zzso The zzso of the zzso and urinary tract was better zzso by the zzso zzso contrast agent than zzso The agent also resulted in low liver contrast enhancement, indicating low zzso tissue zzso These features render the zzso zzso zzso a promising contrast agent for magnetic resonance zzso
