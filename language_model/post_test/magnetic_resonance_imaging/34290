Early identification of the potentially zzso zzso is critical for the determination of therapeutic intervention strategies in acute focal cerebral zzso This study zzso the zzso zzso from the core on the basis of the dynamics of zzso zzso This was tested in a rat model of focal cerebral zzso by infusion of zzso using zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso The authors detected essentially no enrichment of zzso with zzso from the infused zzso in the zzso zzso However, in zzso areas, zzso was incorporated into zzso which could point toward compromised but potentially viable zzso The zzso findings suggest that this combination of zzso infusion with the proposed magnetic resonance methods may aid in zzso the zzso from the core in cerebral zzso
