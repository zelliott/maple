The zzso zzso zzso of zzso humans is activated during various zzso zzso and cognitive tasks, but little is known about its modular zzso Using functional zzso we tested whether processing of auditory versus tactile and spatial versus zzso information was zzso in the OC of the early zzso No zzso OC zzso was zzso However, the right middle zzso zzso zzso showed a preference for spatial over zzso processing of both auditory and tactile zzso Furthermore, zzso activity was correlated with accuracy of individual sound zzso zzso In sighted controls, most of zzso zzso including the zzso was zzso during auditory and tactile conditions, but the right zzso was more activated during spatial than zzso visual zzso Thus, although the sensory zzso driving the zzso in the reorganized OC of blind individuals are altered, the functional specialization of zzso zzso is retained regardless of visual zzso
