zzso zzso is defined as zzso zzso in excess of that used for zzso zzso despite sufficient oxygen to completely metabolize zzso to carbon dioxide and zzso zzso zzso is present in the normal human brain at rest and increases locally during increased zzso zzso yet its many biological functions have received scant attention because of a prevailing zzso focus on the role of zzso as zzso for zzso zzso As an initial step in zzso this zzso we measured the regional distribution of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in 33 zzso normal young adults at zzso We show that the distribution of zzso zzso in the brain is zzso present in previously zzso functional zzso In particular, zzso zzso is significantly elevated in zzso and lateral zzso and prefrontal zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso have levels of zzso zzso significantly below the brain zzso The levels of zzso zzso are not strictly related to the levels of brain energy zzso For example, sensory zzso exhibit high zzso rates for zzso and oxygen consumption but low rates of zzso zzso These striking regional variations in zzso zzso in the normal human brain provide an opportunity to explore how brain systems zzso use the diverse cell biology of zzso in support of their functional zzso in health and zzso
