To investigate the effect of the zzso spectral modeling of fat on zzso values as measures of liver iron and on the zzso of liver fat zzso with biopsy as the reference zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were zzso Patients with liver disease zzso zzso 95; 50 men, 45 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent a zzso liver zzso and 97 biopsy samples were reviewed for zzso and iron zzso MR imaging at zzso T was performed zzso hours after biopsy by using a zzso three-dimensional zzso sequence for water and fat zzso Data were reconstructed zzso correcting for zzso and zzso zzso Fat fraction and zzso maps zzso were reconstructed and differences in zzso and zzso grades with and without zzso modeling of fat were tested by using the zzso zzso zzso rank correlation zzso was used to assess fat zzso and zzso zzso Linear zzso analysis was performed to compare the fat fraction for both zzso 

Mean zzso grade at biopsy ranged from zzso to zzso zzso specimens in 26 of 97 patients zzso showed liver iron (15 mild, six moderate, and five zzso In all 71 samples without iron, a strong increase in the apparent zzso was observed with increasing zzso grade when zzso modeling of fat was used zzso When zzso modeling was used, there were no differences in the apparent zzso as a function of zzso grading zzso and zzso values agreed closely with those reported in the zzso Good correlation between fat fraction and zzso grade was observed zzso both without and with spectral zzso 

In the presence of fat, zzso spectral modeling of fat improves the agreement between zzso and liver zzso zzso modeling of fat leads to zzso of liver zzso
