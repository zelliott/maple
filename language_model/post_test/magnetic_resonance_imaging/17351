The objectives of this study were zzso to test the utility of zzso count and zzso location as zzso of disease severity in patients with zzso sclerosis complex and zzso to examine the relationship between gene zzso zzso count, and zzso zzso We found that an increased zzso count per lobe and in total was associated with an increased risk of infantile spasms zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso count in the zzso lobe was associated with an increased risk of pervasive zzso disorder zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso count per lobe and in total was higher in those with poorly controlled zzso and those with zzso zzso however, these differences were not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso was associated with a significant increase in the zzso count per lobe and in total zzso zzso zzso In zzso increased zzso count is strongly associated with infantile spasms and a zzso gene zzso zzso control and zzso delay do not show the strong association with zzso count suggested by the earlier zzso
