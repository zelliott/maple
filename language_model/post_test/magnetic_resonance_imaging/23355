zzso noise both in terms of its magnitude and frequency during magnetic resonance imaging zzso scan is influenced by imaging parameters and pulse zzso It varies because of many different factors such as structure, materials, and magnetic field zzso The purpose of our study is to evaluate the characteristics of acoustic noise independent of zzso scan protocol by measuring a zzso transfer function zzso at various zzso zzso 

We measured sound pressure levels in the frequency domain in a zzso seven zzso and three zzso clinical zzso systems when applying a simple zzso zzso zzso zzso We calculated a zzso zzso in each zzso zzso zzso X, Y, and zzso by the zzso zzso 

zzso at a zzso range zzso zzso was larger than that at low frequency for all zzso zzso scanners except for a low zzso field zzso For high frequency zzso zzso the zzso zzso scanner had a larger zzso than that of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso MR scanner with a vacuum chamber reduced zzso at a lower frequency zzso zzso zzso but this effect decreased at higher zzso 

zzso analysis makes it possible to obtain more detailed information on acoustic noise properties among zzso zzso
