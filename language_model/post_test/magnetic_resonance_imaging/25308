Previous authors have shown that conventional zzso is superior to plain CT in the assessment of root zzso in the lateral zzso but this question has never been evaluated with respect to MR imaging of the zzso zzso Our purpose was to assess the accuracy of MR imaging, conventional zzso and zzso CT zzso zzso of the zzso level in identifying degenerative lateral recess root zzso with surgical zzso 

MR imaging, conventional zzso and CT zzso of the zzso level were assessed in the imaging of 58 lateral recesses at 38 zzso levels in 26 patients who underwent surgery for zzso with degenerative lateral recess zzso Each lateral recess was graded as normal, small without root zzso small with root zzso or severe root zzso 

MR imaging underestimated root zzso in zzso to zzso of the cases in which root zzso was surgically zzso Conventional zzso underestimated root zzso in only zzso to zzso of the cases and correctly predicted zzso in zzso to zzso CT zzso underestimated root zzso in 38% of the surgically confirmed zzso 

MR imaging significantly underestimated root zzso caused by degenerative changes in the lateral zzso Although MR imaging is a superb study when used in the search for degenerative disk disease and disk zzso conventional zzso is a crucial supplemental study that is necessary to confirm degenerative root zzso in the lateral recess as the cause of zzso
