Various cognitive theories aim to explain human zzso zzso zzso mental logic theories claim zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the mental model theory proposes cognitive processes of constructing and manipulating zzso organized mental models, and zzso imagery theories zzso that such abilities are based on visual mental zzso To explore the neural zzso of human zzso reasoning, we examined zzso zzso oxygen level zzso contrasts of twelve healthy participants during zzso and conditional reasoning with zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The results indicate that, in the absence of any correlated visual zzso reasoning activated an zzso network, including parts of the prefrontal zzso zzso area, BA, 6, 9) and the zzso zzso zzso zzso the superior and inferior zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the visual association zzso zzso zzso In the discussion, we first focus on the activated zzso zzso that is well known to be involved in spatial perception and spatial working zzso Second, we briefly relate the zzso in the prefrontal cortical areas and in the anterior zzso zzso to other imaging studies on higher cognitive zzso Finally, we draw some general conclusions and argue that zzso zzso and inspect zzso organized mental models to solve zzso zzso zzso
