At early zzso the diagnosis of local recurrence of zzso cancer is often difficult and magnetic resonance imaging zzso is currently considered the most accurate method for diagnosing zzso We evaluated the role of zzso and zzso zzso for the diagnosis of local recurrence of zzso zzso 

zzso patients, suspected of having a pelvic recurrence of zzso cancer, were evaluated by a high field strength zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences and zzso dynamic fast zzso zzso zzso recalled sequences were performed in all zzso The dynamic images were zzso with zzso zzso by plotting zzso zzso and calculating the percentage of signal increase at the end of the first zzso dynamic zzso The pelvic zzso were classified as zzso or not zzso by applying the following diagnostic criteria: zzso zzso and signal intensity of the zzso in zzso sequences and zzso percentage of enhancement in dynamic enhanced zzso Diagnosis was confirmed by zzso zzso needle biopsy (12 zzso surgery (four zzso clinical and imaging follow-up (20 zzso 

The diagnosis was local recurrence in 15 patients and zzso zzso in 21 zzso zzso zzso had zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso Analysis of the percentage of enhancement showed zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

In agreement with the literature, our results showed a high sensitivity and specificity for dynamic zzso This technique thus can be considered an important adjunct to zzso zzso especially in selected cases in which zzso zzso cannot rule out local zzso However, these results must be validated by further zzso
