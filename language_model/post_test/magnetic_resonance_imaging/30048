With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging zzso after knee injuries interest has zzso on the clinical relevance of different zzso zzso zzso Different zzso sequences reveal varying characteristics of such zzso Prospective data of 69 patients with zzso zzso zzso fractures or bone bruises according to the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso symptoms zzso and activity zzso were assessed at the time of first zzso and zzso months later including a follow-up zzso using T zzso fat saturated zzso zzso zzso T zzso spin echo zzso zzso zzso spin zzso zzso and T zzso zzso zzso The patients were divided in 4 groups: patients with zzso fracture and patients with pure bone zzso subdivided in patients with and without zzso knee zzso Bone bruises were diagnosed in 44 cases, zzso fractures in 25 zzso Patients without zzso pathology had significantly poorer function at the time of zzso with zzso fractures, but not in the zzso with zzso zzso zzso were not significantly different in both groups at this zzso At zzso months both zzso with fractures had a lower level of function compared to patients with bone bruises, activity score and symptoms showed poorer results in the group without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all zzso T zzso weighted spin echo zzso sequences revealed to be the most important tool to differentiate the various zzso zzso for a modification of rehabilitation avoiding zzso forces in case of zzso fractures might be the use of zzso using open kinetic chain instead of closed kinetic chain or zzso with relief of the affected zzso
