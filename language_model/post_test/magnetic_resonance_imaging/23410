Evidence from functional zzso studies on resting state suggests that there are two distinct zzso cortical systems that mediate conscious zzso an zzso system that encompasses lateral zzso areas and has been linked with processes of external input zzso zzso and an zzso system which encompasses mainly zzso brain areas and has been associated with internal processes zzso zzso The aim of our study was to explore the neural zzso of resting state by providing behavioral and zzso data from healthy zzso With no a zzso zzso we first determined zzso the relationship between external and internal awareness in 31 zzso We found a significant zzso between external and internal awareness with a mean switching frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, this frequency is similar to zzso zzso slow zzso We then evaluated 22 healthy volunteers in an zzso paradigm looking for brain areas where zzso activity correlated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cingulate, anterior zzso zzso and zzso areas zzso zzso was zzso linked to intensity of internal zzso whereas zzso of lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with intensity of external zzso
