We hypothesized that distinct cognitive processes underlying oral and written picture naming depend on intact function of different, but zzso regions of the left zzso cortex, such that the distribution of tissue dysfunction in various areas can predict the component of the naming process that is zzso To test this hypothesis, we evaluated 116 individuals within 24 h of acute zzso stroke using a battery of oral and written naming and other zzso tests, and with magnetic resonance diffusion and zzso imaging to identify the areas of tissue zzso zzso function analysis, using the degree of zzso in various zzso zzso 22 (including zzso zzso BA 44 zzso of zzso zzso BA 45 zzso of zzso zzso BA 21 zzso zzso zzso BA 37 zzso inferior zzso zzso BA 38 zzso zzso zzso and BA 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso classified patients on the basis of the primary component of the naming process that was impaired zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso access, zzso word form, zzso word form and motor speech by the pattern of performance and types of errors across zzso zzso Additionally, linear zzso analysis demonstrated that the areas contributing the most information to the identification of patients with particular levels of impairment in the naming process were largely consistent with evidence for the roles of these regions from functional zzso This study provides evidence that the level of impairment in the naming process reflects the distribution of tissue dysfunction in particular regions of the left zzso inferior and zzso zzso zzso cortex, zzso inferior frontal and inferior zzso zzso While zzso zzso is also critical for picture naming, it is likely that bilateral zzso damage is necessary to disrupt visual zzso These findings provide new evidence that a network of brain regions supports naming, but separate components of this network are zzso required for distinct cognitive processes or representations underlying the complex task of naming zzso
