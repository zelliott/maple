A potent zzso zzso fulfilling the requirements for the development of zzso contrast agents or zzso zzso was armed with zzso zzso We then implemented a click methodology to graft the zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso retained the zzso binding capacity for zzso or zzso zzso as evidenced by the number of bound water molecules to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes were shown to double the brightness of the zzso fluorescent signal compared to its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso would enable the fluorescent signal of labeled zzso to be zzso
