zzso combined zzso is an acquired zzso caused by vitamin B12 zzso zzso with B12 leads to improvement in most but to complete recovery in only a few zzso zzso indicators in zzso combined zzso are zzso therefore, predicting complete recovery of zzso deficits is zzso 

To identify potential zzso of outcome and to generate hypotheses concerning zzso of complete resolution of zzso deficits in zzso combined zzso 

We searched zzso zzso to October 2005), zzso zzso to October 2005), and references from identified zzso zzso zzso Reports of patients with zzso combined zzso containing results of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and description of outcome and 1 patient treated by the zzso 

We extracted data from 45 reports and 57 patients zzso zzso 21 zzso age zzso 10 to zzso with a diagnosis of zzso combined zzso and estimated the strength of association between clinical, laboratory, and zzso factors and complete resolution of signs and zzso 

Eight patients zzso achieved clinical resolution and 49 zzso improved with B12 zzso The absence of sensory zzso deficit, zzso and zzso signs were associated with a higher complete resolution zzso Patients with zzso zzso in zzso or zzso 7 segments and age less than 50 also appear to have higher rates of complete zzso 

B12 therapy is reported to stop progression and improve zzso deficits in most patients with zzso combined zzso However, complete resolution only occurs in a small percentage of patients and appears to be associated with factors suggestive of less severe disease at the time of zzso
