The length of the cervical zzso in healthy volunteers was measured in the zzso and erect position using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

To assess the relationship between the length of the cervical zzso and cervical posture in healthy zzso 

A number of detailed descriptions of the normal zzso features of the cervical zzso have been zzso However, to our knowledge, there is no report to compare the relationship between the length of the cervical zzso and cervical posture in healthy volunteers using zzso zzso 

This study was performed on 20 healthy volunteers using zzso zzso The subjects were studied in the zzso and erect zzso The recumbent series consisted of 3 zzso neutral, zzso and zzso The erect series consisted of 3 zzso neutral, zzso and zzso On the zzso image, the length of the cervical zzso from C1 to zzso was measured at the zzso middle, and zzso zzso The angle of the zzso of C2 and zzso was zzso The results were compared with each zzso 

In the recumbent and erect series, the mean length of the cervical zzso in zzso was longer than in neutral and extension at the zzso middle, and zzso zzso There were significant differences between the length of the cervical zzso in zzso neutral, and zzso The mean length of the cervical zzso in extension was shorter than in neutral and zzso at the zzso middle, and zzso zzso There were significant differences between length of the cervical zzso in extension, neutral, and zzso 

We found zzso differences of the length of the cervical zzso in the recumbent and erect zzso These results may be important when assessing the dynamic factor in cervical zzso zzso
