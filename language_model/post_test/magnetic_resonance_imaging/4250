To investigate the possible occurrence of zzso in the zzso in patients with zzso necrosis of the zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients with zzso zzso head necrosis were assessed by zzso and zzso for the presence of zzso zzso Three criteria were established to differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and irregular contours of the zzso zzso typical zzso lines of zzso zzso deficient zzso of intravenous zzso in the affected zzso 

In four patients zzso confirmation of zzso necrosis was zzso The MR analysis of 22 zzso zzso of those zzso showed changes which suggested zzso No zzso zzso were demonstrated in the zzso bone of any zzso Two cases of zzso necrosis were found without an zzso zzso head zzso In two patients of the 14 who had undergone total hip replacement following necrosis of the zzso head, zzso loosening of the zzso component was zzso 

The study suggests that zzso necrosis may be an accompaniment to zzso necrosis of the zzso zzso Further work is required to assess its importance in premature loosening of the zzso element of total hip zzso
