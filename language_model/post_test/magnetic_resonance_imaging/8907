Recent brain imaging studies indicate that empathy for pain relies upon both the affective and/or the zzso zzso of the pain zzso and zzso neural responses are modulated by stimulus reality, personal experience, and affective link with zzso The current work investigated whether and how zzso neural responses are modulated by emotional contexts in which painful zzso are zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we first showed that zzso a painful stimulation zzso zzso applied to a face with neutral expression induced zzso in the anterior zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso stimulation zzso zzso However, when observation of the painful stimuli delivered to a neutral face was zzso with observation of painful or happy faces, the zzso activity decreased while the activity in the face area of the secondary zzso zzso increased to the painful zzso Moreover, the secondary zzso activity associated with the painful stimulation decreased when the painful stimulation was applied to faces with happy and painful zzso The findings suggest that observing painful stimuli in an emotional context zzso affective responses but increases sensory responses to perceived pain and implies possible interactions between the affective and sensory components of the pain zzso during empathy for zzso
