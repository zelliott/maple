We analyze a series of patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso associated with zzso sclerosis zzso submitted to zzso investigation with scalp zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and, when necessary, with depth zzso zzso We sought to evaluate the clinical utility of zzso in patients with zzso 

We included patients who had phase I investigation with zzso independent seizures, zzso zzso zzso or zzso onset initiating in the side zzso to the side of zzso zzso Patients whose implanted zzso failed to demonstrate an zzso unilateral zzso onset were later evaluated with depth zzso zzso 

Between May 1994 and December 2004, 64 patients met our inclusion criteria: 33 female zzso and 31 male subjects zzso The mean age at enrollment was zzso years zzso zzso zzso The groups with zzso surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had a greater chance of zzso with zzso when compared with the group with bilateral independent zzso on surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso in zzso of zzso zzso percent of patients became seizure free after zzso zzso Five patients were implanted with depth zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso confirmed the results of zzso zzso monitoring in all patients, and the surgery was zzso 

In zzso zzso is a reliable method for zzso of zzso that are not clearly recorded by surface zzso
