zzso of the zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso is thought to be a key driver of tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso is an oral inhibitor of zzso complex 1 zzso with zzso activity in a variety of zzso 

We conducted a zzso zzso zzso zzso phase II study to estimate the response rate to zzso in zzso type 2 zzso patients with progressive zzso zzso zzso Ten eligible patients were zzso including 2 pediatric zzso zzso was administered at a daily dose of 10 zzso zzso or 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso orally in continuous zzso courses, for up to 12 zzso Response was assessed every 3 months with zzso using zzso zzso tumor analysis, and zzso Nine patients were zzso for the primary response, defined as zzso decrease in VS zzso Hearing response was zzso as a secondary zzso in 8 zzso 

None of the 9 patients with zzso disease experienced a clinical or zzso zzso No objective imaging or hearing responses were observed in stage 1 of the trial, and the study was closed according to zzso stopping zzso 

zzso is ineffective for the treatment of progressive VS in zzso zzso We are currently conducting a zzso zzso zzso study of zzso in zzso VS patients to zzso the biological basis for apparent treatment resistance to zzso zzso in these zzso
