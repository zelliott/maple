To assess the effect of zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso construct zzso on zzso zzso healing as determined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and clinical outcome of zzso rotator cuff zzso 

A comparative series of patients undergoing zzso rotator cuff repair was zzso Two matched groups of patients (20 each) were zzso rotator cuff repairs without zzso zzso zzso 1) and rotator cuff repairs zzso with 2 zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso cuff repair to the normal footprint without tension or zzso vents was performed by a single zzso zzso rehabilitation was held zzso zzso zzso scans were used to evaluate rotator cuff zzso zzso measures included American zzso and zzso Surgeons, Rowe, Single Assessment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We followed up 40 patients (2 matched groups with 20 patients each) with a mean age of 57 years zzso 44 to 69 zzso for a mean of 31 months zzso 24 to 44 zzso zzso zzso studies showed persistent zzso zzso defects in zzso of controls (12 of zzso and zzso of zzso repairs (6 of zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the control group tears measuring less than 3 zzso in zzso zzso 50% (7 of zzso healed fully, whereas zzso of the zzso group tears measuring less than 3 zzso in zzso length (12 of zzso healed fully zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 in terms of American zzso and zzso Surgeons zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso Single Assessment zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso Test zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The Rowe scores zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso were statistically zzso 

The addition of 2 zzso zzso zzso into a primary rotator cuff zzso repair resulted in lower zzso rates identified on zzso than repairs without the zzso Other than the Rowe scores, there was no zzso clinical difference by use of standard outcome zzso
