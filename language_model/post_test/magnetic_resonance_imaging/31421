To zzso evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the detection of zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso with zzso analysis as the reference zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were zzso From July 2005 to May 2006, 113 patients zzso men, 22 zzso age range, zzso years; mean age, 61 zzso with zzso cell lung cancer underwent zzso zzso MR imaging followed by surgery or zzso The zzso zzso ratios zzso of signal intensity and zzso zzso characteristics (such as eccentric cortical zzso or obliteration of the fatty zzso were assessed on zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter was assessed on zzso three-dimensional fast zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic and zzso zzso zzso analyses were used for statistical zzso 

The zzso value zzso zzso zzso proved to be most appropriate zzso under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the detection of a zzso zzso Of the various parameters zzso zzso characteristics appeared to be the most significant zzso zzso zzso parameters for depicting a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso was zzso and diagnostic sensitivity, zzso and accuracy were zzso zzso of 74 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso details of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso fast zzso MR images are significant for detection of zzso or zzso zzso zzso at zzso MR zzso
