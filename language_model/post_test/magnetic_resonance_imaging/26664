zzso the zzso of zzso surrounding zzso zzso is essential for normal brain zzso The development of the zzso sheath enables rapid synchronized communication across the neural systems responsible for higher order cognitive zzso Despite this critical role, quantitative zzso of zzso in zzso is not possible with current zzso techniques including diffusion zzso and structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso Although these techniques offer insight into structural zzso they reflect several different zzso of development, zzso changes in zzso size, density, zzso and membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and water zzso zzso observed signal changes are zzso hindering meaningful zzso between imaging findings and metrics of learning, behavior or zzso Here we present the first quantitative study of zzso in healthy human zzso from 3 to 11 months of zzso Using a new zzso zzso technique, we report a zzso pattern beginning in the zzso zzso and internal zzso proceeding zzso from the zzso of the corpus zzso and zzso zzso (at zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso (at 4-6 zzso and then to the zzso of the corpus zzso and frontal and zzso zzso (at zzso zzso Our results also offer preliminary evidence of zzso zzso rate zzso This work represents a significant step forward in our ability to appreciate the fundamental process of zzso and provides the first ever in zzso zzso of zzso maturation in healthy human zzso
