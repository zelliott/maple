We present the results of a direct comparison of zzso zzso using identical tasks for both functional PET and zzso zzso zzso We examined the most commonly employed methods for each zzso For zzso this is the blood zzso zzso zzso contrast method with zzso zzso In PET zzso zzso studies are based on the development of high sensitivity zzso imaging of regional cerebral blood flow from multiple zzso zzso The identical zzso paradigm of a visually cued sequential finger opposition was used for PET and zzso For both zzso the entire brain volume difference images were smoothed to the same final resolution and the peak zzso value within the primary zzso zzso area was then zzso All zzso zzso in the zzso above a predetermined threshold of statistical significance were zzso Finally, the zzso zzso location was calculated for the zzso region for each zzso These studies showed a very similar pattern of zzso with the volume of zzso greater in zzso and higher levels of statistical zzso The zzso of zzso however, differed by 9 zzso 3 zzso between the zzso with the zzso zzso location zzso to that for zzso These results were stable across all processing options including differing levels of image smoothing and thresholds of statistical zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that draining veins contribute a substantial signal for zzso zzso studies and indicate caution for the interpretation of zzso zzso images with zzso sites near draining zzso
