zzso is a rare cerebral tumor that has only recently been classified as a separate zzso entity, even though it remains closely related to zzso in terms of both its clinical and therapeutic zzso The onset of this tumor during childhood is particularly zzso 

The authors describe three cases of zzso in three patients of 13, 15, and 16 years old, in an attempt to identify any distinctive aspects of the zzso zzso On the basis of their personal experience and in the light of the available literature, the authors review the salient features of this pathological condition in young patients to identify any distinctive aspects as well as to define the significance of the extent of the zzso component and of a zzso appearance of the zzso in terms of zzso 

In particular, they emphasize how modern zzso protocols make it possible to achieve a massive zzso of the zzso in absolute safety in many cases, while avoiding further deficits in others, thus ensuring not only significant survival times but also a good quality of zzso
