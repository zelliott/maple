Childhood zzso has been shown to significantly elevate the risk of psychiatric zzso Previous zzso studies of children exposed to zzso have reported zzso neural structure in several regions, including the prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso These studies have exclusively investigated zzso differences rather than focusing on genetically and zzso distinct zzso of brain zzso 

Here we used zzso methods to examine cortical zzso surface area, and local zzso in a community sample of children with documented experiences of abuse zzso zzso zzso and a group of carefully matched zzso peers zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cortical thickness in the zzso compared with the zzso group was observed in an extended cluster that incorporated the anterior cingulate, superior frontal zzso and zzso zzso In addition, reduced cortical surface area was observed within the zzso regions of the left middle zzso area and zzso zzso Local zzso deficits within the zzso group were located within two zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso extending into zzso zzso 

This is the first time structural abnormalities in the anterior zzso and zzso zzso have been detected in children exposed to zzso zzso methods seem to capture zzso previously zzso zzso abnormalities associated with zzso We suggest that these approaches detect zzso precursors of brain volume differences seen in adults with histories of zzso Because the reported regions are implicated in several clinical disorders, they might constitute biological markers of vulnerability, linking exposure to early adversity and psychiatric zzso
