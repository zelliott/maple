In this paper, magnetic resonance imaging zzso is investigated for monitoring small and large zzso created by high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso in freshly excised lamb brain and in rabbit brain in zzso A zzso zzso focused zzso of 5 zzso diameter, focusing at 10 zzso and operating at 1 zzso was zzso A zzso zzso positioning device that is used to navigate the zzso is zzso The effects of zzso were investigated using zzso and zzso fast spin echo zzso and zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso and zzso show better anatomical details within the brain than zzso zzso but with zzso zzso the contrast between zzso and brain is higher for both zzso and bubbly zzso The best contrast between zzso and brain with zzso zzso is obtained with zzso above 500 zzso whereas with zzso zzso the best contrast is observed between 40 and 60 zzso The maximum contrast to noise ratio zzso measured with zzso zzso was approximately zzso With zzso zzso the corresponding zzso was approximately zzso With this system, we were able to create large zzso (by producing overlapping zzso and it was possible to monitor these zzso with zzso with excellent zzso The length of the zzso in zzso brain was much higher than the length in zzso indicating that the penetration in the in zzso brain is zzso possibly by reflection due to trapped bubbles in the blood zzso This paper demonstrates that zzso has the potential to treat brain tumors in zzso This could be done either using a zzso zzso with a frequency around 1 zzso or using a zzso zzso
