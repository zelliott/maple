zzso zzso has mainly been used for detection of acute zzso and for distinction of zzso and zzso zzso We applied diffusion zzso in patients with zzso sclerosis in order to evaluate diffusion imaging characteristics of zzso zzso Five children with known zzso sclerosis were included in this zzso The zzso examinations were performed on a zzso MR zzso zzso zzso was obtained using the zzso imaging zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso values from the abnormal brain zzso were calculated directly from automatically generated zzso zzso Seven normal children were available for zzso In this control group the mean zzso value of the normal white matter was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso sclerosis patients the mean zzso value of the white matter zzso ( zzso was apparently high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with that of normal white zzso The zzso value of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso value within a giant cell tumor was zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to that of normal cerebral white zzso The zzso maps were superior to zzso zzso zzso zzso images with respect to zzso zzso and they provided mathematical information on tissue zzso With respect to detection of the exact numbers and sizes of the zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery images were superior to zzso zzso It is believed that diffusion zzso can be useful in evaluation of various zzso changes associated with zzso zzso Further studies on zzso zzso and on various brain zzso would provide increasing data on this relatively new zzso zzso
