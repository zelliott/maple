To determine whether or not acupuncture of zzso zzso zzso produces a significant response of the visual zzso zzso by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

This study investigates the zzso of the visual zzso zzso by a soft and an intensified stimulation of zzso 37, an zzso documented to influence zzso zzso Three different zzso were carried out to detect any possible zzso of the Blood zzso Level zzso zzso in the visual zzso to visual stimulation through zzso 

The percentage signal changes in the visual stimulation cycles did not significantly differ before zzso during zzso 

Whereas no zzso zzso with acupuncture was detected in the visual cortex, zzso in response to needle twisting were detected in different cortical zzso Further studies are necessary to clarify whether these clusters correlate to inevitable zzso stimulation accompanying acupuncture or represent an zzso zzso
