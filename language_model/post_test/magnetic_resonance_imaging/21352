The aims of this study were to compare in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso characteristics of zzso skin cancer assessed by a zzso zzso zzso with zzso and to describe zzso features of skin zzso 

This prospective study included 30 skin tumors treated by zzso MR images of skin samples were acquired on a zzso MR scanner using a fast zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso index and margins of the zzso were zzso The presence or absence of the following was noted: healthy margins, zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso superficial and deep zzso involvement, subcutaneous involvement, superficial and zzso zzso MR results were compared to zzso 

zzso correlation zzso zzso was very good for the evaluation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso index zzso zzso zzso The zzso was good for the evaluation of the margins zzso zzso zzso but for zzso zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso Mean bias between zzso and zzso was inferior to 1 zzso for zzso zzso index and zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso of zzso skin cancer allows zzso of zzso with good correlation with zzso After in zzso confirmation it could have a diagnostic role regarding the zzso of surgical margins but its actual limitations prevent its practical adoption at this zzso
