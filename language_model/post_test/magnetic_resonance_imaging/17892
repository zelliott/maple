Higher rates of substance use and dependence have been observed in the offspring of mothers who smoked during zzso Animal studies indicate that prenatal exposure to nicotine alters the development of brain areas related to reward processing, which might be a risk factor for substance use and addiction later in zzso However, no study has examined the effect of maternal smoking on the zzso brain response during reward zzso 

To determine whether adolescents with prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking differ from their zzso peers in the response of the zzso zzso to the anticipation or the zzso of a zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso 

Data were obtained from the zzso zzso a European zzso study of zzso reinforcement sensitivity, and emotional zzso in zzso The zzso sample consists of zzso healthy adolescents (age range, zzso zzso recruited from March 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011, in local zzso 

We assessed an zzso zzso of 177 adolescents with prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking and 177 zzso peers (age range, zzso zzso matched by sex, maternal educational level, and imaging zzso 

Response to reward in the zzso zzso measured with functional magnetic resonance zzso 

In zzso exposed zzso we observed a weaker response in the zzso zzso during reward anticipation zzso side, zzso zzso right side, zzso zzso compared with their zzso zzso No differences were found regarding the zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso of a reward zzso side, zzso zzso right side, zzso zzso 

The weaker zzso of the zzso zzso to reward anticipation in zzso exposed adolescents may represent a risk factor for substance use and development of addiction later in zzso This result highlights the need for education and preventive measures to reduce smoking during zzso Future analyses should assess whether zzso exposed adolescents develop an increased risk for substance use and addiction and which role the reported zzso differences during reward anticipation plays in this zzso
