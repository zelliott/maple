The purpose of this study was to develop a technique for zzso zzso of the ankle to evaluate zzso of the zzso zzso A special device was used to perform zzso passive positioning of the ankle from zzso to zzso positions for the zzso zzso zzso A fast zzso zzso acquisition in the steady state pulse sequence was used to obtain zzso images to assess the zzso zzso during different positions of the zzso Seven zzso volunteers and five patients with suspected zzso zzso zzso were zzso There was no zzso displacement of the zzso zzso observed in the zzso subjects nor in two of the zzso Two patients had zzso zzso zzso observed on the zzso zzso studies, and one patient had the zzso zzso maintained in a displaced position in all ankle zzso The preliminary results suggest that zzso zzso of the ankle is a potentially useful technique to facilitate evaluation of patients with suspected zzso of the zzso zzso particularly in instances in which zzso is zzso and spontaneous reduction of the zzso may zzso
