The zzso characteristics of zzso gels prepared with zzso zzso solution have been zzso The response mechanism is an increase in the zzso zzso relaxation rate of zzso caused by zzso zzso It has been observed that: zzso oxygen zzso assures consistent and maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso in the range zzso have no effect upon zzso zzso the initial G value is 150 zzso zzso for gels containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increasing zzso zzso only causes a moderate increase in zzso zzso the gel zzso are dose rate independent in the range zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity is pH dependent, being zero at pH 7; zzso freshly prepared gels are slightly more sensitive than those more than 24 h old; and zzso the diffusion zzso for zzso zzso in a zzso zzso gel containing zzso M zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and this will require consideration for the zzso imaging of dose zzso
