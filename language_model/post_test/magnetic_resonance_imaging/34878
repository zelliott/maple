zzso invasive treatments for benign zzso zzso zzso are currently very zzso zzso laser zzso zzso of the prostate is the technique most frequently zzso The objective of this study was to assess the correlation between the zzso effects observed and the changes visible on magnetic resonance imaging during this type or treatment in the human zzso in order to evaluate the tissue effects obtained according to the power and the interaction time zzso In 10 patients requiring radical zzso for zzso cancer, visual laser zzso of the prostate zzso was performed during the 10 days preceding the radical operation zzso 1 to 9 zzso The entire zzso was submitted to pathological examination in order to correlate the zzso result with contrast magnetic resonance imaging performed in 6 patients, using a standard zzso zzso 12 to 24 hours before complete zzso of the zzso The zzso examination showed zones of zzso necrosis of variable volume, accompanied by extensive peripheral zzso containing vessels with a partially obliterated zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso showed that zzso zzso had a low density appearance and were perfectly demarcated with peripheral zzso and zzso zzso In contrast with the experimental investigations performed to date, we demonstrated a clearly delayed tissue zzso Our experience demonstrates that a period of several hours between laser treatment and removal of the operative zzso is not sufficient to evaluate the extent of zzso zzso High resolution magnetic resonance imaging with a standard zzso zzso sometimes combined with a multiple zzso is very valuable to assess the effects of zzso
