The purpose of our study was to compare the value of MR imaging with CT in the diagnosis of zzso zzso in the zzso and chronic stages zzso 3 days after the zzso zzso 

We performed 42 MR examinations using a zzso unit in 37 patients with zzso zzso caused by a zzso zzso zzso were done zzso days after the zzso We obtained 40 zzso 11 zzso zzso 15 zzso and 28 moderately zzso zzso CT was also performed in all patients within 24 zzso of the MR zzso Confirmation of the presence of zzso zzso at the time of the MR examination was made by zzso examination using zzso puncture or surgical zzso 

In the zzso and chronic zzso zzso zzso was seen as an area of high signal intensity on zzso zzso zzso zzso and moderately zzso MR images in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of cases, zzso On CT scans, zzso zzso was seen as an area of high zzso in only zzso of zzso Especially in the chronic stage, zzso zzso was seen as an area of high signal intensity more frequently by MR imaging than by CT zzso on zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso on moderately zzso zzso and zzso on CT zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by MR imaging until a maximum of 39 days after the zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by CT until a maximum of 17 days after the zzso 

Our findings show that MR imaging is superior to CT for the diagnosis of zzso and chronic zzso zzso MR imaging is especially useful for the diagnosis of chronic zzso zzso
