This study evaluated the effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso MR imaging of complex zzso masses of the brain compared with that of conventional zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our hypothesis is that zzso MR images provide better characterization of these masses and facilitate more appropriate zzso diagnoses and zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso MR images and specimens for zzso examination were obtained in seven consecutive patients, zzso years old, with zzso mass zzso of the brain and zzso symptoms and signs directly related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained in six patients, surgical exploration was done in five patients, and zzso biopsy was done in zzso After examination of the routine zzso and zzso images, the usefulness of zzso images was determined by how well they facilitated correct zzso zzso 

On zzso MR images, the solid or zzso components of a zzso mass had extremely low signals in contrast to the high signal of surrounding zzso On routine zzso images, however, the signals of these components were masked by the signal of the surrounding zzso zzso MR images helped markedly in diagnosis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In cases of enhancing brain tumors, zzso MR images provided the same information that zzso images zzso Overall, when zzso MR imaging was used, more information about the texture and constituents of the zzso mass was zzso and a more useful diagnosis was zzso 

zzso results show that zzso MR imaging is a more useful technique than conventional zzso imaging for characterizing complex zzso masses of the zzso zzso MR imaging zzso allows distinction of zzso from zzso zzso helps establish where biopsy has the best chance of providing tissue that will show zzso changes, and zzso helps distinguish simple zzso from tumors, zzso or zzso zzso and may be particularly helpful in detecting the contents of zzso zzso
