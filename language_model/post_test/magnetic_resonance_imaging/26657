Regional and global relationships of lung function and structure were studied using zzso zzso zzso in a rat zzso model of zzso zzso zzso 4) and healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso ventilation zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso of zzso were measured at a zzso zzso resolution in zzso middle, and zzso slices 6 zzso after model zzso Pulmonary function testing zzso was performed before zzso to yield forced zzso volume in 50 zzso zzso airway resistance zzso and dynamic compliance zzso zzso threshold values of ventilation and zzso zzso and zzso were zzso corresponding to zzso population of zzso falling above or below each threshold value, zzso For correlation analysis, zzso was compared with zzso residual capacity zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso was compared with zzso total lung capacity zzso and zzso Regional correlation of r and zzso was evaluated by dividing each of the three lung slices into four zzso zzso was significantly larger in zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference of zzso and zzso was insignificant between the two zzso The zzso of healthy rats was significantly larger than the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso was significantly smaller in healthy animals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No systematic difference in these quantities was observed between the three lung zzso A significant zzso increase in zzso and a significant zzso decline in zzso for zzso rats was observed compared with a significant 51% increase in zzso and a zzso zzso decline in zzso zzso of imaging and zzso metrics revealed that r and zzso divide the rats into two separate clusters in the sample zzso
