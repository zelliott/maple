The size and shape of the corpus zzso were assessed on zzso section magnetic resonance images in 27 patients with zzso 13 patients with zzso personality disorder zzso and 30 healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired and zzso so that the zzso plane passed through the anterior and zzso zzso and was parallel to the zzso zzso The corpus zzso and the whole brain were traced on zzso section slices of each brain, and the zzso was divided into 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses were used to assess zzso shape zzso zzso of the corpus zzso was smaller zzso in the zzso of the corpus zzso and zzso in the zzso in schizophrenic patients than in normal zzso The zzso of the corpus zzso was larger in zzso patients than in schizophrenic patients or normal zzso The zzso corpus zzso was largest in normal controls, smaller in zzso patients, and smallest in schizophrenic zzso Shape analysis was consistent with these size zzso and suggested a downward bowing of the corpus zzso in schizophrenic and zzso zzso zzso patients also had a region of the zzso just zzso to the zzso that was zzso than in the other two zzso The decreases in corpus zzso size in schizophrenia varied directly with length of illness, perhaps indicative of a progressive zzso The zzso differences in zzso size and shape are consistent with a hypothesis of decreased connectivity between the left and the right zzso in schizophrenia and zzso
