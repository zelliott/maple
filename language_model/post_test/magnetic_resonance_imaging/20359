To aid the development of symptomatic and disease zzso therapies in Parkinson's disease zzso there is a strong need to identify zzso measures of zzso zzso zzso function that are sensitive to disease zzso This study examines the relation between blood zzso zzso zzso zzso in every nucleus of the zzso and zzso disease severity in early stage de zzso zzso zzso zzso measured at 3 T was compared between 20 early stage de zzso zzso patients and 20 controls during an established precision grip force zzso In addition to the zzso zzso zzso in specific zzso and cortical regions was zzso There were three novel zzso First, there were significant negative correlations between total motor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in bilateral zzso bilateral zzso zzso external segment of the zzso zzso bilateral zzso nucleus, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Second, zzso was the symptom that most consistently predicted zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso Also, zzso zzso in the zzso internal zzso zzso was related to zzso Third, the reduced cortical activity in primary motor zzso and supplementary motor area in de zzso zzso did not relate to motor zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso activity in zzso of the zzso relates most consistently to zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging has strong potential to serve as a zzso marker for the state of zzso function in de zzso zzso
