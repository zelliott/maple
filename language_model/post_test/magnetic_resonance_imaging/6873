The zzso zzso Working Group, consisting of representatives from the zzso Oncology Group zzso zzso Physics Center zzso American zzso Society zzso American College of zzso zzso American College of zzso Imaging Network zzso American Association of Physicists in Medicine zzso zzso zzso Oncology Group zzso and American Society for zzso zzso and Oncology zzso proposed guidelines for zzso zzso for cervical zzso This report was based on their zzso clinical experience and a review of the zzso It reflects only the personal opinions of the authors and is not meant to be an endorsement from any of the above zzso
