The measurement of the zzso of zzso flow in tissue in zzso is complicated by the presence of stationary as well as moving spins and by a variety of zzso phenomena which affect signal zzso This paper describes a technique by which, using zzso zzso sequences with a set of very long TE times, the zzso of the moving component can be zzso
