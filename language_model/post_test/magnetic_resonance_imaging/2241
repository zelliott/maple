We consider operative survival as the primary objective in acute type A dissection and believe that virtually all native zzso valves can be zzso We sought to answer the question: zzso glue repair improve the long-term stability of zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso studied 64 patients with an acute type A zzso an ascending zzso zzso and zzso zzso operated on by the same surgeon between 1988 and zzso Three had zzso syndrome and 2 had a zzso zzso The valves in all patients without zzso syndrome were repaired with zzso zzso The valve and root were zzso by zzso Some patients underwent nuclear magnetic resonance zzso 

There were four hospital zzso and three late zzso zzso root zzso was required in 2 of the 60 survivors zzso and operation on the zzso zzso in zzso Root zzso were required within 3 zzso The remaining zzso repairs remained zzso 

The native zzso valve can be zzso in most patients, and glue repair is zzso zzso root repair is associated with a low operative zzso
