zzso dysfunction of varying degrees is common in patients with zzso B zzso zzso zzso without overt zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso mechanisms underlying these zzso are not well zzso We sought to identify changes in the neural activity of patients with zzso without zzso in the resting state by using the zzso of zzso fluctuation zzso method and to determine whether these changes were related to impaired zzso zzso functional zzso data from 30 patients with zzso and 30 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and years of education were compared to determine any differences in the zzso between the two zzso zzso was measured with the zzso zzso zzso score zzso and the relationship between these scores and zzso variation was zzso Compared with controls, patients showed widespread lower standardized zzso zzso values in visual association areas zzso zzso zzso middle zzso zzso and left inferior zzso zzso zzso areas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso and the default mode network zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso Higher zzso values were found in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso In patients, zzso values were significantly positive correlated with the zzso in the right middle zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso Our findings of zzso abnormalities in patients with zzso without zzso suggest that zzso dysfunction in patients with zzso without zzso may be caused by abnormal neural activity in multiple brain zzso
