To explore the neural zzso of the zzso by using zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging and to investigate whether zzso zzso networks zzso are disrupted in patients with mild traumatic brain injury zzso 

This zzso study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from 24 patients with zzso and 17 healthy control zzso The patients had varying degrees of symptoms, with a mean disease duration of 22 zzso The zzso functional MR imaging data were analyzed by using a standard zzso zzso correlation method to characterize zzso zzso Student zzso tests were used to perform zzso The association between zzso zzso and performance on zzso and zzso measures was also investigated in patients with zzso by using zzso rank zzso 

A normal pattern of zzso zzso was demonstrated in healthy zzso This pattern was characterized as representing relatively zzso and restrictive functional zzso zzso suggesting an zzso property of the zzso zzso during the resting zzso This pattern was zzso with significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased symmetry zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso compared with healthy control zzso Increased functional zzso zzso connectivity was correlated with diminished zzso functions and clinical symptoms in patients with zzso 

These findings of abnormal zzso zzso lend further support to the presumed subtle zzso injury in patients with zzso zzso functional MR imaging can be used as an additional imaging zzso for detection of zzso connectivity abnormalities and for better understanding of the complex persistent zzso zzso
