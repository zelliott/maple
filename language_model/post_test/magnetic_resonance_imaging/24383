zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso tears zzso have been reported to be associated with zzso zzso zzso However, no study has examined the association between anatomical zzso variables of the hip joint and zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso variables of the zzso 

zzso out of zzso hip zzso records met the inclusion zzso Two independent blinded investigators evaluated the location of zzso zzso tears zzso zzso at the zzso junction of the zzso zzso zzso neck zzso angle, zzso neck zzso angle, zzso zzso angle, alpha angle, lateral central edge angle zzso zzso index, and zzso zzso zzso analyses between groups were zzso 

Twenty-two patients had no zzso zzso 19 patients had zzso and 35 patients had zzso not isolated at the 3 o'clock position zzso with zzso zzso zzso and 10 with zzso zzso zzso The alpha angle mean was significantly higher zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso mean was significantly higher zzso in zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no statistically significant difference in any of the zzso variables between the controls and the zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrated that zzso are zzso distinct and not associated with zzso or other zzso zzso This supports the previous studies, which proposed that zzso are associated with zzso
