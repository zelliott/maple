The blood of the zzso head is thought to be supplied by vessels originating from the zzso and lateral zzso zzso arteries and via the zzso cavity of the zzso zzso it is difficult to induce zzso of the zzso head when the zzso cavity of the neck is zzso In the present study, we established a new model of zzso head necrosis by zzso the hip joint and zzso the zzso and lateral zzso zzso arteries and zzso zzso of zzso head blood flow revealed that a marked decrease to zzso of the control value was achieved by both hip dislocation and zzso of blood zzso zzso examination showed no necrosis with either dislocation or zzso alone, whereas at 2 and 4 weeks zzso of the animals subjected to both procedures showed widespread zzso These zzso findings considered in the light of results of the blood flow zzso suggest that a decrease in zzso head blood flow below zzso of the control value is needed to cause zzso In addition, magnetic resonance images zzso of the model were evaluated in the combined dislocation and zzso group at 4 weeks zzso zzso zzso Changes on zzso were seen in 3 of 5 zzso The zzso changes of the zzso head are thought to be zzso on zzso within 4 weeks after zzso without zzso
