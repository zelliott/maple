Although many zzso magnetic resonance zzso studies have assessed the relative ratios of brain zzso from patients with zzso absolute zzso is zzso The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of these 2 methods in zzso magnetic resonance zzso in discriminating Alzheimer's disease zzso and zzso disease zzso from healthy controls zzso 

The subjects were 30 zzso patients, 13 BD patients and 26 HC zzso zzso zzso MR zzso at short echo times were acquired from 8 volumes of zzso 

At zzso zzso the absolute zzso concentration in the zzso was the most sensitive measure to discriminate zzso from zzso and the absolute zzso concentration in the anterior zzso and deep white matter to differentiate BD from HC and zzso No relative ratio using zzso as a reference had a sensitivity over zzso at zzso zzso The cause of disparities between the 2 methods was attributed to fluctuations in the zzso zzso 

Our study revealed that absolute zzso is superior to relative ratio to differentiate zzso and BD from zzso
