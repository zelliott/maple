Alexander disease is a rare disorder of the central nervous system with characteristic zzso white matter abnormalities with frontal predominance on magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso shows a lack of zzso in the affected white matter, zzso interpreted as zzso or zzso To increase our insight into the nature of the pathology leading to the MR imaging findings in Alexander disease, we applied serial MR imaging, zzso zzso transfer zzso imaging zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso in six patients with juvenile Alexander zzso 

The MR imaging protocol comprised zzso and zzso spin echo images and zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso maps were generated, and MR zzso zzso were zzso for several zzso 

MR imaging showed similar cerebral white matter abnormalities in all patients, with only minor increase on prolonged zzso despite sometimes serious clinical zzso MR zzso showed highly elevated levels of zzso zzso and zzso compounds and decreased total zzso and zzso levels in the abnormal white zzso High values of zzso were observed, and both zzso and zzso were zzso 

The sequential MR imaging findings in Alexander disease provide strong evidence against active zzso as sole explanation for the underlying zzso An alternative explanation for our zzso zzso and zzso zzso would suggest zzso be zzso and zzso of zzso as seen in low grade zzso
