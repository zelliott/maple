We zzso that magnetic resonance zzso zzso is comparable to zzso retrograde zzso zzso as a diagnostic tool in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with suspected zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso and zzso in 8 months (March 1, 1996, to October 31, zzso zzso resonance zzso was performed with a zzso scanner using zzso zzso Images were obtained in a zzso to zzso zzso Images from zzso were zzso evaluated by a zzso for image quality, zzso zzso level of zzso and overall diagnostic zzso Images from zzso were zzso evaluated by a zzso zzso zzso and served as the standard for calculating sensitivity, zzso and positive zzso zzso In addition, zzso findings were compared with zzso results in all patients zzso 

zzso MR images were obtained in 18 patients zzso zzso zzso images were obtained in 16 zzso of 18 attempted zzso zzso and 11 zzso of 14 attempted pancreatic zzso zzso resonance zzso accurately delineated the level of zzso zzso zzso obstruction in 13 zzso of 15 zzso More important, zzso provided valuable staging information in most zzso zzso from zzso correlated with operative findings zzso and location of tumor and zzso vascular zzso in 8 zzso of 10 patients who underwent surgery, while failing in 2 patients zzso with zzso 

zzso resonance zzso is a sensitive study for detecting the presence and level of zzso zzso obstruction in patients with zzso The results are comparable to those of zzso however, zzso provides additional data regarding extent of disease that is not available from zzso zzso
