To evaluate the quantitative parameters obtained from dynamic MR zzso images as zzso of survival taking into consideration the zzso effects of other zzso zzso 

Thirty-nine patients zzso years; survival zzso zzso with high-grade zzso (8 grade III, 31 grade zzso were zzso included in the zzso Additional data incorporated zzso performance scale, zzso zzso extension after surgery and type of zzso Dynamic zzso zzso was acquired before zzso zzso zzso were extracted for each zzso and several quantitative parameters were obtained from the whole zzso volume and the 10 % maximum zzso Additional image zzso included the presence of zzso single or multiple zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The relationship between quantitative parameters and survival was assessed using zzso techniques and the zzso zzso Cox zzso analysis was used to evaluate each zzso zzso zzso 

Only the mean of the 10 % maximum values of the transfer zzso showed an independent relationship with patient survival zzso zzso test zzso Cox zzso zzso with higher values corresponding to lower survival zzso 

High maximum transfer zzso values show an independent statistical relationship with low survival in high-grade zzso zzso This imaging zzso can be used as a predictor of zzso
