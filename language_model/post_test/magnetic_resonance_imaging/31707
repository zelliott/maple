zzso recovery in response to a brain zzso such as a stroke, can even occur years after the incident and may be accelerated by effective rehabilitation zzso In zzso chronic zzso patients, we administered a short-term intensive language training to improve language functions and to induce cortical reorganization under rigorously controlled zzso zzso naming performance was assessed during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso prior to and immediately after the language zzso zzso of interest zzso for statistical analyses were constituted by areas with individually determined zzso high zzso of slow wave generators zzso by zzso prior to the language zzso that clustered mainly in left zzso zzso Three additional individually defined regions served to control for the specificity of the results for the selected respective target zzso the zzso area of the individual patient's zzso the mirror image of the delta zzso in the right zzso and left zzso regions that did not produce a significant amount of slow wave zzso zzso changes of zzso brain zzso were highly correlated with improved naming of the trained pictures, but selectively within the zzso dysfunctional zzso brain zzso Our results suggest that zzso of cortical functions is possible even years after a zzso The behavioral gain seems to be zzso by brain regions that had been partially deprived from input after the initial zzso We therefore provide first time direct evidence for the importance of zzso functional zzso of zzso areas in a zzso sample of chronic zzso zzso
