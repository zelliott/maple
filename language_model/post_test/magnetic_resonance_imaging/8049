The social behavior of both human and nonhuman primates relies on zzso for the recognition of individuals, their facial expressions, and their direction of zzso A broad network of cortical and zzso structures has been implicated in face processing, yet it is unclear whether zzso dimensions of face zzso such as expression and direction of zzso are processed jointly or independently by zzso and functionally zzso neural zzso zzso zzso were presented with a set of monkey faces displaying aggressive, neutral, and zzso expressions with head and eyes either averted or zzso zzso responses to these faces as compared to zzso images revealed widespread zzso of the superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso and included activity in the zzso The different dimensions of the face stimuli zzso distinct zzso patterns among the zzso zzso The zzso amygdala, including the zzso zzso and accessory zzso zzso produced a stronger response for threatening than zzso zzso The central nucleus and bed nucleus of the zzso zzso responded more to averted than zzso zzso Independent behavioral measures confirmed that faces with averted gaze were more zzso suggesting the activity in the central nucleus may be related to attention and zzso
