The zzso zzso plays a key role in the regulation of central zzso transmission, which zzso cognitive zzso zzso zzso function and impaired executive processing are robust features of zzso 

To examine the effect of a zzso in the zzso zzso gene (the variable number of tandem repeats in the 3' untranslated zzso on brain function during executive processing in healthy volunteers and patients with zzso We hypothesized that this variation would have a different effect on prefrontal and zzso zzso in zzso reflecting altered zzso zzso

Regional brain zzso during word generation relative to repetition in an overt verbal zzso task measured by functional magnetic resonance zzso Main effects of zzso and diagnosis on zzso and their interaction were estimated with analysis of zzso in zzso 

zzso of diagnosis, the zzso zzso was associated with greater zzso than the zzso zzso in the left anterior zzso and right zzso zzso Trends for the same effect in the right zzso and for greater zzso in the zzso anterior zzso zzso were also zzso There were diagnosis zzso zzso interactions in the left middle frontal zzso and left nucleus zzso where the zzso zzso was associated with greater zzso than the zzso zzso in patients but not zzso 

zzso cingulate, and zzso function during an executive task is normally modulated by variation in the zzso zzso zzso Its effect on zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso is altered in patients with zzso This may reflect altered zzso function in these regions in zzso
