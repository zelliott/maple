Today, most studies of cognitive processes using functional zzso zzso experiments adopt a zzso zzso zzso flexible stimulation zzso require new statistical models in which not only the zzso amount but also the time course of the measured zzso response is zzso Most previous approaches have been based on a linear zzso context and have introduced zzso model functions to improve the signal zzso In this report a zzso zzso context is zzso from which shape parameters for the zzso response are obtained per trial and per region of zzso These parameters allow the investigation of zzso shape variations of the zzso zzso By embedding the zzso into a robust statistical framework and rigorously analyzing the zzso interactions in the zzso data, it is possible to derive statistically valid descriptions of single zzso zzso The model, zzso algorithm, zzso and an example analysis from a zzso zzso study are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
