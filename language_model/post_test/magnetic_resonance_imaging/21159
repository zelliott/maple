zzso of the occurrence of zzso of cortical development zzso and its relationship to zzso zzso in zzso II zzso zzso is zzso 

To assess zzso of cortical development and its relationship to zzso zzso regarding zzso II zzso 

Brain and cervical spinal zzso from 66 children (age range, zzso mean age, zzso with zzso II zzso were zzso zzso If present, the type, number and location of zzso of cortical development were zzso zzso zzso was assessed for the level of the zzso zzso the descent of the zzso and the shape of the fourth zzso these parameters were compared in children with and without zzso of cortical zzso 

Twenty children with zzso of cortical development were zzso Only zzso zzso zzso was zzso The median level of the zzso zzso was significantly lower in children with zzso of cortical development compared with children without it zzso A low zzso junction was identified more frequently in children with zzso of cortical development zzso relative to children without zzso of cortical development zzso zzso The fourth zzso shape was not significantly different in children with or without zzso of cortical development zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was seen in a relatively high proportion of children with zzso II zzso suggesting that it may be associated with severe zzso zzso
