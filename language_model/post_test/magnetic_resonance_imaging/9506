zzso resonance imaging zzso with oxygen challenge zzso zzso uses oxygen as a zzso zzso to define zzso tissue based on zzso and oxygen extraction zzso zzso displays a greater zzso signal change during OC than surrounding zzso Since timely restoration of cerebral blood flow zzso should salvage zzso zzso OC was tested by examining the consequences of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 minutes) was induced in male zzso rats zzso zzso was identified on zzso zzso during zzso zzso and zzso injury were identified on zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced and scans zzso zzso for final zzso and zzso OC were run on day zzso zzso signal increase to OC was zzso in zzso zzso and zzso nucleus and was unaffected by zzso In zzso zzso zzso signal increased by zzso zzso zzso during zzso and returned to zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso core zzso signal increase was zzso zzso zzso during zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso increased from zzso zzso 13 to zzso zzso 25 zzso per 100 g per minute on zzso On day 7, zzso zzso gave a normal OC response and was located outside the zzso zzso zzso zzso recovered when zzso was zzso providing further validation of the utility of zzso OC for acute stroke zzso
