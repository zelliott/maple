To determine the frequency and types of dual pathology in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso and to analyze the clinical manifestations and surgical zzso 

A total of 240 patients with zzso underwent zzso zzso following a comprehensive zzso zzso zzso zzso of these had zzso sclerosis zzso or zzso lobe zzso in association with another zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of 37 patients with dual pathology had zzso of the zzso zzso nine had cortical zzso four had cavernous zzso or zzso zzso one had a zzso zzso zzso one had a zzso and four patients had cerebral zzso in zzso zzso had abnormal head magnetic resonance zzso zzso had abnormal zzso zzso zzso scans, and zzso had abnormal zzso zzso The zzso zzso procedure zzso showed impaired memory of the zzso side in zzso of the zzso Twenty patients had left and 17 had zzso en bloc zzso zzso including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Twenty-six zzso became zzso eight zzso had rare seizures, two zzso had worthwhile seizure reduction and one zzso had no improvement zzso of follow-up zzso years, mean zzso zzso zzso 

zzso had dual zzso The dual pathology was almost exclusively seen in patients whose zzso were zzso or occurred early in life, suggesting that the zzso is more vulnerable and more readily develops HS in early zzso zzso including the lateral and zzso zzso structures led to a favorable outcome with no mortality and little zzso
