In this retrospective study, a zzso zzso transfer as first described by zzso in 1988 was performed in 12 patients with massive, zzso rotator cuff zzso Their average age was 59 years and the preliminary results are reported here after an average follow-up of 39 zzso In 50% of the patients there was no pain and zzso had mild to moderate pain at zzso zzso zzso scoring was excellent in zzso good in zzso moderate in zzso and poor in zzso Active range of motion in the shoulder improved significantly in external rotation and zzso zzso force as measured with zzso and zzso systems showed weak zzso In two patients these tests could not be performed due to lack of force, in 9 patients abduction force was much weaker than on the zzso side and in one patient the operated arm was stronger than the other zzso We conclude that in most patients good pain relief and functional improvement can be achieved after zzso zzso transfer for zzso rotator cuff zzso A good active range of motion can be expected but a lack of force zzso However, it remains difficult to conclude for which patients this surgery can be predictably zzso
