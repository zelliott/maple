We assessed the role of spinal magnetic resonance imaging zzso and bone zzso as zzso factors in patients with zzso stage I multiple myeloma zzso and negative skeletal zzso 55 consecutive patients underwent spinal zzso and 41 of them underwent bone zzso by zzso X-ray zzso zzso Spinal zzso studies showed evidence of bone zzso involvement in zzso patients zzso A diffuse pattern was present in three patients and a focal pattern in 14 patients, nine of them with only one zzso zzso During a median follow-up of 25 months, 10 patients had disease zzso zzso patients with abnormal zzso and zzso patients with normal zzso Median time to disease progression was not reached in both groups but was significantly different for patients with normal and those with abnormal patterns on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was only slightly decreased compared with normal people zzso zzso Z score zzso and was not of zzso zzso Using a zzso analysis the only two independent significant zzso parameters were abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, spinal zzso but not bone zzso appeared to be justified in patients with stage I zzso zzso and negative skeletal zzso
