To compare ultrasound zzso CT, and zzso in the evaluation of zzso vascular zzso portal and zzso zzso flow, and collateral pathways zzso and spontaneous zzso in candidates for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 patients with history of zzso zzso bleeding or intractable zzso underwent duplex zzso zzso CT, and zzso before zzso The appearance of portal and zzso anatomy was graded from 1 (not visible) to 4 zzso zzso independently by four zzso zzso and direction of portal and zzso zzso flow, and presence and location of zzso and spontaneous zzso zzso were also zzso zzso and effects of zzso variation were assessed for significance using Friedman's zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded higher scores than CT or US for zzso veins zzso zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and CT scored better than US for portal vein branches zzso zzso zzso and zzso vein zzso zzso zzso All tests demonstrated the main portal vein well, with no statistically significant zzso US and zzso were more sensitive than CT for detecting portal vein flow and direction zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso zzso was most sensitive for zzso vein flow and direction zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso CT and zzso were more sensitive than US in detecting zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso zzso variation did not influence results significantly P zzso zzso zzso provides the most useful information and may be the preferred single imaging test prior to zzso
