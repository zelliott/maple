Although the zzso has been described as a zzso zzso a growing body of work suggests that it is a more general zzso zzso A well-established face matching task has been shown to robustly activate the zzso and has been used to investigate the influence of age, drugs, and zzso on the zzso In order to examine more specifically the emotion processing component in this task, we added a condition in which neutral faces are matched by zzso The left and right zzso responded to both the emotion and the identity matching condition, and the only selective response to emotion matching was at the left inferior prefrontal zzso The left zzso response zzso to emotion matching but not to identity zzso We concluded that the zzso response to face matching is driven at least in part by relevance zzso independent of emotion processing, although there appears to be additional zzso processing at the left zzso
