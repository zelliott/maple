The aim of this investigation was to compare two current zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso at zzso zzso with regard to their ability to differentiate between zzso zzso tumors and zzso changes in patients zzso for zzso The patient population comprised 25 patients in whom zzso zzso was suspected based on MR zzso zzso imaging started 10 zzso after zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso and was performed using a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was calculated zzso using zzso zzso was performed at zzso T using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by MR imaging zzso for zzso were placed into the suspected zzso Signal zzso of zzso compounds zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso When using the zzso of zzso for zzso zzso the sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of the zzso zzso were 95, 100 and zzso zzso For zzso the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 89, 83 and zzso respectively, based both on the zzso ratios of zzso and zzso as tumor criterion with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso yielded more favorable results compared to zzso at distinguishing zzso and/or residual zzso from zzso changes and may be particularly valuable when the evaluation of tumor extent is zzso
