zzso zzso groove distance zzso is a commonly used measurement for surgical decision making in patients with zzso zzso and zzso This measurement has historically been performed utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso More recently, magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been proposed as an equivalent method, but this has not yet been fully zzso 

To determine the reliability of zzso distance zzso on both zzso and CT and to determine whether the zzso are interchangeable with one zzso 

zzso study zzso Level of evidence, zzso 

All patients with zzso instability who underwent both CT and zzso of the knee from 2003 to 2011 were included zzso zzso 59 knees in 54 zzso Two zzso musculoskeletal zzso measured the zzso distances for each patient by CT and zzso in a randomized, blinded zzso zzso reliability was calculated between zzso for both imaging zzso and zzso reliability was calculated between the 2 imaging zzso The results are reported using zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The 59 knees had a mean zzso distance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by CT and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso reliability between the zzso was considered excellent for both CT and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When comparing CT to zzso the zzso was considered only fair for each of the zzso zzso and zzso Eleven patients zzso had a zzso distance of zzso zzso on CT preoperatively and underwent zzso realignment by zzso zzso zzso In this surgical zzso the mean zzso distance was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by CT and only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso for a mean difference of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso distance can be measured with excellent zzso reliability on both zzso and CT; however, the values derived from these 2 tests may not be zzso This observation should be taken into consideration when zzso is used for surgical planning because zzso may underestimate the zzso distance when compared with zzso
