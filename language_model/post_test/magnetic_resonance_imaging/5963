Clinical and research zzso in the field of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders zzso require accurate and valid identification of zzso clinical zzso 

A comprehensive zzso battery, coupled with magnetic resonance imaging, zzso MR zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso were administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders zzso to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified across the spectrum, and distinguish diagnostic zzso within the zzso The zzso outcomes of the comprehensive zzso study are presented zzso 

The study groups zzso 1) zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso zzso as diagnosed by an interdisciplinary team using the zzso zzso zzso and 4) healthy peers with no prenatal zzso A standardized zzso battery was administered to each child and their primary caregiver by a zzso 

Use of the zzso Code produced three clinically and statistically distinct zzso clinical zzso The three zzso zzso zzso and zzso reflected a linear zzso of increasing zzso impairment and physical zzso representing the full zzso of zzso zzso and psychiatric disorders were comparably prevalent across the three zzso groups, and significantly more prevalent than among the zzso All three zzso zzso had comparably high levels of prenatal alcohol zzso 

Although zzso zzso and zzso are distinct zzso subgroups, these groups are not distinguishable solely by their zzso zzso While all children within a group shared the same magnitude of zzso zzso the patterns of impairment showed considerable individual zzso zzso MRS and zzso further distinguished these zzso zzso
