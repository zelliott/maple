zzso zzso during meal zzso activates zzso zzso which send signals from the stomach to the brain and result in the perception of fullness and zzso zzso is one of the mechanisms that zzso food zzso We measured regional brain zzso during dynamic gastric balloon zzso in 18 health subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging and the blood zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso signal was significantly changed by both inflow and zzso changes in the zzso zzso For lower balloon volumes, water inflow was associated with zzso of zzso zzso and right zzso The larger volume condition additionally activated left zzso amygdala, left zzso zzso and the left zzso The response in the left zzso and zzso was zzso associated with changes in self-reports of fullness and positively with changes in plasma zzso zzso whereas those in the right zzso and zzso were zzso associated with the zzso body mass zzso The widespread zzso induced by gastric zzso corroborates the influence of zzso zzso on cortical and zzso brain zzso These findings provide evidence that the left zzso and zzso process zzso signals of fullness produced by gastric zzso involved in the controls of food zzso
