The authors studied zzso zzso zzso in 31 subjects with zzso zzso zzso pain to compare clinical findings with those of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound zzso All subjects received clinical, zzso and magnetic resonance imaging examinations using zzso zzso and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and high resolution ultrasound using power zzso zzso zzso in 25 women and six men with a mean age zzso years zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso and zzso enhancement are associated statistically with increasing pain intensity on resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso flow were associated with increasing pain intensity on resistance to zzso There is no statistically significant association between magnetic resonance imaging zzso and pain intensity on resistance to zzso Clinical and ultrasound examinations positively identify zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The magnetic resonance imaging is a more sensitive test for zzso zzso zzso tear than either clinical or ultrasound zzso
