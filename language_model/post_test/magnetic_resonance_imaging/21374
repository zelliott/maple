The development of new small zzso therapeutic drugs requires accurate zzso of drug zzso biological activity and treatment zzso zzso measuring these zzso is often hampered by the lack of efficient zzso platforms with high sensitivity and zzso Using an in zzso model system, we report a simple and sensitive liquid zzso mass zzso zzso to zzso the zzso of a recently developed novel zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a zzso zzso analog whose biological activity is enhanced via zzso We developed a rapid organic phase extraction technique and validated wide and functional zzso distribution in various mouse zzso consistent with its enhanced potency previously observed in a variety of human cancer cell zzso More importantly, in zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso further established that zzso inhibited disease progression and affected key zzso in a mouse model of zzso zzso
