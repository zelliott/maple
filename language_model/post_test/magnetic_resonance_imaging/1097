To develop a method to provide absolute values of regional zzso zzso by means of color zzso and to determine zzso zzso reserve using magnetic resonance imaging during the first pass of zzso zzso acid zzso 

The study population consisted of five patients with zzso zzso two with zzso zzso four with coronary artery disease, and one with normal coronary arteries who presented with mildly abnormal zzso zzso For each zzso six continuous slices were acquired during the first pass of zzso zzso zzso body zzso before and during zzso zzso zzso zzso using an zzso fast zzso shot zzso sequence on a zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso images were created and displayed by means of a color zzso The parameters were calculated zzso by zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso reserve was then zzso as the zzso of zzso zzso during zzso stress and zzso before zzso zzso 

zzso zzso during zzso stress in patients with normal coronary arteries zzso zzso 1) or after successful zzso coronary intervention zzso zzso 2) was increased compared with that before zzso zzso However, the patients with coronary artery disease zzso zzso 2) failed to show increased zzso zzso The patients with zzso zzso showed increased zzso zzso during zzso stress, although two with zzso zzso did zzso 

Our new technique can provide absolute values of regional zzso zzso by means of color zzso and has potential for widespread use for evaluation of zzso and other types of heart zzso
