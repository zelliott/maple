To investigate whether there is zzso zzso in the human zzso tract in zzso To consider how the zzso varies with duration of zzso and location of zzso 

Seven patients with damage to the primary visual zzso zzso the lateral zzso nucleus zzso or the zzso tract were scanned with structural zzso The volume and zzso area of the left and right zzso tracts were zzso based on the intensity values of the zzso zzso High values zzso to zzso with high white matter content, and the values decrease as the white matter content drops zzso zzso A zzso index to compare the tract size in the two zzso was calculated at different intensity zzso 

The three zzso patients with longstanding damage to either zzso or zzso showed zzso zzso greater than zzso at the highest intensity values, indicating significant zzso tract zzso Those with recent damage to the zzso tract had even higher zzso zzso due to direct zzso Even 18 months after zzso zzso there was a significant correlation between the zzso and volume zzso at different intensity zzso whereas no control subject showed any zzso 

zzso zzso had already begun 18 months after zzso Although there was no visible decrease in volume at this stage, the white matter integrity was zzso zzso decrease in volume could be zzso at longer zzso of zzso This method of zzso assessing structural images provides an effective, zzso approach to monitor the zzso of zzso tract zzso
