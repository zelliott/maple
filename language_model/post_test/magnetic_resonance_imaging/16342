zzso is a complex experience involving extensive interactions between brain and spinal zzso zzso Various interventions that zzso pain, such as the application of a competing noxious stimulus zzso are thought to involve zzso regulation through diffuse noxious zzso controls zzso However, no study has yet examined the relation between brain and spinal zzso activity during zzso analgesia in zzso This zzso study investigates brain responses to zzso painful electrical stimulation administered to the zzso nerve to evoke a spinal zzso response zzso zzso before, during and after zzso induced by the immersion of the left zzso foot in cold zzso zzso are compared with a control condition without zzso As expected, zzso produced robust pain zzso with residual analgesia zzso during the recovery zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso was significantly decreased by zzso only in a subset of zzso zzso effects of zzso on pain perception and spinal zzso were paralleled by decreased zzso activity in zzso zzso Individual changes in zzso brain activity were specifically related to analgesia in primary zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and amygdala, and to zzso zzso in supplementary motor area and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, sustained zzso induced by the zzso stimulus in the zzso predicted zzso decrease while sustained activity in zzso and the zzso gray matter predicted zzso zzso These results provide evidence for the implication of at least two partly zzso neural mechanisms underlying the effects of zzso on pain and spinal zzso in zzso
