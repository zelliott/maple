zzso in zzso zzso zzso neural zzso have been noted following obesity zzso It has been speculated that these zzso neural changes may be related to documented zzso changes in food zzso however, this relation has not been previously zzso In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging and rating scales were used to assess neural zzso desire to eat zzso zzso and liking for zzso and low-calorie food cues in 14 females one month zzso and one month zzso gastric bypass zzso zzso zzso to zzso changes in all variables were zzso and zzso changes in neural zzso were zzso on zzso changes in desire to eat and liking of zzso zzso revealed significant zzso reductions in zzso zzso zzso neural zzso desire to eat zzso and liking for zzso relative to low-calorie food zzso zzso reductions in zzso zzso were associated with zzso reductions in zzso but not zzso for zzso versus low-calorie zzso Interestingly, reductions in food wanting were also related to reductions in zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso following zzso zzso are consistent with the hypothesized zzso between wanting and zzso supporting the notion that zzso but not zzso is processed through the zzso reward zzso zzso reductions in both zzso and zzso zzso reductions in desire to eat might suggest that less dietary zzso was zzso to resist potential overconsumption as the anticipated reward value of zzso foods decreased following zzso
