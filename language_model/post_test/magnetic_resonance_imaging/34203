We describe almost entirely automated procedures for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso statistics to test the zzso hypothesis of zero zzso difference between two groups of structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso under the zzso hypothesis are available for 1) global tissue class zzso 2) standardized linear model zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso estimated at each zzso and 3) an area of zzso connected clusters generated by applying an arbitrary threshold to a two-dimensional zzso map of normal statistics at zzso zzso We describe novel methods for economically zzso probability zzso under the zzso hypothesis, with fewer zzso by zzso of the observed zzso Nominal Type I error control by zzso testing is generally zzso whereas theoretical zzso may be over zzso zzso has the additional advantage that it can be used to test any statistic of interest, such as the sum of zzso zzso statistics in a cluster (or cluster zzso regardless of its theoretical zzso under the zzso zzso These issues are illustrated by application to zzso data acquired from 18 adolescents with hyperkinetic disorder and 16 control subjects matched for age and zzso
