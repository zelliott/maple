zzso of cerebrovascular reserve capacity predicts the risk of zzso insult in patients with major vessel zzso Blood zzso zzso zzso imaging has the potential to estimate reserve capacity of the cerebral circulation zzso based on changes in the signal that reflect differences in the magnetic zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The authors examined the feasibility of using the zzso technique to assess cerebrovascular reserve capacity in patients with cerebrovascular zzso disease by comparing results with an established method of measuring zzso Ten patients with severe or complete zzso of the internal carotid artery were compared with 17 healthy subjects to evaluate regional differences and identify variables that indicate a change in the zzso zzso zzso of cerebral vessels was induced by breath zzso and the zzso change was examined with zzso zzso zzso Before measuring the regional change in the zzso zzso actual timing of zzso and zzso periods was corrected by shifting the phase of a zzso template to obtain the largest correlation zzso zzso signal change was calculated on a zzso basis and was compared with zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso zzso The degree of impairment and the distribution of impaired areas detected by the zzso study correlated with the results of zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity of the zzso technique by visual inspection were zzso and zzso zzso A negative response zzso zzso frequently was observed in areas of exhausted reserve capacity, suggesting that a zzso phenomenon zzso The percent change and the zzso were well correlated zzso zzso zzso The mean percent change in most areas of impaired reserve capacity was more than 2 zzso below the mean values in healthy zzso The present method of zzso zzso analysis can be used to create a map of the cerebral zzso zzso Furthermore, the development of reliable, generally accessible techniques for evaluating cerebral zzso opens the door for clinical studies to monitor and treat patients with compromised zzso This study is an attempt to develop such zzso
