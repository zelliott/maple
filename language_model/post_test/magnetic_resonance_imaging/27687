To evaluate the usefulness of three-dimensional ultrasound zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and three-dimensional power zzso zzso zzso in the zzso assessment of zzso invasion in zzso zzso 

A prospective zzso zzso 

University zzso 

Twenty consecutive patients diagnosed with zzso zzso 

zzso 3 T zzso and zzso US examinations were performed, and the depth of zzso invasion was zzso The zzso zzso zzso index, flow index and zzso flow index, were calculated by zzso 

The results were compared with the final zzso report after a surgical zzso 

In detecting deep zzso invasion, the sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso and their combination was 50, zzso and zzso zzso The specificity was zzso 50 and zzso zzso There were no significant differences in the zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso 

zzso appears to be more sensitive than zzso US in detecting deep invasion, while zzso US has a better zzso
