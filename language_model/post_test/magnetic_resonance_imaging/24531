zzso volume effects in zzso magnetic resonance zzso in the brain have been studied previously in terms of proper water concentration calculations, but there is a lack of disclosure in terms of zzso placement techniques that would affect the zzso The purpose of this study is to facilitate a fully automated MRS zzso registration method which is time efficient, accurate, and can be extended to all imaging zzso A total of thirteen healthy adults underwent single zzso zzso scans in zzso zzso zzso zzso of a MRS zzso onto an anatomical scan is derived along with a full calculation of water concentration with a correction term to account for the partial volume zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso known to yield high reliability are zzso zzso correlation analyses between tissue volume zzso and zzso zzso were statistically significant in zzso zzso zzso and zzso lobe and zzso lobe zzso MRS zzso zzso zzso by dice metric over repeated visits yielded zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso concentration were zzso These findings reiterate an importance of considering the partial volume effects when tissue water is used as an internal concentration reference so as to avoid zzso a zzso difference as a zzso zzso
