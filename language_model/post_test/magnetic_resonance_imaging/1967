The aim of this study was to compare the clinical usefulness of zzso zzso iron oxide zzso MR contrast media zzso zzso Laboratories, zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso in patients with head and neck zzso cell zzso using zzso as gold zzso Eighty-one previously zzso patients were enrolled in a zzso zzso clinical zzso All patients had a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and surgery within a period of 15 zzso The MR exams were analyzed both on site and by two independent zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and imaging was done per zzso zzso groups, and per individual zzso zzso when the short axis was zzso or zzso 10 zzso For individual zzso zzso zzso MR showed a high sensitivity zzso or zzso zzso and specificity zzso or zzso zzso For zzso zzso groups, the sensitivity was zzso or zzso 59% and specificity zzso or zzso zzso zzso results were partially due to inflammatory zzso zzso results from the presence of zzso zzso Errors of interpretation were also related to motion and/or zzso artifacts and problems of zone zzso zzso MR had a negative zzso value zzso zzso or zzso zzso and a positive zzso value zzso zzso or zzso zzso The specificity and zzso of zzso MR were better than those of zzso zzso zzso MR showed an unexpectedly high sensitivity and zzso which were not increased with zzso zzso The potential contribution of zzso MR still remains limited by technical problems regarding motion and zzso artifacts and spatial zzso It is also noteworthy that logistical problems, which could reduce the practical value of zzso zzso will be minimized in the future since zzso MR alone performed as good as the combination of zzso and zzso zzso
