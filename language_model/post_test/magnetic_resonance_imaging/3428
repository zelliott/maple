zzso traumatic zzso fluid zzso leak is a challenging problem in diagnosis and zzso zzso leaks frequently present by intermittent zzso or by zzso attacks of meningitis, which can be the only presenting zzso The objective of this study is to present our experience in management of pediatric traumatic zzso roof zzso leaks using a zzso repair technique via an zzso zzso 

Ten pediatric patients zzso zzso years, six males and four zzso presenting with zzso zzso roof zzso zzso were operated upon between January 2007 and December 2010, using an zzso zzso zzso repair zzso zzso zzso evaluation included both zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso cuts, and magnetic resonance imaging zzso high resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso the GE zzso zzso electromagnetic navigation system was used in all zzso zzso follow-up was done clinically by regular zzso examinations and zzso by zzso assessment using the same zzso zzso 

zzso all patients presented with unilateral intermittent watery zzso with periods ranging from 5 to 24 months before zzso Seven cases had a history of zzso zzso zzso were confined to zzso roof in all 10 cases zzso side in seven and left side in zzso and ranged in size from 2 to 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two cases had more than one zzso on the same zzso All defects were identified preoperatively using our zzso zzso One case was associated with a zzso with no brain zzso and another case was associated with a small zzso Mean zzso hospitalization was 6 days zzso zzso zzso None of our patients developed any zzso or zzso complications or required revision surgery with a zzso success rate after a mean follow-up duration of zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso leaks involving the zzso roof can be successfully managed via the zzso zzso route using a zzso repair technique, thus limiting complications associated with external zzso zzso imaging including zzso and high resolution zzso is of paramount importance for detecting the zzso site and for planning zzso
