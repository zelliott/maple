zzso zzso is a Web-based application that enables investigators to map data from zzso studies to a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It currently serves as an image zzso enabling them to create figures suitable for publication, presentation and archival zzso Eventually it will enable investigators studying any of several species to analyze the overlap between their data and zzso data mapped by zzso The purpose of the current project was to incorporate the zzso zzso mouse brain zzso zzso into zzso An enhanced zzso echo zzso magnetic resonance image zzso of the zzso zzso brain zzso et zzso zzso was warped to bring the irregular biological zzso of the zzso into line with the zzso flat zzso plane of the zzso zzso The left zzso was deleted and the right zzso reflected to produce a symmetrical zzso MR zzso The symmetrical zzso image was imported into zzso The map executing this zzso was applied to four other zzso volumes based on the same zzso zzso and maintained at the Center for zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso a zzso zzso a segmented image and an image reconstructed from zzso zzso sections of the zzso zzso versions of those images were returned to the zzso zzso where they are made available to other zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was demonstrated by mapping and comparing a number of cortical areas as illustrated in three conventional mouse brain zzso The zzso zzso mouse brain zzso is now accessible in zzso where investigators can map image data to standard templates over the Web and process them for publication, presentation and archival purposes: zzso
