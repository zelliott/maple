Water zzso by dry kidney beans zzso zzso zzso and zzso beans zzso zzso was traced using zzso resonance imaging in order to zzso the channel of water entry, the manner of water delivery and the timing of swelling of the zzso 

zzso resonance images of beans absorbing water were continuously measured with the zzso imaging method for 16 h or 20 h at zzso zzso With this technique, it was possible to detect and zzso the location of water in the beans, at a low water content, in the initial stages of water zzso 

Water was taken up through a specified zzso the zzso near the zzso and distributed primarily to the zzso When water reached the zzso it began to be incorporated into zzso with considerable swelling of the zzso Water zzso took place within a short time for kidney zzso The initial process of water entry was associated with mechanical zzso of the zzso Rapid zzso of the zzso and the swelling of the zzso were then zzso Water was supplied to zzso through the zzso zzso In contrast, it took a long time, zzso 7 zzso to activate the water channel of the lens for zzso beans which have a tightly fitting zzso zzso of the zzso was not uniform, which induced temporary zzso before enlargement of the zzso 

The zzso of the lens as the sole water channel, the delivery of water to the zzso within the zzso the swelling of the zzso and the further zzso of water are zzso different processes during zzso and were separated by locating water in various zzso and by zzso the time course of water zzso using magnetic resonance imaging with the zzso imaging zzso
