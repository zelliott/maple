Using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso the purpose of this study was to evaluate findings of focal zzso zzso zzso 

This retrospective study included 8 patients with 7 zzso confirmed focal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso One case was considered as zzso by using clinical findings and follow-up zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were reviewed by 2 zzso We evaluated the signal intensity of focal zzso on zzso zzso and zzso images and the pattern of enhancement in zzso portal, zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso value for focal zzso zzso was also zzso 

On zzso images, 7 zzso of 8 cases zzso zzso showed mixed zzso with irregular zzso Six zzso of the 8 cases showed rim enhancement in the zzso zzso Most cases zzso zzso zzso showed zzso or zzso in the portal and equilibrium zzso In the zzso phase, all cases zzso showed mixed zzso with irregular margins and zzso zzso All cases showed zzso in both low and high zzso ranges on zzso The zzso for 6 cases showed less than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso showed mixed zzso irregular margins, and zzso shapes with excellent zzso contrast in the zzso phase of the zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso may not be helpful for characterizing these benign zzso zzso
