Current density imaging zzso has been shown to be a feasible method to map spatial distribution of electric currents through bone structures and for studying osteoporosis and bone fracture zzso For the osteoporosis model, bone sample was zzso in a solution of a sodium salt of zzso acid zzso which causes chemical reaction with zzso zzso zzso and lowers the zzso degree of the solid zzso This enables clear zzso of conventional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso of conventional magnetic resonance and CD images of bone was improved by immersing the bone samples into zzso saline containing contrast agent zzso prior to zzso To stimulate effects of bone fracture on electric current zzso through bone, a zzso cut was made through the bone, and the resulting gap was filled with an zzso Electric current density images under these conditions have shown that regions of strong zzso can be distinguished from regions of no zzso at the site where the zzso restricts electric zzso Real bone fracture was zzso as zzso To demonstrate influence of zzso concentration on electric current spatial distribution, the bone samples were zzso after being immersed in various saline zzso The same contrast in current density images was produced with the combinations of higher zzso zzso and lower zzso Our observations demonstrate the feasibility of the method in mapping current density in bone structures, which could have implications in understanding and monitoring the effects of the electrical zzso
