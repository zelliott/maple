Several zzso techniques are available for the treatment of zzso and zzso zzso The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a zzso procedure incorporating a new zzso collagen type I gel for the treatment of small zzso and zzso defects in the knee evaluated at zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients were treated with a zzso collagen type I gel zzso of 11 zzso zzso The zzso were implanted in the zzso cartilage zzso and fixed by zzso zzso The clinical outcome was assessed preoperatively and at 6 weeks, and 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery using the International zzso Documentation Committee zzso score, zzso activity scale and visual analogue scale zzso zzso attachment rate was assessed 6 weeks zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso was evaluated using the zzso Observation of zzso zzso zzso zzso score at 6, 12 and 24 months after zzso Clinical results were correlated with zzso zzso 

Six male and nine female patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 26 zzso zzso No complications were zzso The mean zzso values after 6 weeks and the mean zzso patient values after 6 months were significantly improved from the zzso values zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso This improvement remained up to the latest zzso There were no significant differences between the median zzso and zzso zzso values zzso zzso improvement of the mean zzso score was observed after 12 months and remained by 24 months zzso zzso zzso MR images showed that in 14 of the 15 patients, the graft was completely attached by 6 weeks zzso At 24 months after zzso zzso demonstrated complete filling in all cases with a mainly smooth surface, complete integration of the border zone, zzso structure of the repaired tissue and nearly normal signal zzso No correlation between any variables of the zzso score and the clinical scores was zzso 

The present study reveals that the new method produces both good clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso Use of zzso only implanted zzso of a smaller diameter leads to a high attachment rate at zzso zzso
