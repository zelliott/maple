The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of zzso zzso MR imaging as predictor of outcome for zzso stem cell transplantation zzso in zzso zzso MR imaging of the zzso zzso including zzso and zzso spin echo and zzso inversion recovery and zzso and zzso fast field echo images, was zzso performed in 27 zzso major patients being prepared for zzso The area of red zzso and its percentage of the zzso zzso were measured, and the presence of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the relationship between red zzso area percentage and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Red area percentage were less in patients with successful zzso zzso zzso compared to unsuccessful transplants zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Red zzso area percentage correlated positively with duration of zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso red zzso area percentage was significantly zzso associated with successful zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso and duration of zzso and serum zzso were not associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Red zzso area percentage of zzso zzso on MR imaging is a useful predictor of zzso zzso
