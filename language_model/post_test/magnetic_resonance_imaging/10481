Global zzso matter zzso loss has been reported in multiple sclerosis zzso We addressed the question of if and where zzso loss is localized by means of zzso zzso zzso applied to zzso studies of 51 patients with clinically defined zzso zzso and 34 zzso normal subjects, segmented into normal and abnormal brain zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were subsequently compared on a zzso basis to highlight regions of relative zzso loss zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple comparisons at zzso Additionally, localized differences in brain asymmetry between the zzso and the control groups were assessed by comparing on a zzso basis maps of zzso differences between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple zzso In zzso patients, zzso volume was significantly decreased at the level of the left zzso zzso and zzso as well as of anterior zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso The only cortical region of significant zzso loss in the right zzso was located in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso loss regions were zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso confirming a preferential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso load, while no correlation between cortical regional zzso loss and disease zzso clinical status or zzso load zzso Our findings suggest that in zzso cortical zzso reduction zzso involves left zzso structures and deep zzso the latter zzso zzso to global zzso zzso
