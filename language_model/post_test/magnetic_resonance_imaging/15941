Evidence from neuropsychology suggests that the distinction between animate and inanimate kinds is fundamental to human zzso Previous zzso studies have reported that viewing animate objects activates zzso visual brain regions, whereas inanimate objects activate zzso zzso However, these studies have typically compared only a small number of animate and inanimate kinds zzso animals and zzso and some evidence indicates that task demands determine whether these effects occur at zzso In the current study we test whether a zzso zzso bias is evident across a variety of zzso and across different tasks zzso two stimuli at a general, intermediate and zzso zzso Images of objects were presented zzso in pairs, and zzso zzso were made at different levels in different zzso The zzso data showed zzso zzso for animate objects and zzso zzso for inanimate zzso Additional analyses within these regions revealed no main effect of task, and no interactions between task and zzso Furthermore, there were no zzso of zzso in any of the regions of interest that showed a significant task by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso category biases do not always depend on zzso task zzso Furthermore, we consider whether the animate and inanimate zzso reflect biases in the zzso responses of strongly zzso regions such as the zzso face area or the zzso place zzso
