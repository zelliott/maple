The simultaneous zzso technique is a method of imaging multiple parallel slices with the number of echoes normally used to image a single zzso Images of 16 slices have been obtained from a single zzso zzso The distance between the slices can be decreased to approximately zzso of the field of view in the zzso direction with the cost of significant image zzso The image blurring is negligible when the distance between the slices approaches the field of view in the zzso zzso The zzso are zzso and equations and images are zzso
