Among the methods of parallel magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso Parallel Acquisitions zzso technique reconstructs the missing zzso data by a set of zzso which are derived from zzso signal zzso lines acquired in parallel to the reduced zzso In this paper, a novel hybrid method is proposed to reconstruct by cross sampling the zzso lines zzso to the reduced lines and zzso weights with a zzso zzso zzso The proposed method can mix the benefits of cross sampling and the zzso kernel zzso The in zzso experiments demonstrate this method, named as zzso zzso zzso zzso can effectively reduce the zzso artifacts and noises when high acceleration is zzso
