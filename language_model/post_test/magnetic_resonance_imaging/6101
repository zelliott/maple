Clinical research into the treatment of acute stroke is complicated, is costly, and has often been zzso zzso in imaging technology based on zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging scans offer opportunities for screening experimental therapies during phase II testing so as to deliver only the most promising interventions to phase zzso We discuss the design and the appropriate sample size for phase II studies in stroke based on zzso zzso 

zzso of the relation between analyses of zzso volumes and of zzso outcomes is illustrated using data from zzso trial patients from the zzso International Stroke Trials zzso The size of an effect on zzso volume that would lead to a clinically relevant treatment effect in terms of a measure, such as modified Rankin score zzso is zzso The sample size to detect that magnitude of effect on zzso volume is then zzso zzso is used to evaluate different criteria for proceeding from phase II to phase zzso 

The odds ratios for zzso zzso roughly to the square root of odds ratios for zzso volume, zzso that for equivalent power zzso sample sizes based on zzso volumes should be about one fourth of those based on zzso zzso of power requirements, appropriate for phase II, lead to further sample size zzso For example, a phase III trial comparing a novel treatment with zzso with a total sample size of zzso patients might be motivated from a phase II trial of 126 patients comparing the same 2 treatment zzso zzso zzso phase III trials in stroke should aim to demonstrate significant effects of treatment on clinical zzso However, more direct outcomes such as zzso volume can be useful in phase II for determining whether such phase III trials should be undertaken in the first zzso
