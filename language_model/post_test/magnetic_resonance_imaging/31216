We compared behavioral and neural effects of zzso enhancement between spatial attention, spatial working memory zzso and visual control tasks, using zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso responses zzso but increased accuracy selectively for zzso zzso also decreased zzso to visual stimulation across all tasks within primary visual cortex, increased zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively during maintained attention and zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso selectively during maintained zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso as a function of the visual zzso toward which attention or memory was directed was decreased under zzso In the case of attention, this effect correlated strongly with a decrease in a behavioral measure of selective spatial zzso Our results suggest that, while zzso enhancement zzso visual attention by increasing activity in zzso zzso generally, it accomplishes this in a manner that reduces zzso selective zzso of zzso zzso
