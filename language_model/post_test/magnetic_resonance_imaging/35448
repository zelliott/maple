We examined the relation between occupational zzso to frequent zzso and/or heavy lifting with cartilage zzso based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso in men and determined which compartments are most zzso 

We evaluated 192 men with symptomatic knee zzso zzso The more symptomatic knee was zzso using zzso zzso was scored using the Whole zzso zzso zzso zzso method at the zzso and lateral zzso joint and zzso zzso Occupational zzso to frequent zzso zzso and/or heavy lifting were assessed using a validated zzso 

Among the 192 men zzso zzso standard zzso age 69 zzso 9 zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso those reporting occupational exposure to zzso alone, heavy lifting alone, both zzso and heavy zzso or none of these activities numbered 7, 40, 47, and 98, zzso Compared with men with no occupational exposure to these activities, and following adjustment for age, zzso and history of knee injury or surgery, we found that men reporting occupational zzso to both zzso and heavy lifting had a modest increased risk for worse cartilage zzso scores at the zzso joint zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso joint zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although the latter did not reach statistical zzso 

Men with frequent occupational zzso and heavy lifting have a greater likelihood for worse cartilage zzso scores at the zzso zzso These findings add support to the important role of zzso loading on the zzso of knee zzso particularly zzso zzso
