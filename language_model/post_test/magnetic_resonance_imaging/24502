zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently the initial symptom of multiple sclerosis zzso The aim of our study was to investigate the risk of conversion to zzso in children following isolated ON and to evaluate the performance of current diagnostic methods such as zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso visual evoked zzso zzso and zzso bands in spinal fluid zzso as zzso factors for zzso zzso 

Medical records of 159 patients presenting with acute ON between 2000 and 2010 at the Department of Pediatrics, University of zzso were zzso 34 patients with isolated ON were zzso zzso to zzso was defined according to the revised McDonald criteria zzso Age, sex, zzso ON type, zzso zzso and visual recovery were assessed as zzso of progression to zzso using simple zzso zzso A multiple zzso zzso model included variables found to be significant in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was associated with an increase in the odds of zzso development zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as was positive zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, only zzso remained statistically significant in multiple zzso 

Multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso are suitable for assessing the risk of progression to zzso following isolated zzso as children with both zzso abnormalities and positive zzso at onset of ON are at high risk of developing zzso
