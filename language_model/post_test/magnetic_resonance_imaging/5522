The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zzso transplantation on left zzso function, zzso and zzso formation after compromised coronary zzso 

A coronary vessel with zzso zzso was zzso and skeletal muscle was zzso for isolation and zzso of zzso Two weeks after zzso animals were randomly selected to receive zzso injections of 2 zzso zzso zzso or zzso Fifteen animals survived the whole study period zzso and zzso zzso All animals underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso and four weeks zzso 

Peak filling rate of the left zzso improved in the zzso group zzso but not in the control zzso Peak ejection rate and duration of zzso improved only in the zzso group zzso and zzso zzso zzso fraction or local zzso did not zzso Fibrosis and zzso were similar in both groups, but more zzso were present zzso in the zzso zzso 

In this zzso study, zzso zzso transplantation improved zzso heart function via enhanced zzso filling of the left zzso
