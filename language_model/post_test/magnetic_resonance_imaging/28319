The Mansfield and zzso model of zzso pair zzso is extended using electrical circuit simulation to interacting zzso clusters zzso all zzso of zzso zzso up to and including four zzso This information is used to simulate flow through porous rock samples by calculating the expected zzso zzso found in porous rocks using the zzso rapid zzso imaging zzso
