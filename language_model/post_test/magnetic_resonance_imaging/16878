To determine the zzso number, and location of multiple zzso zzso on brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso in children with zzso type 1 zzso and their correlation with age, and to establish their sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for the diagnosis of zzso in children, especially in the early age zzso zzso 

We performed a zzso study of 162 patients with zzso from Croatian zzso Association Database and zzso control children between the ages of 2 and 18 years who underwent brain zzso between 1989 and zzso 

Multiple zzso were present in zzso of zzso patients and zzso of zzso They were mainly located in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and were significantly decreased in prevalence and number in the older zzso zzso had excellent diagnostic accuracy with the area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso curve of zzso and zzso confidence zzso zzso of zzso The diagnostic sensitivity, zzso and accuracy rate of zzso for zzso were highest in the youngest age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study strongly suggests the inclusion of zzso on brain zzso on the list of diagnostic criteria for zzso especially in children of early age, when the clinical penetration of the zzso gene has not yet been completely zzso
