zzso delivery zzso the delivery and distribution of drugs by the slow bulk movement of fluid in the zzso space, allows delivery of therapeutic agents to large volumes of the brain at relatively uniform zzso This mode of drug delivery offers great potential for the treatment of many neurological disorders, including brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and seizure zzso An analysis of the treatment efficacy and toxicity of this approach requires confirmation that the infusion is distributed to the targeted region and that the drug zzso are in the therapeutic zzso 

To confirm accurate delivery of therapeutic agents during zzso and to monitor the extent of infusion in real time, zzso surrogate zzso that are visible on images obtained using zzso techniques zzso acid zzso for computerized zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid for magnetic resonance zzso zzso were developed and investigated for their usefulness as surrogate zzso during zzso distribution of a zzso The authors infused zzso zzso into the cerebral zzso of monkeys and measured the volumes of distribution by using CT and MR zzso The distribution volumes measured by imaging were compared with tissue volumes measured using quantitative zzso with zzso serum zzso zzso with the surrogate zzso For in zzso determination of zzso zzso the authors examined the correlation between the concentration of the zzso in brain zzso standards and CT zzso zzso They also investigated the long-term effects of the surrogate zzso for CT zzso zzso on animal behavior, the zzso characteristics of the zzso and zzso toxicity after cerebral zzso 

Distribution of a zzso to clinically significant volumes in the brain is possible using zzso The spatial dimensions of the tissue distribution can be accurately defined in zzso during infusion by using surrogate zzso and conventional imaging techniques, and it is expected that it will be possible to determine local zzso of surrogate zzso in zzso of tissue in zzso by using CT zzso Use of imaging surrogate zzso is a practical, safe, and essential tool for establishing treatment volumes during zzso zzso zzso of the central nervous zzso
