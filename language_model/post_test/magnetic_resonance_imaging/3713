It has been shown that the probability of face repetitions influences the magnitude of zzso response reductions zzso et zzso zzso zzso that zzso expectations affect adaptation and repetition suppression processes in the human central nervous zzso An unresolved question is whether probability effects are specific for the retinal position of the stimuli or affect stimulus processing globally, throughout the visual zzso To address this question we tested whether face repetition probability affects zzso adaptation zzso when the repeated stimuli are presented on the same retinal position, overlapping each other or when they are presented in opposite zzso zzso were exposed to either two identical zzso trial, zzso or two different zzso trial, zzso face zzso Both types of trials were presented either in blocks consisting of zzso zzso block, zzso or zzso zzso block, zzso of zzso We found that repetition probability influences zzso equally for overlapping and zzso zzso the signal reduction after zzso was more pronounced in RB than in AB for both spatial arrangements of zzso This effect was present in bilateral zzso and zzso face areas, as well as in the lateral zzso zzso Our results support the role of stimulus repetition probability in determining zzso and shows that the effect is zzso to the retinal position of zzso
