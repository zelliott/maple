We have developed methods for rapidly generating zzso zzso zzso for use in education, training simulations and procedure zzso By zzso local surface features of zzso wounds onto patient images and zzso models, one can zzso generate large patient zzso from a small initial zzso zzso The wound database is generated from clinically captured photographic zzso The wound image is extracted from the image of the surrounding zzso The zzso anatomy database is generated from zzso scans and from multiple photographic zzso zzso wound images can be moved rotated and scaled and blended in the final zzso
