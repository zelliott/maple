This paper aims to study the abnormal patterns of brain zzso metabolism zzso in zzso disease zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso patients compared to zzso healthy controls zzso using the zzso Disease zzso Initiative zzso zzso The local cerebral zzso rate for zzso zzso in a set of 90 structures belonging to the zzso zzso was obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso data in resting zzso It is assumed that brain regions whose zzso values are significantly correlated are functionally zzso therefore, when metabolism is altered in a single region, the zzso will affect the metabolism of other brain areas with which it zzso The zzso metabolism network zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso among all pairs of zzso was studied using the graph theory zzso The highest concurrent fluctuations in zzso were basically identified between zzso cortical regions in all zzso zzso differences in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso groups as compared to NC were zzso The zzso and zzso patients showed zzso patterns in comparison to NC subjects, as detected by global and local network properties zzso and local efficiency, zzso index, and zzso zzso network's attributes showed an intermediate position between NC and zzso corroborating it as a transitional stage from normal aging to zzso zzso Our study is an attempt at exploring the complex association between zzso zzso zzso zzso and the attributes of the brain network organization in zzso and zzso
