To evaluate the capabilities of delayed enhanced zzso CT zzso performed immediately after zzso coronary intervention zzso in predicting zzso zzso obstruction zzso formation assessed by delayed enhanced zzso zzso 

zzso patients presenting with a primary acute zzso zzso successfully zzso by zzso underwent a zzso immediately after zzso and a zzso within zzso The left zzso was split into 64 zzso rated as zzso zzso or zzso on zzso Their mean density was measured on zzso and calculated relative to the patient's mean healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso early zzso were also zzso zzso and specificity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso detection was calculated for mean CT relative density zzso determined from a zzso zzso zzso early zzso and zzso 

Mean CT relative density was higher in zzso zzso than in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso leading to a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso for a zzso of zzso zzso and specificity were respectively zzso and zzso for zzso early zzso and zzso and zzso when considering the two zzso 

zzso performed immediately after zzso allows for an accurate prediction of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso obstruction zzso is an important zzso sequel following zzso zzso zzso zzso can be accurately predicted by zzso CT zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso areas can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso may become a useful zzso tool for acute zzso zzso
