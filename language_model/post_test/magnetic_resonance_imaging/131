We know that hearing impairment affects a large part of the zzso In cases of profound and bilateral hearing loss, children may have problems in speech development, as well as communication and zzso zzso implants have been used as a treatment option in these zzso Today, inner ear zzso is a mandatory test in the zzso evaluation of these zzso In our daily zzso we wonder whether zzso can provide not only zzso but also quantitative data, with real cochlear linear values built from three dimension zzso 

The aim of the present investigation is to propose a method to obtain zzso cochlear length measures from the zzso bones of zzso 

We assessed three zzso images from the zzso of six zzso By overlapping zzso rulers on these images it was possible to measure cochlear zzso 

These measures varied between 17 and zzso zzso 

We have concluded that it was possible to measure cochlear length from three zzso zzso images, by employing the method hereby zzso
