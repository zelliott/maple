To describe the prenatal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings suggestive of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This retrospective case series included fetuses referred to our institution for brain zzso between 2007 and 2012, which were diagnosed with zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso or zzso The type of zzso associated zzso and associated zzso are zzso 

We included 11 fetuses zzso female, two zzso with a mean zzso age at diagnosis of 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were small and diffuse zzso large and multiple zzso or single zzso A targeted ultrasound examination performed before fetal zzso missed the diagnosis in four cases (one diffuse and three zzso a further ultrasound examination performed after zzso diagnosed zzso in two of these four zzso zzso was present in six cases (four unilateral and two zzso zzso appeared in all cases as zzso of intermediate zzso protruding into the zzso zzso In all cases of diffuse zzso the frontal horns and bodies of the lateral zzso appeared square in shape on zzso view, with irregular borders on zzso zzso Associated cerebral zzso were observed in seven cases and included corpus zzso zzso zzso with additional zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also present in two zzso zzso zzso was performed in five of the six cases of isolated small and diffuse zzso in female zzso and demonstrated zzso in two of zzso
