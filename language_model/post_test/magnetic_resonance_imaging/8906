During rest, multiple cortical brain regions are functionally linked forming zzso zzso This high level of functional connectivity within zzso networks suggests the existence of direct zzso connections between these functionally linked brain regions to facilitate the ongoing zzso zzso zzso White matter tracts are the structural highways of our brain, enabling information to travel quickly from one brain region to another zzso In this study, we examined both the functional and structural connections of the human brain in a group of 26 healthy subjects, combining 3 zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with diffusion zzso imaging zzso Nine consistently found functionally linked zzso networks were retrieved from the zzso zzso The diffusion zzso imaging scans were used to reconstruct the white matter pathways between the functionally linked brain areas of these zzso zzso Our results show that well-known anatomical white matter tracts zzso at least eight of the nine commonly found zzso networks, including the default mode network, the core network, primary motor and visual network, and two zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the functionally linked zzso networks reflect the underlying structural connectivity architecture of the human zzso
