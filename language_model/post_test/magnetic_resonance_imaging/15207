We present a new zzso approach for regional group zzso analysis in zzso zzso The method restricts anatomical zzso spatial smoothing and random effects statistical analysis to the space inside and around a structure of zzso zzso involves finding zzso zzso between manually outlined masks, and it zzso the continuous zzso zzso which makes it possible to extend zzso shape zzso to the space inside and outside of zzso Our approach is an alternative to zzso zzso in cases where the latter may fail due to anatomical zzso or zzso It also provides an opportunity to analyze the shape and thickness of structures zzso with functional zzso We apply the technique to the zzso and evaluate it using data from a visual scene zzso zzso study, where zzso in the zzso is zzso We produce detailed statistical maps of zzso zzso as well as maps comparing zzso inside and outside of the zzso We find that random effects statistics zzso by the new approach are more significant than those produced using the zzso zzso zzso framework zzso zzso Holmes, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1994, zzso zzso maps in functional zzso a general linear zzso Human Brain zzso zzso zzso at low levels of zzso suggesting that greater specificity can be achieved by the new method without a severe zzso in zzso
