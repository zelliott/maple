In a large zzso study, a multinational consortium has recently identified a common genetic variation in zzso being associated with zzso zzso Here, we explored whether this quantitative trait locus also affects zzso function using a previously established reliable zzso zzso We observed a significant effect of zzso variation in the right zzso showing that zzso zzso increased with the number of risk zzso Furthermore, the risk zzso was associated with decreased performance in a verbal learning and memory zzso By showing that this zzso zzso also relates to behavioral difference and underlying brain zzso in memory, our findings support the idea that zzso may affect the individual capacity to resist disease in terms of diminishing or boosting zzso zzso
