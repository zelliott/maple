The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate preliminary results of an zzso surgical technique for patients suffering from chronic Achilles zzso 

Case zzso 

zzso operations were performed on 7 consecutive patients involved in recreational sports suffering from chronic Achilles zzso zzso zzso in whom conservative treatment had zzso zzso included 2 patients with pure zzso 4 with zzso and degenerative zzso and 1 with a chronic partial zzso Patients were preoperatively and zzso evaluated at a mean follow-up period of 16 months zzso 6 to 27 zzso with a zzso points rating zzso All patients were studied preoperatively with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and 6 were re-evaluated with the same procedure after zzso All surgical interventions were performed on an ambulatory basis and 5 under local zzso The surgical zzso technique consisted of zzso release and zzso in cases with pure zzso In addition, 2 zzso zzso were performed in cases with degenerative zzso or partial zzso 

According to the scoring system used, all 7 patients had improved final outcome after surgery from a mean of 39 points preoperatively to 88 points zzso The patient with an AT partial tear achieved the lowest zzso The only complications were a minor zzso and zzso that resolved zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso failed to show evidence of degenerative zzso 

zzso surgery may be a valid alternative to treat Achilles zzso unresponsive to conservative treatment because of potential lower zzso
