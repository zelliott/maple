zzso evidence suggests that spatial knowledge derived from ground-level navigation can consist of both route and survey zzso zzso and zzso studies aiming to identify the neural structures responsible for topographical learning in humans have yielded partially inconsistent results, probably due to the lack of an effective behavioral zzso allowing for a reliable distinction between different zzso zzso we employed a novel virtual reality environment that provides accuracy and reaction time measures precisely indicating the emergence of route zzso survey zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to zzso brain regions involved in the acquisition of pure route knowledge in the form of associations between consecutive landmark views and the direction of intermediate zzso Participants were scanned during repeated zzso of the complex environment from a zzso ground-level zzso zzso data revealed emerging route knowledge in 11 out of 14 zzso zzso comparisons between zzso and control conditions identified zzso in zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso inferior zzso zzso Most importantly, only zzso inferior zzso regions showed increasing zzso across sessions, thus zzso behavioral measures of route zzso Given the established role of the zzso zzso zzso in spatial processing, this area is thought to provide the pivotal spatial link between two landmarks encountered in immediate zzso zzso
