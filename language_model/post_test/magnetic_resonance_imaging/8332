To assess auditory processing, hearing difficulties, and brain magnetic resonance zzso imaging abnormalities in children with zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

Great Ormond Street Hospital and Institute of Child zzso 

Eleven case subjects with zzso zzso and 11 zzso and zzso healthy control zzso 

All subjects completed a structured hearing zzso baseline zzso and central auditory tests zzso speech tests, frequency and duration pattern tests, and zzso zzso Case subjects underwent brain MR imaging with zzso and the results were compared with those of zzso and zzso healthy control subjects randomly selected from the zzso and Physics Unit zzso 

Brain MR imaging, central auditory test results, and questionnaire zzso 

The corpus zzso area was significantly smaller on brain zzso in the cases compared with the zzso The anterior zzso was small in 7 cases and was normal in 3 cases on visual inspection of brain MR images zzso in 10 of 11 zzso zzso showed no abnormalities in any of the zzso Central auditory test results were normal in all the controls and were abnormal in all the cases except for 1 case with a pattern of abnormalities consistent with reduced auditory zzso zzso The cases had greater difficulty zzso sound and understanding speech in noise than the zzso 

Despite normal zzso children with zzso zzso may experience auditory zzso transfer deficits and have difficulty zzso sound and understanding speech in zzso In view of their additional visual difficulties, thorough zzso evaluation of these children is indicated to initiate appropriate zzso
