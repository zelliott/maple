zzso in zzso languages has been extensively investigated and suggests a central deficit in orthography to zzso mapping in the left zzso Compared to zzso in zzso languages, the central deficit for Chinese zzso is still zzso Because of the zzso nature of Chinese characters, some have suggested that Chinese zzso should have larger deficits in the semantic zzso To investigate this, Chinese children with reading disability zzso were compared to typically developing zzso children using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso on a zzso judgment task and on a semantic association judgment zzso zzso children showed less zzso for both tasks in right visual zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting a deficit in zzso zzso zzso children also showed less zzso for both tasks in left inferior frontal zzso zzso which additionally showed significant correlations with zzso of bilateral zzso regions in the zzso group, suggesting that the abnormalities in frontal zzso and in zzso zzso regions may reflect a deficit in the connection between brain zzso zzso failed to reveal larger differences between groups for the semantic compared to the zzso task, suggesting that Chinese zzso is similarly impaired in the access to zzso and to zzso from the visual zzso
