This study investigated the accuracy of prediction of zzso outcome at 1 year using cerebral zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and structured zzso neurological assessment in term infants after presumed zzso brain zzso zzso control infants and 28 infants with presumed zzso brain injury underwent zzso MRS zzso Studies were carried out as soon as possible after the cerebral zzso most within 48 zzso zzso had an early structured neurological assessment at a median of 19 hours zzso 0 hours to 9 zzso from the presumed zzso insult and a late assessment at a median of 7 days zzso 3 to 25 zzso during zzso The maximum cerebral zzso ratio zzso measured by zzso MRS accurately predicted adverse outcome at 1 year with a specificity of zzso and positive zzso value of zzso Neurological assessment had a tendency for zzso zzso However, both early and late neurological examination can be used as a reliable indicator for a zzso outcome at 1 year having negative zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso
