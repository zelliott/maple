The authors studied 33 musculoskeletal zzso comparing zzso zzso with zzso pathological evaluations based on zzso zzso Fifty-one sites were investigated to determine the clinical significance of a low signal intensity line zzso on the outer margin of the tumor zzso zzso at different sites were counted as individual cases, since they sometimes showed different characteristics at different zzso An zzso showing a consistent zzso and no change on either of two zzso images zzso or zzso was evaluated as a strong zzso and was thought to represent a barrier preventing tumor zzso In cases showing a strong zzso zzso beyond the line can provide a safety margin, even if zzso as a marginal procedure according to the zzso zzso In cases showing only a faint zzso a high rate of tumor cell presence was observed external to the line; in such cases the surgical plan must be focused on the zzso of a zzso zzso
