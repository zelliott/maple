Clinical zzso suggests that a sharp increase in the number of enhancing zzso should signal an increased risk of zzso The zzso of zzso recommends that subjects exhibiting at least five zzso over the baseline level be referred for closer zzso This rule has been used as an informal safety criterion with limited formal zzso 

The purpose of this study was to determine the best threshold for the rule and to demonstrate its zzso zzso for risk of subsequent relapses for multiple sclerosis zzso zzso 

We used zzso zzso modeling to apply the rule to patient data from a phase II clinical zzso zzso zzso was zzso using rate ratios and receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

We found that, for these data, a threshold of five zzso over the baseline constituted the best definition of a zzso Overall, zzso of subjects broke the rule at least zzso Breaking the rule increased the odds of imminent zzso by a factor of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

Breaking the rule of five was found to be a significant predictor of an imminent zzso zzso of follow-up and the number of zzso discovered via magnetic resonance imaging zzso were also significant zzso of zzso
