Digital Image zzso zzso zzso as well as Nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso using an especially developed imaging routine for zzso are suitable tools for the assessment of the anatomical conditions when mechanical problems are supposed to occur during birth zzso zzso zzso zzso A concept for an zzso evaluation procedure of these imaging techniques has been developed, zzso a more elaborate measuring zzso easily and precisely zzso due to appropriate software packages being implemented in the diagnostic units, calculation of zzso relevant parameters not zzso immediately from the imaging zzso This is possible by means of multiple zzso analysis of a data base from zzso evaluated female pelvis zzso zzso calculation of zzso soft tissue place requirements by means of zzso analysis of female zzso zzso and zzso empirical determination of cut off values in borderline zzso zzso evaluating 190 zzso by means of zzso zzso of the according zzso zzso The calculations necessary to obtain all these parameters are implemented in a software package which also contains an zzso for the general zzso of an individual zzso Thus, a rather sophisticated knowledge base for pelvic assessment becomes easily zzso
