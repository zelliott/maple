zzso positioning has been suggested as an alternative to the conventional zzso position for patients receiving breast zzso but few data exist on how this may alter heart zzso We zzso zzso compare the zzso location of the heart in the prone and zzso positions in patients treated for breast zzso 

In 16 patients treated with zzso photons for breast cancer, the zzso zzso planning images zzso in the zzso zzso and diagnostic magnetic resonance images zzso in the prone zzso were zzso For each case, the distance between the anterior zzso and the anterior chest wall was measured at nine specific points; three points at each of three zzso zzso The differences in the zzso between the prone and zzso positions were compared with the zzso zzso zzso 

There is a systematic displacement of the lateral and superior aspect of the heart closer to the chest wall in the prone zzso zzso position zzso displacement 19 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso the zzso and inferior aspects remain zzso There was also a reduction in volume of lung zzso between the heart and chest wall when prone zzso decrease of 22 zzso p zzso zzso for zzso 

The superior and lateral aspects of the heart typically move zzso during prone positioning compared with the zzso zzso This may have negative consequences in situations in which the high-risk target zzso include the chest wall or deep zzso
