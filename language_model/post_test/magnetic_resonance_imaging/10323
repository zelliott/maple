zzso is a zzso of cognitive processing with stimulus repetition that can occur without explicit zzso Whereas the functional zzso of zzso zzso at retrieval is established, zzso processes that initiate zzso and explicit memory have not yet been zzso zzso and we investigated them using zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso predicting later explicit memory occurred in the bilateral zzso zzso lobe zzso and left prefrontal zzso zzso zzso predicting later zzso did not occur in these areas, but rather in the bilateral zzso cortex, left zzso zzso and bilateral inferior zzso areas linked with stimulus zzso Surprisingly, these regions showed response zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso and explicit memory have distinct functional zzso at zzso with zzso zzso being specific for explicit memory, and suggest that zzso is initiated by sharpness of neural responding in stimulus identification areas, consistent with recent zzso evidence regarding zzso neural zzso at zzso We tentatively suggest that this zzso responding at zzso may set the stage for increased neural processing efficiency at zzso with these different neural mechanisms both leading to observed zzso zzso zzso and argue that neural zzso at zzso and not just at zzso will be critical in resolving the debate about the neural mechanisms of learning that zzso zzso
