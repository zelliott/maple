The advent of ultrasound and zzso zzso resulted in a great increase in detection and diagnosis of small zzso zzso zzso These are mainly slow growing tumors, without zzso disease and with possible zzso at the zzso zzso there is not agreement about the best treatment for the small zzso 3 zzso zzso cell zzso In this paper the role of zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance for detection and characterization of the small zzso masses is zzso On occasion it is possible to obtain the tissue characterization of a solid zzso mass by diagnostic imaging (for example zzso however, most zzso solid zzso masses have an zzso zzso The majority of problematic zzso masses have zzso zzso The diagnosis of simple zzso is based on few simple but rigid criteria: homogeneous water density, very thin wall, well defined and sharp interface with zzso zzso lack of contrast zzso When there are zzso zzso thickened wall or increased density, the zzso is zzso In these cases the zzso suggested by zzso can be zzso zzso zzso are simple zzso they do not require any further zzso zzso zzso are minimally complicated but reliably benign zzso zzso wall, thin zzso thin zzso Some of these zzso require zzso and the majority of them do zzso zzso have thick zzso thick zzso and thick and irregular walls, but not contrast zzso In most cases these zzso require surgical exploration for diagnosis and zzso zzso zzso zzso are clearly zzso they are indicated by contrast enhancing regions within zzso They always require zzso
