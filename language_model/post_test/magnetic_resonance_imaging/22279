We report two cases of zzso zzso after zzso zzso This is rare, with only one other reported case in the zzso 

We report two patients who presented after blunt cervical and head zzso Plain films revealed that each patient had zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging revealed the delayed development of zzso zzso zzso zzso was noted in both zzso 

The surviving patient showed marked neurological improvement and resolution of his zzso after zzso zzso 

For patients with closed head injuries who develop zzso zzso we recommend zzso zzso zzso to assess for the presence of zzso In patients with zzso dislocation, delayed neurological deterioration warrants magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso junction to rule out zzso zzso
