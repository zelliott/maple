zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso We zzso that CDs clinically emerging in the early developing brain tend to extend into zzso or larger zzso networks to pronounce zzso in contrast to CDs which clinically emerge at a later zzso 

We evaluated the spatial and zzso profiles of zzso zzso patterns in children with zzso confirmed zzso We designated Group A as children with changing zzso zzso patterns over time, and Group B without zzso We compared seizure profiles, consecutive scalp zzso zzso zzso zzso and surgical zzso 

We found 14 children consisting of 10 Group A patients (7 zzso and 4 Group B patients (all zzso Eight zzso Group A patients had their seizure onset zzso years while all Group B patients had seizure onset zzso years zzso Changes of zzso onset zzso pattern in Group A consisted of bilateral (4 zzso extending zzso extending and bilateral zzso and generalized zzso We saw zzso zzso zzso and single clustered zzso spike sources zzso in zzso Six patients underwent surgery before 15 years of age, and 4 of them attained seizure zzso All 4 Group B patients had zzso zzso and single clustered zzso Three patients underwent surgery after 15 years of zzso All 4 patients attained seizure zzso 

zzso zzso patterns change over time in children with early seizure onset and intractable zzso caused by zzso Younger zzso children with CD more frequently have zzso zzso zzso or larger zzso zzso Early zzso of CD, guided by zzso zzso and zzso video zzso resulted in seizure freedom despite changes in zzso zzso zzso
