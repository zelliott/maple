The aim of this work was to realize and clinically evaluate an image fusion platform for the integration of zzso zzso and zzso data into the zzso images of an zzso zzso system with a focus on zzso zzso A vertically open zzso T zzso scanner was equipped with a dedicated navigation system enabling the registration of additional imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso acquired data zzso These merged image data served as the basis for zzso planning and zzso zzso So far, the system has been used in 70 zzso interventions (13 of which involved image data zzso 15 minutes extra zzso The zzso navigation system is characterized by a higher frame rate and a higher image quality as compared to the zzso navigation based on continuously acquired zzso real time zzso Patient movement and tissue shifts can be immediately detected by monitoring the zzso differences between both navigation zzso The zzso image fusion allowed a refined navigation planning especially for the zzso of deeply seated brain zzso or zzso close to eloquent zzso zzso zzso orientation and instrument guidance improve the safety and accuracy of zzso zzso
