zzso sclerosis complex zzso can manifest with 3 principal zzso pathological entities: cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso giant cell zzso zzso The authors analyzed the location and growth of zzso zzso in a large cohort of patients with zzso 

After institutional review board protocol approval, the authors zzso reviewed brain zzso scans of zzso patients for whom at least 1 zzso stored zzso zzso study was zzso zzso data included location, size, and growth over time of all zzso zzso 

The authors reviewed zzso scans in 103 patients, who zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso zzso 157 zzso were located along the zzso groove zzso in 88 zzso Twenty zzso were operated zzso The remaining 339 zzso were distributed along the lateral zzso always in contact with the course of the zzso nucleus, and were presumed to be zzso Twenty-two patients with more than 4 years of follow-up had 34 zzso along the zzso of which 23 were stable in size and 11 zzso All other zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso showed the intimate association of zzso and the zzso nucleus in 1 zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso patients are located throughout the lateral zzso zzso Their location exclusively follows the course of the zzso zzso Only zzso along the zzso showed the potential to grow, and these were then identified as zzso The remaining zzso were zzso zzso why these zzso develop in relation to the zzso nucleus may offer insights into zzso
