The cerebral and zzso network involved in zzso continuous and discrete movements was studied in blood zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at 3 zzso 

Seven healthy right-handed volunteers were scanned zzso while drawing a circle with the tip of the right index finger zzso motor zzso and zzso while drawing a triangle with the tip of the right index finger zzso motor zzso 

In both motor tasks, extensive zzso were observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso insular, lateral zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso within red, zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso However, discrete movements were specifically followed by the recruitment of the left zzso cortex, right zzso nucleus and the second zzso zzso zzso and bilateral and stronger zzso of the zzso cortical areas, whereas continuous movements specifically activated the right prefrontal zzso and the lateral zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso 

We confirm the findings of previous studies showing partly distinct neural networks involved in monitoring continuous and discrete movements, but we found new differential neural zzso within the zzso insular and zzso zzso
