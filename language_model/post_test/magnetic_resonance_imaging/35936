zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging has developed rapidly to rival zzso as a zzso imaging zzso zzso detail may exceed that currently available using zzso techniques, and the ability to image moving zzso may compete with zzso color flow mapping in detecting zzso diseases and zzso Because of the considerable clinical experience with zzso as angled MR imaging planes become available as standard software packages, it may be useful for MR cardiac imaging to use standard, accepted zzso nomenclature and imaging zzso This article describes the principles used to obtain long and short axis MR images that are comparable with zzso imaging zzso Diagrams and illustrations are provided to orient the viewer using nomenclature common to zzso These views may eventually be useful for functional analysis of the left zzso and for detection and evaluation of zzso heart disease and zzso zzso
