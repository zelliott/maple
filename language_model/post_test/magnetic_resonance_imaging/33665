This paper describes a robust method for flow field mapping by zzso zzso fast passage zzso It provides a quick and simple way to simultaneously acquire flow profiles at several locations and arbitrary zzso inside the zzso The flow profile is the zzso evolution of the labeled flowing zzso zzso obtained using a carotid zzso and jet zzso are similar to the previous experimental studies employing zzso zzso zzso zzso and other flow zzso zzso In addition, the preliminary results obtained with a human volunteer support the feasibility of the technique for in zzso flow zzso
