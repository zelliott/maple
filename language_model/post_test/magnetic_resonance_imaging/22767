There still is a need for devices that allow zzso stimulation of skin areas of the human zzso We constructed a stimulation system and tested it by using brief zzso stimulation to the right thumb of nine healthy zzso zzso in response to tactile stimulation with zzso of 1, 3 and 5 zzso were measured using a zzso zzso zzso The stimulation device consists of synthetic zzso connected to plastic tubes capable of carrying compressed air, and an electronic zzso which controls the zzso and zzso of an electromagnetic zzso The valve near the zzso did not lower the image zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the stimulation site was reliably detected in response to a stimulus magnitude of zzso bar in all zzso 1 zzso stimulation resulted in higher zzso percentage zzso zzso Our device is an zzso low-cost and portable tool suitable for research and clinical zzso It permits passive zzso stimulation relevant for clinical assessments and is also compatible with zzso zzso and zzso zzso In basic and clinical research, this device therefore contributes to meaningful comparisons between results obtained with different zzso
