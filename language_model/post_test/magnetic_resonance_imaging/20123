To develop a zzso approach for zzso of vascular zzso from dynamic zzso imaging, a technique routinely used to measure cerebral blood volume zzso and flow in zzso 

This study describes a process for zzso both the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso transfer constant and zzso from dynamic zzso zzso The zzso was applied to data from the brains of 12 patients with grade IV zzso The stability of the method was zzso Estimates of zzso by this technique were compared to those of the conventional zzso 

The zzso was found to be insensitive to noise and to generate stable zzso estimates of zzso and zzso 

Using a single imaging zzso the three most important vascular properties, zzso cerebral blood flow zzso and zzso can be zzso This approach may have potential in clinical evaluation of patients with brain tumor or acute zzso zzso
