zzso language impairment zzso is a primary zzso disorder in which language is significantly more impaired than other zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings without clinical zzso are often zzso The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize the frequency of these zzso to describe them and to analyze their association with zzso clinical, zzso and evolution zzso 

The cases of 35 children with a diagnosis of zzso who also underwent zzso and zzso were systematically reviewed zzso 

In this population, aged between 4 and 7 years, zzso zzso of patients exhibited a specific expressive language disorder and 51% zzso a specific receptive zzso zzso percent of the children featured abnormal zzso zzso zzso were essentially localized on the left side of the brain and in two specific zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The groups with and without abnormalities were compared statistically with each other in terms of clinical, zzso and evolution zzso Evolution data were available for 24 patients through a telephone interview and for nine patients through a new complete language zzso comparison of the two groups showed significant differences in terms of severity of the zzso disorder, a higher number of delayed acquisition of walking and zzso and a higher range of non specific zzso zzso 

A large proportion of children suffering from zzso present abnormal zzso recordings with no clinical zzso This rate is much higher than in the general population and the abnormalities are essentially localized on the left side of the brain in regions known for their specific role in language zzso These abnormalities are more frequent in children with a severe zzso disorder, suggesting that they may share common zzso features with zzso 

The presence of zzso abnormalities in a large group of patients suffering from zzso associated with minor neurological abnormalities suggests a possible theoretical zzso zzso Minor zzso zzso genetically transmitted or acquired during the zzso or zzso period, may create vulnerability towards zzso This vulnerability, in conjunction with environmental influences such as family environment, linguistic zzso exposure to multiple languages, or zzso hearing loss, might take the form of zzso This hypothesis zzso the importance of prevention and early detection of zzso when identifying vulnerable zzso Monitoring the family early through parental guidance and early school support would facilitate the acquisition of zzso
