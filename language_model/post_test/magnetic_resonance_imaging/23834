In zzso MR imaging of zzso and zzso motion helps to evaluate diseases affecting zzso and zzso motion and to identify the specific zzso zzso A number of significant points have been zzso First, MR imaging flow studies can be useful in evaluating zzso spaces and zzso zzso Second, zzso and zzso motions occur in the spinal zzso and zzso Traveling wave motion occurs along the length of the spinal zzso Third, spinal zzso zzso is associated with decreased zzso zzso and loss of zzso displacement at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occur with lateral zzso zzso to the spinal zzso Fourth, in spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso is decreased by zzso and is normal in zzso patients with low zzso zzso zzso motion helps to rule out possible zzso in symptomatic zzso with zzso zzso in acquired and zzso symptomatic zzso spinal zzso motion is zzso zzso in symptomatic zzso zzso zzso flow and zzso motion decrease, but recover after surgical zzso and after zzso zzso zzso in zzso spinal zzso zzso motion is normal or zzso zzso spinal zzso with zzso zzso leads to diffuse zzso acceleration and prolonged zzso zzso zzso possibly related to the loss of the zzso mobility of the zzso Finally, focal spinal zzso leads to focal dynamic zzso deformation and can be associated with prominent zzso zzso When zzso is severe or zzso zzso motion is significantly zzso zzso cases demonstrate good recovery of zzso and zzso motion, unless zzso or obstruction is still zzso
