The purpose of this zzso zzso study was to correlate motor functional zzso zzso with cortical brain mapping by zzso stimulation using zzso reconstructed images of the surface of the brain, and to validate the spatial data of zzso in patients with brain zzso 

Fourteen patients with tumors of the zzso region underwent functional MR mapping of the hand region and subsequently cortical mapping before tumor zzso Data obtained with zzso and brain mapping were not known previously by the zzso and by the zzso respectively zzso zzso 

In each case, the results of direct cortical mapping matched those obtained with zzso both positively and zzso although the extent of the functional zzso was larger than the area required to elicit the corresponding movement during zzso brain zzso 

zzso can be used before surgery to assess motor functional area in patients with zzso zzso More studies are needed to validate during surgery the real extent of zzso zzso
