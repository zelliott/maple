zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has shown great utility in diagnosing soft tissue burden in zzso zzso though zzso measures of cartilage integrity have proven more zzso zzso zzso can reflect the zzso content of zzso however, it requires specialized hardware, acquisition zzso and long imaging zzso This study was designed to assess the potential of a clinically feasible sodium zzso acquisition to detect differences in the knee cartilage of subjects with zzso versus healthy controls zzso and to determine whether zzso changes in sodium content are observed at 3 and 6 zzso 28 subjects with primary knee zzso and 19 HC subjects age and gender matched were enrolled in this zzso zzso At zzso 3 and 6 months subjects underwent structural zzso and a zzso echo time zzso zzso sodium scan as well as the knee injury and zzso outcome score zzso and knee pain by visual analogue score zzso A standing zzso of the knee was taken for zzso zzso zzso A blinded reader outlined the cartilage on the structural images which was used to determine median zzso sodium zzso in each region of interest on the zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso all significantly separated the zzso and HC zzso zzso subjects had higher zzso sodium zzso most strongly observed in the lateral zzso lateral zzso and zzso zzso zzso There were no significant changes in cartilage volume or sodium concentration over 6 zzso This study has shown that a zzso sodium zzso at a moderate zzso field strength and imaging time with fluid zzso by zzso weighting significantly separated zzso from zzso zzso
