The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the zzso findings associated with acute zzso plateau zzso 

MR scans of 29 patients with acute zzso plateau fractures were analyzed zzso The images were evaluated for the presence of injuries involving the zzso cruciate and collateral zzso The presence of a zzso or a simple joint zzso was also zzso The zzso plateau fractures were classified according to the scheme devised by zzso 

Evidence of internal zzso of the knee was found in 28 zzso zzso zzso collateral ligament zzso injuries and lateral zzso zzso tears were noted most zzso zzso zzso tears were seen in zzso and zzso collateral ligament injuries were diagnosed in zzso zzso percent had anterior cruciate ligament injuries while the zzso cruciate ligament was injured in zzso Twelve zzso patients demonstrated the characteristic zzso features of a zzso zzso joint zzso were found in the remaining 17 zzso zzso 

MR imaging in patients with acute zzso plateau fractures commonly demonstrates associated zzso and zzso zzso By imaging in multiple planes, zzso can aid in the accurate characterization of zzso plateau fracture patterns and zzso
