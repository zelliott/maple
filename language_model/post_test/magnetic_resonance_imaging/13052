zzso zzso requires bilateral symmetrical movements of the facial muscles, but the zzso of the activated zzso zzso corresponding to the area of the face activated during lip zzso remains under zzso In this study, zzso zzso responses in the zzso zzso during zzso lip zzso were evaluated in a zzso magnetic field in zzso healthy right-handed zzso The results showed that the activated zzso area on the left side was larger than that on the right side, and there was a statistically significant difference in the number of activated zzso between the left and right zzso zzso in an individual study of the male group, although approximately symmetrical motor action zzso of facial muscles were recorded during lip zzso There was a statistically significant difference in interaction between the zzso zzso and left) and sex zzso and zzso and multiple comparison test showed statistical significant differences between zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso The peak value of the percent changes in zzso signal responses on the left side was approximately twice as high as that on the right side in the males of the group, though the bilateral zzso zzso was almost equally activated in the females in the zzso In addition, the left primary sensory area related to the face area was significantly activated as a region where Male was more active than Female in a general linear model zzso zzso zzso This study revealed the possibility that the left zzso zzso was more closely involved in zzso mouth movement in men, suggesting sex-related differences in zzso zzso zzso
