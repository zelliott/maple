Medical management of type B zzso dissection can result in progressive zzso of the false zzso and poor long-term zzso Recent studies using models of zzso dissection have suggested flow zzso such as stroke volume, zzso and zzso are related to zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess whether zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso can accurately zzso and zzso flow characteristics in patients with zzso dissection and whether these features are related to the rate of zzso zzso 

Twelve consecutive patients with medically treated type B zzso zzso dissection underwent a three-dimensional zzso zzso anatomy scan using a blood pool contrast zzso zzso phase contrast zzso data zzso zzso were acquired in the ascending and descending zzso and zzso zzso data were acquired in the entire zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were used to assess the quality of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Stroke volume, zzso and the direction of flow were calculated using zzso zzso and related to the rate of zzso expansion measured on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed good correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and no zzso bias zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso zzso The median zzso growth rate was zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso and this correlated well with the growth rate of the false zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso False zzso zzso zzso was seen in 7 of 12 patients and was not associated with reduced zzso expansion rate zzso present: zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso False zzso stroke volume and zzso were associated with more rapid zzso expansion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The position of the dominant entry tear was associated with rapid expansion, which tended to be higher with zzso vs zzso entry tears zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso flow was seen in the false zzso in 8 of 12 patients and was related to the rate of zzso expansion zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be accurately applied to zzso and zzso flow characteristics in patients with zzso zzso Stroke volume, zzso zzso dominant entry tears, and zzso flow are related to the rate of zzso zzso This study demonstrates the potential of this new imaging zzso A larger prospective study is now required to measure flow characteristics and determine their zzso value for risk zzso of patients with zzso zzso
