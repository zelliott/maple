We evaluated the efficacy and long-term outcome of the zzso diet in patients with intractable childhood zzso as a result of focal zzso of cortical zzso 

A retrospective analysis evaluated seizure outcomes of 47 patients who had intractable zzso from zzso surgically zzso focal zzso of cortical development and were first treated with the classic zzso diet, involving the zzso zzso zzso The long-term prognosis of 21 patients, who became zzso 3 months after the zzso diet, was followed up with that of 22 patients who eventually underwent zzso zzso 

Three months after diet zzso 29 zzso patients showed a reduction in seizure frequency of zzso including 21 zzso who became zzso Of the 21 patients with complete seizure control at 3 months, 16 zzso successfully completed the diet for 2 years without zzso and 10 zzso have remained zzso after zzso of the diet zzso follow-up for 3 years and 10 zzso including 1 patient who remained zzso with additional medication after a zzso Of the 22 patients who underwent zzso surgery, a zzso outcome was obtained for 13 zzso 

The zzso diet should be considered to be an additional option even in patients with focal zzso of cortical development, and long-term zzso outcome can be expected for patients who become zzso 3 months after the zzso
