Several zzso MR imaging studies have investigated zzso and sex-related cerebral volume changes in healthy human zzso most often by using samples spanning several decades of life and linear correlation zzso This study aimed to map the normal pattern of regional age-related zzso reductions specifically in the elderly zzso 

One hundred zzso eligible individuals zzso years of zzso were selected from a community-based sample recruited for the zzso Paulo zzso and Health zzso study, and a zzso MR imaging investigation was performed zzso with the second zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to conduct a zzso search for significant linear correlations between gray matter zzso volumes and zzso In addition, zzso masks were used to investigate whether the relationship between regional zzso zzso volumes and age would be best predicted by a zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso analyses revealed selective zzso of accelerated zzso loss exclusively in men, involving the zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, and zzso zzso zzso The only structure in which zzso zzso changes were best predicted by a zzso model was the left zzso zzso 

The variable patterns of age-related zzso loss across separate zzso and zzso regions highlight the complexity of degenerative processes that affect the healthy human brain across the life zzso The detection of age-related zzso zzso decrease in men supports the view that zzso in such regions should be seen as compatible with normal zzso
