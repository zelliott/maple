Loss of control is a prominent feature of zzso use disorders zzso and involves orchestrated activity from several brain zzso control zzso 

In this study, we determined the associations between zzso control network zzso and connectivity and zzso zzso 

To that end, we compared zzso (N zzso zzso zzso zzso (N zzso 30) users during a Stop Signal zzso First, we compared differences in neural response during response zzso via general linear model analysis within a zzso regions of zzso Second, we examined functional connectivity via zzso interaction zzso analysis between the right frontal control network zzso zzso and zzso control zzso 

There was no significant difference in network zzso between zzso and zzso users in any of the zzso control zzso However, preliminary findings using the zzso analysis showed that during successful response zzso zzso users had greater connectivity between right frontal control network and zzso zzso nucleus zzso network compared to zzso users zzso volume zzso zzso p zzso zzso Further, multiple zzso analyses on the zzso maps showed zzso effects of age of onset and quantity of zzso use in the zzso zzso 

Taken together, these findings suggest that functional connectivity between frontal control and zzso zzso networks during response zzso is sensitive to the effects of zzso severity unlike behavioral task performance and neural zzso in zzso control zzso Further, zzso of this zzso such as onset and quantity of zzso use, show attenuated effects with progression of zzso
