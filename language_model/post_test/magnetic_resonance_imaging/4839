The persistence of a zzso superior zzso zzso is the most common zzso of systemic zzso zzso Increased utility of cardiac imaging, in particular zzso techniques such as zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso will result in increased detection of the anomaly and its zzso zzso in the typical form it is often zzso zzso its discovery may have clinical significance nonetheless, and its mimics require zzso During cardiac development the anomaly results from a failure of the left anterior zzso vein to zzso zzso anatomical zzso include the absence of the right superior zzso zzso and of an zzso bridging zzso Typical drainage is to the coronary zzso zzso of which may be the first hint to the zzso Clinical implications with respect to vascular access and zzso are well zzso A significant minority drain into the left atrium, potentially creating a zzso significant zzso Additionally, differentiation from anomalous left upper pulmonary zzso drainage via a vertical vein is zzso A newly discovered zzso runs an zzso course with subsequent typical zzso and if not recognized as such, may be confused with a left zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso MR zzso has proven extremely helpful in characterizing anomalous zzso and we demonstrate how such techniques can help delineate the anomaly and differentiate from its zzso
