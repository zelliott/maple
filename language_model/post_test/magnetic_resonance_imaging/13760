While it is well known that longer duration of cardiac arrest zzso is often associated with poorer long-term outcome, the influence of resuscitation efficacy on zzso recovery is less zzso The objective of the present study is to investigate whether an inadequate and prolonged resuscitation after a shorter CA can lead to worse long-term outcomes than an effective resuscitation after a longer CA, provided that the total time from the onset of CA to the return of spontaneous circulation is zzso 

zzso rats were zzso into 2 groups with nominal 9 minutes zzso 1) and 15 minutes zzso 2) of zzso zzso zzso Each group was further divided into 2 zzso on the basis of the duration of resuscitation efforts (labeled as S and L for short and long, zzso Thus, the zzso and nominal resuscitation times were 8 and 1 minute, respectively, for group zzso 5 and 4 minutes for group zzso 14 and 1 minute for group zzso and 11 and 4 minutes for group zzso zzso zzso was measured continuously at the zzso zzso level before, zzso and after the CA, with the use of the zzso spin labeling zzso zzso The survival time, zzso damage, and neurological deficit were evaluated 5 days after zzso 

Groups zzso and zzso had nearly the same duration of CA zzso zzso zzso minutes, zzso versus zzso zzso zzso minutes, zzso The same is true for groups zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso minutes, zzso versus zzso zzso zzso minutes, zzso Despite longer zzso shorter and more effective resuscitation was associated with significantly improved long-term outcomes and higher cerebral zzso at the early stage of zzso 

zzso resuscitation increased early zzso and improved survival after zzso The clinical implication is that inadequate and prolonged resuscitation may have zzso effects on the recovery of CA zzso
