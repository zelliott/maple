The purpose of this study was to find a robust zzso paradigm to obtain reliable, zzso auditory zzso and characterize the zzso zzso of the auditory zzso in regard to the zzso zzso The extent of zzso and zzso of zzso was investigated utilizing functional magnetic resonance zzso Two tasks were zzso zzso repetitive stimuli of zzso zzso zzso consisting of alternating four A with four C piano notes and a zzso string of zzso zzso zzso which was a fast zzso sequence of piano zzso Eleven volunteers were zzso The zzso periods had a duration of 30 zzso and presented every 30 zzso All subjects demonstrated zzso signal activity in the superior zzso zzso zzso involving the primary and secondary auditory zzso except one subject who showed no zzso with the DO zzso zzso zzso more zzso than DO zzso zzso The bulk zzso for zzso and DO was slightly greater in the right hemisphere, although the primary auditory area zzso zzso was better activated on the left p zzso zzso area 22 was most frequently zzso dominant zzso zzso p zzso for DO and zzso zzso These findings appear to have implications in the examination of zzso zzso
