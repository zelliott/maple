Use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in individuals with orthopedic implants is limited because of the large zzso caused by metallic zzso As a possible solution for this problem, we suggest the use of zzso imaging zzso methods, which are immune to the zzso artifacts observed with conventional zzso zzso A further advantage of zzso based on the fact that signal zzso is achieved in zzso times (as short as tens of zzso is that they enable the direct zzso of the zzso elements of the zzso allowing the detection of possible implant zzso We present in zzso zzso images of zzso zzso of two hip zzso together with zzso images of gelatin zzso containing their respective metallic zzso These data underscore the great potential of the zzso technique for obtaining zzso images of individuals with large metal zzso
