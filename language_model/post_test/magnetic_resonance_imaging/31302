The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical importance of zzso obstruction zzso on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso comparing it with the zzso zzso index zzso assessed using zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in 33 patients within 7 days after zzso of a zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso injection of zzso zzso images were obtained with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the left zzso cavity and in zzso sections were generated and then the zzso was assessed by the maximum slope zzso Late enhancement zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso According to the zzso of zzso the patients were classified into 3 groups: Group 1 included patients with localized zzso zzso Group 2, patients with zzso zzso Group 3, patients having zzso with zzso In cases of anterior zzso the zzso for the anterior wall and parts of the inferior wall in Group 3 was significantly lower than that for Group 1 and zzso For inferior zzso the zzso for parts of the inferior wall in Group 3 was significantly lower than that for Group 1 and zzso 

zzso is related to lower zzso indicating severe zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso is an important marker of zzso status after zzso zzso
