zzso at rest or during effort is not uncommon in patients with zzso zzso zzso even those with a successful repair or mild degree of zzso zzso factors and functional abnormalities have been proposed as causes of this zzso Recently, zzso arch geometry was reported in association with hypertension at rest in patients with successful zzso zzso zzso patients (age zzso zzso zzso zzso without significant obstruction at rest zzso zzso zzso zzso at rest zzso or zzso zzso zzso were selected for the zzso All patients underwent a zzso zzso exercise test and magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso zzso arch shape was defined on global geometry as normal, zzso and zzso Percentage of zzso narrowing zzso was also zzso zzso patients zzso showed zzso hypertension zzso Regarding the shape of the zzso arch, normal geometry was present in 17 patients zzso 9 zzso had gothic zzso and 15 zzso had zzso zzso There were no differences among the 3 zzso in regard to the zzso of zzso zzso in normal, zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso or AN zzso in normal, zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso In conclusion, our results fail to show a correlation between a specific zzso arch shape and the zzso of zzso and significant AN in patients with native or residual zzso or repeat zzso zzso at present, the role of zzso arch geometry in identifying patients at risk of zzso is still zzso
