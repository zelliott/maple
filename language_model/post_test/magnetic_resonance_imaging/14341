A new zzso pulse, which can induce uniform and arbitrary flip angles despite the presence of zzso zzso magnetic field zzso zzso is employed for 3-D fast imaging using a single surface zzso for pulse transmission and signal zzso Computer calculations and zzso zzso and human surface zzso imaging experiments demonstrate the utility of this zzso pulse for zzso imaging with a zzso zzso which generates a highly zzso B1 field zzso
