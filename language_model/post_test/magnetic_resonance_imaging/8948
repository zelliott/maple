The purpose of our study was to investigate the efficacy of zzso lateral knee zzso in the diagnosis of knee zzso compared with an zzso reference standard, to evaluate reader experience in zzso assessment, and to establish a new threshold for zzso zzso measurement for the diagnosis of zzso 

zzso and third-year zzso residents and an attending musculoskeletal zzso zzso assessed 108 zzso lateral knee zzso for qualitative grading of joint fluid and quantitative measurement of the zzso zzso zzso and quantitative evaluation of zzso knee zzso examinations performed within 1 week of zzso was performed by two attending musculoskeletal zzso as a reference zzso 

zzso visual grading of zzso lateral zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso and accuracy of zzso for joint zzso zzso from previous work showing 4 zzso of fluid zzso the zzso zzso to 4 zzso on zzso zzso zzso the corresponding measurement on zzso lateral zzso was predicted to be 7 zzso Using this new criterion of zzso sensitivity, zzso and accuracy compared with an MR zzso zzso reference standard were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Historical data for overhead lateral zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso and accuracy of zzso 

zzso visual assessment of zzso lateral knee zzso is highly sensitive for the detection of joint zzso By performing quantitative evaluation with a new zzso criterion for zzso zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso and accuracy are equivalent to that of overhead lateral zzso
