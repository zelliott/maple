The aim was to describe zzso behavior during zzso limb activities and examine the zzso and stabilizing functions of the zzso Thirty healthy subjects were examined in the zzso position using a dynamic zzso system assessed simultaneously with specialized zzso zzso The zzso excursions zzso were measured at three zzso points in the zzso zzso the zzso positions zzso as related to a reference horizontal baseline were zzso zzso were taken during tidal breathing zzso and zzso zzso of upper or lower zzso against external resistance together with zzso Mean DE in both upper and lower zzso limb activities was greater compared with the zzso condition zzso zzso zzso with the effect greater for lower limb zzso zzso zzso in the upper and lower zzso activities were lower compared with zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower only for lower zzso activities zzso zzso zzso zzso was most affected at the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso portion of the zzso zzso correlated strongly with tidal volume zzso in all zzso Changes in zzso relative to the initial value were minimal for upper and lower zzso but were related to lower values of Vt zzso zzso zzso zzso involvement of the zzso in the limb zzso activities was zzso zzso zzso and zzso differed from the zzso conditions, especially in lower zzso zzso The differences between the percent changes of zzso zzso Vt found for lower zzso activities were confirmed by both zzso and zzso zzso recruitment in response to zzso zzso
