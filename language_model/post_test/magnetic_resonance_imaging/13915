Prospective cohort zzso 

To study the zzso value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of zzso spine fractures concerning the zzso and clinical zzso 

zzso about the proper treatment of zzso spine fractures is caused by zzso of conventional imaging zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso is capable of distinguishing injury to all structures of the fractured spine and thus may help develop schemes with higher zzso zzso 

A total of 53 patients with 71 fractures were studied with zzso in a prospective zzso A total of 24 patients with 39 fractures were treated conservatively and 29 patients with 32 fractures were treated zzso after a protocol concerning the treatment zzso zzso scans were obtained within 1 week of injury and at the zzso zzso zzso scores were obtained at the zzso zzso Previously described zzso schemes concerning the trauma and zzso conditions were zzso 

An zzso outcome in the conservative group was related to the progression of zzso which in most cases was predictable with the use of trauma zzso findings concerning the zzso zzso and zzso body zzso In the zzso treated group, recurrence of the zzso zzso was predictable by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex together with zzso zzso and zzso body involvement as seen on trauma zzso The authors recommend the use of zzso to develop reliable zzso criteria for these zzso
