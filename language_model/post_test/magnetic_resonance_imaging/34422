We have described a case of zzso of the zzso with extension into the adjacent soft zzso and zzso zzso Diagnosis and treatment were initially delayed due to the assumption that zzso in the thigh muscles seen on initial zzso represented zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a destructive zzso containing a zzso within the zzso indicative of zzso It was, however, the zzso imaging that dramatically demonstrated the full extent of the complicating zzso which extended downward to zzso and upward under the zzso muscles almost to the top of the zzso zzso This proved to be an invaluable guide for the zzso
