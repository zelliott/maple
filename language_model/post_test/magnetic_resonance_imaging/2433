We describe a double case of zzso in zzso siblings, suggesting the disease is sometimes zzso 

Two typical zzso zzso were observed in two zzso zzso The brother and the sister, whose parents were first cousins, developed the tumors at the same zzso 

The male patient was operated on using a zzso approach, and the tumor was completely zzso The patient remained free from recurrence 9 years after zzso His older sister died after tumor removal was attempted at another zzso 

To our knowledge, such a connection has never been reported in the zzso It suggests that zzso which is usually zzso can also be transmitted in an zzso zzso zzso
