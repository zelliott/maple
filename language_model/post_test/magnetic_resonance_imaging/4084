The aim of this study was to establish diagnostic criteria for zzso zzso and to determine whether there was any connection between zzso zzso and other common zzso and zzso zzso 

The normal position of the zzso body was assessed in 10 zzso zzso MR signs of zzso zzso were evaluated zzso in 60 symptomatic patients with pain in the knee, impaired mobility, and/or joint swelling who had no clear diagnosis after the evaluation of case history, clinical examination, and zzso The criterion for zzso of the zzso was defined as a distance of zzso or zzso 3 zzso between the peripheral border of the zzso and the edge of the zzso zzso 

In the volunteers, the mean distance from the zzso zzso to the edge of the zzso plateau was zzso zzso and that from the lateral zzso was 0 zzso In 55 symptomatic patients without zzso zzso the mean distance from the zzso to the edge of the zzso plateau was zzso zzso Five patients zzso had evidence of zzso zzso 4 in the zzso zzso and one in the lateral zzso The most commonly associated knee zzso was joint zzso in 5 knees and zzso in 2 zzso 

zzso zzso was not a rare finding with MR imaging in patients with painful zzso zzso zzso was associated with other knee abnormalities such as joint zzso or zzso
