In this study, quantitative trait zzso zzso for chemical and physical body zzso growth and feed intake in pigs were identified in a zzso zzso population, developed by crossing zzso zzso with a commercial dam zzso zzso data from 315 zzso animals were available for protein and zzso deposition measured in live animals by the zzso dilution technique at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso body zzso At zzso body weight, carcass characteristics were measured by the zzso grading system and after zzso Three hundred and zzso animals from 49 families were zzso for 51 molecular markers covering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Novel zzso for protein zzso content at zzso body weight and protein zzso zzso from 120 to 140 zzso were detected on zzso near several previously detected zzso for lean and fat tissue in neck, shoulder and ham zzso Another zzso for zzso zzso was found on zzso closely associated with a zzso for intramuscular fat zzso zzso for daily feed intake were detected on zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of a zzso for food conversion ratio zzso on zzso was associated with zzso for increased lean tissue and decreased fat zzso Because no zzso for growth rate were found in the region, the zzso for zzso is most likely due to a change in body zzso These zzso provide insights into the zzso regulation of chemical or physical body composition and its association with feed zzso feed efficiency and zzso
