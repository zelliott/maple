The study of neural plasticity has expanded rapidly in the past decades and has shown the remarkable ability of the developing, adult, and aging brain to be shaped by environmental zzso in health and after a zzso zzso experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso adjacent to a zzso in the zzso brain areas can take over progressively the function previously played by the damaged zzso It definitely is accepted that such a reorganization zzso zzso the zzso differences in zzso organization of the zzso zzso This reorganization largely zzso clinical recovery of motor performances and zzso integration after a zzso Brain functional imaging studies show that recovery from zzso strokes is associated with a marked reorganization of the zzso patterns of specific brain zzso To regain hand motor control, the recovery process tends over time to bring the bilateral motor network zzso toward a more normal zzso while zzso simultaneously new areas, perhaps to sustain this zzso zzso zzso zzso exists in zzso pattern changes over zzso Some patients display zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso suggesting the development of zzso strategies to compensate for the lost zzso The zzso in stroke often zzso a significant zzso of sensory and motor hand zzso outside the zzso areas, or enlargement of the hand zzso The zzso also zzso zzso although to a lesser zzso Although absolute values of the investigated parameters zzso across subjects, secondary to individual zzso zzso variation is minimal with regards to zzso differences, due to the fact that individual zzso characters are mirrored in the two zzso zzso zzso asymmetry of the zzso hand areas seems to be the zzso with highest sensitivity in describing brain reorganization after a zzso zzso and mapping motor and zzso cortical areas through focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is useful in studying hand representation and zzso zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso and zzso allow the detection of zzso areas zzso as a result of either zzso reorganization or recovery of the previously damaged neural zzso These techniques have the advantage of high zzso resolution but also have zzso zzso provides only zzso scalp zzso whereas zzso even if giving three-dimensional mapping of generator sources, does so by means of inverse procedures that rely on the choice of a mathematical model of the head and the zzso These techniques do not test movement execution and zzso integration as used in everyday zzso zzso and PET may provide the ideal means to integrate the findings obtained with the other two zzso This zzso combined approach is at present the best way to test the presence and amount of plasticity phenomena underlying partial or total recovery of several functions, zzso above zzso Dynamic patterns of recovery are emerging progressively from the relevant zzso zzso recruitment of the affected cortex, be it spared zzso zzso as in the case of cortical stroke, or intact but zzso cortex, as in zzso strokes, seems to be the rule, a mechanism especially important in early zzso zzso The transfer over time of preferential zzso toward zzso zzso as observed in some cases, seems, however, to reflect a less efficient type of plastic zzso with some aspects of zzso zzso zzso the use of the affected side can cause zzso to increase again in the affected side with a corresponding enhancement of clinical zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may represent recruitment of direct zzso zzso tracts and relate more to mirror movements, but it more likely reflects activity zzso within zzso zzso large-scale motor zzso Finally, zzso of areas not normally engaged in the dysfunctional tasks, such as the zzso prefrontal zzso or the superior zzso zzso in motor paralysis, might reflect the implication of zzso cognitive zzso An integrated approach with technologies able to investigate functional brain imaging is of considerable value in providing information on the zzso extension, zzso and functional hierarchy of cortical brain zzso zzso knowledge of the mechanisms regulating the long-term recovery (even if zzso observed for most zzso zzso after neural damage, might prompt newer and more zzso therapeutic and zzso strategies for zzso zzso
