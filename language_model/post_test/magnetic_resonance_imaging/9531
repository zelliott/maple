To study magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a tool for early diagnosis of zzso arthritis zzso in patients with early zzso arthritis zzso 

Patients zzso zzso zzso without a specific zzso diagnosis, but with zzso tender zzso and/or zzso swollen zzso among the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso weeks but zzso months, underwent clinical, zzso conventional zzso and zzso examinations and were followed up for zzso months for the final diagnosis of zzso or zzso Based on zzso zzso clinical, zzso and imaging parameters were selected for inclusion as explanatory variables in multiple zzso zzso analysis, with development of zzso as the dependent zzso A prediction model was developed, and its performance was tested and compared with that of a previous model developed by van der zzso zzso et al (the zzso zzso 

Of the 116 patients with early zzso 27 zzso developed zzso When the prediction model was applied, which included as explanatory variables presence of hand arthritis, zzso for zzso factor zzso morning zzso lasting zzso hour, and the zzso zzso in zzso Clinical Trials zzso summary score for bone zzso in the zzso and wrist zzso the outcome of zzso or zzso was correctly identified in zzso of the patients zzso zzso specificity zzso Another zzso value for the prediction index in the model would allow a higher specificity zzso and higher accuracy zzso but lower sensitivity zzso With the zzso model, zzso was predicted in zzso of the zzso 

zzso evidence of bone zzso in the zzso and wrist zzso is an independent predictor of future zzso in patients with early zzso A prediction model that includes the variables clinical hand arthritis, morning zzso zzso for zzso and bone zzso on zzso in the zzso and wrist zzso correctly identified the development or lack of development of zzso in zzso of zzso
