The question of how affective processing is organized in the brain is still a matter of controversial zzso Based on previous initial evidence, several suggestions have been put forward regarding the involved brain zzso zzso zzso dominance in emotional processing, zzso zzso dominance according to positive or negative zzso zzso one network for all emotional processing and zzso zzso discrete emotion zzso We examined these hypotheses by investigating intrinsic functional connectivity patterns that zzso with results of the Positive and zzso zzso Schedule zzso from 65 zzso This approach has the advantage of being able to test connectivity rather than zzso and not requiring a potentially zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity from 200 zzso covering the whole brain was zzso Positive and negative affect zzso with functional connectivity involving a shared set of regions, including the zzso prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, the visual zzso and the zzso In addition, each affective domain had unique connectivity patterns, and the zzso index showed a right zzso dominance for negative zzso zzso our results suggest a predominantly zzso network with zzso elements as the underlying organization of emotional zzso
