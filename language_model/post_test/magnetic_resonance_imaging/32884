The zzso detection of transplanted cells in damaged zzso and the zzso follow-up of cell fate and graft size are important for the evaluation of cell zzso We have shown previously that the zzso of the natural iron storage zzso zzso permits the detection of zzso cells in mouse heart by zzso but further imaging zzso is zzso Here, we report a systematic evaluation of zzso stem cell imaging in zzso mouse hearts in zzso using three zzso pulse sequences in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso echo zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with improved zzso equilibrium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not change zzso contrast in the zzso zzso zzso images, but showed a zzso reduction in signal intensity ratio in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were highly correlated with zzso assessments zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells transplanted to mouse heart did not change the zzso signal intensity, although zzso zzso was seen in some zzso These data support the use of zzso to track the survival, growth and migration of stem cells transplanted into the injured zzso
