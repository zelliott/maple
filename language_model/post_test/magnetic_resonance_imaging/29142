Previous studies have shown that clinical zzso of zzso nerve zzso is inaccurate as compared with MR imaging zzso The purpose of our study was to ascertain the added value of zzso zzso investigation of the zzso nerve zzso for the improvement of zzso zzso and for the zzso of patients for MR zzso 

We reviewed the zzso studies of the zzso zzso and the MR imaging studies of 20 patients with unilateral symptoms and signs related to the zzso nerve (40 zzso nerves zzso The results of the two studies were compared to assess the value of zzso in predicting MR imaging zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso was compared with zzso at MR zzso MR imaging was used as the standard of zzso 

Eight zzso of 20 patients had MR imaging findings related to presenting zzso symptoms, including five brain stem zzso and three peripheral zzso Fourteen zzso of 20 patients had zzso abnormalities related to presenting symptoms and zzso For brain stem zzso zzso zzso as shown by zzso corresponded well with MR imaging zzso zzso yielded a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a positive zzso value of zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso in predicting MR imaging zzso zzso agreement was good for both the zzso zzso and MR imaging zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso recordings of the zzso zzso can be used to exclude structural zzso in patients with symptoms related to the zzso zzso When a zzso is localized in the brain stem with zzso a tailored MR imaging examination of this region may be zzso
