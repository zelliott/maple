It is commonly accepted that the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso MR zzso zzso is zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso is considered the zzso spatial resolution barrier in the human zzso However, since local zzso zzso zzso zzso at high magnetic fields zzso are dominated by regional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reducing the zzso dimensions may increase zzso This could zzso in part, for signal loss with volume zzso It is shown that for two cubic zzso of sides zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as the volume decreases by zzso their zzso ratio is reduced by only zzso due to a commensurate zzso increase of zzso This is demonstrated in a phantom and the brains of volunteers, with zzso zzso in a zzso at 4 zzso It is shown that while the cubic zzso dimensions were all zzso reducing their volume zzso their zzso zzso decreased only zzso due to their zzso twofold zzso In other words, both spatial and spectral resolutions were doubled at a significantly, zzso zzso zzso zzso This advantage was exploited to produce quality high spatial resolution, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maps in a zzso zzso
