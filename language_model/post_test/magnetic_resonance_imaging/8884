zzso transplantation is an effective therapy for restoring zzso in zzso diabetes, but long-term zzso graft function is achieved only in a minority of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging of pancreatic zzso is an attractive option for zzso monitoring of graft zzso So far, previous studies have been performed in the absence of a standardized labeling procedure and, besides a feasibility study in patients, the effectiveness and safety of various labeling approaches were tested only with high field magnets zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso of a labeling procedure for human zzso with zzso contrast agent zzso zzso safety aspects of labeling related to inflammation and zzso quality of imaging both at 7 T and zzso zzso We have highlighted that the ratio of zzso is crucial for zzso zzso with a ratio of zzso zzso allowing successful in zzso imaging both with zzso T and zzso T magnets up to 143 days after zzso zzso With this standardized labeling zzso labeled zzso are neither inflamed nor more susceptible to inflammatory insults than zzso zzso This report represents an important contribution towards the development of a standardized and safe clinical protocol for the zzso imaging of transplanted zzso in zzso
