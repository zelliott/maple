The study of pain integration, in zzso within the human brain has been largely improved by the functional zzso techniques available for about 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by laser evoked zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso can nowadays generate maps of zzso or zzso zzso brain zzso zzso and zzso complement PET by their better zzso resolution and the possibility of individual subject zzso Recent advances in our knowledge of pain mechanisms concern zzso acute pain, zzso pain and investigation of zzso zzso The zzso studies using PET have demonstrated zzso zzso in thalamus, zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in right zzso and zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso can be modulated by attention zzso chronic pain, zzso selective attention to zzso and probably zzso zzso processes rather than pain zzso zzso in zzso zzso presumably zzso zzso aspects of pain perception while zzso zzso is particularly involved in particular aspects of pain discrimination zzso zzso In patients, zzso pain, angina and zzso facial pain result in PET abnormalities whose significance remain obscure but which are localized in zzso and anterior zzso zzso suggesting their distribution is not random while zzso responses remain zzso in zzso Drug or stimulation induced analgesia are associated with zzso of zzso zzso abnormalities associated with many chronic zzso The need to investigate the significance of these responses, their zzso zzso zzso their time course, the individual strategies by which they have been generated by zzso PET data with zzso and zzso results, are the challenges that remain to be addressed in the next few years by physicians and zzso To advance our knowledge of the mechanisms generating both abnormal pain and analgesia zzso and surgical zzso in patients is the main motivation of such zzso zzso
