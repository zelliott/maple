Because of their increased sensitivity to zzso extended signals, zzso tests are widely used to detect changes and zzso in brain zzso However, when images are zzso the zzso distribution varies depending on local zzso zzso tend to be large in smooth regions, resulting in increased false zzso while in rough regions, clusters tend to be small, resulting in decreased zzso zzso et zzso proposed a random field theory zzso method that adjusts cluster sizes according to local zzso of images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its effect on statistical zzso of zzso zzso Presented at the 8th International Conference on zzso zzso of the Human zzso June 2-6, 2002, zzso zzso Available on zzso in zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso 8 (1999) zzso In this paper, we implement this method in a zzso test zzso which requires very few zzso is known to be exact zzso zzso Blood zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso and is robust zzso 20 zzso zzso We compared our method to stationary zzso stationary zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using simulated data, we found that our zzso test performs well under any setting zzso whereas the zzso zzso test performs well only for smooth images under high zzso We also found that the stationary zzso test becomes zzso under zzso while both zzso zzso and zzso tests remain valid under zzso On a real PET data set we found that, though the zzso tests have reduced sensitivity due to zzso zzso zzso these tests have better sensitivity for clusters in rough regions compared to stationary zzso zzso We include a detailed and consolidated description of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
