The role of spinal networks in zzso is well investigated, but little is known about possible cortical contributions to zzso across a zzso 

The authors hypothesized that there are cortical zzso zzso to zzso in stroke patients with increased muscle tone of the wrist zzso 

Stroke patients and controls were scanned using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during slow and fast passive movements of the hand with simultaneous recording of passive movement resistance zzso 

Control participants had zzso activity zzso for slow than fast zzso of 2 types, in areas that were also more active in passive movement than rest zzso relative increase in zzso in zzso zzso and zzso was greater for slow than zzso and in areas that were also more active in rest than passive movement zzso relative decrease in zzso in zzso areas and zzso zzso zzso was greater for fast than zzso In the patient group, with large zzso variation of zzso we found an association between zzso and the zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso extending into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, supplementary motor area zzso zzso Area 45 zzso zzso and zzso Post hoc testing also revealed a similar correlation in zzso and zzso zzso in controls and showed that patients activated zzso zzso and zzso more than controls in the zzso zzso 

The findings suggest the possibility of zzso sensory and motor cortical involvement in zzso after stroke, which warrant further zzso
