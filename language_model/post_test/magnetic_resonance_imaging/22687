This study examined the hypothesis that low birth weight is associated with changes in regional zzso deposition as well as insulin sensitivity in adult zzso Eleven adult female twin pairs were studied by magnetic resonance to determine regional zzso Their insulin sensitivity was assessed by the zzso model zzso There were significant associations between birth weight and current zzso model assessment value zzso zzso abdominal visceral zzso zzso and subcutaneous fat volumes zzso zzso if the group of 22 subjects were analyzed as zzso There were no significant associations of the zzso pair difference in birth weight and differences between adult twins in these same variables possibly because of limited patient zzso zzso birth weight does zzso an increased risk of abdominal zzso as well as insulin resistance in twin populations as it does in the general zzso
