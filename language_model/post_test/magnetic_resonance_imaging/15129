zzso resonance imaging zzso has been widely used for the evaluation of zzso arthritis zzso with only a minority of studies considering other types of zzso This review is concerned with an evaluation of the zzso appearance of peripheral zzso in zzso arthritis zzso 

A zzso search was performed to identify all publications from the years 1985 to 2006 concerning zzso of the peripheral zzso and zzso Additional papers were retrieved by scanning the references to the zzso zzso Articles written in English, French, German, and Italian were zzso 

Most papers studied the hand and zzso and only few of them were concerned with the knee, foot, zzso joint, and zzso Patients with zzso showed often, but not always, a pattern of joint inflammation which extended beyond the capsule into the zzso zzso Bone zzso and zzso were less frequent than in zzso In particular, bone zzso at the zzso junction was seen, especially in the zzso The degree of zzso assessed by dynamic zzso was similar in zzso and zzso 

Data on zzso of the peripheral zzso in zzso are zzso Only few studies were specifically designed to evaluate the pattern of arthritis in zzso with most information zzso from papers where different types of arthritis were considered zzso An zzso origin of zzso has been proposed in contrast to the primarily zzso inflammation of zzso This zzso interpretation is likely to be true, but does not explain all cases of zzso and needs to be confirmed by further zzso
