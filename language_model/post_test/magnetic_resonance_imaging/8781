The zzso study seeks to identify clinical and biological markers of zzso disease in zzso individuals who have undergone zzso genetic zzso We compared baseline motor data between zzso carriers zzso and zzso carriers zzso using zzso and zzso Cases were zzso as near, zzso or far from diagnosis using a zzso zzso zzso volumes were calculated using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso Multiple linear zzso associated total motor score, motor zzso and individual motor items with estimated diagnosis and zzso zzso zzso total motor scores at baseline were associated with higher genetic probability of disease diagnosis in the near future zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and smaller zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Nearly all motor domain scores showed greater zzso with increasing proximity to diagnosis, although zzso and zzso were most highly associated with diagnostic zzso Among individual motor items, worse scores on finger zzso tandem zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show unique association with diagnosis zzso Even in this zzso population, subtle motor abnormalities were associated with a higher probability of disease diagnosis and smaller zzso zzso zzso assessment will help inform whether motor items will be useful measures in preventive clinical zzso
