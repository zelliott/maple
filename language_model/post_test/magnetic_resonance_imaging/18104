zzso zzso zzso has emerged as a powerful technique for assessing neural effects of psychoactive drugs and other zzso Several experimental approaches have been developed to use zzso in zzso and awake animal subjects, each of which has its advantages and zzso We sought to assess whether one particular method to scan alert zzso animals can be used to assess zzso effects of zzso zzso To date, the use of zzso as a method to compare pharmacological effects of zzso drugs has been zzso Such studies are important because zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso produce distinct profiles of behavioral effects related both to clinically desirable zzso zzso zzso and to zzso effects zzso abuse zzso This study sought to determine whether we could use our zzso approach to compare acute effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso intravenous doses of zzso and zzso zzso that do not affect zzso zzso zzso were acquired in alert male zzso zzso zzso to undergo zzso scans under restraint, absent excessive stress hormone zzso These zzso zzso activated bilateral zzso and nucleus zzso regions of zzso At the dose tested, zzso induced greater left nucleus zzso zzso zzso than zzso while zzso activated left zzso zzso nucleus more than zzso Our results suggest that our zzso approach could be zzso for comparing effects of zzso zzso
