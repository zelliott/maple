Although substantial evidence suggests that the prefrontal zzso zzso zzso processes that are critical for accurate episodic memory judgments, the specific roles of different zzso zzso remain zzso Here, we used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish between prefrontal activity related to operations that zzso influence processing of retrieval cues based on current task demands, or zzso are involved in monitoring the zzso of zzso Fourteen participants studied auditory words spoken by a male or female speaker and completed memory tests in which the stimuli were zzso foil words and studied words spoken by either the same speaker at study, or the alternate zzso On zzso test trials, participants were to determine whether each word was zzso regardless of the voice of the speaker, whereas on zzso test trials, participants were to additionally distinguish between studied words that were spoken in the same voice or a different voice at zzso Thus, on specific test trials, participants were explicitly required to attend to voice information in order to evaluate each test zzso zzso zzso BA 10), zzso prefrontal zzso BA zzso and inferior frontal zzso BA zzso regions were more active during specific than during general zzso zzso in anterior and zzso zzso was enhanced during specific test trials even in response to zzso items, suggesting that zzso in these regions was related to the differential processing of retrieval cues in the two zzso In contrast, differences between specific and general test trials in inferior frontal regions zzso BA zzso were seen only for studied items, suggesting a role for these regions in zzso monitoring zzso zzso from this study are consistent with the idea that different zzso zzso implement zzso but complementary processes that collectively support accurate episodic memory zzso
