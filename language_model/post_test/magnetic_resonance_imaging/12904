To determine the rate of treatment failure in patients outside of a controlled treatment trial and to ascertain the factors physicians used to make this zzso 

One hundred and thirty four patients with the diagnosis of zzso zzso multiple sclerosis zzso or clinically isolated symptom zzso enrolled in the zzso study zzso zzso Investigation of Multiple zzso at the Brigham and Women's zzso were treated with either zzso beta or zzso zzso as their initial treatment for zzso 

The probability of failing initial treatment within 3 years was zzso Clinical activity, defined as relapses and/or progression in zzso determined treatment failure in zzso zzso of zzso New zzso zzso or zzso zzso on zzso was used to define treatment failure in zzso zzso and new zzso zzso were used in combination with clinical activity in zzso zzso Treatment failures had a higher zzso zzso zzso volume zzso and number of zzso zzso zzso on the enrollment zzso than zzso 

These observations demonstrate that treating physicians use both clinical and zzso parameters to define a response to treatment and initiation of a treatment change and that baseline zzso identified those with increased risk of treatment zzso
