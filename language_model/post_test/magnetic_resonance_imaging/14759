To evaluate the properties of plaque by the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso it is necessary to use a material with stable signal intensity zzso muscle or zzso zzso as a zzso However, there may be differences between zzso zzso we used a small phantom set on the circumference of the neck as a zzso The signal intensity ratio zzso methods using the phantom as a reference were reviewed for discrimination of the properties of plaque in the carotid zzso 

Three zzso zzso 1: zzso phantom zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso and phantom zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were set around the zzso zzso was calculated for each region of interest and compared according to pathological zzso 

The method using a phantom as a reference reduced the standard zzso of tissue ratios to zzso from zzso in comparison with the method using muscle and showed a close correlation with pathological zzso In addition, the agreement rates with pathological grade and grades from each zzso using signal intensity of the phantom as a reference were higher than using signal intensity of the muscle as a reference to zzso from zzso for two-dimensional images and to zzso from zzso for three-dimensional zzso 

The method described here reduced error compared to the method using muscle as a reference, and the results were closely correlated with pathological zzso
