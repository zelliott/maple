The specific role of particular cerebral regions with regard to executive functions remains zzso We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study to segregate different network components underlying the Wisconsin zzso zzso Test zzso a test widely applied clinically to assess executive zzso Three different test zzso of the zzso differing in task complexity (A zzso B zzso zzso were contrasted with a high-level baseline condition zzso zzso zzso were extracted in a serial zzso approach zzso zzso zzso Imaging data were further subjected to a zzso analysis with individual behavioral zzso zzso A with the zzso revealed the entire neural network underlying zzso performance, including zzso regions and the zzso Further analysis showed that, within this network, right zzso prefrontal zzso related to simple working memory operations, while right zzso prefrontal zzso related to more zzso working memory zzso The zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and the zzso junction zzso represented an zzso network for error zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso and the right zzso prefrontal zzso was associated with increased zzso control in the context of increasing demands of working memory and cognitive zzso zzso zzso were found to be related to zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso and working memory representations zzso zzso cortex, zzso The data provide neural zzso for the different cognitive components involved in the zzso They support a central role of the right zzso prefrontal zzso in executive working memory operations and cognitive control functions but also suggest a functional zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
