Soft tissue zzso are characterized by their zzso With new diagnostic imaging techniques, low- and high-grade components of the tumor can be zzso Thus zzso should be guided by imaging to assure representative zzso Besides zzso the advent of zzso and gene expression analysis may allow more accurate zzso in the near zzso Gene expression profiling has already proven its value by finding new zzso in other tumor zzso Furthermore, this technique is a zzso tool to predict the response of a tumor to zzso and zzso zzso Up to now, response evaluation in zzso therapy is based on tumor size and not on vital tumor zzso Newer techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso can show the change of metabolism in zzso therapy and allow objective, comparative measurement of biological zzso The diagnostic of soft tissue zzso implies primarily a multidisciplinary approach for a stage associated zzso
