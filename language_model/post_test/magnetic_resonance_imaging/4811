To determine whether the echo time of magnetic resonance zzso and zzso imaging sequences may be important for the occurrence of high signal strength from zzso with pathological zzso imaging sequences with sufficient spatial resolution and very short echo times were developed for zzso zzso with standard zzso zzso The sequences were applied on the Achilles zzso of five healthy volunteers and seven patients with zzso Some affected regions inside tendon, probably corresponding with tissue with subtle zzso in the collagen zzso were only revealed in images recorded with very short echo times TE zzso 5 zzso whereas stronger zzso and zzso in liquids between the fiber zzso were also shown in images with longer echo times TE zzso 10 zzso zzso methods allow shorter echo times than zzso techniques for a given zzso system of the zzso and given spatial zzso So minimum echo time zzso sequences should be used for sensitive imaging of zzso zzso because no considerable signal zzso due to zzso effects were found in zzso
