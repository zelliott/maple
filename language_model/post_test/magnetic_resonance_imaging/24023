zzso causes progressive zzso Most patients with zzso have a zzso I zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso mechanisms underlying the progression of zzso associated with the zzso I zzso should improve strategies to halt progression of zzso 

The authors zzso studied 20 adult patients with both zzso I zzso and symptomatic zzso Testing before surgery included the zzso clinical zzso evaluation of anatomy by using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso evaluation of the zzso and zzso fluid zzso zzso and flow by using zzso zzso MR zzso and evaluation of zzso and cervical zzso pressure at rest, during the zzso zzso during jugular zzso and following removal of zzso zzso compliance zzso During surgery, zzso zzso and pressure zzso were obtained from the zzso cervical zzso and zzso zzso spaces and zzso Six months after surgery, clinical zzso MR imaging studies, and zzso pressure recordings were zzso Clinical examinations and MR imaging studies were repeated zzso For comparison, 18 healthy volunteers underwent zzso MR imaging, zzso MR imaging, and cervical and zzso zzso pressure zzso Compared with healthy volunteers, before surgery, the patients had decreased zzso diameters of the zzso and zzso zzso spaces at the zzso zzso In patients, zzso zzso at the zzso zzso was increased, but zzso flow was zzso zzso of zzso pressure across the zzso zzso to the spinal zzso space in response to jugular zzso was partially zzso Spinal zzso compliance was reduced, whereas cervical zzso pressure and pulse pressure were zzso zzso fluid flowed zzso during zzso and zzso during zzso on zzso MR zzso At surgery, the zzso zzso abruptly descended during zzso and ascended during zzso and the upper pole of the zzso contracted in a manner zzso with zzso descent and with the peak zzso cervical zzso pressure zzso Following surgery, the diameter of the zzso passages at the zzso zzso increased compared with zzso values, and the maximum flow rate of zzso across the zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso of pressure across the zzso zzso to the spinal zzso space in response to jugular zzso was normal and cervical zzso mean pressure and pulse pressure decreased to zzso The maximum zzso diameter decreased on MR imaging in all zzso zzso MR imaging documented reduced zzso and flow of the zzso zzso Clinical symptoms and signs improved or remained stable in all patients, and the zzso resumed a normal zzso 

The progression of zzso associated with zzso I zzso is produced by the action of the zzso zzso which partially zzso the zzso space at the zzso zzso and act as a zzso on the partially enclosed spinal zzso zzso This creates enlarged cervical zzso pressure waves that compress the spinal zzso from without, not from zzso and zzso zzso fluid zzso with each zzso which leads to zzso zzso The disappearance of the abnormal shape and position of the zzso after simple zzso zzso surgery suggests that the zzso I zzso of the zzso zzso is acquired, not zzso Surgery limited to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso eliminates this mechanism and eliminates zzso and its progression without the risk of more invasive zzso
