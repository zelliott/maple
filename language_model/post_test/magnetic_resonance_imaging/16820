To assess the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in liver tumors and normal liver and effects of motion and data acquisition time on zzso 

Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained for this prospective zzso The study complied with zzso zzso Two CT zzso scans were obtained zzso days apart in seven patients with liver tumors with two scanning zzso zzso 1: 30-second zzso zzso phase zzso six intermittent zzso zzso spanning 135 zzso Blood flow zzso blood volume zzso mean transit time zzso and zzso area product zzso for tumors and normal liver were calculated from phase 1 with and without rigid registration and, for combined zzso 1 and 2, with manually and zzso phase 2 images, by using zzso zzso zzso was assessed with zzso zzso of variation zzso and zzso zzso 

For tumors, zzso zzso zzso and zzso values and zzso varied by zzso method, the former by up to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Median zzso values doubled with the addition of phase 2 data to phase 1 zzso The best overall zzso was obtained with zzso registered phase 1 and phase 2 images, with zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso liver evaluations were similar, except with marginally lower zzso 

Absolute values and zzso of CT zzso parameters were markedly influenced by motion and data acquisition zzso zzso in particular, probably requires data acquisition beyond a single breath hold, for which zzso techniques are likely zzso
