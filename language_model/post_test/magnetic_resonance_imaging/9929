To evaluate zzso zzso in patients with type 2 diabetes using blood zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

The zzso values of zzso and zzso as well as cortical thickness were measured in 25 patients with type 2 diabetes and 30 normal zzso The associations between zzso values and clinical parameters were zzso 

The zzso zzso value of the patients with diabetes was significantly higher than that of the normal zzso No significant difference in cortical thickness was found between the patients with diabetes and the normal zzso The zzso zzso value increased with zzso in the patients with zzso 

zzso zzso is a zzso and efficient method to assess the zzso in different regions of zzso zzso of kidney in diabetic patients can be detected earlier by zzso zzso than traditional zzso
