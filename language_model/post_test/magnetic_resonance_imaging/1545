zzso zzso associated with zzso type 1 is classically thought to be primarily related to abnormal development of the zzso zzso We investigated the possibility that these changes may be zzso 

We conducted a retrospective review of zzso bone changes in all patients with zzso zzso type 1 who had undergone CT zzso zzso and MR imaging zzso zzso at our zzso A review of repeat images of 20 patients permitted analysis of progressive zzso bone zzso 

zzso patients had abnormalities of the zzso wings, 13 of whom also had enlargement of the middle zzso zzso compatible with descriptions of classic zzso zzso All the patients with zzso zzso had zzso in the zzso superficial zzso zzso that were often zzso with a zzso abnormal zzso zzso All except one had tumor zzso in the deep orbit, zzso with the zzso zzso Four patients had zzso evidence of progressive zzso bone changes over zzso 

The origin of zzso bone changes may be zzso A modified concept of zzso zzso is proposed that emphasizes interaction between zzso and zzso bone during skull zzso
