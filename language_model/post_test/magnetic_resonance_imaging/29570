zzso dominant zzso zzso constitute one of the most zzso zzso and genetically zzso groups of neurodegenerative zzso zzso 50 to zzso of the families carry zzso in genes known to be implicated in zzso zzso zzso Numerous zzso zzso also have been zzso often in single families, but the responsible genes have not yet been zzso This suggests further genetic zzso We have zzso 18 subjects from a large French family in which zzso zzso and prominent sensory zzso zzso as a dominant zzso zzso zzso was high regarding age at onset (17 months to 39 zzso severity, and the clinical picture that ranged from pure sensory zzso with little zzso involvement to a zzso zzso zzso After excluding known zzso responsible for zzso and zzso sensory zzso we detected linkage with zzso zzso markers in a zzso zzso We designated this new locus zzso after testing of 16 additional zzso zzso zzso zzso of odds scores of zzso and zzso were obtained at zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis defined a critical zzso region of zzso between zzso and zzso No linkage to this locus was found in four other zzso This zzso contains several genes that could be responsible for the zzso One of these zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso but no zzso were found by direct sequencing, excluding its responsibility in the zzso zzso repeat expansions often are involved in zzso zzso but no pathological expansions were found at the protein or at the DNA level using the zzso zzso and the repeat expansion detection method, zzso The gene responsible for zzso remains to be zzso
