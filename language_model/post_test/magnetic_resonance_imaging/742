We zzso the usefulness of zzso electrical stimulation mapping zzso for locating motor pathways in pediatric patients harboring cerebral zzso closely related to motor zzso 

We applied zzso in 17 consecutive pediatric patients operated on under general zzso It was possible to locate motor function in 15 patients and in all children 5 years old and younger, as well as in all patients presenting with severe motor deficits, using relatively high current zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso of our zzso A zzso complete removal of the zzso was carried out in 12 cases out of 17 with no definitive zzso zzso Motor function improved for all patients presenting preoperatively with a severe zzso 

In our experience zzso revealed to be an useful tool for allowing us to push the zzso of any zzso infringing on eloquent zzso up to the limit of functional areas, even in cases in very young and severely zzso zzso
