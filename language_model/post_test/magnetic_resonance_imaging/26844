It has been shown that prolonged exposure to a human face leads to zzso visual zzso It seems that these zzso zzso zzso have multiple zzso related to the adaptation of earlier and higher level processing of visual zzso The largest magnitude of zzso using long-term adaptation zzso is usually observed at the zzso position of the preceding zzso zzso However, zzso is also zzso to a smaller degree, at other retinal positions in a zzso zzso way and this component depends less on the adaptation zzso Several lines of zzso suggest that while the zzso zzso involves lower level areas of the zzso processing zzso the zzso zzso depends on the zzso of higher level zzso areas and the zzso zzso in zzso In the present paper, we zzso the available zzso zzso and zzso results regarding the spatial selectivity of zzso and discuss their implications for the visual stability of object representations across zzso eye zzso
