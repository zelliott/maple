We sought to perform a preliminary comparison of zzso ratio zzso and image quality for magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso at zzso and 3 zzso 

Two imaging zzso were studied using a zzso zzso fast zzso pulse sequence and a zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso In the first zzso 4 subjects were zzso using identical imaging parameters before and after contrast administration at zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was zzso for the zzso as well as for the liver, zzso and zzso In a second cohort of 12 subjects in whom the receiver bandwidth was adjusted for field strength, zzso zzso and qualitative rankings of image quality were zzso 

In the study cohort using identical imaging parameters at both magnetic field strengths, the mean zzso ratios of zzso at zzso to zzso T of the zzso fast zzso images for the zzso liver, zzso and muscle were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the corresponding ratios were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso phase, the corresponding ratios were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and for the delayed zzso phase, the corresponding ratios were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso benefit of zzso T was significantly greater on zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the second study zzso zzso was superior at zzso zzso although the use of a reduced zzso bandwidth at zzso T substantially diminished the advantage of the higher field zzso With qualitative comparison of images obtained at the 2 magnetic field strengths, the zzso zzso zzso images obtained at zzso T were zzso whereas the single shot fast zzso images obtained at zzso T were preferred because of better signal zzso 

Our results in a small cohort of volunteers and patients demonstrate a marked improvement in zzso at zzso T compared with zzso T (by a factor of 2 in some zzso when identical imaging parameters were zzso The zzso advantage at zzso T is diminished but persists when the receiver bandwidth is adjusted for magnetic field zzso The results suggest that zzso T may offer promise for improved body zzso although further technical development to zzso zzso and improve signal zzso will be needed before its full potential can be zzso
