zzso zzso have been used increasingly in the past few years for the zzso of function in tasks involving overt zzso These designs exploit the differences in the zzso characteristics between the rapid zzso and the slower zzso signal zzso The zzso of these designs and the best way to analyze the acquired data has not yet been fully zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate various design and analysis strategies for maximizing the detection of function while minimizing zzso motion zzso Both zzso and blocked zzso can be specifically designed to meet these zzso Various zzso and blocked designs were compared both in simulation and in experiments involving overt word reading in their ability to detect function and to avoid zzso motion zzso A blocked design with task and control zzso of 10 s and an zzso design with a minimum stimulus duration zzso of 5 s and an average zzso zzso zzso of 10 s were found to zzso detect blood zzso zzso signal changes without significant motion zzso Ignoring images acquired during the speech can help recover function in areas particularly affected by motion but substantially reduces the detection power in other zzso Using the stimulus timing as an additional zzso to model the motion offers little benefit in practice due to the zzso of the zzso signal zzso
