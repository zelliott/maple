In patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso zzso joint zzso involvement is a common cause of severe growth zzso zzso of growth zzso depends on age of onset and duration of arthritis in the zzso zzso arthritis is difficult to diagnose at an early stage since relatively few symptoms and clinical findings are related to this zzso The zzso process can affect growth long before zzso changes are zzso We investigated the relationship between zzso arthritis and symptoms and clinical findings to suggest a clinical routine for diagnosing zzso zzso We also describe the course of zzso arthritis in relation to a commonly used zzso method versus zzso 

Fifteen children with zzso were examined 4 times at 6 month intervals for zzso involvement by clinical examination, zzso and zzso zzso At zzso 10 healthy children served as a control zzso 

Patients reported more inability to chew and open their mouth than the control zzso zzso of the zzso and range of zzso movements were diminished in the arthritis zzso zzso translation was correlated to zzso changes seen on both zzso and zzso zzso was superior to zzso in following changes of the zzso over time, and inflammation was detected in nearly all zzso 

zzso cannot be recommended for diagnosis or to follow the course of changes in the zzso We advocate recording zzso translation and zzso range of motion as a current clinical routine to find early zzso arthritis in contrast to the often used zzso performed in our study, which was an uncertain zzso
