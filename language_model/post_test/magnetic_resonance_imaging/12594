Social threat is a key component of mental zzso and a potent generator of negative emotions and zzso responses in the zzso How the human brain processes social context and drives peripheral zzso however, is relatively poorly zzso Human zzso and animal studies zzso the zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso though this zzso region is likely to contain multiple zzso with diverse relationships with zzso zzso and zzso We used zzso combined with a novel zzso path analysis approach to identify brain zzso of the effects of a public speech preparation task zzso zzso threat, zzso on heart rate zzso This model provides tests of functional pathways linking zzso manipulated threat, regional zzso activity, and zzso zzso both across time zzso zzso and across individuals (between zzso It thus zzso time series connectivity and individual difference analyses in the same path zzso The results provide evidence for two zzso zzso coupled zzso of zzso that independently zzso zzso zzso zzso caused activity increases in a more zzso zzso zzso region, whose activity was coupled with zzso zzso zzso zzso caused activity decreases in a right zzso zzso region, which were coupled with zzso zzso Individual differences in zzso strength in each zzso independently predicted individual differences in zzso zzso These results underscore both the importance and zzso of zzso in generating zzso responses to zzso
