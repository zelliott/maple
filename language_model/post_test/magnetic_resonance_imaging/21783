Large animal studies have been zzso to define tolerance of normal brain to zzso and verify treatment planning programs with two recently installed zzso zzso zzso The normal brain tolerance studies zzso two biological zzso magnetic resonance visible damage only and zzso signs progressing to zzso The studies focused on defining the zzso zzso for the contaminant fast zzso and from nitrogen capture of zzso zzso and zzso capture reaction zzso zzso The zzso zzso was approximately zzso to zzso depending on whether a dose reduction factor for the low gamma dose rate was zzso The microscopic distribution of the zzso compounds, coupled with the extremely short length of the zzso fragments from zzso zzso capture by zzso yields an observed zzso effect much less than would be expected from such high LET zzso This observed zzso effect, which is a product of the zzso of the zzso atom and the relative zzso effect of the zzso fragments has been termed compound zzso The compound factor was based on the calculated physical dose from the zzso zzso in blood based on measured blood zzso zzso The approximate compound factor for zzso was studied at the two institutions and it ranged from zzso to zzso depending on the site and the zzso zzso The mean compound factor for zzso was only studied at one site and was found to be zzso for both zzso The increase in the compound factor for zzso is in keeping with previous calculations based on the differences in compound zzso zzso of these studies has helped the initiation of phase I and phase II clinical trials at Brook haven National Laboratory and the planned European clinical trials at zzso The zzso
