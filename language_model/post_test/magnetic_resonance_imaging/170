A case series of the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings in seven adult zzso zzso 

Seven patients from the National Specialist zzso Group Centre for zzso zzso zzso England, zzso completed the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging protocol to assess cardiac structure and function in zzso zzso 

All patients had some degree of left and right zzso zzso zzso mid wall zzso delayed enhancement was demonstrated, suggesting an underlying zzso zzso Some degree of zzso was zzso No evidence of zzso zzso or fatty zzso was demonstrated, but coronary artery disease cannot be completely zzso Repeat scanning after 18 months in one subject showed progression of zzso and decreased left zzso zzso 

Adult zzso zzso appears to be a zzso process causing impairment of both zzso zzso cardiac magnetic resonance scanning has helped clarify the underlying disease progression and responses to zzso Confirmation of significant zzso in the zzso gene should lead to advice to screen the subject for zzso and zzso zzso
