The zzso and function of the zzso system of zzso mice zzso zzso 8) was studied in zzso using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after bilateral injection of zzso zzso zzso 5 or 200 zzso into the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a pronounced zzso signal enhancement within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with milder increases in zzso and zzso This finding is in line with differences in the zzso of zzso zzso previously reported using zzso zzso The subsequent zzso transport of zzso highlighted the principal zzso projections from the zzso zzso formation via the zzso and the zzso zzso to the zzso part of the lateral zzso zzso A strong zzso signal enhancement was also observed in the zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis revealed zzso conditions of zzso zzso at about 2 h after injection and optimal zzso ratios at about 6 h after zzso The present results using zzso zzso zzso open new ways for studying the role of the zzso system in specific aspects of learning and memory in normal and zzso zzso
