The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of zzso in the zzso zzso area that were related to surgical damage to the brain zzso 

A prospective series of 101 patients with zzso zzso zzso were examined with zzso magnetic resonance imaging, 2 to 6 years zzso zzso zzso after early zzso 

zzso in the zzso zzso region, on the side of the zzso approach, were observed for 36 zzso These zzso were not visible in zzso zzso scans obtained zzso or zzso or 3 months after zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso in the anterior zzso artery exhibited fewer of these zzso than did patients with zzso in the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral zzso this difference was not statistically zzso The age of the patient, the duration and depth of zzso the amount of blood or zzso enlargement in zzso and zzso zzso zzso scans, and the zzso and severity of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso did not predict the existence of these zzso The clinical conditions of the patients, as assessed using the zzso zzso zzso at 3 months after surgery and at the time of magnetic resonance imaging did not predict the existence of these zzso Nine of the 10 patients who underwent surgical treatment of zzso zzso on the zzso side exhibited no signs of tissue zzso 

zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso seems to cause damage in the zzso zzso region in one-third of zzso The significance of these zzso remains zzso
