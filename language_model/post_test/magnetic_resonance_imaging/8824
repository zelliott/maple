zzso directional selectivity using zzso in humans is difficult because the resolution is insufficient to directly access zzso selective zzso Here we used motion adaptation of the zzso visual evoked potential zzso and source imaging in the frequency domain to detect brain areas that contain zzso zzso This study uses a definitive zzso marker for zzso adaptation in the zzso to zzso cortical areas that are direction zzso It has been shown previously that an zzso stimulus produces an zzso response that is dominated by even zzso of the stimulus zzso This pattern of response is consistent with equal population responses to each direction of zzso zzso exposure to zzso motion zzso an asymmetry in the population response that is consistent with adaptation of zzso zzso This asymmetry zzso itself in the presence of odd harmonic components after adaptation zzso the feature that indicates the direction used for adaptation is the phase of the zzso zzso We recorded this signature of direction selectivity in a group of observers whose zzso visual areas had been defined from zzso zzso We find zzso responses throughout zzso cortex, with the largest effect in areas zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
