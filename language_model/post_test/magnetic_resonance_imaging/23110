In this paper, we propose a new zzso zzso framework to cluster white matter fiber tracts into zzso using a zzso zzso processes mixture zzso zzso The number of clusters is automatically learned driven by data with a zzso process zzso prior instead of being manually zzso After the models of zzso have been learned from training data without zzso they can be used as zzso to zzso fibers of new subjects for comparison across zzso When zzso fibers of new subjects, new clusters can be created for structures not observed in the training zzso Our approach does not require computing zzso distances between fibers and can cluster a huge set of fibers across multiple zzso We present results on several data sets, the largest of which has more than zzso zzso
