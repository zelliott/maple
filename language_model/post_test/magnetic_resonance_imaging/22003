The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of zzso in the measurement of cartilage thickness of the ankle joint in comparison to zzso and zzso zzso 

The ankle zzso of four fresh zzso feet were zzso on a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Standard zzso spin echo zzso and a zzso zzso zzso sequence with fat zzso were zzso Following MR imaging, the zzso was zzso and cut parallel to the MR images for zzso evaluation and zzso specimens were zzso zzso zzso of the cartilage thickness of the zzso were carried out in two ways: without and with consideration of a transition zone of intermediate signal intensity between zzso cartilage and zzso cortical zzso The data were compared with the zzso specimens as the gold standard expressing the difference as a percentage zzso On zzso specimens thickness of deep zzso cartilage layer was zzso 

zzso without the transition zone showed a mean zzso of zzso cartilage thickness of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for fat saturated zzso zzso Considering the transition zone the mean values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso specimens showed a zzso increase of thickness of deep zzso cartilage zzso 

zzso of the cartilage layer of the ankle joint on MR images are only accurate if the transition zone zzso cartilage zzso is considered and the optimal pulse sequence zzso is zzso
