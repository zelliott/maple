The study design included an in zzso laboratory zzso The objective of the study is to zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso processes in zzso patients during zzso functional body movements with zzso weight zzso Limited data has been reported on the motion patterns of the zzso spine zzso This information is necessary for the evaluation of traumatic injuries and degenerative changes in the zzso zzso as well as for improving the surgical treatment of spinal diseases using zzso zzso Eight zzso subjects with an age ranging from 50 to 60 years underwent zzso scans of their zzso segments in a zzso position and zzso models of zzso were zzso Next, each subject was asked to stand and was positioned in the following zzso standing, 45 degrees zzso zzso extension, zzso left and right twisting, while two zzso zzso images were taken simultaneously at each of the zzso The zzso models were matched to the zzso outlines of the images from the two zzso views to zzso the position of the zzso in zzso at each zzso The data revealed that zzso process zzso distance decreased from zzso to zzso to zzso to zzso when measured in the zzso zzso with significantly higher values at zzso and zzso compared with zzso These differences were not seen with zzso zzso During the zzso extension, the zzso distance at the zzso motion segment was significantly reduced, but no significant changes were detected at zzso and zzso During zzso the zzso distances were not significantly different than those measured in the zzso position at all zzso Going from the left to right twist positions, the zzso segment had greater amounts of zzso zzso while all segments had similar ranges of translation in the zzso zzso The zzso process distances were dependent on body posture and zzso zzso
