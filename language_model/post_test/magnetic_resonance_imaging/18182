zzso zzso primarily targets the zzso and brain in mice and zzso zzso to these critical zzso leads to the high mortality associated with such infections, and invasion across the zzso barrier can result in zzso zzso zzso zzso can penetrate a brain zzso cell barrier in zzso through zzso migration, but this mechanism has not been confirmed in zzso zzso using the zzso vascular contrast agent zzso zzso acid demonstrated that integrity of the zzso barrier is lost during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso laser scanning zzso was used to provide the first real-time demonstration of zzso zzso colonizing the living brain, where both zzso and zzso forms of the pathogen were zzso Furthermore, we adapted a previously described method utilizing zzso to monitor inflammatory cell recruitment into infected zzso in zzso zzso and other zzso were zzso in kidney and brain by the administration of zzso iron oxide zzso In addition to obtaining new insights into the passage of zzso zzso across the brain zzso these imaging methods provide useful tools to study further the zzso of zzso zzso infections, to define the roles of zzso zzso genes in kidney versus brain infection and to assess new therapeutic measures for drug zzso
