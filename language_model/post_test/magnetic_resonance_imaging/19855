The two most common types of acquired reading disorder resulting from damage to the territory of the dominant zzso cerebral artery are zzso and pure zzso Patients with pronounced zzso zzso have a right zzso zzso that zzso into central or zzso zzso they read individual words well, but generate inefficient reading zzso when reading along a line of zzso Patients with pure zzso also often have a zzso but are more disabled, making frequent errors on individual words; they have sustained damage to a brain region that supports efficient word zzso 

To investigate the differences in zzso site between zzso zzso and pure zzso groups, as zzso techniques differ between the two zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance images were obtained from seven patients with zzso zzso and from six patients with pure zzso caused by a left zzso zzso The boundary of each zzso was defined and zzso volumes were then transformed into a standard zzso space so that regional comparisons could be zzso 

The two patient groups did not differ in terms of damage to the zzso left zzso zzso but those with pure zzso had additional lateral damage to the zzso zzso zzso and adjacent zzso 

zzso will be able to predict the type of reading disorder patients with left zzso zzso have from simple tests of reading speed and the distribution of damage to the left zzso lobe on brain zzso This information will aid management decisions, including recommendations for reading zzso
