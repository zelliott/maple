Despite the widespread adoption of diffusion zzso techniques, there is still no consensus on a comprehensive quality assurance routine specific for diffusion zzso We propose here a routine assurance pipeline for imaging of zzso The routine simply comprises zzso acquisitions on a zzso each repetition lasts less than 5 zzso and can be performed using a variety of zzso test zzso The proposed zzso script checks for the zzso of G, the uniformity of zzso across the zzso the mutual agreement of zzso power across the three logical axes and the zzso zzso zzso the routine can correct for the mutual agreement of zzso power along the three zzso returning a set of zzso zzso to be used in data zzso The effectiveness of the scheme in the presence of mismatched zzso zzso is reported using both simulations and in zzso zzso The script is freely available zzso
