Despite the reported diagnostic value of the zzso zzso procedure zzso or zzso zzso for determining zzso zzso and memory zzso it has never undergone formal reliability testing because a prospective zzso study design is neither feasible nor zzso However, some patients require repeat testing for clinical purposes, a circumstance that allows for exploration of issues related to zzso The current investigation sought to: zzso evaluate the frequency of and reasons for repeated zzso and zzso describe the zzso reliability of repeated zzso in a large zzso zzso zzso 

A 10-year review zzso of the New York University Langone Medical Center Comprehensive zzso Center patient registry revealed 630 zzso Review of medical records identified 20 individuals who underwent two or more zzso on separate zzso Because zzso repeated due to technical problems should be considered separate from zzso repeated for other reasons because these zzso likely included a change in the procedure zzso lower medication zzso in an attempt to zzso the complication, patients were grouped zzso Six patients underwent repeated zzso due to technical complication and 14 patients underwent a repeated zzso due to other reasons zzso unexpected memory outcome, reconsideration of surgery years after a previous surgical zzso in which no surgery was performed, and/or consideration of a second zzso Given that data obtained from injections zzso to a seizure focus are sometimes considered in a manner clinically different from data obtained from injections zzso to the seizure focus, memory outcome was classified relative to the side of identified seizure zzso The degree to which language and memory data were consistent across repeated zzso was zzso 

Language functioning was consistently zzso across zzso in all but one zzso Among the six patients who experienced technical problems in the first zzso three were fully participatory in the second procedure such that valid data were zzso For the other three, the technical problem recurred with no change in outcome across zzso Among the 14 patients with repeated zzso due to other reasons, zzso of the available zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso outcomes were consistent across zzso No difference between zzso or zzso injections was observed for the likelihood of a change in results zzso zzso zzso 

Our data identified overall high reliability for both the zzso and zzso sides with repeated zzso zzso zzso indicated that although patients for whom a zzso technical problem was identified during the zzso may benefit from a repeat study, there is little benefit to repeating the zzso in patients with zzso or unexpected results zzso results are not likely to zzso These data support the overall reliability of both the language and memory data obtained from the zzso
