To characterize zzso zzso images zzso in the acute phase of cerebral zzso sequential magnetic resonance images of 84 Mongolian zzso with zzso of the left common carotid artery were zzso 

Twelve zzso were used for each group, among which the zzso time zzso minutes, zzso zzso zzso changes developing within the first 2 weeks were compared with patterns on zzso images and zzso on a zzso zzso 

Although zzso images and zzso both demonstrated abnormal findings as early as 3 hours after zzso zzso demonstrated more zzso abnormalities with shorter zzso than zzso images (especially when there were only mild zzso zzso The earliest changes were an abnormal enhancement around and within the lateral zzso in temporary zzso this was not demonstrated in permanent zzso 

zzso resonance images using zzso demonstrated abnormal zzso within 3 hours after zzso and the pattern is correlated with intensity of zzso
