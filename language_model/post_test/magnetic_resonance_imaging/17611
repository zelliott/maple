There have been reports that patients with schizophrenia have decreased activity in the prefrontal zzso during emotion zzso However, findings have been zzso by sample zzso and explicit cognitive task interference with emotion zzso We aimed to further investigate this by examining the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso in response to the passive viewing of sad film zzso 

We presented film excerpts depicting sad and neutral social situations to 25 schizophrenia patients zzso with blunted affect zzso and 11 without blunted affect zzso in an implicit perception task to evoke zzso activity illustrated by blood zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso 

A zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso using statistical zzso mapping indicated that zzso patients differed from zzso patients at a zzso level zzso corrected for multiple zzso zzso with our a zzso hypothesis, zzso patients zzso to zzso zzso showed significant zzso in the right zzso An exploratory analysis revealed the following zzso of zzso zzso nucleus, zzso middle prefrontal cortex, zzso prefrontal cortex, anterior zzso cortex, and anterior zzso pole in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso anterior zzso pole, and zzso in the zzso zzso 

We observed not only zzso in the zzso group but also dysfunctional zzso distributed throughout the zzso The zzso and zzso zzso seen in the zzso group may indicate that these brain regions were working harder to compensate for zzso in other zzso These distributed dysfunctional circuits may form the neural basis of blunted affect through impairment of emotion processing in the brain that prevents it from processing input efficiently and producing output zzso thereby leading to symptoms such as blunted zzso
