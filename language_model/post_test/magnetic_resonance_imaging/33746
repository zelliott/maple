The authors report on the development and preliminary validation of a technique for measuring zzso ratio zzso at all points along selected vessel segments in the original three-dimensional magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso 

zzso ratio zzso on flow rate, field of view, and flip angle were measured on images from a conventional zzso zzso pulse sequence using constant flow in a branching vascular zzso An estimate of the inherent zzso of the technique was obtained from multiple scans of a flow phantom and a human zzso 

The overall standard zzso zzso of the zzso was found to be approximately zzso of the average zzso value for the flow phantom study and zzso for the human zzso zzso zzso was found to increase with field of view and was found to become zzso for low flow rate and/or high flip zzso 

In general, such zzso zzso allow the investigation of the mechanism of signal loss and general technique zzso in zzso
