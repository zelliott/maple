zzso control of the heating procedure is essential for zzso applications of focused ultrasound zzso The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of zzso zzso 

An automatic control system was developed using a dedicated interface between the MR system control computer and the zzso wave zzso Two zzso were used to regulate zzso power to maintain the focal point temperature at a desired zzso 

Automatic control of zzso power level was demonstrated ex zzso at three target temperature levels zzso of 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, and 30 degrees C above room zzso during 30-minute zzso zzso zzso in zzso results on rat leg muscle confirm that necrosis estimate, calculated zzso during zzso zzso allows prediction of tissue zzso zzso The feasibility of fully automatic zzso control based on zzso zzso has been zzso
