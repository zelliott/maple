Much recent research has sought to uncover the neural basis of moral zzso However, it has remained unclear whether zzso zzso are sufficiently zzso to be studied zzso as a unified zzso We tested this assumption by using zzso to examine the neural zzso of moral judgments within three moral zzso zzso harm, dishonesty, and zzso zzso We found that the judgment of moral zzso was zzso by distinct neural systems for each of the different moral areas and that these differences were much more robust than differences in zzso judgments within a moral zzso zzso zzso and harmful moral transgression recruited networks of brain regions associated with zzso affective processing, and action understanding, zzso zzso zzso zzso was the only region activated by all scenarios judged to be morally wrong in comparison with neutral zzso However, this region was also activated by zzso and harmful scenarios judged not to be morally wrong, suggestive of a zzso role that is neither peculiar to nor zzso of moral zzso These results suggest that moral judgment is not a wholly unified faculty in the human brain, but rather, zzso in zzso neural systems that are engaged zzso depending on the type of transgression being zzso
