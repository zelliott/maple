Wave intensity analysis, traditionally derived from pressure and zzso data, can be formulated using zzso and zzso zzso and area can both be derived from high-resolution zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso In this study, very high zzso resolution zzso data is processed using an integrated and zzso technique to derive wave zzso 

Wave intensity was derived in terms of area and zzso zzso These data were directly derived from zzso using a zzso spiral sequence accelerated with sensitivity zzso zzso Image processing was integrated in a plug-in for the zzso viewer zzso including calculations of wave speed and wave zzso zzso and descending zzso data from 15 healthy volunteers zzso data were used to test the method for zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data were also compared with results from 15 patients with coronary heart disease zzso to assess the clinical usefulness of the zzso 

Rapid image acquisition zzso zzso and image processing was feasible in all zzso Wave speed was zzso zzso ascending zzso zzso descending zzso and the wave intensity pattern was consistent with traditionally formulated wave zzso Wave speed, peak forward zzso wave in early zzso and peak forward expansion wave in late zzso at both locations exhibited overall good zzso and zzso zzso Patients with coronary heart disease had higher wave speed zzso zzso and lower forward zzso wave zzso zzso and forward expansion wave zzso zzso zzso This difference is likely related to the older age of the patients' zzso indicating stiffer zzso as well as compromised zzso function due to their underlying zzso 

A zzso zzso and zzso method for performing wave intensity analysis is zzso Its application is facilitated by the use of a very high zzso resolution spiral zzso A zzso of wave intensity based on area change has also been proposed, involving no assumptions about the zzso shape of the zzso
