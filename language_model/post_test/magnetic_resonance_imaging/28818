The spatial distribution of cortical neural clusters activated during movement of either hand zzso zzso or only of one hand, was investigated in healthy right-handed volunteers performing a sequential finger opposition task, using zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso clusters were found in the zzso zzso zzso and adjacent lateral zzso zzso of the two zzso and in the left superior zzso zzso In the zzso zzso their spatial extent was larger on the left zzso zzso activated exclusively during zzso finger movements were equally distributed in the left and right zzso zzso No cluster activated exclusively during zzso finger movements was zzso These findings support a role of the zzso zzso zzso of the dominant zzso in bilateral motor zzso
