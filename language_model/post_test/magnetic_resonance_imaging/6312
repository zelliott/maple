Recently, the zzso echo imaging sequence in conjunction with small flip angle zzso and short repetition times has been widely used for fast zzso zzso As the repetition time decreases to an extent comparable to the zzso relaxation time zzso the residual phase zzso of the zzso spin zzso tends to form another nuclear signal which is heavily weighted by zzso and similar to a long zzso TE zzso zzso This effect, although expected, has not been zzso in the conventional fast zzso echo zzso When this residual phase zzso is zzso in conjunction with the fast zzso zzso free zzso technique, both the zzso and the echo signals can be zzso In this paper, we have proposed a new technique by which simultaneous acquisitions of both the zzso and the echo signals are zzso zzso on this fast zzso mode imaging have shown that the zzso signal is zzso while the echo signal is strongly zzso The flip angle optimal for maximizing signal and related contrast are also studied in conjunction with the proposed sequence and the experimental results are zzso
