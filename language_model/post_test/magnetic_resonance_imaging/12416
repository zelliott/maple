Point distribution models zzso are one of the most extended methods to characterize the underlying population of set of samples, whose usefulness has been demonstrated in a wide variety of applications, including medical zzso However, one important issue remains zzso the large number of training samples zzso This problem becomes critical as the complexity of the problem increases, and the modeling of zzso zzso represents one of the most challenging zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso this paper introduces a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso able to efficiently characterize the different zzso zzso as well as the particular locality of each element zzso The significant advantage of this new method over two previous approaches in terms of accuracy has been successfully verified for the particular case of zzso zzso brain zzso
