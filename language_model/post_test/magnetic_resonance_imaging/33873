The use of a surface zzso in MR imaging improves zzso ratio of adjacent zzso of zzso We therefore devised an zzso receiver zzso for imaging the zzso zzso The probe is solid and zzso it comprises a zzso geometry receiver with integral zzso matching and zzso It is placed in the zzso canal and zzso zzso Both in zzso and in zzso normal anatomy is zzso The zzso is high signal intensity, the zzso low signal intensity, the internal zzso zzso high signal intensity and the external zzso low signal intensity on zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso muscle bridges the inferior part of the external zzso zzso In zzso zzso collections and the site of the zzso opening are zzso In zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso focal zzso defects are zzso in zzso zzso zzso external zzso zzso is zzso In zzso zzso patients with zzso forward zzso of the anterior zzso zzso with descent of zzso air and feces into the zzso canal is zzso The extent of zzso invasion is assessed in low zzso zzso In children with zzso zzso anomalies, abnormalities of the muscle components are defined using zzso zzso Such information is invaluable in the assessment and surgical planning of patients with a variety of zzso zzso
