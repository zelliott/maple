zzso of spatial attention are common in Alzheimer's disease zzso but may develop earlier in the course of the disease, a condition referred to as mild cognitive impairment zzso In a previous experiment, we showed that emotional content overcame the zzso decline in selective attention to novel events zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Weintraub, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso attention by zzso is preserved in aging and zzso Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso zzso The current experiment examined the influence of secondary zzso upon selective spatial attention in zzso and healthy aging zzso zzso performed a covert attention task while undergoing zzso They won money for fast responses and lost money for slow zzso In young subjects, this task had shown that the influence of incentive upon spatial attention is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Simmons, zzso zzso zzso zzso Parrish, zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Monetary incentives enhance processing in brain regions zzso zzso control of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both groups were able to use spatial cues to generate an anticipatory zzso shift towards the cued zzso The prospect of winning (but not zzso money enhanced zzso shifts in zzso subjects, an effect that was zzso by zzso zzso In contrast, only the prospect of losing money enhanced zzso shifts in zzso subjects, an effect that correlated with zzso zzso zzso effects of incentive upon spatial attention are only partially maintained in zzso and zzso with corresponding modifications in the underlying neural zzso These results suggest a reorganization of the relationships between the zzso system and spatial attention network in healthy aging and zzso
