Many studies have been devoted to the role of back muscle activity in the development of zzso While an imbalance in the zzso zzso activity has often been detected at the skin surface, very little information is available on the mechanisms by which such an imbalance could take zzso To gain insight into those mechanisms, an important step could be the collection of anatomical data on the volume of the zzso zzso muscle on both sides of the spine as well as on the skin and subcutaneous fat zzso thickness separating those muscles from the body zzso For this purpose, the use of magnetic resonance zzso imaging is zzso 

To collect anatomical information on the zzso zzso muscles and zzso thickness along the spinal zzso of zzso zzso 

In an zzso retrospective study, MR images of zzso patients treated in a pediatric hospital in the last 5 years were zzso 

Images were obtained from adolescent idiopathic zzso zzso 

For 15 patients zzso zzso three clinical acquisition protocols were zzso Five investigators were asked to grade the contrast of the images obtained with each zzso All the assessments were carried on the same monitor without any change in its zzso For the MR sequence providing the best contrast, 25 fully zzso zzso zzso were obtained from 17 patients zzso zzso A manual zzso with an image processing software package was done on the zzso zzso muscle on both sides of the spine on each of the available images in order to determine their zzso zzso was also zzso first at regular intervals from zzso to zzso over the zzso zzso muscle and then at sites centered over the zzso of each zzso 

For Group I, the spin echo zzso was found to provide the best contrast to identify the zzso of individual zzso With this zzso the analysis of the fully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that back muscle volume was found larger 14 times on the zzso side and 11 times on the convex zzso When the length of each curve was zzso and then divided into three equal regions, muscle volume was larger 11 times at the zzso (6 times on zzso zzso 7 times above and 7 times below (4 times on the zzso side for both zzso From zzso to zzso the mean zzso thickness of each patient ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso On average, this thickness was zzso zzso between zzso and zzso but became larger at zzso zzso At the zzso of each zzso zzso zzso thickness was always larger on the zzso side, and the difference decreased progressively as the distance from the zzso zzso 

A larger back muscle volume in adolescent idiopathic zzso patients was slightly more frequent on the zzso than on the convex zzso The differences were more frequent at the zzso of the zzso zzso thickness was always greater on the zzso side at the zzso zzso
