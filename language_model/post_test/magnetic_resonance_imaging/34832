We examined zzso zzso in 62 patients with zzso zzso finding that high intensity area in symmetrical bilateral zzso zzso other than zzso zzso was found on both zzso weighted images zzso and fat suppression zzso shift zzso zzso This zzso finding was observed in 32 of 41 patients with zzso while 1 of 21 patients with chronic zzso This zzso finding was zzso The zzso of this zzso finding was correlated with severity of zzso and was statistically significant between in the patients with chronic zzso and those with zzso The contributing factors to the zzso of this zzso finding were severity of zzso and total zzso level by an analysis with zzso zzso zzso This zzso finding was detected clearer in a fat suppression imaging than in zzso The cause of this zzso finding was supposed not fat related substance by the finding of fat suppression zzso This zzso finding would be useful for prediction of severity of zzso
