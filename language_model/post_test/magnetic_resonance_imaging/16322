To evaluate the correlation of zzso of the brain as zzso in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and the ability of spontaneous zzso 

In a prospective concept, zzso zzso after traumatic brain injury or spontaneous zzso zzso was performed in 250 subjects at an early zzso All zzso findings were correlated with respiratory conditions on the day of zzso zzso was performed only to facilitate zzso of the artificial zzso as and when zzso zzso zzso could hence be registered zzso 

Thirteen subjects zzso had no spontaneous zzso In these cases, a bilateral zzso of the zzso zzso zzso could be zzso In four of these cases, no additional injuries of the zzso were zzso These subjects awoke 2 days after the impact with zzso and zzso Combined zzso of the zzso zzso and other zzso regions were found in nine zzso All these patients died without zzso In the absence of a bilateral zzso of the zzso zzso zzso spontaneous zzso was always zzso A unilateral zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso in one patient who had the ability of spontaneous zzso 

This work confirms the presence of autonomous respiratory centers within the zzso zzso zzso that allows sufficient adequate zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the presence of a bilateral zzso of this zzso
