During functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso our participants selectively attended to tone zzso at the left or right, and occasionally shifted their attention from one stream to another as guided by a centrally presented visual zzso zzso changes in the zzso stream served as zzso zzso zzso tones zzso occurred infrequently in both zzso to catch attention in a bottom-up manner, as indicated by their effects on reaction times to zzso zzso activated the right zzso junction zzso zzso parts of the left zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso parts of the superior zzso zzso zzso and left frontal eye zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso in the zzso sound stream were associated with enhanced activity in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso possibly related to evaluation of the distracting zzso zzso controlled zzso attention shifts zzso activated bilateral areas in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso frontal zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso Thus, our results suggest that in audition zzso controlled and bottom-up triggered shifting of attention activate largely overlapping zzso superior zzso and frontal zzso As the zzso superior parts of the zzso and zzso zzso were activated specifically by zzso controlled attention shifts, and the zzso was specifically activated by bottom-up triggered attention shifts, our results also suggest some differences between auditory zzso controlled and bottom-up triggered shifting of zzso
