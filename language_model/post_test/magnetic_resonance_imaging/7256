Experience with spinal zzso has taught that spinal zzso zzso will eventually produce neurological zzso The primary diagnostic and monitoring zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso almost always produces images consistent with zzso zzso even in zzso or improved, previously operated zzso This presents a problem in selecting appropriate candidates for zzso zzso zzso a method of monitoring should predict functional zzso zzso zzso zzso tests, and zzso MR studies could potentially be adapted for this zzso The authors have evaluated the latter technique in both symptomatic and zzso zzso patients with zzso Studies of cervical zzso motion show a clear separation between results in patients with zzso expansion from zzso and those with pure zzso zzso patients with progressive deficit or pain have limited cervical zzso motion which improves after surgical zzso MR studies of zzso motion have zzso promise in the prediction of deficit from spinal zzso zzso and should be further evaluated in comparison with ultrasound and zzso zzso
