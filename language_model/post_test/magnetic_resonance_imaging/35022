The purpose of this study was to use zzso with gross zzso and zzso correlation in zzso to define the zzso details of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of seven zzso knees was performed before and after zzso administration of a zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images with and without fat suppression were acquired in three zzso zzso was made between findings derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed on five zzso 

The zzso and zzso appearance of the zzso zzso zzso complex was defined on zzso zzso The zzso zzso ligament and the zzso zzso ligament were best zzso on zzso zzso In three of five knees, the superficial fibers of the zzso zzso ligament were attached to the zzso in a position zzso to the attachment point of the zzso collateral zzso In all three knees, the deep fibers of the zzso zzso ligament merged with and attached to the zzso collateral zzso In two of these five knees, all fibers of the zzso zzso ligament were attached to the zzso collateral zzso These findings were confirmed at zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso ligament can attach only to the zzso collateral ligament or to both the zzso collateral ligament and the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso appearances of the zzso zzso zzso complex and the course of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ligaments were best defined on zzso zzso
