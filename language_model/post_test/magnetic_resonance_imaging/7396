The purpose of our study was to determine if the rate of zzso complications was increased with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pacing lead zzso zzso zzso Minneapolis, zzso zzso compared to the previous generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso pacing lead zzso 

The zzso lead is a newly introduced zzso zzso lead designed to be used zzso in a magnetic resonance zzso zzso This lead has specific design changes compared to the previous generation of zzso pacing zzso 

This study was a retrospective case control study of 65 consecutive patients implanted with two zzso leads compared to 92 consecutive control patients implanted with two zzso leads over a zzso period at a high-volume zzso care zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso or death within 30 days of implant were seen in eight patients from the zzso cohort and two from the zzso cohort zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso Lead zzso occurred in four of the zzso patients and in none of the zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 

In a high-volume center, the zzso of zzso cardiac zzso zzso death, and lead zzso was significantly higher with the zzso zzso zzso lead when compared to the previous generation zzso zzso zzso
