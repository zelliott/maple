To determine the pattern of enhancement on zzso MR studies of the brain in zzso 

zzso brain MR studies of 16 zzso were reviewed zzso All infants had normal zzso courses, normal zzso MR findings, and normal zzso examinations at age 12 zzso All enhancing regions within the brain, zzso zzso and orbits were zzso An enhancement factor, F zzso zzso was calculated from zzso intensity zzso in five regions of each zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso where zzso was signal intensity after contrast administration and zzso was the zzso signal intensity for each zzso 

Enhancement was detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso veins and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso No enhancement of the brain zzso was detected by visual inspection, although some change in signal intensity of the cerebral zzso was detected by the zzso intensity zzso with enhancement factors ranging from 0 to zzso zzso zzso No consistent regional variation in enhancement was zzso Because the degree of enhancement was identical to that in the normal adult brain, the slight enhancement detected was attributed to contrast material in zzso and small zzso 

In addition to the expected findings of enhancement of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso and the cerebral zzso we detected enhancement of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso No evidence of enhancement of the cerebral zzso was zzso suggesting that the zzso barrier to zzso zzso is intact in the zzso zzso
