MR findings of zzso vein zzso are not consistent in the zzso Our goal was to evaluate MR findings of zzso after zzso vein zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso veins was performed in seven zzso Of these, five dogs were examined with zzso before surgery, on the day of the zzso vein zzso and on the 1st, 4th, 8th, zzso and 30th zzso The other two dogs underwent zzso on the 4th and 8th days for zzso zzso 

On zzso images, zzso differentiation was lost in all dogs by the 15th zzso On zzso images, the signal intensity of the zzso zzso was significantly decreased beginning on the first zzso The zzso showed no zzso enhancement in the zzso zzso The volume of the kidney began increasing at the time of zzso vein zzso started to decrease after the 4th day, and developed significant zzso by the 30th zzso 

After zzso vein zzso the zzso zzso appears zzso on zzso images, zzso differentiation is lost within 2 weeks on zzso images, and the kidney becomes zzso by 1 zzso
