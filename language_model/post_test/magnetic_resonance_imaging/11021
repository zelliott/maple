The main objective of this thesis was to evaluate and monitor the zzso response following treatment interventions in patients with chronic Achilles zzso by using different zzso zzso For this purpose, we investigated different types of zzso including zzso contrast zzso zzso images zzso zzso and developed a precise method to measure zzso volume and mean zzso signal of the Achilles zzso Study I aimed at evaluating 15 patients with zzso painful Achilles zzso before and 2 years after surgical zzso There was marked zzso of the zzso signal zzso The most sensitive sequence for depicting an zzso zzso in this study was zzso zzso zzso They showed a zzso of the zzso signal zzso from zzso patients preoperatively to zzso zzso The clinical outcome was excellent in eight, good in five, fair in one and poor in one zzso In study II, the early contrast agent enhancement in the zzso enhanced zzso signal zzso was correlated with the zzso findings in 15 patients with chronic Achilles zzso Early contrast enhancement zzso the first zzso was seen in zzso in the symptomatic Achilles zzso with a significant difference compared to the zzso zzso zzso Increased severity of zzso changes, including fiber structure zzso increased zzso zzso of zzso and increased amount of zzso correlated to zzso In study III, we developed a computerized 3-D zzso zzso technique to measure zzso volume and mean zzso zzso This technique showed an excellent zzso and zzso zzso The technique was also used to follow up zzso the zzso adaptation and healing described in studies zzso In study IV, using serial zzso during a period of 1 year, we evaluated the biological effect of zzso repair following zzso zzso injury by five zzso zzso core zzso employing a needle technique in chronic Achilles zzso zzso found during healing, such as zzso volume and zzso zzso changes, could be monitored by MR imaging, and subsided as noted in the 7- and 12-month zzso In study zzso we evaluated the effect of treatment with a zzso daily performed, zzso zzso strength training program in 25 patients who had been suffering from zzso painful Achilles zzso zzso volume decreased by zzso and the mean zzso signal by zzso The clinical outcome was zzso In study zzso we revealed zzso adaptation immediately following zzso strength zzso An zzso examination within zzso of the performed exercises resulted in increased total zzso volume zzso and mean zzso signal zzso 

zzso techniques can be used as an adjunct to clinical evaluation by monitoring zzso effects following different treatment interventions, thereby adding evidence in clinical studies on patients with chronic Achilles zzso
