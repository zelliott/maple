The purpose of this study was to examine the course and zzso of functional decline among patients with vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso patients completed three tests of executive functions and underwent zzso scanning to generate quantitative ratings of zzso zzso at a baseline zzso The zzso zzso and Brody zzso of Daily Living zzso was used to estimate instrumental activities of daily living zzso at the baseline evaluation and at a 1 year zzso We hypothesized that: zzso zzso would decline significantly over the course of 1 year, and zzso baseline performance on executive tasks and zzso zzso would predict zzso impairment at 1 year zzso even after accounting for global cognitive zzso A paired samples zzso demonstrated that zzso declined significantly over the course of 1 year, and zzso analyses revealed that baseline performance on executive tasks was a significant predictor of zzso at the 1 year zzso even after accounting for global cognitive zzso zzso to our zzso zzso zzso did not explain unique zzso in zzso after accounting for executive zzso These findings demonstrate that baseline executive dysfunction is a significant and powerful predictor of future functional decline in individuals with zzso
