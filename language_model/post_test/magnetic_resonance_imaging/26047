zzso activity patterns to zzso painful stimuli of two different sizes were examined in normal volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Seven right-handed subjects were studied when the painful stimulus applied to the right hand fingers covered either zzso large zzso or zzso small zzso zzso temperatures were adjusted to give rise to equivalent moderately painful zzso zzso signal increases and decreases were determined for the zzso zzso and motor zzso When the overall activity in these regions was compared across subjects, increased zzso activity was observed over more brain volume with the larger zzso whereas decreased zzso activity was seen in more brain volume for the smaller zzso The individual subject and zzso activity patterns indicated regional specific differences in increased and decreased zzso zzso The small zzso resulted in decreased zzso responses throughout the upper body representation in both primary zzso and motor zzso In contrast, no decreased zzso signals were seen in the secondary zzso zzso and in the zzso In another seven volunteers, the effects of the size of the zzso painful stimulus on zzso thresholds were examined zzso zzso stimuli were delivered to the fingers and zzso thresholds were measured on the arm just zzso to the zzso zzso with the zzso results in the primary zzso cortex, painful zzso stimuli using the small zzso increased zzso thresholds on the zzso whereas similarly painful stimuli using the large zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso These results are discussed in relation to the cortical dynamics for pain perception and in relation to the zzso organization of cortical zzso
