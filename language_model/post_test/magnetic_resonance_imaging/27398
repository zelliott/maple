The zzso of the zzso at birth greatly affects injury after stroke but the contribution of the zzso barrier zzso to the differential response to stroke in adults and zzso is poorly zzso We asked whether the structure and function of the zzso is disrupted differently in zzso and adult rats by transient middle cerebral artery zzso In adult rats, zzso leakage into injured regions was markedly increased during zzso h zzso but leakage remained low in the zzso zzso zzso employing zzso zzso in the zzso showed that zzso zzso to both large zzso zzso zzso and small (3 zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso remained largely undisturbed 24 h after zzso The profoundly different functional integrity of the zzso was associated with the largely zzso patterns of regulated genes in zzso cells zzso from injured and zzso adult and zzso brain at 24 h zzso zzso zzso total probe zzso Within significantly regulated zzso probe sets in injured adults and zzso probe sets in zzso changes in the gene expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the tight junction protein zzso and zzso zzso were among the key zzso The protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 was also better preserved in zzso zzso zzso zzso remained low in acutely injured zzso but zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the systemic circulation enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The markedly more zzso zzso in zzso brain than in adult brain after acute stroke may have major implications for the treatment of zzso zzso
