To explore the value of serial magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnosis of cerebral zzso caused by zzso zzso in premature zzso 

The clinical data of 8 premature infants with central nervous system invasive zzso infection zzso were zzso zzso The infants underwent serial cerebral zzso scans zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso was found as pathogen in all of the 8 zzso Seven infants presented with cerebral zzso and 4 infants had concurrent zzso zzso zzso were found on zzso particular in white matter area of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The MR imaging findings in 4 infants within 11 days after zzso showed zzso and multiple zzso zzso and zzso signals on zzso but obvious changes were not found on zzso and zzso The most striking zzso signals on zzso and zzso signals on zzso appeared between 2 and 4 weeks after zzso and some zzso of zzso zzso and marked contrast enhancement were also noted on zzso Smaller and smaller changes of the zzso zzso were seen on zzso and zzso 4 weeks zzso Delayed zzso and thinner corpus callous were shown in 2 patients at three zzso 

zzso and serial zzso are helpful in the early diagnosis of zzso cerebral zzso and the evaluation of treatment outcome in premature zzso
