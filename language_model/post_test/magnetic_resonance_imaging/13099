Studies evaluating zzso beta zzso for multiple sclerosis zzso showed only partial zzso In many patients, zzso does not halt relapses or disability zzso One strategy to potentially enhance efficacy is to combine zzso with classical zzso agents, such as zzso zzso or zzso commonly used for other zzso zzso 

The zzso study was zzso trial and evaluated efficacy of zzso alone and combined with zzso zzso alone or zzso zzso and zzso zzso as initial zzso 

A total of 181 patients with zzso zzso zzso were zzso to receive zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso once weekly, zzso 30 zzso IM once weekly plus zzso 50 zzso orally once daily, or zzso 30 zzso IM once weekly plus zzso 50 zzso orally once daily plus prednisone 10 zzso orally every other zzso The primary end point was annualized zzso rate zzso at 2 zzso Patients were eligible for enrollment in a zzso zzso 

At 2 years, adjusted zzso was zzso for zzso zzso for zzso plus zzso and zzso for zzso The cumulative probability of sustained disability progression was zzso for zzso zzso for zzso plus zzso and zzso for zzso There were no statistically significant differences among groups for either measure at 2 and 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso volume change at 2 years was significantly lower for combination zzso versus zzso alone zzso P zzso zzso Groups had similar safety zzso 

In zzso patients with early active zzso combination treatment did not show superiority over zzso zzso
