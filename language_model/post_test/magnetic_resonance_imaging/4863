High temperature zzso zzso surface zzso have been used as a low loss zzso receiver zzso for improving magnetic resonance imaging image zzso However, the application of zzso surface zzso is significantly limited by their filling zzso To maximize the filling factor, it is desirable to have the zzso zzso wrapped around the sample so that more nuclear magnetic zzso can contribute to the zzso In this study, a whole new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 5 zzso and length of 8 zzso was designed for the magnetic resonance image of a zzso whole body in zzso 3 T zzso zzso The experiment was conducted with a zzso copper zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso to show the zzso zzso ratio zzso with the zzso zzso zzso at 77 K was zzso and 2 folds higher than that of the copper zzso zzso at 300 K for a phantom and an zzso mice whole body zzso Testing results were in accordance with predicted ones, and the difference between the predicted zzso gains and measured zzso gains were zzso In zzso with this zzso zzso system, a zzso whole body can be zzso in one scan and could reach a high zzso due to a 2 folds zzso gain over the zzso zzso of copper zzso zzso at 300 zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso not only improves zzso but also enables a zzso whole body screen in one zzso
