We can read words at an amazing speed, with the left zzso taking the burden of the processing in most readers zzso over zzso of right-handers and about zzso of zzso Yet, it is a long-standing question whether word reading in central vision is possible without information transfer between the left and right zzso zzso Here we show that such communication is required by comparing word naming zzso and eye movement data of people with zzso language dominance and a unique sample of healthy zzso dominant zzso The results reveal that individuals with zzso speech dominance name words faster when they are allowed to fixate at the word beginning, whereas zzso zzso are faster for zzso toward the zzso In text reading, the eyes of zzso zzso land more to the left than the eyes of zzso zzso making more information directly available to the dominant zzso We conclude that the traditional view of bilateral projections in central vision is zzso In contrast, zzso communication is needed in central vision, and eye movements are adjusted to zzso information zzso Our findings therefore call into question the explanation of zzso sparing in zzso based on a zzso projecting zzso In addition, these results are in line with the increase of white matter in the zzso of the corpus zzso when people learn to zzso
