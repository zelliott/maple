zzso zzso zzso zzso is a technique that allows for a zzso unbiased analysis of zzso relaxation time across the whole zzso Previous studies have shown that this technique is effective for clinical analysis of single zzso however, the effects of age normal age-related changes on these data were zzso Our study was therefore designed to assess the effect of normal aging on zzso zzso 

A linear zzso with age as a predictor of zzso was run in both a zzso zzso zzso manner to determine regions which showed significant age-related change and subsequently zzso on a selection of zzso to allow for a more detailed analysis of the zzso 

zzso estimates showed a significant increase with age in the frontal lobe white matter and a significant decrease with age in the zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso There was also a general trend for zzso to decrease in inferior zzso lobe zzso matter in the zzso zzso 

Age causes changes in zzso relaxation time in healthy control subjects, with increases being observed in frontal lobe white matter and decreases in the zzso These changes should be accounted for when interpreting single subject zzso zzso
