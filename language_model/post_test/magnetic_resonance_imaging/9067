zzso an zzso zzso pattern of paradoxical zzso in children with unilateral zzso zzso zzso acquired early in zzso 

Of 68 children who underwent zzso during zzso scalp zzso and brain zzso of six children with an zzso scalp zzso pattern zzso to the clinical and imaging data were zzso Medical charts were reviewed for clinical findings and seizure zzso 

Age of seizure onset was 1 zzso zzso The destructive zzso zzso was an zzso stroke in 2, a zzso zzso in 2, and a zzso trauma and zzso syndrome in one patient zzso zzso zzso pattern was characterized by prominent zzso rhythms with either zzso zzso spike and wave complexes or beta frequency sharp waves zzso zzso over the unaffected zzso zzso zzso zzso was discordant, however, other findings of motor deficits zzso five zzso one zzso seizure zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormalities zzso and unilateral burden of zzso zzso guided the decision for zzso After zzso months of zzso follow up, five of six patients were seizure free and one has brief staring zzso 

We describe a paradoxical zzso of the zzso to the zzso zzso in children with zzso zzso zzso This zzso pattern is compatible with seizure free outcome after surgery, provided other clinical findings and tests are zzso with origin from the abnormal zzso
