zzso cortical dysfunction is frequently reported in zzso It remains unclear whether this represents the coincidence of several prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso or a more zzso dysfunction in a zzso cognitive control zzso Whether these zzso are properly considered reflective of zzso vs zzso remains zzso 

To test whether common zzso of the cognitive control network exhibit altered activity across functional zzso studies of executive zzso in schizophrenia and to evaluate the direction of these zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso articles published prior to February 2007 were zzso All reports used functional zzso during executive function performance by adult patients with schizophrenia and reported zzso analyses in standard zzso zzso zzso primarily included the delayed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso likelihood zzso modeling reported zzso zzso as the center of a zzso zzso function in the zzso with statistical zzso and correction for multiple zzso 

In zzso zzso healthy controls and patients activated a similarly distributed zzso network, prominently including the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso patients showed reduced zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso left zzso (with significant zzso of these zzso and zzso cortical zzso Increased zzso was observed in several zzso cortical zzso zzso within groups varied modestly by zzso 

Healthy adults and schizophrenic patients activate a zzso similar neural network during executive task performance, consistent with the engagement of a zzso cognitive control network, with critical zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso Nevertheless, patients with schizophrenia show altered activity with deficits in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso in activity are evident in other zzso areas, which could be zzso in zzso
