Treatment strategies for the highly invasive brain zzso zzso zzso require that cells which have invaded into the surrounding brain be specifically zzso The inherent zzso of neural stem cells zzso to primary and invasive tumor zzso can be exploited to deliver zzso to invasive brain tumor cells in zzso Use of the strategy of converting zzso to drug via therapeutic zzso delivered by immortalized therapeutic zzso lines have shown efficacy in animal zzso Thus therapeutic zzso are being proposed for use in human brain tumor clinical zzso In the context of zzso therapies, zzso can be used both to zzso follow dynamic zzso patterns of the zzso tumor targeting allowing for the zzso of treatment strategies and to assess efficacy of the zzso zzso of cells allows their presence to be zzso and tracked by zzso Thus we aimed to zzso therapeutic zzso without affecting their cellular physiology using a method likely to gain United States Federal Drug Administration zzso zzso 

For human use, the characteristics of therapeutic zzso Stem zzso must be clearly defined with any zzso to the cell including iron labeling requiring zzso of cellular zzso Here, we studied the effect of zzso of the therapeutic zzso with zzso zzso complex zzso on zzso zzso migratory properties and zzso zzso when compared to zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso were zzso by zzso at tumor sites, after zzso administration into the zzso zzso to the zzso in an zzso human zzso zzso mouse zzso 

zzso labeled zzso retain their zzso status, tumor zzso and maintain stem cell character, while allowing in zzso cellular zzso tracking at 7 zzso to monitor their real-time migration and distribution at brain tumor zzso Of significance, this work directly supports the use of zzso zzso for real-time tracking in the clinical trial under development: zzso Pilot zzso Study of zzso zzso and zzso modified zzso Stem zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso for Treatment of zzso zzso zzso
