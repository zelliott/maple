There is ongoing debate about which imaging zzso is best for patients with inflammatory zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso has been successfully used to evaluate the zzso and the zzso Because virtual zzso by zzso requires zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso is preferred for assessment of the zzso However, zzso without special zzso preparation may be sufficient as a diagnostic tool if specifically targeted in the course of a known zzso The aim of this study was zzso to assess the correlation of zzso zzso and zzso findings for the terminal zzso and the colon in a cohort of patients with Crohn's zzso 

In all, 60 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease were included in the zzso Here, 412 anatomical segments of the colon were zzso by zzso 401 by zzso and 374 by zzso 

zzso or absence of inflammation was zzso diagnosed in 310 segments zzso The highest zzso was found for the terminal zzso and, in patients with previous surgery, the zzso zzso and specificity for zzso versus zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso versus zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In a retrospective analysis of patients with Crohn's disease, zzso assessment of inflammation in anatomical segments of the colon reaches acceptable zzso rates with zzso and zzso without prior preparation of the zzso The data justify a prospective controlled zzso
