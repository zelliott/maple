The prognosis for patients with zzso is related to the zzso of surgical zzso It is, however, often not possible to obtain a zzso complete zzso of tumors arising in the zzso zzso This may be because of the involvement of structures, the sacrifice of which would result in unacceptable zzso or because of zzso zzso at zzso For those patients in whom initial surgery was incomplete, zzso zzso surgery may allow more complete clearance of zzso 

We have performed zzso surgery for fourth zzso zzso in five zzso two women, aged 26 and 27 years, and three male patients, aged 4 months, 19 months, and 18 zzso The zzso male patient underwent early zzso surgery without receiving any interim zzso zzso surgery on the other four patients was performed after they had received zzso No additional major morbidity was associated with the subsequent surgery, which achieved zzso complete zzso in four of the five zzso Three of four patients who underwent zzso complete zzso were well, without clinical or zzso evidence of zzso zzso at 23, 25, and 34 months after their second zzso The zzso patient who underwent early zzso complete zzso relapsed locally at 33 months after zzso Complete zzso was not possible in one patient who had progressive tumor 8 months after zzso zzso 

For patients in whom complete zzso of fourth zzso zzso is not possible at initial surgery, zzso procedures may enable zzso clearance to be achieved with little zzso A larger study is needed to evaluate this approach to zzso
