We investigated the impact of the zzso and reconstruction protocol on clinical zzso The performance of standard clinical reconstruction procedures in discrimination tasks related to the diagnosis of zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso was compared with the performance of a quantitative approach incorporating improved corrections for zzso zzso intrinsic spatial resolution, and zzso spatial zzso 

zzso normal controls zzso group), 56 subjects who did not have zzso who did have memory problems, but who did not develop zzso within 5 y of follow-up zzso group), and 27 subjects who did not have zzso who did have memory problems, and who did develop zzso over the follow-up period zzso zzso were considered in this zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies were performed for each subject at zzso The standard zzso protocol zzso routinely used in our clinic, consisted of Compton window scatter correction followed by filtered zzso with zzso correction using a uniform zzso zzso In the improved quantitative approach zzso projections were corrected for scatter by use of a general spectral method and reconstructed by use of zzso expectation zzso incorporating corrections for zzso response and zzso using both a uniform zzso map zzso and a zzso zzso map zzso Mean zzso activity concentration and zzso volume were estimated for 7 zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amygdala, and the banks of the superior zzso zzso Data were analyzed by zzso zzso analysis, and performance in zzso group discrimination was measured by correlated zzso zzso 

The use of zzso yielded a small but systematic improvement in discrimination accuracy for normal versus zzso groups zzso or area under the zzso curve zzso zzso normal versus questionable groups zzso zzso and questionable versus zzso groups zzso zzso compared with the results obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Discrimination performance was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso with zzso than with zzso in all 3 tasks zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso volume zzso led to a lower overall performance in all 3 tasks than did zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso quantitative image reconstruction with accurate compensation for zzso zzso and variable zzso response led to significantly better performance in discrimination tasks related to the diagnosis of zzso zzso than did standard clinical reconstruction zzso The use of a zzso brain zzso map yields a small improvement in discrimination zzso
