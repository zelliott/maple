Seven patients with complex partial zzso zzso undergoing invasive zzso were investigated with a combination of 10 zzso strip zzso contacts zzso + lateral zzso and 22 zzso recording zzso In each patient spikes with different zzso zzso were identified, and for those with similar zzso the zzso activity was zzso A new inverse solution method called zzso zzso et zzso 2001, this zzso was used to reconstruct the sources of both single and averaged spikes in a standard zzso and a statistical analysis was performed in order to demonstrate location differences between spikes with different zzso zzso The results revealed significantly more anterior and zzso source locations for zzso compared to lateral zzso zzso Within the zzso group, zzso spikes had more zzso and zzso locations compared to lateral zzso In the lateral zzso group, more anterior and zzso locations were obtained for anterior compared to zzso zzso The results demonstrate the zzso of zzso in the zzso of sources in the zzso lobe with zzso zzso This possibility may become important in the future, for instance in identifying cases where zzso or other limited zzso lobe zzso may replace the standard en bloc zzso
