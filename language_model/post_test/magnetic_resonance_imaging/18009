Neonatal zzso zzso is a prominent cause of infant mortality and zzso zzso zzso is an effective zzso therapy for newborns with zzso zzso zzso correlation between zzso zzso abnormalities and brain injury findings on zzso in zzso newborns has not been previously zzso 

To evaluate the relationship between zzso zzso abnormalities and brain injury on magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso newborns treated with therapeutic zzso 

zzso with hypoxic zzso zzso zzso referred for therapeutic zzso were zzso enrolled in this zzso zzso zzso functioning was assessed with the zzso network zzso scale zzso performed at target age 14 zzso Brain injury was assessed by zzso at target age zzso zzso zzso scores were compared between infants with and without severe zzso zzso 

zzso term newborns zzso zzso with moderate to severe zzso underwent zzso at median 8 days zzso zzso and zzso at median 12 days of life zzso zzso Fifteen zzso had severe injury on zzso 

zzso Total Motor zzso zzso and individual summary scores for zzso zzso and zzso were higher, while Total zzso zzso across zzso zzso was lower zzso poorer zzso in infants with severe zzso injury compared to those without zzso zzso zzso 

Neonatal zzso abnormalities identified by the zzso are associated with zzso brain injury in zzso newborns zzso The zzso can provide an early functional assessment of structural brain injury in zzso which may guide zzso therapies in infants after zzso brain zzso
