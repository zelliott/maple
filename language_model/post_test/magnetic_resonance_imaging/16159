The purpose of this study was to analyze differences in injury zzso zzso physical examination findings, combined injury pattern, and zzso clinical results among zzso anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with hamstring zzso We also evaluated the availability of routine magnetic resonance imaging zzso for detection of zzso remnant zzso 

From January 2005 to May 2007, we analyzed 82 cases of zzso zzso 40 cases of AM zzso and 42 cases of zzso zzso We compared injury zzso combined injury pattern, and zzso and zzso zzso including range of motion, zzso test, zzso test, zzso zzso test zzso San Diego, zzso and International zzso Documentation Committee knee examination zzso We also analyzed the availability of the routine zzso view on zzso for detecting zzso remnant zzso 

A direct injury mechanism was involved more in the AM zzso group than in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnosis for the detection of a remnant AM or zzso bundle presented excellent zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso tears was highest in the reconstruction group zzso zzso zzso v AM zzso group and P zzso zzso v zzso zzso group), and it was higher in the zzso zzso group than in the AM zzso group zzso zzso zzso The AM zzso group had a higher zzso of zzso collateral ligament injury than the other groups zzso zzso zzso v reconstruction group and P zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso The AM zzso group presented with a lower zzso of a zzso grade 2 or 3 positive zzso test zzso zzso zzso v reconstruction group and P zzso zzso v zzso zzso group), but no difference was found in the other clinical zzso 

The AM zzso group was injured more by a direct injury zzso and it presented with a greater zzso of zzso collateral ligament tear than the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso grade 2 or 3 positive zzso test was lower in the AM zzso group than in the other 2 zzso zzso was useful for detection of remnant zzso zzso 

Level III, retrospective comparative zzso
