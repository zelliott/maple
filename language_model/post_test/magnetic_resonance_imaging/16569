The zzso kidney is abnormal in up to zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso Traditionally, anatomical and functional evaluation of the zzso kidney has been performed with ultrasound and zzso acid zzso zzso as zzso Recently magnetic resonance zzso has been used to evaluate zzso anatomy and function in other zzso zzso We compared the results of magnetic resonance zzso and ultrasound for evaluating the zzso kidney in patients with zzso zzso kidney and we describe the range of findings zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso kidney who underwent magnetic resonance zzso were zzso zzso findings on magnetic resonance zzso were analyzed and compared to those on zzso zzso Additional functional information derived from magnetic resonance zzso was also zzso 

We zzso identified 58 patients with a unilateral zzso zzso kidney who had undergone magnetic resonance zzso of whom 54 also underwent zzso Of the patients 19 zzso had a zzso zzso A zzso between magnetic resonance zzso and ultrasound was seen in 9 patients zzso Of these patients only 1 had a completely normal zzso kidney by ultrasound on retrospective zzso The zzso and range of zzso abnormalities was wider than previously zzso 

zzso abnormalities in children with zzso zzso kidney are common and more definitively evaluated with magnetic resonance zzso vs zzso Renal ultrasound remains the most appropriate zzso for the initial evaluation of children with zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso is recommended when a functional study is required either to confirm the diagnosis of zzso zzso kidney or to evaluate suspected abnormalities of the zzso zzso
