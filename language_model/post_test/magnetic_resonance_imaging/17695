To analyze the nature and propagation of muscle bursts in patients presenting with intensified zzso jerks and sleep onset zzso 

We obtained zzso recordings from zzso and zzso zzso muscles during zzso study in 10 subjects presenting with repeated jerking movements at sleep zzso anxiety and sleep onset zzso One subject also had daytime zzso during relaxed zzso and zzso as well as zzso of the zzso preceding the muscle zzso 

We observed 4 patterns of muscle zzso zzso and symmetrical patterned muscle bursts between the two sides and zzso muscles similar to those noted in zzso startle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso propagation of muscle zzso 

zzso jerks are zzso phenomena which may be zzso and repeated and may be of several zzso zzso
