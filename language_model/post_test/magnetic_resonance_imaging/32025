zzso negative prostate zzso in individuals with elevated prostate specific zzso zzso levels can be frustrating for both the patient and the zzso This study was performed to investigate if magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso biopsy increases diagnostic performance in individuals with elevated or increasing zzso levels after previous negative conventional zzso ultrasound zzso zzso 

27 consecutive men with a zzso zzso zzso and/or suspicious finding on digital zzso examination, suspicious zzso findings, and at least one prior negative prostate biopsy were zzso Median age was 66 years zzso zzso median zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso biopsy was performed with a closed unit at zzso zzso an zzso biopsy device, a needle guide, and a titanium zzso biopsy zzso 

Median prostate volume was zzso zzso zzso zzso median volume of tumor suspicious areas on zzso MR images was zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean number of obtained zzso per patient was zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso cancer was detected in zzso (15 of zzso of the zzso zzso biopsy could be performed without complications in all zzso 

According to our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of consecutive men to be examined by zzso zzso biopsy of the prostate in this zzso The method is safe, can be useful to select suspicious areas in the zzso and has the potential to improve cancer detection rate in men with previous negative zzso
