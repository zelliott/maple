To evaluate the dependence of skeletal muscle blood zzso zzso zzso effect and time course characteristics on magnetic field strength in healthy volunteers using an zzso zzso zzso 

Two consecutive skeletal muscle zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso in eight healthy volunteers were performed on zzso T and zzso T zzso zzso zzso For both zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was zzso Temporary vascular zzso was induced by zzso cuff zzso of the zzso zzso time courses were obtained from two different calf muscles and characterized by typical curve zzso zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso were calculated for both muscles in each volunteer at the two field zzso 

zzso muscle zzso changes are dependent on magnetic field strength as the ratio zzso zzso zzso was found to range between zzso and zzso Regarding time course zzso significantly higher relative zzso changes were found in both muscles at zzso zzso 

The present study shows an approximately linear field strength dependence of zzso in the skeletal muscle in response to zzso and zzso zzso Using higher magnetic fields is zzso for future zzso imaging studies of peripheral limb zzso
