To compare the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso for detection of bone zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

In 32 patients with Hodgkin's disease zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso skeleton and zzso IS using zzso zzso zzso zzso were reviewed and compared with zzso crest zzso zzso for zzso zzso was a positive biopsy or zzso positive results of zzso and zzso 

In 16 patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso crest zzso were negative for zzso zzso zzso crest biopsy showed zzso in only four patients zzso zzso was missed in two of 32 patients with IS and in one patient with zzso In one additional patient, zzso was zzso because of pelvic zzso zzso A subset of nine patients zzso with negative zzso had bone zzso involvement according to zzso and IS with identical location and pattern of zzso In eight of these nine patients, diagnostic imaging indicated zzso involvement only in zzso zzso zzso biopsy confirmed zzso in five zzso The clinical course suggested zzso imaging results in the remaining four zzso Two patients zzso remained zzso zzso zzso of zzso and IS for zzso zzso was zzso zzso of 32 zzso 

zzso imaging is essential for optimal staging in zzso lymphoma, as blind zzso appear to have low sensitivity for bone zzso zzso because of frequent involvement in zzso zzso both imaging zzso show a high rate of detection of bone zzso zzso
