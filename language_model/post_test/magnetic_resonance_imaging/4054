We investigated brain zzso zzso zzso euphoria and craving using functional zzso zzso During zzso cocaine zzso zzso and saline infusions in zzso subjects, the entire brain was zzso for 5 zzso before and 13 zzso after infusion while subjects rated scales for rush, high, low, and zzso zzso induced focal signal increases in nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso zzso zzso cingulate, lateral prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and produced signal decreases in amygdala, zzso pole, and zzso frontal zzso zzso produced few positive or negative zzso which were localized to lateral prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso who underwent repeat studies showed good replication of the regional zzso zzso pattern following cocaine and saline zzso with zzso on saline zzso that might reflect zzso Brain regions that exhibited early and short duration signal zzso showed a higher correlation with rush zzso These included the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cingulate, and most regions of lateral prefrontal zzso In contrast, regions that demonstrated early but sustained signal zzso were more correlated with craving than with rush zzso such regions included the zzso right zzso zzso and some regions of lateral prefrontal zzso zzso negative signal change was noted in the amygdala, which correlated with craving zzso Our data demonstrate the ability of zzso to map dynamic patterns of brain zzso following cocaine infusion in zzso subjects and provide evidence of zzso changing brain networks associated with zzso euphoria and zzso zzso
