This study analyzed the change in breast density in women receiving tamoxifen treatment using 3-D zzso Sixteen women were zzso Each woman received breast zzso before and after zzso The breast and the zzso tissue were segmented using a zzso algorithm, based on zzso zzso The zzso tissue volume zzso and breast volume zzso were measured and the ratio was calculated as the percent breast density zzso The changes in breast volume zzso zzso tissue volume zzso and percent density zzso between two zzso studies were analyzed and correlated with treatment duration and baseline breast zzso The zzso showed a reduction in all 16 zzso The zzso showed a mean reduction of zzso The reduction of zzso was significantly correlated with baseline zzso zzso and treatment duration zzso The percentage change in zzso was correlated with duration zzso The reduction in zzso was positively correlated with baseline zzso zzso Women with higher baseline zzso showed more reduction of zzso zzso zzso may be useful for the measurement of the small changes of zzso and zzso after zzso These changes can potentially be used to correlate with the future reduction of cancer zzso
