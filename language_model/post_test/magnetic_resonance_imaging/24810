The zzso zzso zzso is a thin layer of zzso cartilage positioned between the zzso zzso and nucleus zzso zzso that functions both as a mechanical barrier and as a gateway for zzso transport into the zzso Despite its critical role in disc nutrition and zzso the zzso of the zzso has not been well zzso The objective of this study was to zzso and report observations of the zzso three-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso thickness using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso 

MR imaging of ex zzso human zzso zzso spine segments (N zzso 17) was performed in a zzso zzso scanner with sequence parameters that were selected by utilizing high-resolution zzso zzso and an zzso zzso signal model to zzso image contrast between zzso and zzso The zzso thickness at five locations along the zzso zzso direction zzso 5 zzso 10 zzso off-center towards anterior and zzso was measured, and analyzed using zzso zzso and a post hoc zzso zzso For further investigation, six in zzso volunteers were zzso with a similar sequence in a zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso was performed, which confirmed that the zzso sequence successfully detected the zzso 

zzso thickness determined by zzso in the zzso plane across all zzso disc levels and locations was zzso zzso zzso zzso ex zzso The zzso thickness was not different across disc levels, but was thinner toward the center of the zzso 

This study demonstrates the potential of zzso zzso imaging for structural zzso of the zzso zzso which may be developed as a technique to evaluate changes in the zzso with disc zzso in future zzso
