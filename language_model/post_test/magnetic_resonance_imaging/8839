Region of interest zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data analysis relies on zzso signals from a specific area which is presumed to be involved in the brain activity being zzso The zzso is of interest in many functional connectivity studies for example in zzso as it plays an important role in zzso In this context, zzso may be defined using different zzso Our study aims at evaluating the spatial correspondence of zzso zzso obtained using three brain zzso with zzso zzso obtained using an automatic zzso zzso dedicated to the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso MR images of 18 healthy volunteers (five zzso were acquired on a zzso zzso Individual zzso for both zzso of each subject were segmented from the MR images using an automatic zzso and zzso zzso software called zzso providing the gold standard zzso for comparison with the zzso zzso For each subject, zzso zzso were also obtained using three brain zzso zzso available as a commonly used software zzso automated anatomical labeling zzso zzso included as a subset of zzso into zzso zzso and a zzso brain zzso by zzso et zzso The levels of agreement between the zzso results and those obtained using the zzso were assessed based on quantitative zzso measuring volume differences and spatial zzso The comparison was performed in standard Montreal Neurological Institute space, the registration being obtained with zzso zzso 

The mean zzso error across all subjects was zzso for zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso in case of zzso derived from the zzso zzso and zzso for zzso derived from zzso The mean zzso and zzso zzso rates were zzso and zzso respectively for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso for the zzso 

Though zzso zzso definition may be convenient, the resulting zzso may be poor representations of the zzso in some studies critical to zzso or zzso Performance of the zzso zzso was inferior to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso are highly significantly smaller, and this results in the worst performance out of three zzso It is zzso that the defined zzso should be verified with knowledge of zzso before using it for further data zzso
