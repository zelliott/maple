Different categories of visual objects evoke distinct zzso sensory responses in zzso visual zzso Although numerous lines of evidence support a distinct zzso neural architecture, the mechanisms underlying the zzso of the category selectivity by zzso influences remains zzso In this study, we investigate the zzso role of the zzso in the zzso of evoked activity to face and scene stimuli in the zzso zzso We used two experimental approaches to disrupt prefrontal cortical zzso zzso to zzso in healthy participants zzso 1) and focal zzso zzso in stroke patients zzso zzso After these zzso to normal zzso function zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso intact zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso exhibited less distinct category selectivity to faces and zzso These two experiments provide zzso evidence highlighting a direct role of zzso in the zzso zzso of bottom-up visual zzso
