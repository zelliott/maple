We describe the clinical, zzso zzso presentation in two zzso families, and correlate it with the distribution and proportion of zzso DNA carrying the A to G transition at zzso zzso Family A was characterized by late onset zzso in two members, zzso in one, and mild zzso involvement in zzso zzso of zzso of affected and unaffected individuals was zzso in muscle, zzso in zzso There was no obvious correlation between clinical picture and proportion of zzso zzso In family B full zzso syndrome appeared only in the third generation, but the zzso was also detected in muscle of zzso individuals of the first and second zzso The proportion of zzso zzso in blood, and to a lesser extent in muscle, correlated with the severity of the clinical zzso The zzso zzso is consistently detected in all zzso maternal relatives of zzso zzso We conclude that different clinical presentations of zzso zzso may coexist in the same family, and correlation between clinical severity and molecular zzso is not always zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in muscle and blood is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the expression of the typical zzso zzso
