zzso zzso based zzso with precise and zzso zzso sizes are excellent candidates as magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast zzso Control of agents' sensitivity, zzso and functionality is key to the successful zzso We report the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso possessing highly controlled and precise structures, and their potential applications as zzso contrast zzso These agents have no obvious zzso as verified by zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso with zzso modification showed a zzso increase in zzso zzso to zzso zzso comparing to zzso In zzso studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso provided much higher signal intensity enhancement zzso in mouse zzso especially at zzso zzso with zzso relatively enhanced zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in mouse liver and kidney were confirmed through measurement of zzso by zzso coupled plasma atomic zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso showed much higher zzso concentration in blood with zzso blood at zzso zzso comparing to other zzso zzso These findings provide an attractive alternative strategy to the design of zzso zzso zzso with controlled structures, and open up possibilities of using the zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso
