Fourteen patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso examination (16 zzso and clinical evaluation zzso zzso studies included zzso enhancement and zzso zzso spin zzso Separate investigators determined the severity of disease on MR images and on clinical evaluation in a blinded zzso zzso studies were evaluated for percentage of mural contrast enhancement, wall zzso and length of diseased zzso An MR product was generated using these zzso Clinical evaluation used the Crohn's Disease zzso Index zzso and modified Index of the International Organization for the Study of zzso zzso Disease zzso Linear correlation was found between the MR product and clinical indexes of disease zzso The correlation between MR product and the modified zzso index was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The correlation of MR product and zzso was less close zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Among individual MR zzso length of diseased zzso showed the greatest correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Percentage contrast enhancement and zzso wall thickness showed significant correlation to the modified zzso index zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not to the zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The results of this study show that the product of mural contrast enhancement, wall zzso and length of diseased zzso correlated with clinical indexes of disease activity in Crohn's zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may be useful in evaluating the severity of Crohn's disease and may provide information complementary to clinical zzso
