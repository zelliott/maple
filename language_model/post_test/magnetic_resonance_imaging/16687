The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso and zzso brain structures zzso in zzso in the processing of emotional words varying in stimulus zzso Healthy subjects zzso were presented with emotional zzso or zzso or neutral words in three different conditions: zzso self zzso my zzso zzso other zzso his zzso and zzso no reference zzso the zzso zzso of unpleasant words was associated with increased zzso and also zzso zzso across all zzso Pleasant stimuli were specifically associated with increased zzso of zzso and zzso when related to the self zzso other and no zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso was zzso increased during processing of zzso emotional words zzso other and no zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso in response to emotional stimuli is modulated by stimulus reference and that brain structures implicated in emotional and zzso processing might be important for the zzso experience of one's own zzso
