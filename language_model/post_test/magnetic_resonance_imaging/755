We analyzed modifications in zzso relaxation time zzso and regional cerebral blood volume zzso in two areas of the zzso system, zzso zzso bulb zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso female zzso The aim of this work was to extend the knowledge about zzso modifications of these zzso parameters at different zzso zzso No significant difference was observed in zzso values of the zzso between the two groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso On the contrary zzso values of the zzso were significantly different zzso zzso zzso between the two groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values of zzso were significantly different zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso female rats zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed in the zzso These findings suggest that in the zzso system, zzso plasticity parallels zzso maturation and indicate the importance of an appropriate baseline study in experiments dealing with the zzso system performed at different zzso
