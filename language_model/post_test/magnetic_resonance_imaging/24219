zzso correlation studies in zzso syndromes have been handicapped by the low sensitivity of CT and standard zzso for acute zzso zzso and their difficulty in zzso between acute and chronic zzso 

We zzso studied 43 patients presenting with a classic zzso syndrome using zzso zzso a technique with a high sensitivity and specificity for acute zzso zzso 

All patients were scanned within 6 days of stroke zzso An acute zzso was identified in all zzso zzso motor stroke was associated with zzso in the zzso limb of the internal capsule zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and insular zzso zzso stroke with zzso in the zzso and lateral zzso zzso hand syndrome with zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and pure sensory stroke with a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso extended into neighboring zzso structures in zzso of the zzso 

zzso syndromes can be caused by zzso in a variety of locations, and specific locations can cause a variety of zzso zzso Extension of zzso into neighboring structures in patients with zzso syndromes appears to be more frequent than previously described in studies using CT and standard zzso
