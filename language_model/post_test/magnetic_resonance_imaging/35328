zzso is a powerful tool for measuring cerebral blood flow zzso zzso However, most animal studies require zzso potentially interfering with normal zzso zzso zzso was used here to study zzso regulation during repetitive scanning in zzso MR zzso images were acquired using FAIR zzso alternating inversion zzso zzso spin zzso and absolute zzso was zzso zzso changes in response to a hypoxic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gas stimulus were zzso zzso led to a robust increase in zzso compared with baseline zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused a smaller zzso increase in mean zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso were repeated 5 days later, zzso was dramatically reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the first imaging zzso Without application of the hypoxic and zzso gases during the first zzso baseline zzso and zzso changes in response to zzso at the second zzso were similar to zzso zzso Blood gas analyses revealed a slight reduction in zzso zzso during the second period of zzso compared with the zzso These findings indicate that, in zzso rats, even a short hypoxic episode can have long-lasting effects on cerebrovascular zzso
