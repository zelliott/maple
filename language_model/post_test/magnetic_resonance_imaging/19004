There are few reports about magnetic resonance zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso For this reason, we have undertaken a prospective study evaluating the diagnostic efficiency of zzso as compared with zzso zzso patients with zzso were examined with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and standard and zzso There were seven cases of zzso associated with acute zzso 11 patients with zzso and chronic zzso zzso five cases of zzso zzso of the zzso and one zzso disease of the zzso All cases were first submitted to zzso which failed to diagnose only a case of zzso associated with chronic zzso depicted by zzso We used a GE zzso Horizon zzso system (20 zzso and a zzso zzso Plus zzso machine (four zzso Eleven patients were operated zzso In all cases, it was possible to identify the zzso the main pancreatic duct and the zzso tree, and verify the relationship of the zzso with neighboring zzso Communication of the zzso with the main pancreatic duct was described in five instances, but we cannot be sure that zzso would have depicted all zzso zzso The zzso and zzso images were confirmed by surgery in the 11 zzso zzso The diagnosis of duct zzso and small pancreatic stones in initial cases of chronic zzso zzso may be zzso Clinical findings are very important data to be considered in the differential diagnosis of zzso Together with the clinical data, zzso is a very important technique in the diagnostic and therapeutic decision making of zzso Standard magnetic resonance is zzso as part of the examination in all zzso zzso is not zzso is reliable if one knows its limitations, and the patient can return at once to his zzso It allows the analysis of many variables in one examination, contributing to better zzso
