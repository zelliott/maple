This article reviews the experience available to date on zzso assessment in cancer of the zzso including correlation studies of magnetic resonance zzso zzso parameters with zzso zzso and direct correlation with patient zzso The data suggest that MR zzso parameters do not always correlate with zzso zzso while there is evidence that MR parameters predict patients' treatment zzso These observations raise the issue that perhaps the zzso zzso accepted gold standards for tumor zzso and zzso factors, reflect anatomical information at a zzso single time point and may not always provide sufficient information on the zzso zzso function of the zzso MR zzso assessment reflects both anatomical and functional information and may provide this additional information on the zzso zzso and zzso status of a zzso zzso assessment of tumor zzso may augment the individual risk profile in cervical cancer patients and has the potential to impact on therapy selection and treatment zzso
