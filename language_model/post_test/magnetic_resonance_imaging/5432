During zzso focused ultrasound zzso treatments of zzso zzso using zzso 2000, tissue zzso are delivered by a zzso zzso while MR imaging is performed with a pelvic receiver zzso The consistency of the pelvic zzso performance is crucial for reliable MR temperature zzso as well as detailed zzso imaging in zzso Test zzso in a gel phantom combined with MR zzso are used to test the performance of the zzso zzso prior to each zzso As we show, however, these tests do not adequately evaluate receiver zzso performance prior to clinical zzso This could become a problem since the zzso part of the zzso is frequently moved and can zzso The aim of this work is to demonstrate the utility of the zzso ratio zzso as a reliable indicator of pelvic zzso zzso Slight modification of the zzso zzso support was accomplished to assure zzso zzso zzso The zzso was measured in a gel phantom using zzso acquisitions from the zzso zzso MR temperature and zzso zzso were obtained using a zzso receiver zzso (with zzso element zzso and a known faulty zzso and compared to those obtained with a fully functioning zzso While the MR zzso tests were insensitive to change in pelvic zzso performance, zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso the zzso tests were highly sensitive to zzso performance, zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Additional clinical data illustrate the utility of zzso testing of the receiver zzso These tests require minimal (or possibly zzso additional scan time and have proven to be effective in our clinical zzso
