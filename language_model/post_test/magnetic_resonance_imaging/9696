In this issue of zzso two new approaches are described for the assessment of zzso blood flow in people with zzso The first approach used the technique of dynamic assessment of the resistance index zzso in the zzso zzso arteries before and after administration of zzso zzso zzso and the second used zzso to assess total zzso blood flow in relation to mean zzso pressure, thereby enabling direct measurement of overall zzso zzso The results of the first study raise the possibility that dynamic evaluation of the zzso zzso could be used as an early detector of vascular zzso in type 2 diabetes, before the onset of zzso The results of the second study suggest that decreases in zzso blood flow in people with longstanding type 1 diabetes reflect zzso vascular stiffening and raise the possibility that in zzso patients it may also reflect increased zzso zzso
