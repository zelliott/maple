zzso duct complications especially zzso zzso remains a major cause of morbidity influencing the zzso course in living donor liver transplantation zzso The objectives of this study were to investigate the outcome of zzso reconstruction using zzso zzso technique and to clarify the risk factors for zzso zzso after zzso 

We zzso analyzed data of 83 consecutive adult patients who underwent zzso between 1999 and zzso zzso was conducted in 22 patients and zzso zzso in 61 zzso The zzso zzso technique was applied zzso for zzso zzso 

The mean follow-up period after zzso was zzso years zzso zzso Of the 83 recipients, six zzso developed zzso strictures (four at zzso site and two at multiple zzso zzso and one zzso developed zzso leakage after zzso zzso factor analysis identified the diameter of donor zzso duct and the use of right lateral sector as significant risk factors for zzso zzso at the zzso 

Care should be taken when zzso a small zzso duct of the donor graft or right lateral sector graft in zzso because of the associated high zzso of zzso zzso Our technique, including the zzso zzso ensures quality control for zzso duct reconstruction and a better outcome after zzso
