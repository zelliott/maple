Visual stimuli can zzso zzso if they are different to their zzso There has been considerable debate as to the role of primary visual zzso zzso versus higher visual areas zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we zzso modulated the relative orientation of stimuli and their backgrounds to investigate the neural zzso of zzso in visual zzso while subjects were performing a demanding fixation task in a zzso Whole brain and region of interest analyses confirmed a representation of orientation contrast in zzso visual zzso zzso but not in zzso visual zzso zzso Thus, although previous studies have shown that human zzso can be involved in orientation zzso our findings demonstrate that there are cases where zzso is zzso and zzso detection is restricted to higher visual zzso zzso processing is presumably a distributed process across multiple visual zzso
