The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and potential usefulness of power zzso zzso zzso in the assessment of changes in zzso zzso area in the zzso outlet during upper limb zzso 

zzso volunteers and 28 patients with a clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso outlet syndrome were evaluated by zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso area was assessed in the 3 compartments of the zzso outlet with the arm alongside the body and at 90 degrees, 130 degrees, and 170 degrees of zzso The percentage of zzso zzso was calculated for each of these arm zzso zzso of the 28 patients were also assessed by magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

No significant zzso zzso was shown in the zzso triangle and in the zzso minor space of the volunteers and zzso A significant difference zzso zzso zzso in zzso between volunteers and patients was seen for all degrees of abduction in the zzso zzso The 130 degrees zzso maneuver appeared to be the most discriminating zzso zzso Seven patients assessed with MR imaging did not have any zzso zzso on MR images, whereas an appreciable degree of zzso zzso was shown with zzso 

zzso zzso inside the zzso outlet can be detected and zzso with zzso imaging in association with zzso
