zzso X syndrome zzso is the most common known cause of inherited zzso zzso zzso is associated with a zzso expansion in the zzso gene on the long arm of the X zzso zzso deficits, including problems with impulse control and zzso are common in zzso We used functional brain imaging with a zzso task to examine the neural zzso of response zzso in females with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso typically developing zzso Although subjects with zzso had significantly lower zzso scores, as a group their performance on the zzso task was equivalent to that of the typically developing zzso However, females with zzso showed abnormal zzso patterns in several cortical and zzso regions, with significantly reduced zzso in the supplementary motor area, anterior zzso and zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso An important finding of our study is that neural responses in the right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and the left and right zzso were correlated with the level of zzso gene zzso Our findings support the hypothesis that zzso regions typically associated with response zzso are dysfunctional in females with zzso In addition to zzso zzso deficits, reduced levels of zzso were observed in the zzso zzso and, zzso these reductions were correlated with the level of zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso is a key zzso in a zzso zzso network that monitors mental and zzso zzso we suggest that zzso processes may be zzso in zzso
