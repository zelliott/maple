In the verbal zzso task, there was significantly increased zzso in the left inferior frontal zzso in the zzso patients and the healthy control sample compared with the zzso zzso During auditory zzso the healthy control group and zzso treated group produced significantly greater zzso in the superior zzso zzso than the zzso zzso 

zzso treatment is associated with altered blood oxygen zzso responses in both the prefrontal and zzso zzso that cannot be accounted for by improved task performance subsequent to drug zzso
