To investigate the MR findings in patients who have had zzso frontal zzso zzso placed for inflammatory zzso zzso 

The MR images of 13 patients who had improvement of symptoms after zzso frontal zzso zzso placement with fat zzso were zzso evaluated for the presence of high intensity on zzso scans, contrast enhancement, and replacement of frontal zzso fat by zzso soft zzso All studies were performed on a zzso unit using a zzso round surface zzso placed over the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso images were obtained through the operative zzso The zzso and zzso sequences were done with a zzso zzso 

zzso within the frontal zzso on zzso images and enhancement zzso and/or centrally where fat was replaced with soft zzso were found to some degree in all zzso The degree of replacement of frontal zzso fat with soft tissue ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso Five patients with persistent symptoms had no distinguishing MR features when compared with zzso zzso 

Although increased zzso intensity, fat replacement, and enhancement are findings compatible with zzso these changes may be seen in patients who are zzso after placement of zzso frontal zzso zzso they may represent the normal zzso zzso MR findings after zzso placement are zzso and have limited utility in distinguishing symptomatic patients with zzso inflammatory disease from zzso patients whose imaging findings are related to zzso zzso zzso
