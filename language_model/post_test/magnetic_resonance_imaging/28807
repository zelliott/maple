To identify the zzso features associated with zzso in older zzso 

zzso of unknown cause is common in older zzso zzso specimens from six patients and four control subjects, who were part of a zzso study of older people with zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso appearance were zzso zzso zzso zzso sclerotic index (1 - zzso zzso zzso and zzso density were zzso in the frontal zzso white matter zzso 

In comparison with control subjects, most patients had prominent frontal zzso and zzso There were no other gross zzso findings, microscopic zzso or areas of necrosis in patients or control zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso of most patients and not in control zzso Patients tended to have higher mean sclerotic zzso compared with control subjects, but zzso density was no different in the two zzso zzso plaques and zzso zzso were no different in patients and control subjects except in one patient, in whom zzso developed after zzso One patient had cerebral zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso 

Although there was some overlap between the two groups, the main differences between patients and control subjects were prominent frontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and increased zzso wall thickness zzso zzso These findings suggest an association between zzso zzso and zzso in older zzso zzso
