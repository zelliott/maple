A clinical retrospective zzso 

To investigate the clinical outcomes of surgery for cervical spine zzso and identify factors affecting survival and neurological zzso 

zzso disease in the cervical spine is known to be a poorer prognosis than in zzso and zzso zzso Few reports focused on cervical spine zzso are zzso 

A retrospective analysis of medical records and zzso data was performed on 46 patients who underwent surgical treatment due to cervical spine zzso from 2000 to zzso The zzso of cervical zzso overall survival, zzso survival, and neurological and pain outcomes were zzso In addition, factors affecting survival, local zzso and neurological and pain outcomes among the 46 study subjects were zzso These factors zzso age, sex, primary tumor growth rate, zzso zzso status zzso with zzso zzso zzso timing of zzso zzso zzso therapy, time of diagnosis of spinal zzso zzso zzso or zzso invasion on magnetic resonance image, zzso neurological status, and zzso pain zzso 

The zzso of cervical zzso was zzso Mean zzso overall survival was zzso months, the recurrence rate was zzso and mean progression free survival was zzso zzso zzso related to prolonged survival were slow primary tumor growth, low zzso score, zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy was also found to be effective for preventing zzso Patients with high zzso Japanese zzso Association zzso achieved better neurological zzso zzso invasion was found to be zzso correlated with zzso pain zzso 

zzso management for zzso cervical spinal zzso was found to be effective in terms of neurological recovery and pain zzso Furthermore, surgical treatment plus zzso therapy was found to achieve sufficient local control during zzso zzso
