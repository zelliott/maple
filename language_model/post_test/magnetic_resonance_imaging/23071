Current literature only gives sparse account of aneurysm surgery in an zzso zzso zzso After installation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso T at our institution the aim of the present preliminary study was to evaluate zzso pros and cons of aneurysm surgery in this special zzso 

Since February 2009, during a 3 months period we performed zzso image guided aneurysm surgery in 4 zzso and 1 zzso aneurysm (four zzso in this zzso zzso The patients' heads were zzso fixed in the zzso zzso OR Head zzso Our imaging protocol included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso immediately before surgery and after clip zzso zzso zzso was performed using the zzso 

All five zzso were operated without temporary zzso There were no zzso or zzso zzso Patient positioning and head fixation with the integrated zzso Head zzso was zzso but there were significant limitations particularly with regard to more complex approaches and patient zzso Image quality especially zzso was good in 4, insufficient in 1 zzso zzso planning especially vessel extraction from zzso was possible but certainly needs significant future zzso zzso and zzso weighted examinations yielded good image zzso 

Our limited experience is encouraging so zzso Further improvement particularly concerning flexibility of patient positioning and zzso zzso for vascular procedures is most zzso As a future perspective image guided aneurysm surgery in an zzso may be helpful especially in complex zzso and provide zzso and zzso with additional information about cerebral zzso and zzso pattern in the vascular territory zzso to the target zzso
