zzso flexibility is known to depend on the zzso However, the zzso does not act in isolation to bias cognitive zzso In particular, cognitive flexibility also implicates the frontal zzso Here we tested the hypothesis that the human frontal zzso controls cognitive flexibility by regulating zzso function via zzso specific zzso zzso To this end, we exploited a repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso protocol over frontal zzso that is known to increase zzso release in the zzso This intervention was combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the functional and zzso specificity of its consequences at the whole brain zzso Participants were scanned both before and after zzso zzso while performing a cognitive switching task that is known to depend on a specific zzso zzso the zzso zzso stimulation zzso zzso functional signals in the zzso while reducing zzso functional zzso There were no such effects of zzso over the zzso zzso zzso These data strengthen the hypothesis that cognitive flexibility involves zzso frontal control of zzso zzso
