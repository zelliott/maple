A clinical functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso protocol based on a fully automated tactile stimulation was zzso in 10 right-handed volunteers at zzso T for minimum scan time, high zzso and robust zzso of the primary zzso zzso zzso by systematically varying the applied block zzso All volunteers had six different zzso zzso of 5 zzso cycles each with equal block duration that was changed between the zzso from 6 to 30 zzso Data sets of 4, 3 and 2 cycles were generated post hoc resulting in a total of 240 data sets that were evaluated individually for zzso intensity zzso correlation to the zzso reference function zzso and zzso coordinates zzso zzso zzso The protocol with 5 cycles, a block duration of 6 s and a total scan time of 66 s provided the best zzso characteristics zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso Compared to the mean scan time of other clinical zzso protocols zzso zzso a reduction of zzso was zzso
