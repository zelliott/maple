Enlargement of the zzso zzso is being increasingly recognized as a not uncommon and zzso cause of zzso sleep zzso particularly in patients with Down syndrome who have undergone zzso zzso and zzso We have recognized an increasing number of patients who are obese and have zzso sleep zzso with enlarged zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of enlarged zzso zzso in obese zzso 

Seventy-one obese children zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso fast zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso were identified and measured in the greatest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso were considered markedly zzso The zzso with absent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with those with zzso zzso present zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the obese children had measurable zzso zzso which is greater than the frequency previously reported in normal subjects zzso subjects with zzso sleep zzso zzso or subjects with Down syndrome and zzso sleep zzso zzso Ten zzso had zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso subjects with absent zzso zzso zzso zzso had a higher prevalence of measurable zzso zzso than those with zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a higher prevalence of zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso children have a high frequency of enlargement of the zzso zzso with a significantly higher prevalence in those with previous zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a role in the zzso of zzso sleep zzso in obese zzso
