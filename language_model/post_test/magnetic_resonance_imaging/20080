The zzso Review Board approved the zzso and all patients provided signed informed zzso The protocol was zzso with zzso The purpose of the study was to zzso test the hypothesis that addition of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso reserve in segments with zzso zzso zzso zzso would improve the zzso value for functional recovery after zzso in chronic zzso Fifteen patients with zzso coronary artery disease and left zzso zzso dysfunction were enrolled prior to coronary artery bypass zzso zzso Late zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging was used to assess zzso The percentage of wall zzso was measured with zzso cardiac MR imaging at rest and during infusion of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso Repeat cardiac MR imaging was performed 20 weeks zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters according to segment were compared before and after zzso by using F tests with zzso zzso In segments with zzso zzso similar functional recovery was noted in those with zzso or zzso zzso However, in the same zzso those that improved with zzso to normal range demonstrated greater improvement in the percentage of wall zzso zzso zzso 4) after zzso than those that did not zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso a normal zzso response helps differentiate segments with greater functional recovery after zzso
