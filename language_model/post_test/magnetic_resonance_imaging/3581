This prospective study evaluated the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the assessment of left zzso zzso and right zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso volume zzso and zzso volume zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso using cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging as the reference zzso 

zzso patients (24 men and 8 zzso mean age, 51 zzso with a diagnosis of idiopathic zzso underwent zzso and zzso zzso and RV parameters including zzso zzso and zzso from zzso were calculated using fully automated zzso software and compared with those obtained by zzso 

zzso volumes were underestimated by zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso We found no statistical difference between these 2 methods in the assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas RV zzso was overestimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis yielded significant correlations between zzso and zzso in the assessments of zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for RV zzso zzso for RV zzso and zzso for RV zzso all P zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of RV zzso between zzso and zzso with the ratio of RV zzso to zzso zzso showed that there was a statistically significant trend for RV volumes to be underestimated and for RV zzso to be overestimated as the zzso zzso ratio decreased zzso zzso zzso for RV zzso zzso for RV zzso and zzso for RV zzso all P zzso zzso 

For patients with zzso zzso correlated well with zzso for the assessment of zzso zzso but RV zzso should be cautiously zzso
