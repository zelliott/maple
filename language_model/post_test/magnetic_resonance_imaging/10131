We assessed zzso injury and zzso in the cerebral zzso white matter zzso of zzso patients in a pilot study using zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and quantitative zzso transfer zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso were measured in a large central brain zzso zzso in zzso was estimated by zzso of the zzso in each zzso against white matter fraction and zzso to a white matter fraction of zzso The fractional size of the zzso pool zzso was obtained from the zzso spin bath model of zzso by computing the model parameters from multiple zzso and zzso zzso F in zzso was significantly smaller in the patients zzso zzso relative to controls zzso zzso P zzso zzso but did not differ between zzso zzso and SP zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and F in the zzso were not correlated zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso mainly due to a lack of variation in F among zzso This may indicate a floor to the extent of zzso pathology that can occur in zzso before a zzso appears, or that zzso damage is not strictly related to zzso The correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso volume was not significant zzso zzso zzso However, dividing the zzso volumes by the mean F in zzso zzso resulted in a quantity that correlated well with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso possibly reflecting the association of zzso zzso in the zzso with zzso zzso associated with zzso within zzso
