Alzheimer's disease zzso pathology of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be relevant to zzso cognitive zzso The objective of this study was to relate zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and their interaction to zzso cognitive change in cognitively normal zzso 

zzso older people completed at least three consecutive zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plaque burden was measured with zzso compound B zzso zzso retention was zzso into a positive zzso zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso 25) zzso zzso zzso zzso were extracted within zzso regions of interest zzso the zzso and zzso cortical zzso Within each zzso metabolism was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the gray matter structure was evaluated using volume zzso or thickness zzso zzso zzso functional and structural zzso were combined further into zzso neurodegenerative composite zzso Using zzso zzso models, zzso and the neurodegenerative zzso were related to cognitive zzso 

zzso zzso was associated with memory and zzso zzso The neurodegenerative zzso modified these zzso zzso cognitive decline was accelerated in those individuals who exhibited both zzso zzso and lower neurodegenerative zzso scores, although the two measures appeared to be zzso zzso retention zzso predominantly with the cortical neurodegenerative composite for zzso zzso Memory decline was best explained by the interaction between zzso and the zzso neurodegenerative zzso suggesting regional specificity of the neurodegenerative zzso 

Our findings indicate that cognitive zzso deteriorate at a faster rate in cognitively normal individuals expressing zzso burden and zzso within specific zzso zzso
