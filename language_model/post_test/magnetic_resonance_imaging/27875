zzso resonance zzso imaging zzso with 3-D MR reconstruction provides an excellent display of the soft zzso and surface anatomy of the human zzso The excellent anatomical detail of MR images makes this zzso zzso an ideal tool to teach anatomy to all health-care zzso Previous studies of the lung and liver in zzso revealed that the zzso zzso communicated with the visceral zzso zzso via the so-called pulmonary zzso which appears as a sheet of visceral zzso containing zzso and small blood vessels in the zzso zzso A review of the surgical operative reports at the zzso School of Medicine revealed that the zzso zzso are not connected or even zzso during zzso zzso and zzso zzso the authors hypothesized that the zzso zzso may be a cause of zzso complications and that interruption of these important zzso pathways may specifically result in immediate zzso and right zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is proposed as a method to reduce zzso zzso The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the visual and zzso display of the zzso zzso in a zzso model and to provide a means to teach zzso zzso
