zzso bone zzso is a significant zzso of the zzso mechanical properties and is thus of major clinical relevance in predicting fracture zzso The three-dimensional nature of zzso bone is characterized by parameters describing scale, zzso and orientation of structural zzso However, none of the current methods zzso all three types of parameters simultaneously and in three zzso Here the authors present a method that produces a continuous zzso of zzso as belonging to zzso or zzso structures that determines their orientation and estimates their zzso The method, dubbed local zzso zzso zzso treats the image as a distribution of mass density and the orientation of zzso is determined from a locally calculated zzso of inertia at each zzso The orientation zzso of rods and plates are introduced, which can provide new information about zzso not captured by existing zzso The zzso of the method to noise corruption, resolution reduction, and image rotation is zzso Further, the method is compared with established three-dimensional parameters including the zzso index and zzso zzso zzso Finally, the method is applied to data acquired in a previous zzso pilot study showing that the zzso bone of zzso zzso men is less zzso than that of their zzso zzso
