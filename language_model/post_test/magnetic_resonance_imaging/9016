This report documents a zzso zzso zzso contrast agent, containing embedded zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a contrast agent of inflamed zzso in a collagen induced arthritis zzso zzso 

zzso mice were zzso for zzso and zzso after disease onset by two independent zzso After intravenous administration of zzso contrast, optical and magnetic resonance images were obtained and clinical disease was zzso which was followed by processing of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso 

We show a correlation between disease severity and zzso optical zzso that is dose zzso zzso of zzso sections reveal that zzso cells are zzso within the inflamed zzso zzso resonance zzso relaxation time zzso which determine the quantitative measure of zzso and zzso values at each imaging zzso demonstrated a decreasing zzso signal in actively inflamed zzso that was more pronounced earlier rather than later during zzso 

zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and embedded zzso are potential zzso contrast agents in inflammatory arthritis and zzso to zzso within inflamed zzso
