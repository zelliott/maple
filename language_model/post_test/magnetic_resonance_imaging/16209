This study aimed to investigate changes in the deep zzso muscles, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso occurring in association with differing stages of unilateral degenerative hip joint pathology zzso zzso and zzso zzso Muscle volume assessed via magnetic resonance imaging was compared for each muscle between sides, and between groups zzso advanced, control zzso zzso and zzso muscle volume was smaller around the affected hip in subjects with advanced pathology zzso zzso while no significant asymmetry was present in the mild and control zzso zzso showed a trend towards asymmetry in the advanced group zzso and the control group zzso which appears to have been associated with leg zzso Between group differences revealed a significant difference for the zzso muscle reflecting larger muscle volumes on the affected side in subjects with mild pathology, compared to matched control zzso This information suggests that while zzso appears to zzso in subjects with advanced hip joint pathology, it may be predisposed to zzso in early stages of zzso Assessment and exercise prescription methods should consider that the response of muscles of the zzso zzso to joint pathology is not zzso between muscles or across stages of zzso
