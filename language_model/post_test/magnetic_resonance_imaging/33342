zzso zzso tumor zzso is a rare zzso of the zzso The purpose of this study is to determine the zzso features of zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed 15 patients with zzso proven zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso The location, size, shape, margin, and zzso signal of 15 zzso were zzso The zzso curve zzso of dynamic zzso zzso in 14 patients and zzso imaging in four patients were also zzso 

Ten zzso zzso were located in the zzso space zzso at the superior aspect and three at the lateral zzso three in the zzso zzso space, one in the zzso aspect of the zzso space, and one in the zzso zzso zzso All zzso appeared zzso in zzso and had zzso zzso The mean maximum diameter was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fourteen zzso appeared zzso zzso to gray matter on zzso zzso On zzso images, the zzso showed zzso zzso in nine patients and zzso in five zzso The zzso showed zzso marked enhancement on zzso zzso zzso zzso areas on zzso images with marked enhancement were observed in nine zzso zzso signal was identified in six zzso The zzso of 14 patients showed a zzso zzso The contrast index was zzso the time to peak enhancement was zzso seconds, and the zzso ratio was zzso The mean apparent diffusion zzso value of four patients was zzso zzso Another case exhibited zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso signal on zzso images, marked enhancement, and a zzso zzso pattern are the characteristic zzso features of zzso zzso
