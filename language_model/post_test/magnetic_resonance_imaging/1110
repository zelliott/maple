zzso zzso appears in zzso to zzso of zzso The most frequent locations are stomach, zzso or upper zzso zzso in zzso zzso is rarely zzso and clinical symptoms caused by this zzso inflammation are zzso 

We report a case of zzso zzso localized in the major zzso zzso causing zzso obstruction and mimicking a pancreatic head zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso showed only zzso A zzso preserving zzso of the pancreatic head was performed followed by an zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in the zzso region on the pancreatic side a thickened zzso wall with multiple zzso and zzso was found, zzso the common zzso zzso zzso examination showed zzso zzso with inflammatory zzso surrounding the zzso In the zzso zzso a diffuse chronic zzso with marked zzso zzso and zzso of zzso tissue was zzso 

In our case it was impossible to differentiate between chronic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso findings and zzso zzso were not sufficient to distinguish zzso zzso from other tumors of the pancreatic zzso Clear diagnosis could only be made by complete zzso examinations after pancreatic head zzso being the treatment of choice for pancreatic head tumors of unclear zzso The differential diagnosis of zzso zzso as trigger of unclear enlargement of the pancreatic head is very zzso
