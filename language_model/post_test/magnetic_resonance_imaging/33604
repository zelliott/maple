We have used MR monitoring to guide and evaluate the effects of the zzso zzso laser on a zzso rat brain tumor model zzso zzso was used to determine the tumor size, verify the location of the zzso probe, and evaluate the size and location of the zzso zzso during and after zzso During laser zzso an irreversible loss of signal intensity at the fiber tip and a zzso decrease in signal intensity around it were observed with zzso None of the treatment protocols affected mean rat survival zzso Although zzso zzso laser therapy appears to be safe and easy, it does not provide a zzso treatment for zzso zzso zzso where a zzso zzso cannot be adequately zzso Better results can be expected, especially in zzso tumors, with improvements of both the imaging techniques and the laser treatment zzso
