The zzso changes in the inner ears of 5 patients with zzso syndrome were studied by a combined application of MR imaging and CT zzso We used zzso and zzso MR imaging sequences and a special three-dimensional MR imaging technique which allows a very detailed imaging of the inner ear zzso By the use of a CT scan zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be zzso The aim of the study was to zzso zzso labyrinth pathology in zzso syndrome and correlate them with the clinical zzso In one patient who recovered completely without hearing loss, the MR and CT investigations revealed no zzso In the remaining 4 cases, narrowing or obliteration of parts of the zzso labyrinth was zzso In 3 patients, we found aberrations in the zzso consistent with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed enhancement of the zzso and zzso labyrinth in one case, probably indicating an active process with interruption of the zzso zzso The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the inner ear pathology in zzso syndrome is probably caused by zzso zzso
