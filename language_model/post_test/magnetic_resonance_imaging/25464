The objectives of our study were to identify independent clinical, zzso and MR imaging zzso of zzso in patients with zzso and to develop a zzso model based on identified zzso of zzso 

Sixty examinations of 58 patients with biopsy proof of zzso suggestive of zzso zzso on MR imaging were zzso zzso The signal intensity of the zzso on zzso imaging and dynamic zzso imaging, the size of the zzso and the number of suspicious zzso were recorded; in addition, patient age and sex, zzso level, and zzso C viral zzso were zzso The association between zzso and each predictor variable was evaluated using the zzso test or the zzso zzso zzso The final zzso zzso model included the variables that were shown to have a significant association with zzso and the clinically relevant zzso We used the adjusted odds ratios to measure the strength of each zzso The zzso ability of the model for detecting zzso zzso was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve zzso 

The prevalence of zzso zzso in our study population was zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the zzso zzso model was zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso level zzso ratio zzso zzso and number of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso were significant zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso enhancement and zzso zzso were either both present or both zzso zzso level contributed little to the prediction of zzso 

The MR characteristics of zzso zzso during the dynamic zzso phase in conjunction with the serum zzso level and number of zzso are zzso of zzso zzso The use of these zzso can facilitate explicit zzso of zzso in individuals with underlying zzso potentially improving clinical zzso
