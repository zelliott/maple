zzso review of magnetic resonance zzso 

Examine the diagnostic zzso zzso ability, and reliability of the zzso sign in a sample of patients with clinically diagnosed zzso spinal zzso zzso low back pain zzso and vascular zzso and in zzso zzso 

The nerve root zzso sign zzso was recently described as a new diagnostic test for zzso however, the degree to which this sign is sensitive and specific in diagnosis of zzso is zzso 

All zzso images were obtained from subjects who had clinically diagnosed zzso confirmed on imaging by a spine zzso The other images were obtained from people with zzso but no zzso people with severe vascular zzso and zzso zzso Three blinded zzso independently assessed the zzso A positive sign was defined as the absence of nerve root zzso at the level above or below the level of maximum zzso 

Images from 148 subjects were reviewed zzso zzso 31 zzso 4 zzso and 46 zzso zzso reliability for the sign ranged from zzso zzso to zzso and zzso reliability from zzso to zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and specificity ranged from zzso to zzso zzso improved to a range of zzso to zzso when images with only a smallest zzso area of the zzso zzso less than 80 zzso were zzso The sign was able to differentiate zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso controls but not between zzso and zzso or between zzso and vascular zzso 

The zzso was shown to have high zzso reliability and acceptable zzso zzso The Sign appears most sensitive in defining severe zzso cases, yet may not aid in the differential diagnosis of zzso from zzso or vascular zzso or add any specific diagnostic information beyond the traditional history, physical examination, and imaging studies that are standard in zzso zzso
