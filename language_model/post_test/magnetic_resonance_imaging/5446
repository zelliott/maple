The zzso zzso zzso are the only zzso that bear weight directly through zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an association between zzso stresses during running and increases in volume of joint zzso 

This was a prospective case controlled study zzso healthy athlete volunteers acting as own zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso were obtained following 24 h rest and after a zzso zzso The volume of joint fluid in each zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by two independent observers using an automated zzso zzso zzso 

The median volume of zzso fluid in the zzso at rest was zzso zzso zzso range zzso range zzso and after running zzso zzso zzso range zzso p zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The volume of fluid in the zzso of the great toes was substantially larger than other toes zzso zzso at rest, zzso zzso after exercise, p zzso zzso Median volumes decrease from second to fifth zzso zzso zzso at rest and zzso zzso after zzso zzso analysis for each toe revealed no significant difference in volumes before and after running zzso zzso zzso to p zzso zzso The zzso reliability for observer zzso was good with an zzso correlation of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

It appears to be normal to find zzso fluid, particularly in the zzso of the great zzso of athletes at rest and after zzso There does not appear to be an association between moderate distance running and an increase in the volume of zzso zzso
