Reconstruction of movements from zzso recorded brain activity is a key technology for zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso or zzso zzso inevitably records a mixture of signals originating from many cortical regions, and thus it is not only less effective than invasive methods but also poses more difficulty for incorporating zzso zzso We combined two sparse zzso methods to overcome this zzso First, thousands of cortical currents were estimated on the order of zzso and milliseconds by a zzso zzso zzso inverse method, and then a sparse zzso method automatically selected only relevant cortical currents in accurate reconstruction of movements by a linear weighted sum of their time zzso Using the combined methods, we reconstructed two-dimensional zzso of the index fingertip during pointing movements to various directions by moving the wrist zzso A good zzso zzso performance was observed for test zzso mean error between the predicted and actual positions was 15 zzso which was zzso of the path length of the required zzso The reconstruction accuracy of the proposed method was significantly higher than directly using zzso sensor zzso Moreover, spatial distribution and zzso characteristics of weight values revealed that the primary zzso higher zzso and zzso regions mainly contributed to the reconstruction with expected time zzso These results suggest that the combined sparse zzso methods provide effective means to predict movement trajectory from zzso brain activity directly related to zzso zzso
