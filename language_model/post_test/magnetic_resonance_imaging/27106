In moderate to severely impaired stroke patients, single pulse zzso with or without background zzso may not be able to evoke a motor response in muscles of the upper zzso thereby hindering potential studies of stroke patients using zzso zzso pulse zzso has been shown to facilitate responses in zzso muscles of healthy zzso In this study, our aim was to investigate thirteen muscles of the upper zzso in moderate to severely impaired stroke patients and determine the paired pulse zzso zzso zzso that was optimal for zzso of the zzso zzso 

We recruited 8 moderate to severely impaired stroke patients and 5 healthy zzso A hotspot was found that could activate the greatest number of the 13 target upper zzso zzso 16 zzso were zzso 

In healthy controls, an zzso range of zzso zzso in the left zzso and zzso zzso in the right zzso was optimal for zzso the zzso zzso In the stroke patients, stimulation of the zzso zzso at an zzso of zzso zzso was optimal for zzso responses, similar to the control subjects, while stimulation of the zzso zzso had an optimal zzso range of zzso zzso zzso responses in the zzso limb were frequent and the optimal zzso range was much later than the zzso responses in stroke or controls occurring at zzso zzso 

In stroke and control subjects, across muscles and zzso or zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso was optimal to evoke a zzso response and resulted in the greatest degree of zzso
