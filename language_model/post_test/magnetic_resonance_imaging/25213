We measure the tissue oxygen and zzso zzso in the rat brain during zzso of zzso oxygen concentration zzso using zzso frequency domain zzso zzso The rise in zzso zzso concentration and the decline in zzso zzso concentration are demonstrated in correspondence with the zzso of zzso which is changed from zzso to zzso in increments of zzso Furthermore, the tissue zzso zzso also shows the corresponding trend and changes ranging from approximately zzso to zzso The relative changes in zzso zzso concentration are compared to the zzso zzso zzso signal recorded during a similar zzso zzso A linear relationship with high correlation zzso between the relative changes in the zzso zzso signal and the zzso signal is zzso
