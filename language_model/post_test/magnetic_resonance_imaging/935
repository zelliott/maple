To demonstrate and determine the frequency and location of zzso within zzso knees with or without zzso typical of calcium zzso zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso and MR imaging zzso 

Ten zzso knees of elderly individuals that demonstrated no zzso evidence of prior surgery or trauma were studied with MR imaging and subsequently zzso in planes corresponding to those obtained with MR zzso The slices were zzso with high-resolution zzso Two musculoskeletal zzso correlated the zzso MR and zzso zzso Three of the knees, which did not demonstrate zzso were zzso as zzso zzso sections were obtained from four knees that contained zzso and from the three controls, and analyzed with special zzso zzso that demonstrate zzso and zzso 

zzso imaging and zzso analysis demonstrated widespread zzso crystal deposition in four of the 10 knee specimens zzso MR imaging demonstrated some zzso only within the zzso cartilage of the zzso zzso in three of the four zzso specimens that had zzso zzso In all four specimens zzso and zzso analysis were more sensitive than MR zzso zzso analysis demonstrated no evidence of zzso zzso in the control zzso 

MR imaging is insensitive to the presence of zzso deposits in the knee, even when such deposits are zzso Our study suggests that the sensitivity of MR imaging was significantly better in detecting zzso deposits in the zzso cartilage of the zzso zzso when compared with other internal structures, even when such structures contained a higher amount of zzso
