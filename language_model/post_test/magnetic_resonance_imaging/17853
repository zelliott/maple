zzso spectrum disorders zzso are a group of zzso conditions that are accompanied by zzso brain zzso So far, in zzso evidence for zzso structural brain connectivity in zzso has mainly been based on zzso studies of cortical white zzso However, genetic studies suggest that abnormal connectivity in zzso may also affect neural connections within the cortical gray zzso Such intrinsic zzso connections are inherently more difficult to describe in zzso but may be zzso from a variety of zzso geometric features that can be measured using magnetic resonance zzso Here, we present a zzso study that examines the intrinsic zzso connectivity of the brain in zzso using measures of zzso separation zzso to assess the global and local intrinsic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso estimated length of horizontal connections required to wire the zzso within the cortical zzso In a sample of 68 adults with zzso and matched controls, we observed significantly reduced intrinsic wiring costs of zzso in zzso both globally and zzso zzso in global and local wiring cost were predominantly observed in zzso regions and also significantly predicted the severity of social and repetitive symptoms zzso Our study confirms that zzso zzso zzso in zzso is not restricted to the development of zzso connections but may also affect the intrinsic zzso architecture (and zzso within the cortical zzso Thus, the zzso connectivity of the brain in zzso is complex, affecting both gray and white matter, and forms part of the core neural zzso underlying zzso zzso
