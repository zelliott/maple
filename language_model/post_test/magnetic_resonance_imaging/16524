In iron overload, almost all the excess iron is stored zzso as rapidly zzso zzso iron and slowly zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso iron may produce zzso damage that ultimately results in zzso zzso Because zzso zzso iron is evidently in equilibrium with the zzso zzso iron pool, zzso of zzso iron potentially provide a clinically useful indicator of changes in zzso zzso The cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso index of cardiac iron used zzso the effective zzso relaxation rate zzso is principally influenced by zzso iron and changes only slowly over several months, even with intensive zzso zzso Another conventional zzso index of cardiac iron, the zzso relaxation rate zzso is sensitive to both zzso iron and zzso zzso We have developed a new zzso measure, the zzso zzso relaxation zzso zzso and have proposed in previous studies that this measure is primarily sensitive to zzso iron and largely independent of zzso iron in zzso mimicking zzso iron and human liver zzso We hypothesized that zzso could detect changes produced by 1 week of zzso therapy in patients with zzso zzso We zzso 10 patients with zzso major at zzso T in zzso zzso planes of the heart, initially after suspending zzso therapy for 1 week and subsequently after zzso oral zzso After zzso zzso therapy, significant decreases were observed in the mean zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso p zzso zzso Although the difference between changes in zzso and zzso was not significant zzso zzso zzso zzso was consistently more sensitive than zzso (and zzso to the resumption of zzso therapy, as judged by the effect sizes of relaxation rate differences zzso Although further studies are needed, zzso zzso may be a promising zzso method for the rapid assessment of the effects of zzso therapy in the zzso
