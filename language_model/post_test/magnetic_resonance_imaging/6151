In this study, we examined muscle zzso and zzso status during incremental wrist extension exercise in the zzso of individuals with zzso zzso zzso zzso women employed in full-time zzso involving repetitive zzso labor were recruited in this zzso zzso Nine of these women were diagnosed with zzso while the other nine had no previous zzso history and were used as zzso controls zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso was used to zzso monitor the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso pH zzso status during exercise in zzso and zzso We observed a 38% decreased work capacity in zzso compared with Con zzso W zzso zzso zzso zzso W zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso linear zzso of the incremental exercise data revealed that the onset of a faster decrease in zzso zzso the pH zzso zzso and the onset of a faster increase in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso occurred at a zzso relatively lower power output in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso % of peak power zzso Con zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling of the zzso of zzso and zzso recovery following exercise demonstrated a slower zzso zzso zzso time constant zzso for zzso in zzso zzso s zzso zzso zzso Con zzso s zzso zzso and a slower zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso s zzso zzso zzso Con zzso s zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso is associated with an increased reliance on zzso zzso zzso mechanisms include a reduction in local muscle blood flow and zzso an increased zzso cost of force production, or zzso
