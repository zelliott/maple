An in zzso study to develop a goat zzso model for zzso disc zzso zzso 

To determine an optimal method for inducing goat zzso zzso suitable for testing disc zzso zzso 

Although zzso zzso and other small animal studies are useful, the narrow dimensions of zzso in these species limit studies requiring injection of a relevant volume of zzso or zzso of engineered tissue zzso For this study, the goat was selected because the size and shape of their zzso are comparable with those of adult zzso 

A minimally invasive approach that did not cause significant morbidity or mortality to adult zzso zzso zzso 6) was zzso Under zzso guidance, goat zzso zzso were injured with a zzso drill bit or zzso or zzso surgical zzso Two months zzso the zzso were killed and their zzso with adjacent end plates were isolated, zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso scale to categorize the degree of goat zzso zzso was developed on the basis of the zzso features of rabbit zzso previously described by zzso et zzso goat zzso described by zzso et zzso and human zzso described by zzso et zzso The zzso agreement of our scoring system was assessed (weighted zzso value zzso zzso zzso U tests were used to compare the injured zzso with zzso zzso A zzso drill bit inserted to a zzso depth resulted in a significantly higher zzso score than zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso or zzso blade did not result in increased zzso scores compared with zzso zzso 

A comparison of the various injuries inflicted showed that the use of a zzso drill bit resulted in the most significant zzso zzso
