Phase 1 clinical trials of zzso stimulating factor zzso treatment after zzso zzso have indicated that zzso treatment is safe and may improve left zzso zzso This randomized, zzso zzso trial aimed to assess the efficacy of subcutaneous zzso injections on left zzso function in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients (62 zzso average age, 56 zzso with zzso zzso zzso were included after successful primary zzso coronary zzso intervention zzso hours after symptom zzso Patients were zzso to zzso treatment with zzso (10 zzso of body zzso or zzso for 6 zzso The primary end point was change in zzso wall zzso from baseline to 6 months determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso An independent core laboratory analyzed all zzso zzso zzso wall zzso improved zzso in the zzso area in the zzso group and zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso results were found in zzso border and zzso zzso Left zzso ejection fraction improved similarly in the 2 groups measured by both zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso The risk of severe clinical adverse events was not increased by zzso In addition, zzso late zzso loss and target vessel zzso rate in the follow-up period were similar in the 2 zzso 

Bone zzso stem cell zzso with subcutaneous zzso is safe but did not lead to further improvement in zzso function after acute zzso zzso compared with the recovery observed in the zzso zzso
