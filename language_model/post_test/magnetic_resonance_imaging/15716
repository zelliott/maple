This study investigated zzso fingering phenomena in a saturated porous medium due solely to fluid density zzso The objective was to determine dissolved salt zzso in the porous medium and, thus, local fluid density with high zzso resolution and covering substantial zzso A magnetic resonance imaging method, which can achieve this goal by adding zzso to salt solutions, has been zzso This method was applied here to observe and zzso three-dimensional zzso fingering for the initial unstable layering of saltwater above zzso Additionally, characteristic properties were defined and evaluated to facilitate a more meaningful comparison with zzso zzso
