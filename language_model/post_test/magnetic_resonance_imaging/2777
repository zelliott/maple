A zzso cardiac phased array receiver zzso was constructed that comprised a zzso array and a separate zzso zzso Both zzso had two zzso zzso with the same zzso zzso Data acquisition with the zzso array placed on the human chest, and the zzso array placed under the back, yielded an overall enhancement of the zzso ratio zzso over the entire heart by a factor of zzso over a commercially available flexible zzso and a commercially available zzso zzso phased array zzso This improvement in zzso can be exploited in cardiac imaging to increase the spatial resolution and reduce the image acquisition zzso
