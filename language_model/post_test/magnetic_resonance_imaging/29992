In patients with zzso sclerosis complex zzso associations between zzso number, infantile spasms, and cognitive impairment have been zzso We hypothesized that the zzso proportion zzso the proportion of the total brain volume occupied by zzso would be a better zzso of zzso and cognitive function than the number of zzso We investigated zzso load, seizures, and cognitive function and their zzso 

zzso number and zzso were characterized on three-dimensional zzso inversion recovery zzso with an automated zzso zzso zzso zzso histories and zzso recordings were zzso Intelligence zzso were determined and an individual zzso index (a marker of zzso that incorporated multiple cognitive zzso was zzso 

In our sample of 61 patients with zzso zzso was zzso related to the age at seizure onset and to the intelligence equivalent and tended to be zzso related to the zzso zzso Further, a younger age at seizure onset or a history of infantile spasms was related to lower intelligence and lower zzso zzso In a multivariable analysis, only age at seizure onset and zzso index were zzso 

Our systematic analysis confirms proposed relationships between zzso load, zzso and cognitive function in zzso sclerosis complex zzso but also indicates that zzso proportion is a better predictor of cognitive function than zzso number and that age at seizure onset is the only independent zzso of cognitive zzso zzso control should be the principal zzso in patients with zzso
