To assess zzso gated zzso zzso and double zzso fast zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the depiction of zzso fat in zzso heart specimens and patients with zzso right zzso zzso zzso 

A phantom was used to determine the effective zzso spatial resolution of zzso and fast zzso MR imaging zzso Two zzso with proved zzso were zzso with identical sequences with zzso selected fat zzso zzso ratios zzso of zzso fat in the right zzso zzso were compared by using analysis of zzso and Student zzso test with zzso zzso Eleven patients with zzso and 10 control subjects underwent fast zzso MR zzso Two blinded readers zzso evaluated images for fat zzso and image zzso 

Fast zzso MR imaging achieved better spatial resolution but lower zzso than that of gated zzso zzso zzso in zzso specimens were higher for double zzso than for single zzso fast zzso sequences for all section thicknesses zzso zzso Absolute zzso values were higher for zzso fast zzso sequences than for those without fat zzso zzso specimens demonstrated fatty zzso from zzso toward zzso of the RV free zzso zzso fat was detected in eight of 11 zzso patients with zzso and in no control subjects zzso zzso 

zzso fat detection in zzso was better with fast zzso MR imaging alone and combined with fat suppression than was gated zzso MR zzso When fast zzso imaging is applied in zzso however, zzso constraints limit the spatial resolution for RV fat zzso
