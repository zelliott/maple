Despite gross total zzso aggressive zzso based tumors invading major zzso zzso have high recurrence rates with poor long-term zzso Options for aggressive surgical management of zzso zzso invasion may be limited by the inherently high risk of morbidity and zzso 

Between July 1996 and July 2002, 5 cases of zzso aggressive zzso based tumors were operated zzso Gross total zzso had been previously performed in 4 cases, and near total zzso in 1 zzso zzso pathology included 2 zzso zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso zzso and 1 benign zzso with zzso zzso All tumors recurred within 3 to 47 months and zzso a major zzso zzso (four superior zzso and one dominant right zzso zzso Gross total zzso of tumor and involved zzso zzso was accomplished in each zzso 

Three patients had no signs of clinical or zzso recurrence at 10, 18, and 53 months of follow zzso One patient who developed a fatal pulmonary embolism 10 months zzso had evidence of tumor progression on zzso One patient had tumor recurrence at 10 months, but is alive at 38 months and receiving zzso zzso 

For aggressive zzso based tumors that recur with invasion of a major zzso zzso radical zzso of tumor and zzso zzso can be performed safely and may improve long-term zzso
