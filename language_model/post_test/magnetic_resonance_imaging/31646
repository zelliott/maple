zzso zzso in zzso structures such as the zzso zzso zzso has been reported in zzso but not consistently zzso We investigated the prevalence and zzso length of the zzso in 62 schizophrenia patients (32 zzso 30 zzso and 63 healthy controls (35 zzso 28 zzso using magnetic resonance zzso We also explored the relation between the zzso and zzso zzso for the third zzso zzso zzso structures zzso zzso and zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and frontal lobe regions zzso area and anterior zzso zzso The zzso was absent in zzso zzso of the schizophrenia patients and in zzso zzso of the controls, showing a significant group zzso For the length of the zzso schizophrenia patients had a shorter zzso than controls, and males had a shorter zzso than zzso The subjects without an zzso had a significantly larger third zzso and smaller zzso zzso than the subjects with an zzso for both zzso We found a significant zzso interaction for the zzso The schizophrenia patients without an zzso had a smaller bilateral zzso than those with an zzso whereas the zzso was not associated with the volume of the zzso in the control zzso These findings suggest that the absence of zzso in schizophrenia could be a marker of zzso abnormalities in the neural network including the zzso and connected zzso regions, which may play an important role in the zzso of zzso
