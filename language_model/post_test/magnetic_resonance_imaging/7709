zzso presents a significant problem for patients recovering from stimulant zzso Here we examined the hypothesis that patterns of brain function obtained at an early stage of zzso zzso patients who later zzso versus those who remain zzso zzso recently zzso zzso patients were tested using a zzso zzso functional zzso zzso design that was developed in order to replicate a previous zzso study of zzso using a selective attention task, and were then monitored until 6 months of verified zzso or stimulant use zzso zzso revealed smaller absolute blood oxygen zzso zzso response zzso in bilateral zzso zzso zzso and right insular zzso in 23 patients positive for zzso to stimulant use compared with 22 who remained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso personal and family history of drug use were compared in order to form zzso zzso zzso was found to predict zzso with higher accuracy than any other single measure obtained in this zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso in right zzso zzso and insular zzso predicted zzso with zzso zzso which increased to zzso accuracy when history of mania was zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso provided the highest accuracy of zzso These results, combined with previous studies, suggest that the functional organization of zzso brain regions including zzso anterior and zzso zzso and right zzso are related to patients' ability to maintain zzso Novel therapies designed to target these zzso regions identified using zzso may improve treatment zzso
