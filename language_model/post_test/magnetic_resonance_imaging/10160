To evaluate the association between zzso or zzso zzso and the presence of zzso zzso bands zzso or the zzso index in Japanese patients with multiple sclerosis zzso 

Brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso was studied in 34 Japanese clinically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso zzso imaging was added to the routine zzso zzso 

Among the 34 patients, 20 zzso were zzso zzso Among the 20 patients with zzso zzso 17 zzso had zzso zzso although only two zzso of 14 zzso zzso patients had zzso zzso The zzso zzso area was significantly larger in the zzso patients compared with the zzso zzso 

The present study clearly demonstrated a strong association between the zzso zzso and zzso in Japanese zzso Certain zzso immune mechanisms may contribute to the development of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso may be an important factor to understand the zzso of zzso zzso
