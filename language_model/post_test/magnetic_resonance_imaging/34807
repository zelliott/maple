zzso evidence for coronary zzso significance can be obtained with zzso stress zzso Since zzso zzso have already undergone zzso zzso to maintain flow, the response to zzso stimulation is zzso The degree of response limitation is reflected by the coronary flow reserve zzso Absolute volume flow rates can be accurately and zzso measured with zzso zzso The purpose was to assess the ability to measure coronary volume flow rate zzso and characterize the effect of zzso stress on coronary flow zzso by using zzso zzso segmented zzso zzso imaging zzso Ten healthy volunteers were examined by using zzso zzso zzso zzso volume flow rates were measured in the anterior descending coronary artery zzso at rest and following intravenous administration of zzso zzso was determined based on these zzso Mean zzso volume flow rates increased from 38 zzso 11 zzso before application of zzso to 169 zzso 42 zzso The mean zzso amounted to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of zzso zzso to zzso zzso coronary volume flow rates over the cardiac zzso zzso induced changes in volume flow rate and thus zzso can be zzso
