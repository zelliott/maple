To zzso investigate the associations of baseline serum zzso zzso zzso status on evolution of clinical and zzso measures in a multiple sclerosis zzso patient cohort treated with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso and 21 zzso zzso matched for age, sex, disease zzso zzso zzso zzso and time on zzso treatment, were zzso All patients were on intramuscular zzso zzso for at least 3 years and remained on the same treatment over the zzso duration of the zzso 

The zzso group accumulated significantly higher zzso over the zzso follow-up than the zzso group zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso group was lower compared to the zzso zzso At zzso zzso the zzso group had increased tissue damage as measured by diffusion zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso and whole brain volume loss zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso There were more clinical relapses in the zzso zzso group compared to zzso patients (18 versus 10) and a higher frequency of sustained disability progression zzso or zzso versus zzso or zzso 

This study suggests that zzso zzso patients treated with zzso develop more severe zzso and clinical zzso Future studies are required to evaluate the role of zzso as potential zzso for disease prognosis versus zzso for therapeutic response to zzso zzso
