This study describes the prevalence of zzso changes at magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso and zzso ligaments in zzso disorders zzso grades 1-2 in relation to age, zzso spinal zzso type of trauma event and time since zzso 

In zzso consecutive zzso patients zzso women, zzso zzso mean age 42 zzso referred from zzso zzso changes in the zzso and zzso ligaments at high-resolution zzso zzso were zzso graded 0-3 based on a previously reported, reliable grading zzso Type of event according to The International zzso zzso of Diseases and Related Health zzso and time of trauma were obtained from referral zzso 

zzso showed grades 2-3 zzso ligament changes in 449 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and grades 2-3 zzso ligament changes in 311 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 2-3 changes were more common in men than women, odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso ligament zzso zzso changes were not related to age, spinal zzso type of trauma event or time since trauma zzso 5 zzso zzso changes were more often zzso than zzso 

zzso changes of the zzso and zzso ligaments are common in zzso and unlikely to represent zzso zzso Their male and zzso preponderance cannot be explained by variation in ligament stretching or image zzso Further studies are needed to clarify whether such changes are caused by zzso
