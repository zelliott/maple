We aimed to assess zzso and zzso zzso in patients after zzso of zzso zzso repair by two-dimensional zzso zzso tracking and to identify factors associated with zzso 

zzso patients after zzso repair with a mean age of zzso years and 42 zzso healthy controls were zzso zzso zzso deformation zzso and zzso intervals were assessed by zzso zzso tracking and tissue zzso imaging zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as delay above 3 standard zzso of mean values in the control zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was performed for evaluation of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso 22 patients zzso showed zzso zzso and 16 zzso had zzso zzso The zzso delay correlated significantly with right zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso RV zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso duration zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso RV zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and RV zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as RV ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso delay correlated significantly with RV strain zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso duration zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso RV zzso volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and RV zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis, reduced RV strain and prolonged zzso duration remained the main zzso factors predicting zzso Moreover, zzso zzso tracking and TDI showed a significant correlation in the assessment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso delay zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in patients after zzso repair by zzso zzso zzso zzso RV zzso deformation and zzso zzso are the main factors associated with the observed zzso
