In this study, a zzso progressive bilateral high frequency hearing loss is described in a family with 141 identified zzso Recent genetic analyses indicated a zzso inheritance with linkage to the gene zzso zzso and zzso The affected family members who shared zzso at both zzso zzso I) showed an early zzso onset and a more rapid rate of progress compared with those with one either of the two disease associated zzso zzso zzso The zzso pattern was cochlear without a zzso zzso zzso zzso response zzso and magnetic resonance imaging indicated normal zzso zzso The zzso emissions were affected for both type I and type II, whereas the acoustic zzso zzso thresholds were normal in most zzso It is concluded that both types had an outer hair zzso zzso but that the zzso 2 type might have an additional dysfunction at the level of the inner hair zzso It is zzso pointed out that the application of refined zzso techniques as well as a further development of new techniques is needed in order to characterize the zzso of the rapidly expanding number of genetically defined inner ear zzso
