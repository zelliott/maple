To evaluate the diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and define its role, focal zzso zzso of the zzso surface of the zzso joint were zzso zzso defects were well detected zzso zzso with conventional zzso initially administered for observation reference of ligaments and zzso zzso zzso which included zzso planes to the zzso surface and zzso transfer contrast zzso zzso delineated the size of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the difference between zzso zzso defects zzso in zzso A zzso of 30 degrees to the zzso zzso was the average plane angle that afforded optimal zzso of the zzso zzso Our findings advocate that routine zzso are sufficient in detecting severe zzso zzso that require further examination, and the zzso images are highly useful in zzso the recently developed therapeutic approaches and follow-up studies for zzso cartilage zzso
