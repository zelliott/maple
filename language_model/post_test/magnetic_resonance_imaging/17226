The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance zzso zzso in the diagnosis of late zzso complications after zzso liver transplantation zzso and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of this imaging zzso 

Seventy-one zzso were performed in 46 zzso patients with suspected zzso complication after zzso zzso We used a zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The images and maximum intensity projections were evaluated by two zzso zzso confirmation was obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), zzso retrograde zzso zzso zzso zzso 24), surgery zzso zzso zzso and clinical and ultrasound follow-up zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso studies were considered diagnostic by the two zzso in 69 cases zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a positive zzso value of zzso a negative zzso value of zzso and a global diagnostic accuracy of zzso to detect late zzso complications in zzso zzso The zzso agreement was excellent zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a reliable technique to detect and exclude late zzso complications after zzso
