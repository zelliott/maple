Field zzso in zzso zzso Imaging zzso can cause blur or image distortion as they produce zzso frequency at each zzso These effects can be corrected if an accurate field map is zzso Field maps can be estimated starting from the phase of multiple complex zzso data zzso In this paper we present a technique based on statistical zzso in order to reconstruct a field map exploiting two or more zzso The proposed approach zzso a zzso zzso in conjunction with the zzso Cuts zzso zzso The effectiveness of the method has been proven on simulated and real zzso
