The motivation of this study is to evaluate the possible zzso of regional resting state brain activity induced by the acute zzso electromagnetic field zzso exposure zzso of Long Term Evolution zzso zzso 

We designed a zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure zzso zzso subjects participated in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiment including two sessions zzso and sham zzso The radiation source was close to the right zzso Then the resting state zzso signals of human brain were collected before and after the exposure in both zzso We measured the zzso of low frequency fluctuation zzso and fractional zzso zzso to characterize the spontaneous brain zzso 

We found the decreased zzso value around in left superior zzso zzso left middle zzso zzso right superior zzso zzso right zzso frontal zzso and right zzso zzso after the real zzso And the decreased zzso value was also detected in right zzso frontal zzso and right zzso zzso 

The study provided the zzso that zzso zzso zzso exposure modulated the spontaneous low frequency fluctuations in some brain zzso 

With resting state zzso we found the zzso of spontaneous low frequency fluctuations induced by the acute zzso zzso zzso
