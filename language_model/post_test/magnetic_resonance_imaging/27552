In a retrospective study, 34 zzso zzso were investigated on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were affected by zzso and 17 showed no clinical signs of zzso zzso maturation and vascular zzso as well as the extent of the zzso findings and allocation of zzso tissue to each zzso were zzso zzso findings were reported for origin, size, zzso and zzso zzso and were correlated with the presence of zzso 

All zzso affected by zzso showed abnormal maturation on MR scans, but only zzso of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ significantly between the zzso and zzso zzso
