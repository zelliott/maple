To zzso determine in zzso the effects of zzso and zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression gene on zzso and zzso by using cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso imaging for evaluation of zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso 

The investigation zzso to zzso National Institutes of Health zzso Twelve pigs with zzso zzso were studied with cardiovascular MR 3 days and 8 weeks after zzso In six zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was injected at eight sites 1 hour after zzso Six pigs served as zzso zzso MR zzso of zzso area at risk, zzso size, and zzso function were used in evaluation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso B4 zzso were used to assess regional vascular zzso zzso Student zzso test was used to determine significant differences between zzso 

zzso had no effect on cardiovascular MR zzso or zzso size zzso 3 days after zzso At 8 weeks, the therapy increased zzso zzso zzso and vascular density and prevented deterioration of ejection fraction in treated zzso These changes were associated with a significantly greater reduction in extent of enhanced region in treated zzso of zzso surface area zzso zzso zzso error of zzso to zzso zzso zzso than in control animals zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso findings in treated animals showed increased zzso and zzso density in zzso and zzso zzso These new vessels were active and zzso compared with zzso vessels of control zzso 

zzso improves cardiovascular MR measurement of regional zzso zzso and zzso zzso
