zzso zzso zzso is an inherited zzso error of metabolism associated with early zzso death and long-term zzso zzso in zzso zzso diagnosis currently relies on isolation of fetal cells for subsequent genetic and/or zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso have been used on occasion for both zzso diagnosis and management of zzso zzso zzso We illustrate a case in which these zzso zzso also prove useful for prenatal diagnosis of this zzso 

A 31-year-old zzso with a history of two prior infants affected with zzso zzso zzso presented with a spontaneous zzso zzso twin zzso zzso resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso were performed on both zzso zzso resonance imaging of the presenting zzso fetus demonstrated mild zzso increased zzso fluid, and decreased cortical zzso and zzso The zzso zzso fetus was structurally zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso were obtained for both zzso and were zzso The diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso was made in the presenting fetus after delivery on the basis of subsequent mortality from severe zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging of the fetal brain can be used for prenatal diagnosis in fetuses at risk for zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso although technically zzso does not appear to have a role in the prenatal diagnosis of this zzso
