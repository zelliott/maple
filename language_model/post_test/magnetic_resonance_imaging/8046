zzso stroke is a frequent and serious disease with limited treatment zzso zzso can adhere to hypoxic cerebral zzso cells by binding of their zzso zzso zzso zzso to von zzso zzso Exposure of zzso zzso proteins further zzso firm attachment of zzso to the vessel wall by binding of collagen to their zzso zzso In the present study, we addressed the zzso role of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in experimental stroke in zzso 

Complete blockade of zzso alpha was achieved by intravenous injection of 100 zzso zzso fragments of the zzso zzso zzso to mice undergoing 1 hour of transient middle cerebral artery zzso At 24 hours after transient middle cerebral artery zzso cerebral zzso volumes were assessed by zzso zzso zzso In mice treated with zzso alpha zzso 1 hour before middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso were reduced to approximately zzso compared with controls zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso Application of zzso alpha zzso 1 hour after middle cerebral artery zzso likewise reduced brain zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso and improved the neurological zzso Similarly, depletion of zzso significantly diminished the zzso volume but to a lesser extent zzso zzso zzso zzso the disruption of early steps of zzso zzso was not accompanied by an increase in bleeding complications as revealed by serial magnetic resonance zzso In contrast, blockade of the final common zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso fragments had no positive effect on stroke size and functional outcome but increased the zzso of zzso zzso and mortality after transient middle cerebral artery zzso in a zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that the selective blockade of key signaling pathways of zzso zzso and zzso has a different impact on stroke outcome and bleeding zzso zzso of early steps of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso may offer a novel and safe treatment strategy in acute zzso
