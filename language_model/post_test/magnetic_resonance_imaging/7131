This article is a tutorial on the methods used to create three-dimensional zzso images for use in displaying patient zzso This new view into anatomy has developed over the last 10 years from the need of zzso radiation therapists, and zzso to integrate the many images resulting from the recent growth in zzso imaging including zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso CT and zzso studies result in 30 to 100 zzso 3-D imaging processes and zzso this image data volume and extracts more zzso zzso images via zzso reconstruction zzso shaded surface processing, or zzso zzso zzso zzso the image volume to produce novel views of patient anatomy while retaining the image zzso zzso zzso shaded surface display of 3-D objects can involve extensive processing of the images to create computer representations of objects rendered into a zzso 3-D zzso zzso imaging combines the zzso processing of zzso with the techniques of tissue zzso and surface zzso to produce novel projections of the image data volume that allow automated creation of 3-D scenes without recourse to the complexities of object zzso As the ultimate 3-D display, recent advances in zzso design zzso and zzso manufacturing zzso allow the fabrication of physical models of anatomy using computer-controlled milling zzso New technology that actually builds the model layer by layer from a liquid plastic offers the possibility of complete models with intact internal zzso The growth in 3-D is certain as hardware and software costs decrease and medical professionals find further applications for this zzso
