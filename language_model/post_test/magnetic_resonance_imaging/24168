As in adult imaging, zzso can be applied to pediatric brain imaging, and this requires an appreciation of the normal pediatric brain appearance by zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to describe the MR appearance of the brain in normal infants and young children as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso MR zzso 

We zzso examined MR brain studies, interpreted as normal by pediatric zzso from 29 patients zzso 1 to 42 zzso to catalog the appearance of zzso in multiple brain zzso 

On zzso images, white matter progressed from zzso to zzso relative to adjacent gray matter over the first 2 years of zzso An zzso although slightly delayed sequence was observed on zzso images with the exception of the deep cerebral zzso white matter, which followed a zzso sequence of zzso On zzso images, the deep cerebral white matter was zzso zzso relative to gray matter in the young infant, became zzso early in the first few months of life, and then reverted to zzso during the second year of zzso 

The normal appearance and development of brain white matter must be taken into account when interpreting zzso images of infants and young zzso
