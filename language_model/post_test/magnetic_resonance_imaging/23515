To examine the associations between modern imaging zzso and joint damage measured as zzso zzso zzso zzso in early zzso arthritis zzso zzso 

84 zzso patients with disease duration of less than 1 year were included in this inception zzso Patients were evaluated at zzso 3, 6 and 12 months by core measures of disease activity, zzso and ultrasound zzso zzso of zzso conventional zzso and digital zzso zzso zzso bone mineral density zzso of cortical hand zzso 

53 of the 79 patients zzso who completed the follow-up had zzso zzso progression zzso zzso zzso and zzso bone zzso zzso zzso were in zzso analyses independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a trend towards higher zzso zzso score and zzso zzso zzso loss in patients developing zzso zzso On an individual level, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also somewhat better predicted outcome than zzso factor, zzso protein zzso and disease activity score zzso 

zzso inflammation and zzso zzso were independent zzso of zzso zzso progression in early zzso patients on a group zzso The exact prognosis of the individual patients could not be determined by imaging zzso
