To introduce a new method for zzso zzso zzso without fusion to zzso zzso cervical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso column graft containing portions of the zzso discs is cut with a zzso saw from the zzso part of the vertebra via a thin lateral gutter placed in zzso A sufficiently wide zzso operative field is provided for zzso of the ossified ligament with this method, and only a narrow zzso zzso remains after simple replacement of the zzso zzso zzso patients are allowed to walk, usually within 2 to 3 days, wearing simple cervical zzso 

Twelve patients underwent zzso of the ossified ligaments in two to five zzso zzso Clinical results were satisfactory except in one patient, who died as a result of a pulmonary embolism that occurred 10 days after zzso In all of the other patients, the zzso column zzso were fused within a few months, and there were no zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso revealed that cervical alignment was zzso with zzso mobility at the operated segment in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso method provided a sufficiently wide operative field for satisfactory zzso of zzso cervical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso simplifying graft replacement and zzso patient zzso The cervical alignment was zzso
