The search for an Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso is one of the most relevant contemporary research topics due to the high prevalence and social costs of the zzso zzso connectivity zzso of the default mode network zzso is a plausible candidate for such a zzso We evaluated 22 patients with mild zzso and 26 zzso and zzso healthy zzso All subjects underwent resting functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in a zzso T zzso To identify the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso We also measured the zzso of the method, and verified a correlation with cognitive zzso We found a significant difference between patients with mild zzso and controls in average zzso zzso whole cortical positive zzso and absolute zzso zzso individual values showed a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso zzso and zzso values were correlated to global zzso and episodic memory zzso We showed that individual measures of zzso connectivity could be considered a promising method to differentiate zzso even at an early phase, from normal zzso Further studies with larger numbers of participants, as well as validation of normal values, are needed for more definitive zzso
