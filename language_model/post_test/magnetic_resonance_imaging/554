We document serial magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso findings in the process of improvement from delayed radiation necrosis of the spinal zzso A zzso woman underwent zzso for an oral zzso zzso months later she developed a zzso zzso syndrome, suggesting incomplete cervical zzso zzso below the zzso zzso Two months after starting steroid therapy, she had gradual clinical improvement, which continues 8 years after the termination of zzso Neurological improvement was associated with gradual resolution of an extensive high-intensity area within the zzso spinal zzso on zzso Initially, the zzso showed linear and uniform increase in zzso zzso throughout the cervical spinal zzso with standardized zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but it returned to normal value zzso zzso zzso at final zzso Considering that the zzso of zzso zzso correlated with neurological recovery, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso noted in the initial course of zzso could reflect the zzso activity of the compromised spinal zzso
