Current theories of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia emphasize an impairment in the ability of individuals suffering from this disorder to monitor their own performance, and adjust their behavior to changing zzso zzso an error in performance is a critical component of zzso functions that allow the flexible adjustment of behavior to zzso zzso The zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso has been repeatedly implicated in zzso and zzso of zzso behavioral zzso However, accurate zzso and subsequent behavioral adjustments are unlikely to rely on a single brain zzso Recent research demonstrates that regions in the anterior zzso inferior zzso zzso anterior prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and zzso also show robust zzso activity, and integrate into a functional zzso Despite the relevance of examining brain activity related to the processing of error information and supporting behavioral adjustments in terms of a distributed network, the contribution of regions outside the zzso to error processing remains poorly zzso To address this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine zzso responses in 37 individuals with schizophrenia and 32 healthy controls in regions identified in the basic science literature as being involved in error processing, and determined whether their activity was related to behavioral zzso Our imaging results support previous findings showing that regions outside the zzso are sensitive to error commission, and demonstrated that abnormalities in brain responses to errors among individuals with schizophrenia extend beyond the zzso to almost all of the regions involved in zzso processing in zzso However, error related responses in the zzso were most zzso of behavioral adjustments in both zzso Moreover, the integration of this network of regions differed between groups, with the zzso regions and the zzso less connected to the network in individuals with schizophrenia compared to zzso Our findings demonstrate a blunted response to error commission in the zzso that is associated with reduced zzso behavioral adjustments in individuals with zzso This result supports the hypothesis that a failure to respond appropriately to errors in individuals with schizophrenia is linked to zzso in zzso function leading to a compromise in the zzso of cognitive zzso Our findings highlight the importance of examining brain activity related to the processing of error information and supporting zzso behavioral adjustments in terms of a distributed zzso
