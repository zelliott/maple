In zzso imaging of zzso and zzso of transplanted zzso is critical for further clinical development, with zzso MR imaging of zzso iron zzso cells being the current premier zzso Using zzso zzso we present here a strategy for zzso imaging of cells using other zzso To this end, human zzso zzso were labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso as control and tested in zzso for cell viability and zzso zzso for 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso imaging was performed on labeled cell zzso and on cells following transplantation beneath the kidney capsule of mice and zzso zzso and zzso did not reduce human zzso viability or zzso responsiveness as compared with zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were effectively fluorinated for zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso reflective for detection by US imaging and became sufficiently zzso to become zzso allowing zzso with zzso Thus, zzso zzso are zzso cellular contrast agents that may find applications in real-time targeted delivery and imaging of transplanted human zzso or other cells in a clinically zzso manner using zzso US or CT zzso
