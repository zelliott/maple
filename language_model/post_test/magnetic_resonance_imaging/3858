zzso zzso zzso in the form of zzso premature zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso can cause zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of late zzso enhancement zzso in patients with zzso caused by idiopathic zzso zzso 

The study population consisted of zzso consecutive patients zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso with frequent zzso and/or zzso zzso was defined as left zzso ejection fraction zzso of zzso in the absence of any zzso underlying heart disease and improvement of zzso after effective treatment of index zzso zzso 

zzso zzso patients found to have zzso and diagnosed as zzso zzso Improvement in zzso after effective treatment of index zzso zzso was observed in 22 of 27 patients zzso zzso mean zzso burden of zzso zzso did not improve in five of 27 patients zzso zzso zzso mean zzso burden of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging was performed in 19 of 22 patients with zzso and one patient zzso had zzso All five patients with primary zzso underwent zzso imaging and four patients zzso had zzso 

zzso is a rare finding in patients with zzso caused by idiopathic zzso zzso zzso can be used in the diagnostic zzso of patients with zzso Further prospective studies are required to determine the role of zzso in predicting the recovery of left zzso zzso dysfunction in patients with zzso zzso
