A series of gross brain linear zzso and zzso surface areas were obtained in a sample of 69 zzso adult human zzso Data indicate that a subset of these zzso are sexually zzso and can be used to discriminate between male and female zzso zzso further suggest that studies on gender differences in zzso can be greatly enhanced if they account for sample zzso in brain zzso Using 19 of the gross brain measures delineated in this study, it is possible to accurately predict brain zzso It is believed that the measures obtained in this study will facilitate expanded zzso studies of brain zzso and zzso profiles using either zzso material or in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso
