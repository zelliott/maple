zzso therapy zzso is a valuable treatment option in severely depressed elderly zzso zzso abnormalities in the brain, such as white matter zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso or global cortical zzso may influence therapeutic zzso The respective value of these factors in response prediction is zzso 

In a zzso clinical cohort of 81 elderly patients diagnosed with zzso major depressive disorder, magnetic resonance imaging zzso was recorded and rated before zzso zzso The study was conducted at the clinic for Geriatric zzso of the zzso University Medical zzso zzso zzso Amsterdam, The Netherlands, over a zzso period zzso zzso of depressive symptoms was measured by using the zzso Depression zzso zzso zzso Response to zzso was defined as a decrease of at least 50 percent on the zzso and zzso was defined as a score below 10 points on the zzso 

Patients with moderate or severe zzso had a lower mean percentage decrease in zzso scores after zzso zzso in those with zzso compared to zzso in those without zzso P zzso zzso Patients without zzso had a 3 times greater chance of zzso from their depression compared to patients with moderate or severe zzso zzso the hazard ratio for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso In contrast, no differences in change in zzso scores were found for white matter zzso or global cortical zzso 

zzso zzso lobe zzso white matter zzso or global cortical zzso to poor response to zzso in severely depressed elderly zzso These findings suggest that assessment of zzso in severely depressed elderly patients may be useful in the prediction of potential zzso zzso
