The frontal lobe has an extended maturation period and may be vulnerable to the long-term effects of zzso We tested this hypothesis by studying the relationship between duration of illness zzso zzso matter zzso and zzso fluid zzso volume across the whole zzso zzso patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy controls underwent structural zzso scanning and zzso zzso We performed zzso analyses in patients to examine the relationship between zzso and zzso and zzso volumes across the whole brain, and correlations in controls between age and zzso or zzso volume of the regions where zzso or zzso volumes were associated with zzso in zzso zzso were also performed between zzso volume in the regions associated with zzso and zzso zzso A longer zzso was associated with lower zzso volume in the left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso right middle frontal cortex, left zzso zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso Additionally, age was zzso associated with zzso volume in the left zzso zzso in patients, and in the left zzso and zzso excess near the left zzso in healthy zzso Greater zzso volume in the left zzso zzso was associated with better working memory, attention and zzso speed in zzso Our findings suggest that the right middle frontal zzso is particularly vulnerable to the long-term effect of schizophrenia illness whereas the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are affected by both a long zzso and zzso The effect of illness zzso on zzso volume in the left zzso zzso may be extended to brain zzso function zzso
