To present the ultrasound appearance of zzso coalitions zzso 

We present a retrospective review of 11 patients (8 women and 3 men, age range zzso mean age zzso in which zzso the first imaging study carried out, detected a zzso that was not known or suspected zzso Patients were subsequently examined by standard zzso zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In 9 patients with zzso coalition ultrasound showed a reduced joint space of the zzso aspect of the anterior zzso joint associated with an zzso pointed appearance of its zzso In 2 patients with zzso coalitions ultrasound revealed a smooth continuity of the zzso bone surface between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The diagnosis was confirmed in 4 patients with CT and in 3 with zzso In the remaining 4 patients standard zzso were consistent with zzso 

zzso to its zzso capabilities ultrasound can detect zzso We suggest that study of the anterior zzso joint should be a part of every ankle ultrasound examination as it can show a clinically zzso zzso Confirmation of the coalition by CT or zzso is required in the zzso assessment to better assess the type and extent of the zzso anomaly as well as the adjacent zzso
