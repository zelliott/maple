zzso sleep zzso zzso patients exhibit altered sympathetic zzso which may reveal mechanisms underlying the zzso We used functional zzso zzso in 16 control and 10 zzso subjects who were free of cardiovascular or zzso drugs to examine neural responses to a forehead cold zzso challenge, which elicits respiratory zzso zzso and enhanced sympathetic zzso The magnitude of zzso zzso was smaller, and respiratory slowing showed greater zzso zzso and reached a zzso later in zzso zzso Both groups showed similar signal changes to cold stimulation in multiple brain zzso However, signal increases emerged in zzso over controls in anterior and zzso zzso and zzso and frontal cortex, whereas signals markedly declined in the zzso thalamus, zzso and zzso rather than rising as in zzso zzso responses often paralleled changes in breathing and heart zzso zzso zzso areas and zzso and zzso zzso zzso also showed lower signals in zzso zzso Cold zzso zzso responses are modified in zzso and may result from both diminished and exaggerated responses in multiple brain zzso
