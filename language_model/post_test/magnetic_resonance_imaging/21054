The molecular zzso zzso is a key regulator of protein folding in the zzso zzso and it plays a pivotal role in cancer cell survival and zzso zzso of its function has therefore been an important strategy for zzso tumor cell growth in cancer zzso Previous efforts to achieve this goal have used peptides that bind to zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso Here, we describe a zzso that zzso prostate tumor cell death without the need of any zzso zzso This zzso is a sequence derived from the zzso zzso We have shown that this sequence interacts with and zzso the zzso activity of zzso Furthermore, we have demonstrated that it zzso the unfolded protein response in zzso stress resulting in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cancer cells zzso expressing this zzso showed reduced growth and increased zzso in in zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso acid zzso that destroyed binding of the zzso zzso to zzso or zzso of the expression of zzso compromised the zzso effect of this zzso This sequence therefore represents a candidate lead zzso for zzso zzso
