To develop a zzso computer model of the anterior zzso wall and its zzso validate that model, and then use it to determine the combinations of muscle and zzso tissue zzso that result in zzso formation, as observed on dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

A zzso zzso model of the anterior zzso wall and its supports were developed based on zzso geometry from a healthy zzso zzso It included simplified representations of the anterior zzso wall, zzso muscle, zzso and zzso ligaments, zzso zzso zzso pelvis and zzso zzso zzso attachments, and the zzso zzso This model was then imported into zzso and tissue properties were assigned from the zzso An zzso process was used to refine anatomical assumptions until convergence was obtained between model behavior under increases of abdominal pressure up to zzso zzso zzso and zzso observed on dynamic zzso 

zzso size was sensitive to abdominal pressure and impairment of zzso tissue and zzso zzso zzso formed in the presence of zzso in muscular and zzso zzso tissue support compared to either support element zzso zzso impairment resulted in a larger zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle impairment caused a larger zzso hiatus size, longer length of the zzso zzso exposed to a pressure zzso larger zzso zzso and resulted in a larger zzso zzso 

Development of a zzso requires a zzso muscle zzso an increase in abdominal pressure, and zzso and zzso support zzso
