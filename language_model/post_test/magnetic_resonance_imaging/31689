zzso magnetic resonance adaptation zzso also termed repetition zzso is a reduction in activity due to repeated image presentations which has been extensively studied in human visual zzso Here we tested whether zzso dynamics during sustained image presentations is determined by cortical region or by stimulus zzso Nine subjects were scanned while viewing a long sustained presentation of a single face or a house zzso zzso level was maintained throughout the presentation by a demanding contrast detection zzso Our results show a clear regional differentiation in adaptation dynamics within high-level visual zzso -- especially in the zzso zzso zzso regions showed an initial adaptation effect followed by a sustained level of activity for both face and house zzso In contrast, activity in zzso regions showed a faster initial decline for houses, which reached essentially to baseline for the zzso face zzso The zzso lateral zzso zzso region exhibited an adaptation profile similar to the zzso zzso zzso within each region, the rate of signal decline from the peak zzso was independent of the viewed category zzso or zzso and this was true for zzso and frontal regions as zzso Thus, our results demonstrate that the functional differentiation in zzso stream regions is evident not only in their functional selectivity but also in their adaptation zzso Our results suggest regional rather than stimulus specificity with regard to cortical zzso These results demonstrate that the adaptation effect can in fact be compatible with models zzso a tight correlation between activity levels and zzso zzso
