zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso enables zzso measurement of several relevant brain zzso and has provided evidence of a range of zzso abnormalities in zzso especially in zzso and zzso zzso While individuals at high familial risk for schizophrenia zzso exhibit some zzso findings observed in the disorder, zzso MRS findings and their clinical zzso are not well characterized in this zzso 

We compared 23 adolescent and young adult offspring of schizophrenia patients with 24 zzso and zzso healthy controls using zzso zzso We acquired zzso short TE zzso MRS zzso at zzso and obtained zzso zzso of zzso zzso combined zzso and zzso zzso and zzso compounds zzso for the left and right thalamus, anterior zzso zzso and zzso We also assessed the relationship between regional zzso levels, clinical measures and brain volume in a subset of 16 high-risk and 15 control zzso 

Compared to healthy controls, high-risk subjects showed reductions in zzso levels in all three regions zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso increases in zzso in the zzso and zzso and increases in zzso in the anterior zzso In HR, zzso zzso concentration was positively correlated and zzso zzso zzso correlated with measures of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly correlated with attenuated psychotic symptom zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated with executive zzso 

Our data suggest the occurrence of zzso zzso in young relatives of schizophrenia patients similar to those seen in patients with established zzso The observed correlations with cognitive deficits and zzso zzso suggest that these zzso measures may have value as zzso of risk for zzso
