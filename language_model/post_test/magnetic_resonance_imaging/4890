For zzso cerebral zzso the initial zzso rate is the most powerful zzso to predict aneurysm zzso and zzso However, the zzso rate is only estimated zzso in clinical zzso To minimize zzso bias, computer zzso zzso was successfully validated for zzso zzso To minimize the remaining inaccuracy of zzso zzso was applied to zzso zzso MR zzso 

Twelve experimental rabbit zzso were subjected to zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Linear parameters zzso zzso neck zzso parent vessel zzso were measured on zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso The zzso rate was measured by contrast zzso identification of the zzso zzso zzso volume in relation to the total aneurysm zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso parameters were statistically zzso 

There were no limiting metallic artifacts by using zzso MR zzso Linear parameters zzso were nearly identical on zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso neck zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso parent vessel zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso proving the high accuracy of zzso MR zzso zzso measured on zzso MR imaging was considerably lower zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and 2) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso These findings demonstrate unacceptable bias in the current clinical standard zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso is easily zzso Its accuracy is superior to that of the clinical standard zzso The difference between zzso and zzso approached statistical zzso zzso may add objectivity to the ability to zzso the risk of zzso in zzso cerebral zzso
