In zzso zzso relaxation times, zzso of water and zzso zzso of normal and zzso muscles were measured, using the zzso resolved zzso zzso zzso in a genetic avian model of zzso These zzso values were compared with those of the zzso zzso Although the water zzso values of muscles were elevated in both types of zzso the zzso muscles showed a greater increase zzso than the zzso muscles zzso The water zzso differentiation between the zzso and zzso muscles appeared to depend upon their bound water zzso that were calculated on the basis of the Fast zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso values of muscles were higher in the zzso line of chickens compared to their genetic zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso values of muscles of the zzso chickens and their controls were essentially zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso values may potentially complement the water zzso values in the differential diagnosis of muscle zzso
