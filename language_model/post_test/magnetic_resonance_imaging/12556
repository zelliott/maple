zzso zzso zzso of magnetic resonance zzso images is an important but challenging task in medical image zzso Especially for abdominal zzso or zzso such as liver and zzso MR imaging is a very difficult task due to the fact that MR images are affected by intensity zzso weak boundary, noise and the presence of similar objects close to each zzso 

In this study, a novel method for tissue or organ zzso in abdomen MR imaging is zzso this method combines kernel graph cuts zzso with shape zzso First, the region growing zzso and zzso operations are used to obtain the initial zzso Second, shape zzso are obtained by training the shape templates, which were collected from different human subjects with kernel principle component analysis zzso after the registration between all the shape templates and the initial zzso Finally, a new model is constructed by zzso the shape zzso into the kernel graph cuts energy zzso The entire process aims to obtain an accurate image zzso 

The proposed zzso method has been applied to abdominal zzso MR zzso The results showed that a satisfying zzso without boundary leakage and zzso incorrect can be obtained also in presence of similar zzso zzso experiments were conducted for comparing the proposed zzso with other three zzso zzso initial erosion zzso and zzso without shape zzso The comparison is based on two quantitative performance zzso the zzso zzso index zzso and the variation of information zzso The proposed method has the highest zzso value zzso zzso and zzso for liver, right kidney and left kidney zzso and the lowest zzso values zzso zzso and zzso for liver, right kidney and left kidney zzso 

The proposed method can overcome boundary zzso zzso it can segment liver and zzso in abdominal MR images without zzso errors due to the presence of similar zzso The shape zzso based on zzso was integrated into fully automatic graph cuts zzso zzso to make the zzso zzso become more robust and zzso Furthermore, if a shelter is placed onto the target boundary, the proposed method can still obtain satisfying zzso zzso
