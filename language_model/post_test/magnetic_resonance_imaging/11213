zzso zzso studies suggest decreased zzso volumes in currently depressed patients, with conflicting findings for the zzso We studied these zzso lobe structures and superior zzso zzso zzso in patients with current and zzso major zzso We scanned 31 zzso depressed patients (21 currently depressed, 10 zzso and 31 matched healthy controls with a zzso zzso sequence in a zzso zzso GE zzso Imaging zzso There was a trend towards smaller left zzso volumes in all depressed patients compared with healthy zzso We found significantly smaller zzso volumes zzso in currently depressed patients than in zzso zzso Furthermore, we found a statistically significant inverse correlation between length of illness and left zzso volumes and right superior zzso zzso zzso Our finding of smaller zzso in currently depressed patients is consistent with the hypothesis that zzso could result in zzso zzso in major zzso A smaller zzso size may be more characteristic of the depressive state and not be present in zzso zzso
