zzso volume, zzso volume, and zzso are each associated with zzso however, few studies have detected whether these 3 different types of MR imaging zzso exert independent or additive effects on cognitive zzso To detect their extent of contribution to cognitive performance, we explored the independent and additive contributions of zzso zzso white matter injury, and white matter integrity to zzso in elderly zzso 

Two hundred and 9 elderly patients participated in the zzso 97 were zzso adults, 65 had zzso and 47 had zzso We measured zzso on zzso MR imaging, zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso along with zzso matched measures of 4 zzso of cognitive performance, including semantic memory, episodic memory, executive function, and spatial zzso 

As expected, patients with zzso performed significantly more poorly in all 4 cognitive zzso whereas patients with zzso performed generally less poorly than zzso patients, though considerable overlap in performance was present across zzso zzso zzso and zzso each differed significantly between diagnostic groups and were associated with cognitive zzso In zzso models that included all 3 MR imaging measures zzso zzso and zzso zzso volume was the strongest zzso of cognitive zzso 

These results strongly suggest that MR imaging measures of zzso are more closely associated with cognitive function than zzso measures across a broad range of cognitive and functional zzso
