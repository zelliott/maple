zzso cerebral damage zzso includes white matter abnormalities and zzso zzso and represents a common zzso observation in subjects above 50 years of zzso The risk factors of such brain abnormalities are not fully zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether the genetic zzso of zzso E zzso contributes to the occurrence of zzso 

Brain zzso zzso zzso was performed in 280 individuals zzso 50 to 75 zzso without zzso disease randomly selected from the official register of residents of the city of zzso zzso All study participants underwent zzso zzso carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso and a complete blood chemistry zzso zzso was defined as evidence of early zzso and zzso white matter zzso or zzso zzso zzso was graded on a zzso scale ranging from not present zzso to complete zzso zzso 

zzso occurred in 61 individuals zzso The distribution of zzso zzso differed significantly between subjects with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with such findings more commonly had the zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso versus zzso at similar zzso of zzso containing the zzso 4 zzso The zzso zzso 3 zzso was associated with lower levels of total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso LDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and zzso B zzso zzso zzso Also, there was a zzso trend toward less cardiac zzso Other major vascular risk factors and carotid abnormalities were similar among the various zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis created a model of significant zzso zzso including age zzso ratio zzso zzso per year), hypertension zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest an association between the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso despite favorable effects on the zzso profile and cardiac zzso
