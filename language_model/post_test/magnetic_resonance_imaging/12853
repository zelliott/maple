An MR scan was performed on all patients who presented to our hospital with a clinical diagnosis of a fracture of the zzso zzso but who had no zzso on plain zzso This was a prospective study of 102 consecutive patients over a zzso zzso There were 98 patients who fulfilled our inclusion criteria, of whom 75 were scanned within 48 hours of admission, with an overall mean time between admission and scanning of zzso days zzso to zzso A total of 81 patients zzso had abnormalities detected on zzso 23 zzso required operative zzso The use of zzso led to the early diagnosis and treatment of zzso hip zzso We recommend that incomplete zzso fractures are managed zzso with protected zzso The study illustrates the high zzso of fractures which are not apparent on plain zzso and shows that zzso is useful when diagnosing other pathology such as zzso which may not be apparent on plain zzso
