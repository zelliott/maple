Sixteen patients with a variety of brain and spine tumors were examined with zzso spin echo and three-dimensional zzso fast zzso shot zzso zzso degree flip zzso techniques before and after administration of zzso zzso acid zzso to assess the utility of volume imaging in zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed on a zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and compared with the corresponding spin echo zzso Good zzso zzso examinations zzso zzso 9) were seen with a variety of echo times zzso zzso and repetition times zzso zzso Fair zzso zzso 4) and poor zzso zzso 3) examinations were usually associated with motion artifact, especially the zzso zzso Spin echo images were all considered of good zzso An increase in confidence of diagnosis was seen in nine cases following contrast medium administration, based on either enhancement of an zzso zzso zzso 7) or failure of enhancement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging combined with zzso holds promise to develop into a clinically valuable sequence allowing good patient zzso and ability to reconstruct in any plane and sensitivity to abnormalities of the zzso barrier or zzso However, some problems remain, including motion and zzso artifacts, long reconstruction time, and loss of resolution in reconstruction due to zzso zzso
