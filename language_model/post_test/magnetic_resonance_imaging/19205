The aim of this study was to examine age, zzso and zzso trends in zzso zzso body shape, zzso zzso spine magnetic resonance images involving an age range spanning the life zzso 

A zzso zzso retrospective study design involving a sample of zzso 

zzso zzso shape data are commonly derived from zzso zzso The zzso properties of magnetic resonance imaging and availability of digital data for image analysis suggest potential for zzso zzso zzso For the zzso spine, there is limited zzso shape data on zzso while few studies have examined the pattern of age-related changes across the life zzso 

zzso was performed on 220 mid zzso zzso MR images using image analysis zzso Three zzso of zzso shape were zzso the zzso height ratio or anterior wedge index, zzso height ratio or zzso index, and ratio of zzso zzso height to mid zzso diameter or zzso zzso 

Different zzso patterns were noted for the zzso shape zzso zzso lower mean values were noted in males for the zzso zzso Age trends were zzso with a linear age-related decline demonstrated for the anterior wedge and zzso zzso and a zzso trend noted for the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso body shape may be uniquely described using specific shape zzso for examining various zzso gender and zzso zzso 

These results suggest the importance of defining specific reference criteria for zzso zzso body shape zzso particularly age-related data encompassing a wide age zzso zzso resonance studies enable interpretation of zzso shape data in relation to the wide spectrum of zzso afflicting the zzso spine, without the concerns of zzso zzso
