To introduce the preliminary application of rapid zzso zzso for zzso joint zzso zzso 

This study included 11 consecutive patients (13 zzso seeking zzso zzso All patients had previously undergone zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso slice zzso of the zzso zzso The data from CT scanning in zzso (Digital Imaging and Communications in zzso format were input into the interactive zzso zzso software program zzso Medical, zzso zzso zzso planning included zzso and zzso The movements of the jaw bones were simulated by use of zzso zzso The affected zzso was reconstructed based on the zzso zzso Then, the titanium plate was shaped on the reconstructed model before zzso The bone graft was transplanted by the shaped titanium plate during the operation to reconstruct the zzso zzso patients who underwent traditional surgery were used as the control zzso The operative time of the 2 groups was analyzed with the zzso software package, version zzso zzso Chicago, zzso with the Student zzso zzso The data from CT scanning in the experimental group before and after surgery were compared by paired zzso zzso 

All the incisions healed primarily without any zzso All patients were satisfied with the operation, because of their zzso faces and good zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the position of the transplanted zzso cartilage in the zzso zzso A group zzso test showed that the operative time was longer in the control group zzso zzso zzso than that in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso Three parameters zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso CT scan were analyzed by paired zzso test, and there was no significant difference between the 2 zzso 

zzso technology provides an advanced method for zzso reconstruction that can make the zzso reconstruction more accurate and zzso improve the zzso function, and consequently, enhance the zzso zzso
