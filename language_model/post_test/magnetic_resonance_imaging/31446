The use of zzso as a zzso agent has been demonstrated using various models in which improvements in zzso size, DNA damage, and neurological function were zzso We further investigated zzso aspects of the zzso recovery by assessing the therapeutic efficacy of delayed chronic zzso treatment using functional zzso 

zzso functional zzso zzso in the zzso cortex, acquired 2 weeks after the 90-minute transient middle cerebral artery zzso were compared between zzso and zzso zzso Specifically, zzso signal changes based on blood zzso level dependence and functional cerebral blood volume responses were examined using electrical stimulation of zzso Additional zzso zzso were zzso 

The ratio of zzso to zzso blood zzso level dependence response zzso significantly improved with zzso zzso In contrast, the increase of the functional cerebral blood volume response magnitude ratio was not statistically zzso Nonetheless, the zzso treatment induced significant enhancements of total functional zzso zzso zzso as a product of zzso volume and response zzso for both blood zzso level dependence and functional cerebral blood volume zzso Increased cerebral blood volume in zzso zzso suggests a possible zzso vascular transformation in both zzso and zzso zzso however, other zzso vascular parameters zzso size index and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may imply that the zzso of zzso was differently affected by the zzso zzso 

The delayed chronic zzso treatment enhanced the blood zzso level dependence functional zzso response magnitude in the absence of neurological improvement and influenced vascular formation in zzso animal zzso
