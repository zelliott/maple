In this paper we discuss novel MR imaging blood pool agents characterized by new zzso zzso 

The zzso of the products were studied in a rabbit zzso The potential of these new products was demonstrated in experimental MR zzso 

Three main classes of blood pool agents have been defined and characterized according to their zzso zzso low diffusion agents, rapid clearance blood pool agents, slow clearance blood pool zzso Each kind of blood pool agent is expected to have different diagnostic zzso
