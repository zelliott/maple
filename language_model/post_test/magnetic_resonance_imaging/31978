To report the definitive diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso encephalitis in four Japanese women previously diagnosed with zzso acute zzso zzso of unclear zzso and to describe their long-term follow-up in the absence of tumor zzso 

We extensively reviewed the case histories with current clinical and laboratory evaluations that include testing for zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso available from the time of symptom onset (4 to 7 years zzso and the zzso 

All patients zzso developed zzso symptoms, zzso zzso severe zzso zzso and bizarre zzso zzso movements that lasted 1 to 12 zzso Two patients required mechanical ventilation for 6 and 9 zzso zzso tests were normal or zzso including the presence of zzso zzso zzso and normal or mild changes in brain zzso Eventually, all patients had dramatic recovery of cognitive functions, although one had bilateral leg zzso due to systemic zzso zzso to zzso zzso were found in zzso serum or zzso but not in long-term follow-up zzso An zzso zzso was subsequently demonstrated in three patients (all confirmed zzso 

1) These findings indicate that zzso acute zzso zzso or a subset of this disorder is zzso by an zzso immune response against zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 2) Our patients' clinical features emphasize that zzso encephalitis is severe but potentially zzso and may zzso by years the detection of an zzso zzso 3) Although recovery may occur without tumor zzso the severity and extended duration of symptoms support tumor zzso
