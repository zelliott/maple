The association between spinal zzso anomalies and zzso zzso is well zzso Until now, the zzso of zzso zzso has been assumed to be higher in patients with zzso zzso zzso However, recent reports suggest that zzso zzso is as common in patients with a low zzso as in those with a high zzso 

To review the zzso of spinal zzso anomalies in those with a low zzso and those with a high (including zzso zzso zzso zzso and to determine the best diagnostic imaging zzso 

A group of 50 consecutive patients with zzso zzso and in whom spinal zzso had been performed were identified zzso We reviewed and compared the following factors between those with a high zzso and those with a low zzso zzso clinical symptoms, zzso spinal zzso anomalies, and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of spinal zzso anomalies was no different between those with a high zzso and those with a low zzso and spinal zzso anomalies were present regardless of the presence of zzso anomalies or zzso 

zzso to the high zzso of spinal zzso anomalies in patients with zzso zzso zzso is the best imaging tool for detecting such anomalies regardless of the level of the zzso
