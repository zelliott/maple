This study examined the correlation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the assessment of zzso valve zzso zzso in children and young adults with zzso heart zzso We hypothesized that qualitative ECHO assessment zzso insufficiently with quantitative zzso data and compared zzso ECHO evaluations with objective measurement of zzso zzso zzso by zzso Patients who had both ECHO and zzso assessments of zzso within 60 days of each other were zzso The qualitative ECHO assessment zzso moderate, zzso of zzso and left zzso dimension at end zzso were zzso zzso was zzso by zzso using zzso zzso zzso Repeat ECHO review and grading of zzso was performed by a blinded single reader in a randomly chosen zzso of zzso In 43 patients zzso statistical significance was observed in the zzso between mild and moderate, and between mild and severe ECHO zzso There was significant overlap of objective zzso between zzso zzso zzso ECHO zzso corresponded to an zzso zzso of zzso moderate zzso and severe zzso zzso was more significant at moderate and severe zzso zzso were similar in the group in whom a single reader interpreted the ECHO zzso In conclusion, results derived from a real-life zzso ECHO laboratory showed inconsistencies in ECHO grading of zzso with a wide range of zzso measured zzso within a given ECHO zzso ECHO is less reliable in identifying more severe zzso often overestimating zzso zzso zzso is a potentially useful supplement to ECHO for management decisions and assessments of medical and surgical therapies in children and young adults with zzso
