A liquid crystal display was modified for use inside a 7 T MR zzso zzso zzso were performed using different imaging sequences with the monitor zzso present, or zzso zzso with a volunteer was conducted using a visual zzso 

zzso was reduced by zzso in echo zzso echo images when the monitor was on which can be explained by the limited shielding of the coated front window (40 zzso In the zzso experiments, activated regions in the visual zzso were clearly zzso The monitor provided excellent resolution at minor zzso reduction in zzso images, and is thus suitable for zzso at zzso zzso
