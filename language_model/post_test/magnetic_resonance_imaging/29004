We evaluated the relationship of corpus zzso zzso and/or zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso to functional zzso zzso following closed head injury zzso in 51 pediatric patients, including mild zzso moderate to severe zzso with zzso zzso and moderate to severe zzso with zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso transfer of information was assessed using zzso zzso zzso and visual tests in patients and in 16 zzso zzso Total and regional zzso areas were measured from the zzso zzso slice by zzso The corpus zzso zzso group demonstrated a greater right ear advantage on verbal zzso listening than all other zzso Areas of the zzso corpus zzso were zzso correlated with zzso zzso of verbal zzso listening performance and zzso identification of verbal zzso The relationship of corpus zzso zzso and/or zzso to asymmetry in zzso listening is consistent with previous investigation of zzso zzso zzso effects in zzso
