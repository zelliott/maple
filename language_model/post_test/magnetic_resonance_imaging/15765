There is currently much interest in investigating the neural zzso of metaphor zzso In particular, it has been suggested that the right zzso plays a special role in the comprehension of figurative zzso language, and in particular zzso However, some studies find no evidence of right zzso involvement in metaphor comprehension zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso literal word zzso zzso evidence against a selective role of the right zzso zzso 29, zzso Rapp, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of metaphor zzso zzso Brain Research, 20, zzso We suggest that zzso differences between literal and zzso language may be due to factors such as differences in familiarity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Right zzso metaphor zzso zzso the zzso of semantic zzso Brain and zzso 100, zzso or difficulty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso New approaches to understanding the cortical organization of semantic zzso Annual Review of zzso 25, zzso Rapp, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of metaphor zzso zzso Brain Research, 20, zzso in addition to zzso The purpose of this study was to separate the effects of zzso familiarity, and difficulty on the recruitment of neural systems involved in language, in particular right zzso zzso This was achieved by comparing neural zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso between four conditions: literal sentences, familiar and easy to understand metaphors, unfamiliar and easy to understand metaphors, and unfamiliar and difficult to understand zzso zzso recruited the right zzso left zzso pole and right inferior frontal zzso in comparison with literal zzso Familiar metaphors recruited the right middle frontal zzso when contrasted with unfamiliar zzso Easy metaphors showed higher zzso in the left middle frontal zzso as compared to difficult metaphors, while difficult metaphors showed selective zzso in the left inferior frontal zzso as compared to easy zzso We conclude that the right zzso is involved in metaphor processing and that the factors of zzso familiarity and difficulty are important in determining neural recruitment of semantic zzso
