To determine whether zzso relaxation times in magnetic resonance zzso imaging differ between patients with probable zzso disease and elderly control subjects with normal zzso 

MR imaging relaxation times were measured in the head and body of the right and left zzso in 123 zzso 62 patients with zzso disease (44 women, 18 zzso age range, zzso zzso and 61 elderly control subjects without cognitive impairment zzso women, 22 zzso age range, zzso zzso zzso relaxation times were correlated with clinical status zzso vs control zzso age, sex, zzso zzso vs zzso and location within the zzso zzso vs zzso The zzso zzso value was correlated with the severity of disease in the zzso 

No statistically significant difference in the relaxation times was found between the two clinical groups for the analysis of the right versus left zzso and the zzso head versus zzso In both patients and control subjects, no correlation was found between zzso zzso and age or zzso zzso patients had a clinical zzso rating zzso score of zzso zzso mild zzso 21 patients had a zzso score of zzso zzso zzso and eight patients had a zzso score of zzso zzso zzso The zzso score was not available in six zzso No statistically significant association between zzso values and severity of disease was zzso 

MR relaxation time zzso in the zzso are not useful for the detection of zzso zzso
