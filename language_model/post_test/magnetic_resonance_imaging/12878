In fighter pilots neck muscle strengthening exercises are often recommended to protect the neck against zzso The aim of the current study was to compare the relative zzso area zzso and zzso ratio of the cervical zzso of F-16 pilots experiencing neck pain and no neck pain zzso zzso In addition, correlations between these zzso zzso cervical range of motion zzso and neck muscle strength were zzso 

There were 35 male F-16 pilots who zzso of which 10 experienced bilateral neck zzso A standardized questionnaire was used to collect personal zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was assessed at the zzso level to determine zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the maximum zzso strength (David zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso was significantly larger in the neck pain group zzso zzso zzso right: zzso zzso on both the left and the right side, in comparison to the control population zzso zzso zzso right: zzso zzso In the pain group, the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso was significant larger on the left than on the right side zzso zzso zzso right: zzso zzso No differences in the zzso ratio between control pilots and pilots with neck pain could be zzso Between groups no differences were found in the zzso and the neck muscle zzso 

It is hypothesized that the larger zzso in the neck pain group compared to the control group might be caused by greater activity of the deep neck muscles in the neck pain zzso The zzso operation of the F-16 might cause the asymmetry within this zzso
