To analyze the zzso consequences of selective zzso zzso in patients with zzso sclerosis and to correlate the clinical outcome with the MR zzso 

zzso patients were examined with clinical and zzso examination and zzso MR after zzso (7 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso The clinical and zzso outcomes after zzso were compared with those of anterior zzso zzso 

There was no significant difference in seizure cure between zzso or zzso zzso and zzso However, patients with left zzso fared significantly better in terms of verbal zzso and zzso memory when compared with those with left zzso zzso memory and zzso were not significantly different in the two zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso and zzso remnants were found in both zzso groups and did not correlate with seizure zzso White matter change consistent with zzso probably secondary to zzso zzso was demonstrated in the anterior zzso lobe to a mean distance of zzso zzso after zzso zzso and to a lesser degree as a consequence of zzso zzso Nine patients zzso (4 zzso All, 5 zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso in the zzso zzso after zzso All had incomplete zzso zzso 

There is more secondary damage to the zzso lobe after zzso than was previously zzso The extent of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso do not seem to be directly related to seizure zzso Visual field defects are common in zzso because of the anterior but variable course of the zzso zzso
