It has been zzso that schizophrenia represents a disorder of anomalous cerebral zzso This study is a replication of earlier preliminary findings using a zzso zzso suggesting altered zzso in schizophrenia in male subjects, with an extension of the findings to female zzso 

We used zzso magnetic source imaging to estimate the zzso location of the zzso zzso zzso field component zzso in both left and right zzso of 20 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 20 controls without zzso zzso data were obtained by means of magnetic resonance imaging, from which we segmented and zzso volumes of both total brain and left and right superior zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso source were compatible with zzso generators located in the zzso zzso of zzso on the superior zzso zzso in both study zzso zzso sources were zzso in all the control zzso The male patient zzso exhibited significantly less asymmetry than the control group, while the female patient zzso actually showed significantly more zzso The male patient zzso generally had smaller superior zzso zzso than the control zzso No evidence of total brain volume differences was zzso 

Our findings support previous zzso studies suggesting anomalous cerebral zzso in zzso Further, in extending our studies to female patients, our data suggest that the nature of this anomaly is sex specific, a finding that, to our knowledge, has not previously been zzso
