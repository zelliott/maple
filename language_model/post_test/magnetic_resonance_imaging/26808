Patients with acute zzso zzso zzso may zzso and some may ultimately convert to multiple sclerosis zzso however, no criteria that can predict zzso conversion are available to zzso Our aim was to describe the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of patients with an initial zzso attack and evaluate which zzso criteria can predict conversion to zzso 

We zzso reviewed the records of 36 patients diagnosed with zzso We determined clinical zzso examined the zzso fluid zzso and performed brain zzso scans and compared the findings between patients who did and did not convert to zzso 

Clinical zzso and zzso analysis show no significant difference between the two zzso The rate of conversion to zzso from zzso in Taiwanese patients is low zzso after a mean follow-up period of zzso zzso zzso McDonald criteria were fulfilled in zzso zzso zzso zzso of those patients developed zzso according to zzso criteria zzso Of the other patients zzso who did not fulfill these criteria, none converted to zzso zzso rank zzso zzso 

It is difficult to predict from initial clinical presentations to address which patients with zzso will convert to zzso Patients with zzso whose brain zzso findings met the modified McDonald criteria may have clinically isolated syndrome because they have a significantly higher probability of conversion to zzso In contrast, patients whose brain zzso findings did not meeting these criteria may be considered as having classic zzso because they have a lower probability of conversion to zzso
