The purpose of this study was to describe the imaging findings after zzso zzso of adrenal zzso 

We zzso reviewed the imaging findings of all patients with adrenal tumors treated with zzso zzso in our department from January 2001 through August zzso The studies were reviewed in consensus by two attending abdominal imaging zzso and an abdominal imaging zzso Imaging findings before, immediately after, and at zzso and long-term follow-up after zzso were zzso 

Fourteen patients zzso men, seven zzso mean age, 56 zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso of adrenal zzso One case of small zzso and one case of small zzso were the only minor complications zzso rate, zzso The expected side effects of zzso zzso were found in zzso of zzso in two patients adjacent liver zzso was zzso in two patients the zzso zzso was injured, and in two patients local zzso occurred (in one patient, both adjacent liver and zzso zzso were zzso Immediate zzso findings after zzso zzso included air bubbles in 12 patients zzso and fat zzso around the adrenal zzso in 13 patients zzso A fat rim sign was found in zzso of patients at long-term zzso The zzso of the tumor immediately after the procedure increased an average of 7 zzso zzso 5 zzso range, zzso to 18 zzso and tended to decrease in long-term zzso At long-term zzso most zzso of the tumors had decreased in size and zzso 

Air bubbles and fat zzso are frequently seen immediately after zzso zzso of adrenal zzso A fat rim sign is a common finding at long-term zzso zzso of the zzso zone increases immediately after the procedure and decreases in long-term zzso The volume of the zzso zone has a variable size response, suggesting the need for baseline zzso
