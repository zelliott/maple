Single zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso have been recently associated with zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we tested the association between the zzso zzso on the zzso locus and sporadic brain zzso zzso zzso 

We studied 78 patients with sporadic zzso and 103 unaffected zzso zzso DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and the zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso length zzso using the zzso restriction zzso 

We found that the distribution of the three zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was significantly different between cases and controls zzso Using dominant, zzso and additive genetic models, we found that the zzso zzso and the T zzso were significantly more common in the zzso group than in zzso We also evaluated whether the zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso features of zzso (such as zzso size, zzso drainage pattern and zzso zzso and with the occurrence of zzso and zzso We detected a significant association between the zzso T zzso in the zzso model and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso in zzso Deep zzso drainage was significantly more frequent among subjects carrying at least one T zzso in the dominant zzso Patients with zzso showed a significant association with the zzso zzso and the T zzso in all genetic models examined whereas those who experienced zzso bleeding showed a significant association with the T zzso in the trend zzso 

This is the first study demonstrating an association between an zzso of the zzso region and sporadic zzso Our results zzso the relevance of this zzso locus as a common risk factor for various forms of cerebrovascular zzso
