The aim of the current study was to examine the effect of zzso burst repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso on the blood zzso zzso zzso zzso during repeated functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso burst zzso was applied over the right frontal eye field in seven healthy zzso zzso repeated zzso zzso were performed during a zzso task zzso zzso 5, 20, 35, and 60 zzso after zzso We found that zzso burst zzso induced a strong and long-lasting decrease of the zzso signal response of the zzso frontal eye field at 20 and 35 zzso Furthermore, less pronounced zzso of the zzso signal response with different dynamics were found for remote zzso areas such as the left frontal eye field, the zzso eye field, the supplementary eye field, and both zzso eye zzso Recovery of the zzso signal changes in the anterior remote areas started earlier than in the zzso remote zzso These results show that a) the major zzso impact of zzso burst zzso occurs directly in the zzso area itself, and that b) a lower effect on remote, zzso areas can be zzso
