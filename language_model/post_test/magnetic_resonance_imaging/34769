zzso zzso zzso with a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a rapid and quantitative method to detect zzso cell zzso This technique was used to examine the sensitivity of tumor cells to zzso agents, as a novel test of zzso in zzso 

The in zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells to a panel of zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was investigated by both zzso yielding DNA zzso and a zzso zzso test, measuring cellular zzso zzso achievable zzso of the agents were used for the analysis of DNA zzso and proliferation of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cells were treated with the agents, and tumor masses were visually monitored by using magnetic resonance imaging with zzso acid zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso agents examined by the zzso zzso test correlated with a decreased zzso peak in the DNA zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the decrease in the zzso peak was subsequently accompanied by increased zzso areas, suggesting DNA fragmentation induced by the zzso The in zzso zzso test and cell proliferation examination showed that all agents except zzso were zzso Growth zzso of zzso brain tumors and prolonged survival of zzso rats were observed with treatment with the zzso agents, except zzso 

The present study shows that zzso analysis with a zzso dye can detect DNA damage induced by zzso agents, and it suggests that this technique is a novel method to test zzso in zzso
