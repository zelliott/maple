To investigate the role of screening magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the detection of zzso zzso breast cancer in patients with newly diagnosed breast zzso 

Between January 1999 and July 2001, 182 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer (after either core or zzso biopsy with positive or close margins of zzso underwent bilateral contrast zzso MR imaging at zzso T with a dedicated bilateral breast zzso zzso The zzso breast was zzso for cancer zzso Family history of breast cancer, index cancer zzso breast density, and age at diagnosis of first breast cancer were assessed as potential risk factors for zzso zzso breast zzso 

Fifteen patients zzso had a suspicious enhancing zzso depicted in the zzso zzso Seven patients zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in four, invasive zzso zzso with zzso in two, and invasive zzso zzso in zzso Eight patients zzso had benign zzso zzso changes in four, zzso zzso zzso in two, zzso zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso in zzso in one, and zzso zzso in zzso Six patients with negative MR findings underwent zzso zzso no zzso was zzso No significant differences were noted among patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or negative zzso zzso zzso MR findings with regard to family history of breast cancer zzso zzso index cancer zzso zzso zzso breast density zzso zzso or age at diagnosis of first breast cancer zzso zzso 

The preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of using MR imaging of the breast in a screening role, specifically to evaluate the zzso breast in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer to detect zzso and clinically zzso zzso breast zzso
