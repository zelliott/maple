Alzheimer's disease zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the corpus zzso zzso which plays a key role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso this zzso study investigated the neural zzso of zzso zzso in individuals with zzso or zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and zzso healthy individuals zzso 

zzso right-handed participants were zzso scanned to measure the volume of the zzso in 5 zzso In Study 1, zzso zzso and HC individuals performed a zzso zzso letter zzso task zzso zzso in Study 2, zzso and HC individuals performed a zzso zzso task zzso zzso and a zzso zzso task zzso zzso 

The results showed a positive correlation between Response Times and the zzso of the zzso at the lowest cognitive demand level zzso 1) in participants with zzso and the total zzso zzso zzso body, and zzso of the zzso at high cognitive demand levels zzso zzso in normal zzso The volume of the anterior part of the zzso was significantly zzso correlated with the zzso behavioral zzso for the zzso group zzso 1 and Study zzso 

This study provides evidence that zzso zzso may constitute a flexible mechanism that can improve the zzso ability to meet processing demands for low cognitive demand in zzso and for high cognitive demand in normal zzso
