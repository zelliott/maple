zzso can improve motor status after stroke with certain advantages, but there has been less emphasis to date on robotic developments for the zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether a zzso robot would improve motor function, and to evaluate the specificity of therapy effects on brain zzso zzso with chronic stroke producing moderate right zzso weakness received 3 weeks therapy that emphasized intense active movement repetition as well as attention, speed, force, precision and timing, and included virtual reality zzso zzso initiated hand zzso If necessary, the robot completed movements, a feature available at all visits for seven of the subjects and at the latter half of visits for six of the zzso zzso zzso gains were found at end of treatment, for example, in Action Research zzso Test zzso zzso 20 to 38 zzso 19, zzso zzso and arm motor zzso score zzso zzso 10 to 52 zzso 10, P zzso zzso zzso suggest greater gains for subjects receiving robotic assistance in all sessions as compared to those receiving robotic assistance in half of zzso The grasp task practiced during robotic therapy, when performed during functional zzso showed increased zzso zzso zzso across the period of therapy, while a zzso task, zzso did zzso A zzso therapy showed improvements in hand motor function after chronic zzso Reorganization of motor maps during the current therapy was zzso a finding useful when considering zzso of rehabilitation zzso
