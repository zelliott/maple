The purpose of this study was to assess tumor zzso of the brain by dynamic zzso contrast zzso MR imaging and to determine whether this method is clinically useful for monitoring radiation effects on brain zzso zzso zzso compared zzso MR imaging with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso acid human serum zzso zzso in the assessment of tumor zzso in a limited numbers of zzso 

Twelve patients with various kinds of brain tumors were zzso zzso zzso was performed on all patients before and after radiation zzso zzso using zzso was also performed in five zzso The rate of change in tumor blood volume in response to radiation therapy was evaluated with zzso zzso and zzso The rate of change in tumor volume in response to radiation was also zzso 

Ten patients were successfully zzso The rate of change in tumor blood volume correlated well between zzso zzso and zzso There was no significant correlation between the rates of change for tumor blood volume and tumor zzso Changes in tumor zzso preceded the reduction in tumor volume seen following zzso 

zzso zzso provides information regarding radiation effects on tumor vessels that is not available with conventional zzso
