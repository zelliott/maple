zzso molecules mediate attachment and zzso migration of zzso as a critical step in zzso of zzso Their expression and release were comparatively investigated in patients with zzso and zzso disease of the central nervous zzso 

With zzso methods, serum zzso of zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in patients with zzso disease of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso disease and patients with zzso vascular zzso zzso a cerebral zzso zzso As controls, zzso and zzso subjects without zzso cerebrovascular disease zzso were zzso 

We observed significantly increased serum zzso of zzso and zzso in patients with both zzso disease of the large zzso arteries and zzso vascular zzso Interestingly, the highest levels were observed in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso were significantly increased in current smokers but not in diabetic or zzso zzso 

The observation of elevated release of zzso zzso molecules in both patients with zzso of the large zzso arteries and patients with zzso vascular zzso indicates that inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso of zzso play similarly important roles in cerebral zzso and zzso zzso
