Since the first successful demonstration of primary visual zzso zzso by zzso in 1961, zzso studies based on regional blood flow zzso became one of the gold standards for zzso zzso The rapid advancement of zzso imaging techniques provided an appropriate stage for the human application of this original zzso Following the tremendous success of zzso zzso zzso zzso utilizing zzso labeled zzso zzso the magnetic resonance imaging zzso version, which is now referred to as functional zzso zzso was zzso zzso is the method created based on the empirical observation that zzso exhibits spontaneous signal zzso associated with blood flow zzso It is now believed that the principle of zzso is identical to zzso zzso that it is blood flow based in accordance with the well-known zzso doctrine which predicts a decline in cerebral zzso blood volume secondary to an increase in cerebral zzso blood zzso The method is inherently qualitative and does not provide quantitative information regarding flow zzso With the growing use of zzso however, zzso increasing well founded criticism questioning the zzso of zzso data has been zzso The majority of validation issues arise during the process of obtaining raw images, which eventually provides raw zzso data for zzso statistical zzso This article provides a distillation of the essential knowledge necessary for the zzso physicist zzso zzso
