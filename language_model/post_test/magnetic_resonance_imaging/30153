Almost all we know about zzso brain injury in alcohol use disorders has been derived from convenience samples of treated zzso Recent research has demonstrated more zzso conditions, poorer zzso zzso and higher dependence levels in treated zzso than in their zzso zzso Thus, it is not clear whether zzso results from convenience samples of treated zzso can be generalized to the entire population with alcohol use zzso We compared 35 treated zzso at 1 week of zzso zzso and 32 zzso heavy drinkers zzso on regional brain volumes and zzso zzso obtained by in zzso magnetic resonance at zzso zzso to evaluate for potential group zzso Then, we evaluated whether zzso cigarette smoking and common demographic and clinical variables zzso any existing zzso group zzso zzso demonstrated smaller zzso gray matter volumes and zzso than zzso exacerbated by chronic zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso (an accepted marker of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in membrane zzso and zzso (a putative marker of zzso cells and zzso were lower in multiple brain regions of zzso compared to zzso The lower zzso zzso in white matter of zzso versus HD were explained by average number of drinks per month over the year preceding zzso However, the other group differences were not explained by common drinking, zzso and clinical variables zzso as zzso at the same zzso or by excluding participants with zzso mood zzso Taken together, this suggests that the degree of brain zzso as well as zzso and membrane injury in clinical samples of zzso cannot be generalized to the much larger population with alcohol use disorders that does not seek zzso
