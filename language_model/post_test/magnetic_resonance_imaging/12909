Recent zzso correlation studies have extended to the superior zzso zzso the right zzso zzso sites associated with the left unilateral spatial zzso in addition to the traditional zzso zzso of the responsible zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The study aimed at teasing apart, by means of repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso the contribution of the inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and of the superior zzso zzso of the right hemisphere, in making judgments about the zzso of a horizontal line, a widely used task for detecting and investigating spatial zzso zzso trains at 25 zzso frequency were delivered over the inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso and the anterior zzso lobe of the right hemisphere, in 10 zzso zzso participants, performing a line zzso judgment zzso zzso of the inferior zzso zzso at the level of the zzso zzso brought about a rightward error in the zzso judgment, zzso to the side of the zzso with stimulation over the other sites being zzso The neural zzso of computing the zzso of a horizontal segment include the right zzso zzso in the inferior zzso zzso and do not extend to the angular zzso and the superior zzso zzso These zzso data in zzso subjects zzso the evidence from zzso studies in zzso patients, emphasizing the major role of a subset of relevant zzso
