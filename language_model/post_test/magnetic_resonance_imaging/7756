Chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso agents are a new class of zzso zzso contrast agents with a great potential for molecular and cellular zzso As for other established zzso contrast agents, the main drawback deals with their low zzso The sensitivity issue may be tackled by increasing the number of exchanging zzso involved in the transfer of saturated zzso to the zzso water zzso zzso we show that the water molecules in the zzso of red blood cells can be exploited as source of zzso zzso provided that their chemical shift is properly shifted by the zzso zzso of a zzso shift zzso The sensitivity of this system is the highest displayed so far among zzso agents (less than 1 zzso of zzso and the natural origin of this system makes it suitable for in zzso zzso The proposed zzso zzso may be proposed as reporters of the blood volume in the tumor zzso
