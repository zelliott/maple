zzso zzso zzso is an effective treatment for medically intractable zzso lobe zzso Identification of seizure focus is essential to surgical zzso 

To examine the usefulness of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso data in the zzso of seizure zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso data were entered, independently and in zzso as indicators of seizure focus zzso in zzso function zzso yielding correct seizure zzso rates for each set of zzso 

Comprehensive zzso Program, zzso zzso Hospital, University of Florida, zzso 

zzso right-handed adult patients who ultimately underwent successful anterior zzso zzso zzso patients, those with zzso surgical outcome, and any patients with a history of neurological insult unrelated to seizure disorder were excluded from this zzso 

For each patient zzso zzso was represented as a seizure zzso index reflecting the numbers of zzso originating in the left hemisphere, right hemisphere, and those unable to be zzso zzso resonance imaging data were represented as zzso difference in zzso zzso zzso data consisted of mean scores in each of 5 cognitive zzso 

The zzso was a better indicator of zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso although not zzso The zzso and zzso were significantly superior to zzso data zzso zzso and zzso zzso Combining zzso and zzso yielded a significantly higher zzso rate zzso than zzso alone zzso Adding zzso data improved this slightly zzso 

The zzso and zzso were of high zzso value, while zzso data were of limited use in this zzso Combining zzso zzso and zzso improved focus zzso relative to using these data zzso
