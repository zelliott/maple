White matter zzso zzso are the classic pathological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis zzso However, zzso zzso zzso load shows relatively poor correlation with functional outcome, resulting in the zzso zzso of zzso Unlike zzso based measures, zzso zzso assessment of brain zzso shows a strong correlation with functional outcome, and the presence of early zzso predicts a worse disease zzso While extensive literature exists describing zzso characteristics of zzso in zzso the exact zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso loss, zzso damage zzso zzso or a combination of the zzso zzso Animal models of zzso would allow for detailed investigations of the zzso and would contribute to an enhanced understanding of zzso connections in this complex zzso We now report that in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model of zzso in zzso mice, significant brain zzso accompanies the development of the progressive zzso zzso We conducted zzso zzso studies in 8 cases and 4 age, zzso and zzso control zzso While in controls we did not detect any brain zzso significant zzso developed as early as 3 months into the disease course, and reached its peak by 6 months, resulting in zzso enlargement by zzso zzso A strong correlation zzso between zzso and zzso as assessed by zzso zzso was also zzso We earlier reported another neurodegenerative feature in this model, the presence of deep gray matter zzso zzso in zzso zzso Future studies utilizing this model will allow us to investigate key components of zzso zzso neurodegenerative feature development, their tissue correlations and associations with functional outcome zzso These studies are expected to pave the way to a better understanding of the zzso of disability in zzso zzso
