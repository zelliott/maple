We have investigated induced current magnetic resonance electrical zzso zzso zzso by means of computer zzso The zzso zzso was implemented to solve the zzso reconstruction zzso By providing physical insight into the charge accumulating on the zzso the convergence characteristics of the reconstruction zzso were zzso The simulation results conducted on different objects were well correlated with the proposed theoretical zzso The feasibility of zzso to reconstruct the zzso distribution of zzso zzso was also examined in computer simulations using a zzso realistic head zzso The present simulation results suggest that zzso may have the potential to become a useful zzso imaging zzso
