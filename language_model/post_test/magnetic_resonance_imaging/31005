Although still controversial, many authors currently advocate extensive zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso Because these tumors usually migrate along white matter zzso the corpus zzso is often zzso Nevertheless, there is evidently no specific study featuring zzso of the corpus zzso infiltrated by zzso despite abundant literature concerning zzso in zzso surgery or zzso zzso zzso The aim of this paper was to analyze functional outcome following removal of corpus zzso invaded by zzso and to analyze the impact of this zzso on the quality of zzso 

Between 1996 and 2002, a total of 32 patients harboring an zzso involving part of the corpus zzso and having no or only a mild zzso deficit underwent surgery aided by zzso electrical mapping to preserve eloquent structures identified on stimulation and to perform the most extensive zzso zzso zzso no clinical response was zzso on stimulation of the corpus zzso thus, the part of this structure that was invaded by zzso was zzso Despite immediate zzso neurological zzso all patients but one recovered within 3 months and returned to a normal zzso zzso The additional zzso allowed for nine total zzso 18 zzso zzso and five partial zzso Furthermore, only two cases of zzso zzso migration occurred during a median follow up of 3 zzso 

zzso of the corpus zzso infiltrated by zzso improves the quality of tumor removal without increasing the risk of zzso
