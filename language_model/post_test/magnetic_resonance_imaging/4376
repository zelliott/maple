To examine the brain damage of zzso abusers in Japan, where pure industrial zzso is frequently zzso 

Twenty zzso abusers 17 to 33 years of age with zzso zzso zzso years of abuse were examined with a zzso MR imaging zzso 

White matter zzso in zzso brain zzso and zzso on zzso images were found in seven zzso The extent of white matter change was most clearly shown on zzso zzso zzso The patients with restricted white matter change and intermediate white matter change showed white matter zzso in the brain stem and zzso on zzso images, in some cases, with additional zzso in the corresponding zzso zzso These patients had mainly abused pure zzso The patients with diffuse white matter change showed obvious brain zzso including zzso zzso and thinning of the corpus zzso These patients had mainly abused zzso zzso 

There are some patients with restricted but severe enough change to cause the zzso symptoms in specific regions, such as the brain stem and/or zzso before the brain zzso becomes zzso This suggests that the restricted white matter change represents not only an early change of diffuse white matter change, but at least in some cases also represents a zzso different change than that of diffuse white matter zzso We suggest that pure zzso has a possible relation to this qualitative zzso
