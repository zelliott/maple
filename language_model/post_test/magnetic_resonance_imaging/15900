To study zzso muscle zzso function, the local zzso contraction and zzso zzso along human horizontal zzso were zzso by using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Eleven subjects zzso right zzso gazed at a target that moved zzso in a zzso fashion zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso with an zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso deformation in two patients with zzso syndrome type I was zzso The horizontal zzso and the zzso nerve were tracked through 15 time zzso and their local deformation was zzso Eight segments were separated along the zzso and zzso and zzso eye movements were zzso 

In healthy subjects, the maximum zzso deformation was situated at approximately two thirds of the muscle lengths from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were similar for the entire movement range as well as in both movement zzso In the two patients with zzso syndrome type I, the abnormal zzso of lateral zzso muscle affected specific zzso segments zzso The zzso muscle segments contracted and the anterior muscle segments relaxed during zzso 

zzso zzso is a useful technique for advancing the understanding of the physiology and zzso of zzso in humans during eye zzso
