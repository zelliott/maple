To assess the diagnostic confidence of multiple readers in the magnetic resonance imaging zzso diagnosis of zzso 

zzso patients zzso age zzso range zzso who had undergone zzso were zzso zzso Five regions were zzso and the presence of zzso was scored on a zzso scale in order to assess the diagnostic zzso zzso analysis included receiver operating characteristic zzso curve analysis, the Cohen weighted test and sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso negative zzso value zzso zzso positive likelihood ratio zzso and negative likelihood ratio zzso 

The areas under the curve zzso in the detection of zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso for readers 1, 2 and 3, zzso in the zzso ligament zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the anterior compartment zzso zzso and zzso and in the zzso of Douglas zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso confidence of the observers is different according to the region of the zzso of zzso and it can be challenging in the zzso and for the less experience readers also in the zzso and zzso zzso the degree of uncertain diagnosis for the less expert readers may reach up to one third of the zzso 

zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is increasingly used to assess zzso zzso The diagnostic confidence of observers varies according to the location of zzso zzso The diagnosis is more difficult to establish by zzso in some anatomical locations zzso zzso training should be given concerning those locations that cause zzso
