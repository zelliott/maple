This zzso phase I trial was designed to determine the zzso dose zzso of zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate the use of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Patients received zzso twice weekly on a continuous zzso A treatment cycle was defined as 4 zzso zzso zzso toxicity zzso was defined as any grade 3 or 4 zzso toxicity or grade 4 zzso toxicity of any zzso 

A total of 51 patients were enrolled in zzso of six patients to doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso administered as a twice weekly intravenous zzso Three patients progressed early and were zzso for toxicity zzso The zzso observed were one zzso zzso zzso one grade 4 joint and bone pain zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was not zzso Two patients demonstrated complete response, three patients had partial response, and four patients had stable zzso zzso zzso revealed a significant relationship between the change in tumor relative cerebral blood flow zzso from baseline and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve after 16 weeks of zzso 

zzso is well tolerated to doses of zzso zzso durable complete and partial responses were seen in this phase I study, and clinical response appears related to zzso zzso
