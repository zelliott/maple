zzso zzso that distort or compress the zzso junction are commonly associated with zzso As a basis for discussing zzso mechanisms, the upper end of the central canal of the spinal zzso was examined zzso in six aborted fetuses and 14 adults dying of natural zzso the results were correlated with magnetic resonance images in 40 normal zzso The central canal of the zzso which extends from the zzso junction to the fourth zzso was found to migrate zzso zzso in zzso diameter, and zzso beneath the tip of the zzso to form a large, zzso zzso This opening communicates directly with the zzso space through the zzso of zzso and is indirectly continuous with the main body of the fourth zzso In adults, the zzso of the central canal is located approximately zzso zzso below the zzso zzso inferior and zzso zzso below the zzso of the fourth zzso Analysis of magnetic resonance imaging scans in 45 patients with zzso and simple zzso zzso revealed two patterns of cavity zzso 1) zzso that zzso the upper end of the central canal or its continuity with the zzso space produced a zzso type of zzso and 2) zzso that zzso the zzso zzso or the zzso outlets of the fourth zzso produced a zzso type of zzso zzso in association with zzso Evidence is presented that zzso occurring with zzso zzso are not caused by a zzso flow of zzso fluid from the fourth zzso into the central canal of the spinal zzso
