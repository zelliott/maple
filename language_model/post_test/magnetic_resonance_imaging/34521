To assess the clinical and imaging findings in primary muscle zzso 

Seven patients with zzso primary muscle zzso without evidence of systemic disease underwent imaging with plain zzso or zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso Four underwent bone zzso and two underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso 

Plain zzso at initial examination zzso zzso 5) showed no bone zzso zzso masses and bone zzso involvement showed zzso at CT zzso zzso zzso but at MR imaging zzso zzso zzso all masses demonstrated increased signal intensity on zzso images that involved multiple muscle compartments and typically spanned a long segment of the zzso zzso bone disease was less extensive than muscle disease, and, in most cases, subcutaneous zzso or extension was observed adjacent to the zzso Good size correlation was observed between findings at MR imaging, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two patients developed zzso zzso muscle zzso several years after initial zzso 

The presence of an extensive zzso mass with zzso of adjacent subcutaneous fat and minimal or no extension into the bone zzso cavity at MR imaging and normal plain zzso findings may suggest primary muscle zzso
