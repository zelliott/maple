To investigate the feasibility and performance of zzso magnetic resonance imaging compared to zzso imaging to discriminate benign zzso and inflammatory zzso from zzso zzso zzso in rabbits using zzso particles of iron oxide zzso contrast zzso 

Six New Zealand White rabbits were zzso with either complete zzso zzso cell suspension zzso zzso 3) to induce zzso enlarged zzso zzso or with zzso tumor cells to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Image acquisition was performed before and 24 hours after zzso injection of an zzso contrast agent at zzso and afterward at zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative and positive zzso values for the detection of zzso zzso zzso were calculated for both field strengths with zzso serving as reference zzso zzso of zzso zzso with no, zzso and zzso changes were compared using a zzso zzso 

All 24 zzso zzso were detected at zzso as well as at zzso At zzso sensitivity amounted to zzso while specificity reached a value of zzso At the higher field strength zzso imaging was able to reach sensitivity and specificity values of zzso No statistical differences were detected concerning zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resonance zzso with zzso contrast agents allows for differentiation of normal and zzso enlarged zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso First experiments at zzso show promising results compared to zzso which have to be evaluated in further zzso
