zzso zzso is a promising approach toward acute stroke zzso In previous in zzso studies, we demonstrated enhanced zzso destruction induced by zzso zzso However, little is known about biological interactions of zzso ultrasound with brain zzso The aim of this in zzso zzso study was to assess safety aspects of zzso zzso ultrasound in zzso 

The zzso of 33 male zzso rats was zzso for 20 minutes zzso continuous zzso Power output was varied between 0 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso temperature was zzso zzso imaging and zzso imaging was performed before and 4 hours, 24 hours, and 5 days after zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso and zzso relaxation time zzso were measured in regions of interest in the zzso and the zzso zzso The animals were zzso for zzso evaluation zzso 

zzso temperature increased significantly during zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased significantly at zzso and zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso increased significantly in the zzso and zzso zzso group, consistent with zzso zzso No changes were zzso in the zzso output group zzso zzso After zzso with zzso zzso a significant loss of zzso could be detected on zzso Furthermore, 3 animals developed zzso cortical zzso that could be identified as zzso zzso 

zzso ultrasound caused zzso and zzso brain zzso and zzso necrosis in a zzso zzso This study indicates therapeutic zzso ultrasound as being potentially harmful and zzso the necessity of careful evaluation in further animal zzso
