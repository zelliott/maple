In typical zzso zzso muscular zzso zzso peak motor function is usually only zzso sitting or sliding on the zzso though a few patients are able to walk at some zzso However, a few patients have a severe zzso and never acquire head zzso In addition, it is clinically difficult to differentiate this severe zzso from zzso syndrome zzso or from zzso disease zzso In order to establish a zzso zzso we performed zzso analysis using zzso markers closest to the zzso gene zzso in 56 Japanese zzso families, including 35 families whose children were diagnosed as zzso with the typical zzso 12 families with a mild zzso and 9 families with a severe zzso Of the 12 zzso with the mild zzso 8 could walk and the other 4 could stand with zzso 10 cases were zzso for the ancestral founder zzso zzso whereas the other 2 were zzso for the zzso In the 9 severe cases, who had never acquired head control or the ability to sit without support, 3 had progressive zzso 2 required a shunt operation, and 7 had zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that 8 of the 9 cases of the severe zzso are zzso for the zzso zzso and the other one zzso for the zzso We confirmed that at least one zzso in each of the 56 zzso patients has the zzso zzso The rate of zzso for the zzso zzso was significantly higher in severe cases than in typical or mild cases zzso zzso zzso Severe zzso patients appeared to be compound zzso for the founder zzso and another zzso Thus, the present study yielded molecular genetic evidence of a broad clinical spectrum in zzso
