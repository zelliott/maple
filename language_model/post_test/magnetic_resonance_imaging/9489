zzso blood zzso zzso is currently the standard of care for primary and secondary stroke prevention in children with zzso cell anemia zzso However, the effect of zzso on cerebrovascular pathology is not well zzso 

We reviewed children with zzso receiving zzso for abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso or cerebrovascular accident zzso zzso zzso cerebral magnetic resonance imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso were compared with the most recent scans available for each patient and independently scored by a zzso 

Thirty-four patients with a mean age of zzso at the time of baseline zzso were zzso Average elapsed time from baseline to most recent scans was zzso Overall, patients experienced worsening zzso as measured by mean increases in their baseline zzso and zzso scores of zzso and zzso There was a significant difference in the mean change of zzso scores between patients who had zzso and abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with abnormal baseline zzso had worsening scores compared to those with normal baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, patients who had zzso were more likely to have an abnormal baseline zzso and worsening scores compared to abnormal zzso zzso 

We show that children with zzso experience progression of cerebral zzso despite zzso In contrast, zzso for abnormal zzso zzso protection against the development and/or progression of cerebral zzso This effect appears to be real given our large cohort of patients with longer follow up as compared to previous zzso
