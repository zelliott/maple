We studied 6 patients with zzso zzso showing mild signs of central nervous system zzso All patients underwent brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso and motor zzso evoked potential zzso Whereas zzso and zzso were abnormal in all patients, only 1 patient showed brain zzso zzso spinal zzso showed zzso without focal abnormalities in 4 of 6 zzso Median nerve zzso which were recorded with zzso reference zzso revealed delayed or absent scalp zzso zzso potential in all patients and abnormal spinal zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso nerve zzso revealed abnormalities of the zzso zzso response in all 4 patients in whom zzso recording was zzso These findings strongly suggest that in the early stages of disease neurological dysfunction is localized in the spinal cord, where it is difficult to assess using zzso However, zzso and zzso which show a typical pattern of zzso in these patients, could be useful in disclosing signs of long tract involvement and in monitoring zzso
