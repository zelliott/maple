The purpose of this work was to apply fuzzy logic image processing techniques to characterize the zzso bone structure with high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso Fifteen ex zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance images of specimens of human zzso at zzso T and 12 in zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance images of the zzso of zzso and zzso women at 3 T were zzso Soft zzso using fuzzy zzso was applied to MR data to obtain fuzzy bone volume fraction zzso which were then analyzed with three-dimensional zzso fuzzy geometrical parameters and measures of zzso zzso parameters included fuzzy perimeter and fuzzy zzso while measures of fuzziness included linear index of zzso zzso index of zzso zzso fuzzy zzso and exponential fuzzy zzso zzso parameters were validated at zzso T with zzso structural parameters zzso from zzso zzso images, which allow the observation of true zzso bone structure and with apparent MR structural indexes at zzso T and 3 zzso The validation was statistically performed with the zzso correlation zzso as well as with the zzso zzso Bone volume fraction correlation values zzso were up to zzso zzso with good agreements based on zzso analysis showing that fuzzy zzso is a valid technique to zzso this zzso zzso of fuzziness also showed consistent correlations to zzso number parameters zzso zzso and good agreements based on zzso analysis, suggesting that the level of fuzziness in high-resolution magnetic resonance images could be related to the zzso bone zzso
