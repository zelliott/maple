An inherited disorder, zzso zzso zzso is known to cause progressive inflammatory zzso 

To analyze the adult pattern of disease progression in zzso 

We zzso assessed magnetic resonance zzso images obtained in adult patients who had developed cerebral disease between January 1, 1985, and December 31, zzso We identified 103 adult patients with zzso with zzso on their MR zzso Of these, 56 had serial MR examinations at least 1 year apart and were included in this zzso Main zzso Measure zzso of zzso zzso on MR zzso 

On initial zzso 17 patients with zzso had zzso tract zzso without zzso or zzso involvement, 24 had zzso zzso tract zzso with additional involvement of the zzso or zzso and 15 did not have zzso tract involvement but had other white matter zzso In 18 of 21 patients with progressive zzso zzso tract involvement preceded or occurred zzso with progressive inflammatory zzso 

Brain MR imaging abnormalities in adults with zzso progress slower than those reported in zzso The involvement of the zzso tracts is prominent and may at times represent a zzso course of progressive inflammatory zzso
