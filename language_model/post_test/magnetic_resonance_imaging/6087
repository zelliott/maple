To determine the incremental benefit of combined zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and MR zzso imaging, as compared with zzso MR imaging alone, for zzso zzso of peripheral zone zzso prostate zzso 

This prospective zzso study, conducted by the American College of zzso Imaging Network zzso from February 2004 to June 2005, was institutional review board approved and zzso zzso Research associates were required to follow consent guidelines approved by the Office for Human Research Protection and established by the institutional review zzso One hundred zzso patients with zzso prostate zzso and scheduled to undergo radical zzso were recruited at seven zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR sequences were performed at zzso T by using a pelvic zzso zzso in combination with an zzso zzso Eight readers independently rated the likelihood of the presence of zzso cancer in each zzso by using a zzso zzso on MR images alone and later on combined zzso zzso zzso Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso were calculated with zzso as the unit of zzso The presence or absence of cancer at zzso zzso evaluation of prostate specimens was the reference zzso zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso for values obtained with MR imaging alone and with combined MR zzso zzso imaging were zzso The zzso were estimated by using zzso statistics and appropriate zzso confidence zzso 

Complete data were available for 110 patients zzso age, 58 years; range, zzso zzso MR imaging alone and combined MR zzso zzso imaging had similar accuracy in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso for individual readers were zzso for MR imaging alone and zzso for combined MR zzso zzso zzso 

In patients who undergo radical zzso the accuracy of combined zzso zzso MR zzso zzso imaging for zzso zzso of zzso prostate cancer is equal to that of MR imaging zzso
