Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly applied for zzso diagnosis and early evaluation of therapeutic responses over zzso However, the reliability of zzso parameters derived from zzso is highly dependent on the experimental zzso In this study, the effect of sampling frequency zzso and duration on the precision of zzso parameters was evaluated based on system identification theory and computer zzso Both theoretical analysis and simulations showed that a higher value of the zzso zzso zzso required an increasing sampling zzso For instance, for similar results, a relatively low zzso of zzso zzso was sufficient for a low zzso of zzso zzso compared to a high zzso of 3 zzso for a high zzso of zzso zzso For the zzso zzso a decreasing value required a higher sampling zzso A sampling frequency below zzso zzso systematically resulted in imprecise estimates for all zzso For the zzso and zzso zzso the sampling duration should be above 2 zzso but zzso of more than 7 zzso do not further improve zzso zzso
