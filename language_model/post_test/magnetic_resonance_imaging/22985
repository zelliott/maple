zzso evidence revealed a decrease of regional cerebral blood flow in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the deficit and suggested that hysterical conversion deficits might entail a functional disorder in zzso zzso However, there is no systematic structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso study in the literature in patients with conversion disorder zzso zzso we aimed to perform structural zzso to evaluate the brain regions of interest in first applying patients with zzso zzso zzso was used to compare regional brain volumes in ten women with CD and same number of healthy comparison zzso zzso volume zzso whole brain volume, gray and white matter volumes did not differ between the patient and control zzso Patients with CD had significantly smaller mean volumes of the left zzso nucleus, zzso nucleus zzso for zzso nucleus and zzso for zzso zzso and right zzso nucleus and zzso nucleus zzso for both zzso In patients, the right zzso was significantly smaller, and the left zzso rendered to be smaller compared to healthy zzso Age at onset showed a significant relation with left zzso and a zzso trend with right zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest that patients with CD have significantly smaller mean volumes of the left and right zzso zzso and smaller right thalamus, with a trend toward to smaller left zzso compared to healthy controls and that these findings provide novel constraints for a modern zzso theory of zzso
