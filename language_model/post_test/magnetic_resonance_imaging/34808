zzso diffusion zzso were performed in tumors arising from zzso of nude mice with two human breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso to evaluate the specificity of this technique for characterizing solid zzso zzso maps were compared to zzso and correlated well with gross tumor zzso Measured zzso were highly specific for viable and zzso tumor in the five zzso tumors included in this study zzso zzso zzso while only two of the five zzso tumors studied developed distinguishable areas of zzso No statistically significant difference was observed in zzso from viable tumor between the different cell lines zzso zzso zzso
