Many zzso studies have shown that the zzso zzso Test zzso of the zzso Adult Intelligence zzso zzso is useful for screening for zzso of the zzso However, it remains unclear which brain areas are actually involved in the performance of zzso and what brain functions are used for executing this zzso In this study, we examined the cortical areas related to cognitive aspects of zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and determined executive brain functions involved in this test on the basis of zzso zzso Eleven healthy young adults zzso zzso performed a modified zzso zzso task and its control task, which required a simple zzso response during zzso data zzso The direct comparison of brain zzso between the zzso task and the control task revealed greater zzso in a zzso cortical network, including the bilateral inferior frontal zzso left middle frontal zzso (close to the frontal eye zzso and left zzso zzso zzso These zzso are interpreted as reflecting the visual search process and/or the updating process of working memory during the zzso task zzso Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the number of correct responses and zzso in the bilateral inferior frontal regions, suggesting that these prefrontal areas have a crucial role in the performance of zzso in a healthy young adult zzso
