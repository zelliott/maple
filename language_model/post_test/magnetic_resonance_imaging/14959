To be successful at zzso individuals must be able to resist impulses and zzso The strength model of self-regulation suggests that when zzso capacity is zzso self-control deficits result from a failure to engage zzso control zzso Using functional zzso we examined changes in brain activity in response to viewing desirable foods among 31 chronic zzso half of whom completed a task known to result in zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso depleted dieters exhibited greater zzso activity in the zzso cortex, a brain area associated with coding the reward value and liking aspects of desirable zzso they also showed decreased functional connectivity between this area and the inferior frontal zzso a region commonly implicated in zzso These findings suggest that zzso depletion provokes self-control failure by reducing connectivity between brain regions that are involved in cognitive control and those that represent zzso thereby decreasing the capacity to resist zzso
