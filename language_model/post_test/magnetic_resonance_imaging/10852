To zzso the effect of zzso surgery on zzso junction zzso and on global zzso compliance zzso in patients with zzso I zzso by use of magnetic resonance zzso of zzso fluid and blood zzso zzso the effect of zzso surgery may improve our understanding of the zzso characteristics of zzso I zzso and aid in identifying patients who will benefit from the zzso 

Twelve patients were studied with a zzso magnetic resonance imaging scanner before and after zzso zzso zzso phase contrast magnetic resonance images were used to zzso maximum zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso fluid zzso and zzso flow rate, and overall zzso zzso was derived by use of a previously reported method that measures small changes in zzso volume and pressure that occur naturally with each cardiac zzso 

After surgery, changes were documented both in the local zzso parameters and in zzso However, only the change in zzso an average increase of more than zzso was statistically zzso Increased zzso which was associated with improved outcome, was measured in 10 of the 12 patients, no significant change was documented in 1 patient, and decreased zzso was measured in 1 patient whose symptoms persisted after zzso 

An increase in the overall compliance of the zzso compartment is the most significant and consistent change measured after zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso and flow in the zzso junction were less consistent and less affected by the zzso Thus, zzso may play an important role in the outcome of zzso surgery related to improving symptoms and restoring normal neurological zzso in patients with zzso I zzso
