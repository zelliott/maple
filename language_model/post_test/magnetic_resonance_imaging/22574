Attention and memory deficits have been reported in heavy marijuana users, but these effects may be zzso after prolonged zzso It remains unclear whether the zzso of these cognitive deficits indicates that chronic marijuana use does not alter cortical networks, or that such changes occur but the brain adapts to the drug-induced zzso Blood zzso dependent zzso functional zzso zzso was performed in 24 chronic marijuana users (12 zzso and 12 zzso and 19 zzso zzso and zzso control subjects during a set of zzso tasks with graded levels of zzso zzso tests were also administered on each zzso The two marijuana user groups showed no significant difference in usage pattern zzso or duration of use, age of first use, cumulative zzso used, averaged zzso zzso or estimated cumulative lifetime exposure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 45 versus zzso zzso 135 zzso Despite similar task and cognitive test performance compared with control subjects, active and zzso marijuana users showed decreased zzso in the right zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions, but greater zzso in various zzso zzso and zzso brain regions during the zzso tasks (all with P zzso or zzso zzso corrected, cluster zzso However, the zzso signals in the right frontal and zzso zzso regions zzso with duration of zzso in the zzso zzso Active marijuana users, with positive urine tests for zzso showed greater zzso in the frontal and zzso zzso regions than zzso marijuana users and greater usage of the reserve network zzso with load zzso suggesting a zzso zzso Both earlier age of first use and greater estimated cumulative dose of zzso exposure were related to lower zzso signals in the right prefrontal region and zzso zzso The altered zzso zzso pattern in the attention network and zzso of the zzso suggest zzso processes or zzso of brain development in chronic marijuana zzso These changes also may be related to zzso zzso in resting cerebral blood zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso The greater zzso in the active compared with zzso marijuana users demonstrates a zzso state in the setting of active marijuana use, while the long-term chronic effect of marijuana on the altered brain network may be zzso with prolonged zzso
