The zzso and zzso of zzso in 5 normal volunteers and 27 patients with zzso tumors were evaluated preoperatively using a magnetic resonance zzso with a zzso T zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso of the zzso tumors were compared with the pathological findings: zzso the zzso and zzso of the normal zzso zzso were longer than those of the normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso of zzso pelvic cancer zzso were shorter than those of zzso cell cancer zzso p zzso zzso zzso the zzso values of zzso were significantly shorter than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of the normal zzso zzso of subjects zzso 50 years old were shorter than those of subjects zzso or zzso 50 years old zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso evaluation of the pathological findings of zzso tumors may be possible by calculating the relaxation time using zzso under low magnetic zzso
