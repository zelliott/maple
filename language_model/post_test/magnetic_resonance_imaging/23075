This paper presents the development and zzso of an zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso program using a zzso zzso T magnet with a large working zzso 

A previously established zzso zzso T zzso program based on a zzso zzso magnet was upgraded to zzso zzso The upgrade included a short, zzso zzso magnet with a large 70 zzso working zzso zzso Winnipeg, zzso zzso zzso zzso and a fully functional zzso operating room zzso zzso Between January and September 2009, 100 consecutive patients were evaluated at zzso zzso 

The zzso upgrade maintained a patient-focused zzso When not needed for surgery, the magnet was moved to an adjacent zzso A large zzso and streamlined OR table allowed freedom of patient positioning while maintaining access and zzso Working at zzso T enabled application of advanced imaging sequences to the full spectrum of zzso pathology in the zzso zzso The use of zzso continues to show zzso residual tumor in up to zzso of zzso There were no adverse events or technical system zzso 

An zzso program based a zzso T zzso magnet is zzso By moving the zzso the system maintains a patient-focused surgical environment and the ability to share the technology between medical zzso
