To evaluate impaired respiratory mechanics in pulmonary zzso dynamic breathing magnetic resonance imaging zzso was acquired with zzso echo pulse sequences at fixed zzso planes over two to three slow, deep respiratory cycles in 6 controls and 28 patients with pulmonary zzso including 9 patients undergoing lung volume reduction surgery zzso Respiratory motions of the zzso and chest wall zzso were assessed by a zzso view, a fusion display of zzso zzso and zzso images, and the zzso zzso By contrast with normal subjects with regular zzso zzso motions, the patients frequently showed reduced, zzso or zzso motions, with significant decreases in the zzso zzso of zzso motions zzso and zzso and the length of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso 01, zzso After zzso nine patients showed improvements in zzso zzso and mobility, with significantly increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso In 40 studies of 28 patients including the zzso zzso the zzso MAD and zzso significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso seems useful for zzso and directly assessing the impaired respiratory mechanics associated with abnormal ventilation in pulmonary zzso and also for monitoring the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
