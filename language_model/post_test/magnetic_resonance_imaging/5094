The zzso nucleus zzso is a crucial component of the zzso zzso which is part of a zzso circuit that is modulated by zzso structures to zzso emotional zzso zzso disorder is thought to be underpinned by dysfunctional anterior zzso networks, although zzso studies examining the zzso have shown zzso zzso As gross zzso analyses may not detect subtle regional change, we aimed to clarify the role of the zzso in bipolar disorder by zzso shape analysis to detect regional zzso 

The zzso was manually traced on zzso scans from 27 patients with zzso disorder and 24 matched zzso A zzso zzso harmonic shape analysis was undertaken using the zzso zzso 

zzso the left zzso volume was consistently larger in the sample, there was no effect of group or gender or significant interactions between these zzso Volume did not correlate with illness duration or zzso zzso but was larger in those with a history of psychosis at trend zzso However, left zzso shape differed significantly between groups, with zzso in an area along the zzso surface zzso to zzso prefrontal zzso in bipolar zzso zzso patients showed increases in the zzso head and body at trend level overall, in regions connecting to zzso and zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that subtle rather than gross structural changes occur in the zzso which may not be zzso by zzso analysis alone, and reflect zzso in specific zzso zzso in the zzso
