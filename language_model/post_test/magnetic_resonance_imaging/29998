Central nervous system zzso germ cell tumors constitute a unique class of rare tumors that mainly affect children and zzso These tumors are believed to originate from displaced primordial germ zzso Recently, results of treatment of germ cell tumors have improved with use of zzso and combination zzso However, some tumors have proven zzso to intensive treatment with surgery, radiation, and combination zzso zzso is an intermediate filament protein expressed in zzso cells during zzso development and in zzso tumors and is used as a marker of immature elements of tumors, including brain tumor stem zzso In this study, we examined for the first time zzso expression in 19 zzso germ cell tumors zzso pure zzso five zzso with zzso giant cells, one zzso zzso zzso one zzso one zzso zzso and two mature zzso zzso was expressed in 14 cases but was not expressed in three pure zzso and two mature zzso zzso zzso tumors did not exhibit zzso while all tumors that exhibited dissemination also strongly expressed zzso zzso These findings suggest that the detection of zzso expression could be useful in the management of zzso germ cell tumors, as an auxiliary predictor of dissemination and/or zzso
