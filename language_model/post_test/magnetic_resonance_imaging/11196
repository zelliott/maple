The study was performed to compare zzso short time inversion recovery zzso MR imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the examination of children with suspected zzso skeletal zzso zzso Sixteen patients with known or suspected zzso skeletal disease underwent both zzso STIR MR imaging and bone zzso The zzso were described and numbered according to zzso evaluation zzso Thus, 16 regions were analyzed in each patient for the comparison between the two zzso zzso was proven in the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso follow-up were evaluated as gold zzso A total of 139 different zzso was observed by both zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed 119 bone zzso in 256 possible sites zzso zzso revealed only 58 zzso zzso zzso was observed in only four patients zzso According to the location of the zzso correlation was observed in zzso zzso zzso In all, zzso of the zzso were detected only by zzso and zzso of the zzso were detected only by zzso zzso zzso was more sensitive zzso Of all zzso numbered which could be separated in the initial zzso zzso zzso detected 178 zzso in the zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso using a STIR sequence is an effective radiation free method for examination of children with suspected zzso bone zzso zzso showed more zzso than conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be feasible as a screening zzso for zzso and skip zzso in zzso zzso Ewing zzso and zzso cell zzso in zzso
