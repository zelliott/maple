zzso zzso zzso zzso of the adult brain baseline optical properties based on a homogeneous model of the head are known to introduce significant contamination from zzso zzso More complex models have been proposed and occasionally applied to in zzso data, but their performances have never been characterized on realistic head zzso Here we implement a flexible fitting routine of zzso zzso data using graphics processing unit based zzso Carlo zzso We compare the results for two different zzso a zzso slab with variable thickness of the first layer and a template zzso head registered to the zzso head zzso We characterize the performance of the zzso Carlo approaches for fitting the optical properties from simulated zzso data of the adult zzso We show that both zzso provide better results than the commonly used homogeneous model, and we zzso the improvement in terms of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso
