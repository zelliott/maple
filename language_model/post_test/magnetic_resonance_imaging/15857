To identify and zzso suitable zzso zzso parameters for monitoring tissue changes after external beam zzso zzso of prostate zzso 

Six patients with zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso at zzso T using a combined zzso zzso zzso and a dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso echo sequence zzso zzso s zzso zzso zzso was performed before and immediately after zzso at 3 months and at 1 zzso zzso blood volume, mean transit time, zzso zzso zzso volume, and extraction zzso were calculated in prostate cancer and normal prostate for all four time points using a sequential zzso zzso 

zzso cancer and normal prostate tissue showed a statistically significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso and increase in extraction zzso zzso zzso For prostate cancer, there was also a decrease in vascular volume zzso The other parameters investigated showed no statistically significant zzso zzso significant differences between prostate cancer and normal prostate tissue were only observed before zzso when prostate cancer showed significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a smaller extraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Two zzso zzso zzso and extraction zzso appear to be suitable candidates for monitoring the response to zzso zzso zzso of prostate zzso
