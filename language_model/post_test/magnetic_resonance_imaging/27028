According to zzso models, zzso zzso are represented across the cerebral zzso and zzso zzso gray matter zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were examined in groups of 35 psychiatric patients characterized by self-control problems and 18 healthy zzso Among patients, a positive correlation was found between motor zzso and the right zzso and a negative correlation emerged between zzso zzso and the left lateral zzso zzso zzso Among controls, zzso and motor zzso correlated zzso with the left superior zzso zzso while zzso zzso correlated positively with the left zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed convergence in correlation patterns from patients to controls, but not vice zzso That pattern suggested broader neural representation of the trait in the healthy controls, who were less impulsive than the psychiatric zzso
