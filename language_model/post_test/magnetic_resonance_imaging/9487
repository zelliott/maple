In a number of literature reports iron oxide zzso have been investigated for use in imaging zzso plaques and found to accumulate in plaques via zzso by zzso which are critical in the process of zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso of these agents is zzso thus the labeling efficiency for plaques in zzso is not zzso We have developed targeted agents to improve the efficiency for labeling zzso zzso These zzso are based on iron oxide zzso coated with zzso zzso a zzso of zzso scavenger zzso type A zzso We have zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso with sulfur zzso thereby targeting our zzso imaging agents to zzso The zzso zzso zzso remained zzso and had an average zzso diameter of 62 zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell studies confirmed that these zzso were nontoxic and specifically targeted to zzso In zzso zzso after intravenous injection of the contrast agent into an zzso mouse injury model showed substantial signal loss on the injured carotid at 4 and 24 h zzso of zzso No zzso signal decrease was seen at the control carotid and only mild signal loss was observed for the injured carotid zzso of zzso zzso indicating preferential zzso of the zzso particles at the site of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso can facilitate zzso detection and diagnosis of vulnerable plaques in zzso
