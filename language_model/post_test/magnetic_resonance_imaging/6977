zzso zzso zzso are benign vascular zzso which can be found at any region within the central nervous zzso zzso is the most frequent manifestation of this zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso used for the diagnostic evaluation of symptomatic zzso is a sensitive and specific method for the detection of zzso Due to an increased application of MR imaging in the diagnostic evaluation of symptomatic zzso zzso have been found with increasing frequency over the past zzso To achieve optimal treatment of patients with cavernous zzso and zzso both medical and surgical treatment have to be zzso 

This paper reviews published studies and presents our own results concerning current treatment schedules of zzso zzso 

In patients with intractable zzso surgical treatment of zzso seems to be the most successful zzso zzso Whether zzso zzso including the removal of only the zzso or a more extensive zzso is needed to achieve this aim are zzso 

New data acquired with high-resolution imaging zzso zzso and zzso indicate that zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso of zzso tissue bordering the zzso thus permitting appropriate inclusion of this specific area within the zzso instead of performing a simple zzso
