A balanced fast field echo zzso sequence (also referred to as true fast imaging with steady zzso zzso zzso based on projection reconstruction zzso is evaluated in combination with real-time reconstruction and interactive scanning capabilities for cardiac function zzso zzso image sequences obtained with the balanced zzso method are compared with images obtained with a zzso zzso zzso transform zzso zzso In particular, the representation of motion artifacts in both techniques is zzso Balanced zzso provides a similar contrast to zzso techniques, but is less sensitive to motion zzso The use of angular zzso within balanced zzso is examined as a means to increase zzso resolution while causing only minor zzso Furthermore, a modification of the profile order allows the reconstruction of zzso images at different spatial and zzso resolution levels from the same zzso This study shows that balanced zzso is a robust tool for cardiac function zzso
