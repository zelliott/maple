A study of structures which zzso reduction of hip dislocation was performed on 15 hips by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Before treatment started, zzso studies were performed on 10 patients, six of whom were treated zzso after which further zzso studies helped to establish a concentric zzso In the other four conservative treatment failed and they were operated on; in them the zzso studies were compared with zzso and surgical zzso In all but one of these 10 patients, zzso enabled us to differentiate between an zzso and an zzso zzso In five other patients with unsatisfactory development of the hip following closed reduction, zzso was compared with earlier zzso zzso zzso provided accurate anatomical information which would not have been obtained by zzso It clearly has great potential in assisting the surgeon to select the appropriate form of zzso
