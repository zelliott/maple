This study investigated cognitive control of social and zzso information in zzso using functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso with zzso spectrum disorders zzso and a zzso control group completed an oddball target detection task where target stimuli were either faces or zzso objects previously shown to be related to circumscribed interests in zzso The zzso group demonstrated relatively increased zzso to social targets in right insular zzso and in left superior frontal zzso and relatively decreased zzso to zzso targets related to circumscribed interests in multiple zzso brain zzso zzso suggest that zzso recruitment during cognitive control in zzso is contingent on stimulus type, with increased zzso for social stimuli and decreased zzso for zzso stimuli related to circumscribed zzso
