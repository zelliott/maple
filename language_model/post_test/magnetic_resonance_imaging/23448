zzso lobe zzso matter abnormalities zzso are frequent zzso zzso observed on zzso in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso in addition to zzso sclerosis zzso 

To study the influence of zzso pole zzso on clinical characteristics and seizure outcome in patients with HS operated on for zzso 

A cohort of 370 patients undergoing surgery for intractable zzso was zzso collected in an zzso surgery data zzso Clinical characteristics and seizure outcome of all 58 zzso patients with identified HS and zzso zzso 1) were compared with those of a matched control group of 58 HS patients without zzso zzso zzso Both groups were further subdivided into patients undergoing zzso selective zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

The HS plus zzso patients were significantly younger at zzso onset than those without zzso In the HS plus zzso group, zzso of patients were younger than 2 years when they experienced their first seizure in contrast to only zzso of patients with pure HS zzso zzso zzso zzso outcome was not statistically different between the 2 groups: zzso of the patients in group 1 were seizure free zzso class I) compared with zzso of patients in group zzso zzso outcome in both groups was about equally successful with selective zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso 

Limited and standard zzso in zzso patients with HS are equally successful regardless of the presence of zzso
