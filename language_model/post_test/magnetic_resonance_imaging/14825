We come into the world with enduring zzso towards food, which interact with environmental factors to influence our eating behaviors and weight zzso But our fates are not sealed - by learning more about this process we can identify ways to zzso To advance this goal this we need to be able to assess zzso traits such as food cue responsiveness and zzso sensitivity at different zzso zzso Assessment methods might include behavioral measures zzso eating behavior tests, zzso zzso but also zzso such as brain responses to food cues measured using zzso Evidence from zzso children and adolescents suggests that these zzso of appetite differ not only with body weight, but also with familial obesity risk as assessed by parent weight, which reflects both genetic and environmental zzso and may provide a useful predictor of obesity zzso zzso and neural approaches have great potential to inform each other: examining eating behavior can help us identify meaningful zzso zzso whose neural bases can be zzso while increasing knowledge of the shared zzso underlying zzso zzso and related behaviors and disorders may ultimately lead to innovative generalized zzso Another challenge will be to combine comprehensive behavioral and neural assessments of zzso traits with measures of relevant genetic and environmental factors within long-term prospective zzso This approach may help to identify the zzso precursors of zzso and lay the foundations for targeted zzso interventions that can interrupt the zzso to excess zzso
