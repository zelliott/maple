The cognitive division of anterior zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in cognitive control via a distributed attention zzso The structural zzso zzso of zzso have been revealed by several zzso zzso However potential functional zzso zzso of zzso remain less zzso zzso the functional zzso zzso of zzso helps for a better understanding of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to use zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine zzso differences in the functional networks associated with zzso in the two zzso zzso functional connectivity analysis was performed on a group of 49 right-handed healthy zzso The left and right zzso showed significant differences in their patterns of connectivity with a variety of brain regions, including the zzso prefrontal cortex, inferior zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in their zzso cerebral cortex, as well as zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso in their zzso zzso zzso Specifically, for these areas, we found significantly greater connectivity strength with zzso in the right zzso than the left, regardless of whether the connection was positive or zzso The current results highlight the presence of clear zzso in functional networks associated with zzso Future functional imaging studies are needed to give greater attention to the zzso zzso functional networks which are zzso
