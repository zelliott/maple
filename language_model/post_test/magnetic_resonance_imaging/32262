zzso resonance imaging zzso has been shown in the literature to have high accuracy for the diagnosis of superior zzso zzso zzso zzso However, these studies have been performed at specialized institutions and have not been evaluated for community zzso Our hypothesis was that zzso diagnosis of SLAP zzso in the community setting is not as accurate as suggested by previous zzso The zzso reports for 83 consecutive surgically confirmed type II SLAP zzso were zzso The findings regarding the presence of SLAP zzso were documented from the community zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso musculoskeletal zzso evaluated these same 83 zzso as well as 17 zzso with surgically confirmed normal superior zzso The musculoskeletal zzso also used a visual analog scale to zzso grade the quality of each zzso zzso were performed at 14 different centers and were read by 28 different community zzso There were 37 zzso zzso and 46 zzso zzso The community zzso accurately identified 51% of the SLAP zzso The sensitivities for the community zzso were significantly better for the zzso zzso than for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For the two musculoskeletal zzso the sensitivities were zzso and zzso and the zzso were zzso and zzso The zzso for the musculoskeletal zzso were zzso and zzso One of the musculoskeletal zzso had significant correlation between the visual analog score and zzso diagnostic accuracy zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity for one of the musculoskeletal zzso was significantly greater than the sensitivity for the community zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso between the other musculoskeletal zzso and the community zzso were not significantly different zzso zzso zzso In this community setting, zzso was not accurate for the diagnosis of SLAP zzso zzso zzso were more accurate than the community zzso however, the musculoskeletal zzso were not as accurate as previous literature might zzso
