The two most prevalent forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso are the juvenile form zzso disease, zzso and late infantile form zzso disease, zzso The aim of this study was to compare quantitative zzso of brain tissue in zzso and zzso patients with reference values from zzso normal zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) and zzso zzso zzso 17) patients zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso examination including a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured in six defined regions of interest zzso in the calculated quantitative zzso maps within the white matter zzso and gray matter zzso The extracted quantitative zzso were compared with reference values from healthy children and young zzso zzso consent was obtained from the patients or their parents for all zzso 

zzso analysis revealed elevated quantitative zzso in nearly all zzso placed in the zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast to this finding, no significant differences were found for the quantitative zzso of the zzso patients compared to the zzso healthy controls in any of the defined zzso zzso Both groups exhibited no significant zzso of the quantitative zzso in the zzso zzso compared to the healthy zzso 

zzso of quantitative zzso in the cerebral zzso may not be a reliable sign to confirm the diagnosis in zzso patients but could prove valuable for diagnosis confirmation, follow-up zzso and zzso monitoring of the disease progression in zzso zzso
