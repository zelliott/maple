Several studies have investigated zzso brain changes in patients with zzso stress disorder zzso and borderline personality disorder zzso Both groups exhibit volume reductions of the zzso and zzso Our aim was to investigate the influence of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso volumes in patients with zzso 

We compared 2 groups of zzso female patients with zzso (10 with and 15 without zzso zzso and 25 healthy female zzso We used zzso and zzso magnetic resonance images for manual tracing and zzso reconstruction of the zzso and zzso 

zzso volumes of patients with zzso and zzso were smaller than those of healthy zzso However, there was no significant difference between patients with zzso but without zzso and zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso volumes in patients with zzso 

Our study did not allow for zzso the effects of zzso and zzso Another limitation was the relatively small sample zzso 

Our findings highlight the importance of zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso may be related to zzso zzso in brain regions that are of central importance to our understanding of borderline zzso
