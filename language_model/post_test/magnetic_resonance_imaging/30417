In magnetic resonance imaging zzso substantial improvements with respect to sensitivity are expected due to the development of so-called ultra high field zzso zzso zzso zzso scanners with a magnetic field strength of 7 T or zzso Users of this technology need to evaluate this benefit for potential risks since commercially available systems are not certified as a medical device for human zzso This review provides a detailed survey of zzso field zzso related to the exposure of subjects being zzso to occupational exposure, and to exposure of the general public under consideration of current standards and zzso According to present knowledge, it is not expected that exposure of human subjects to zzso magnetic fields of 7 T implies a specific risk of damage or disease provided that known zzso are zzso The available database does not permit definition of exact thresholds for harmful zzso However, experience from previous application of ultra high field zzso indicates that transient phenomena, such as zzso zzso metallic taste, or zzso are more frequently zzso In particular, movements in the field or the zzso of the fringe field seem to lead to zzso zzso Besides such zzso there is a strong demand for systematic investigation of potential interaction mechanisms related to zzso field exposure during zzso zzso
