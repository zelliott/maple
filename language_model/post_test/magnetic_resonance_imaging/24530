The cochlear plays a vital role in the sense and sensitivity of zzso however, there is currently a lack of knowledge regarding the relationships between mechanical zzso of sound at different zzso and zzso in the cochlear and the zzso processes that lead to zzso responses in the central auditory zzso In the current study, we introduced zzso zzso zzso a convenient in zzso imaging method, for investigation of how sound, at different zzso and zzso is zzso from the cochlear to the central auditory zzso Using zzso with zzso administration, we demonstrated differential zzso signal enhancements according to sound intensity and zzso in the ascending auditory zzso of the rat after administration of zzso zzso to signal enhancement without explicit sound zzso auditory structures in the ascending auditory zzso showed stronger signal enhancement in rats who received sound stimuli of 10 and 40 zzso In addition, signal enhancement with a stimulation frequency of 40 zzso was stronger than that with 10 zzso zzso the results of this study seem to suggest that, in order to achieve an effective response to high sound intensity or frequency, more firing of auditory zzso or firing of many auditory zzso together for the pooled neural activity is zzso
