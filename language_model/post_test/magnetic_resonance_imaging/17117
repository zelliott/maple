The purpose of this article is to zzso determine the feasibility of using blood zzso zzso zzso zzso at 3 T in zzso various zzso zzso 

Seventy-one patients zzso age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso underwent kidney zzso including zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso zzso was performed using a multiple zzso echo zzso sequence to acquire 20 zzso images within a single zzso The rate of spin zzso zzso values of solid and benign zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the results of four zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The degree of overall imaging quality in zzso zzso was also zzso 

One hundred three zzso zzso were detected in the 71 zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso values of 45 solid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher than those of 58 benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The mean zzso values of simple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso The degree of overall imaging quality in all patients was satisfactory or zzso 

Renal zzso zzso at 3 T is a feasible technique and may be useful for zzso various zzso zzso
