zzso is fundamental to our perception and understanding of the zzso However, little is known about the neural bases underlying the categorization of zzso Using human functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we compared the brain responses to a category discrimination task with an auditory discrimination task using identical sets of zzso Our stimuli differed along two zzso a zzso dimension and a zzso zzso dynamics zzso All stimuli activated regions in the primary and zzso auditory zzso in the zzso zzso and in the zzso and frontal zzso for the two zzso When comparing the zzso patterns for the category discrimination task to those for the auditory discrimination task, the results show that a core group of regions beyond the auditory zzso including inferior and middle frontal zzso zzso frontal zzso and zzso zzso were zzso activated for familiar speech categories and for novel zzso zzso These regions have been shown to play a role in working memory tasks by a number of zzso Additionally, the categorization of zzso sounds activated left middle frontal zzso and right zzso zzso to a greater extent than did the categorization of speech zzso zzso the zzso aspects of the stimuli had a greater impact on the left zzso of the categorization network than did other factors, particularly in the inferior frontal zzso suggesting that there is no inherent left zzso advantage in the zzso processing of speech zzso or for the categorization task zzso
