We investigate whether the neural zzso of the continuity illusion, as measured using zzso are modulated by zzso As we have shown zzso when two zzso of a synthetic vowel are presented in an alternating pattern, the vowel can be identified if the gaps in each zzso are filled with bursts of plausible masking noise, causing the zzso zzso of a continuous vowel zzso zzso When the zzso ratio is increased so that noise no longer zzso masks the zzso the zzso are heard as interrupted zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not zzso A region of the left middle zzso zzso zzso is sensitive both to intact synthetic zzso zzso zzso present zzso and to zzso zzso compared to zzso Break zzso Here, we compared these conditions in the presence and absence of zzso We examined zzso signal for different sound types under three zzso conditions: full attention to the zzso attention to a visual zzso or attention to an auditory zzso zzso although a robust main effect of zzso state was observed in many regions, the effect of attention did not differ systematically for the zzso zzso compared to either intact zzso or to the zzso Break stimuli in the left zzso zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso continuity of zzso is an obligatory zzso process, and operates independently of zzso zzso An additional finding was that the sensitivity of primary auditory zzso to the number of sound zzso in the stimulus was modulated by zzso
