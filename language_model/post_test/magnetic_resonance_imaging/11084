This zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study aims to investigate the central representations of Chinese zzso transformation zzso by simultaneously manipulating character frequency and zzso zzso inferior frontal zzso (including zzso area and zzso the left zzso region zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the left zzso junction showed greater zzso especially in zzso conditions, when naming inconsistent characters as compared to consistent zzso These findings suggest that these regions are involved in the zzso conversion of zzso input into zzso codes in naming zzso The similar zzso pattern found in these three regions suggests a distributed process, rather than separate neural routes, for zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the regions involved in Chinese zzso are zzso with the findings for reading zzso scripts and indicate that the zzso mechanisms for zzso transformation is domain universal across different writing zzso
