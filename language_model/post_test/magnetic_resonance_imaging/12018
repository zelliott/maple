The zzso gives a reasonable estimate of zzso size but the confidence limits are zzso and the estimates are unreliable in inferior wall zzso zzso size also can be determined from zzso zzso assessment of left zzso dimensions, wall motion zzso and other characteristics of the left zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, particularly with contrast enhancement, has the greatest potential for zzso
