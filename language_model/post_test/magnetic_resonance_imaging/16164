Silver zzso are an integral part of the management of burn zzso Package zzso assert a lack of zzso and safety with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and recommend removal prior to any zzso zzso although there is no clear evidence to support this zzso zzso removal is associated with increased pain, anxiety, stress, and analgesia zzso This study was to determine whether these products produce zzso image distortion or if the agitation of the silver particles generates enough heat which might produce further skin zzso 

zzso limbs from zzso pigs were used in a zzso zzso scanner with three standard silver wound zzso Images were obtained with both dry and wet zzso zzso was assessed before and during zzso by zzso inserted between the dressing and zzso Images were independently reviewed by a zzso and MR physicist for zzso 

None of the zzso exhibited significant temperature increases nor produced significant distortion that influenced imaging zzso 

Our data suggests silver containing wound zzso do not cause a significant increase in dressing temperature or image distortion and thus their removal is not warranted for clinical zzso zzso
