A projection reconstruction zzso zzso technique is zzso The introduced technique is an extension of a standard projection reconstruction zzso zzso technique allowing for the acquisition of several zzso echoes after each zzso of the spin zzso Each echo train is used for acquiring data of a certain angular segment of zzso By use of echo trains consisting of up to four zzso the overall acquisition time for a zzso image can be reduced to 150 zzso without sacrificing image zzso zzso are presented for cardiac zzso for the zzso of zzso and for the zzso of joint zzso For all investigated applications promising results have been zzso Especially in parts of the body where motion on an even shorter time scale than the acquisition process or significant zzso or zzso flow are within the field of view, the introduced technique appears to be a promising technique for MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
