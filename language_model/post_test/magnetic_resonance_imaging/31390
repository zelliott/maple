For the development of new zzso zzso strategies for zzso cartilage repair, a reliable cell monitoring technique is required to track the cells in zzso zzso and zzso We present a systematic and detailed study on the performance and biological impact of a simple and efficient zzso protocol for human zzso stem cells zzso zzso available very small zzso iron oxide particles zzso were used as magnetic resonance zzso contrast zzso Iron zzso via zzso was confirmed zzso with zzso blue zzso and zzso by mass zzso Compared with zzso cells, zzso did neither influence the viability nor the proliferation potential of zzso Furthermore, iron incorporation did not affect zzso in undergoing zzso zzso or zzso zzso as demonstrated zzso and by gene expression zzso The efficiency of the zzso protocol was assessed with high-resolution MR imaging at zzso zzso zzso were zzso in a collagen type I zzso which is in clinical use for zzso zzso cartilage zzso The presence of zzso zzso was indicated by distinct zzso spots in the MR images, as a result of iron specific loss of signal zzso In zzso this zzso technique has great potential to zzso zzso and track their migration after transplantation for zzso cartilage repair with MR zzso
