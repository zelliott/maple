Previous research has often examined whether the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso represents an anatomical correlate of zzso zzso functions, gathering zzso empirical evidence by comparing zzso asymmetry in subjects with differing zzso zzso or speech zzso Apart from other zzso problems, direct comparisons between studies are hampered by insufficient assessment and consideration of all three potential zzso of structural cerebral zzso Based on zzso assessment of structural zzso zzso Imaging zzso scans of 104 healthy subjects, the present study zzso earlier observations of an overall zzso zzso zzso which was found to prevail irrespective of zzso zzso or zzso ear zzso However, the mean magnitude of this zzso asymmetry was not determined by either one of these factors in itself, but varied depending on their specific zzso A clear correspondence between structural and functional asymmetry was only observed among right-handed zzso In this particular zzso more pronounced structural asymmetry was associated with an enlarged zzso on the left side, while the enhanced zzso asymmetry of female zzso resulted from smaller adjusted volumes of their right zzso The existence of such complex interactions suggests that future research in this area can only be expected to overcome past inconsistencies by adequately considering zzso zzso and speech zzso
