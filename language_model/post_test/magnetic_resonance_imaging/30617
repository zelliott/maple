The aim of our study was to evaluate zzso fusion accuracy depending on three zzso zzso 

An zzso and zzso compatible model was created, consisting of a plastic box, which contained 3 zzso zzso scans were performed with 128 zzso zzso The objects were segmented and zzso reconstructions were zzso A special ultrasound adapter with 3 reflective markers was fixed to the ultrasound zzso Thus, the probe could be tracked by the navigation system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the segmented shape of the zzso obtained from the MR images were zzso onto the ultrasound display zzso Siemens, zzso zzso The dependency of fusion accuracy on different depth of ultrasound display, different distances between probe and objects and different angles between the axis of the ultrasound probe and the zzso of the spheres was zzso 435 single zzso were zzso 

zzso fusion accuracy was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso for spheres and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso If the ultrasound probe was directed more zzso to the surface of the spheres the fusion became increasingly inaccurate zzso Fusion accuracy decreased the more distant the US probe was held to the object zzso Different depth of ultrasound display had no significant effect on fusion zzso 

zzso accurate fusion of MR images and real-time zzso could be zzso However, careful interpretation of the fused data is necessary, when different angles and distances of the US probe to the object are zzso
