To investigate the relationship between prognosis of zzso and zzso damage in the cerebral cortex, we evaluated the distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso with zzso and zzso We performed zzso zzso in six zzso patients zzso from 45 to 75 years; all zzso with unilateral left cerebral zzso Three patients showed signs of zzso zzso and the other three zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso imaging was performed with zzso zzso The regions of interest zzso on both images were set in the cerebral cortex, zzso zzso and zzso area in both zzso Three patients were classified in the mild prognosis group and the other three in the moderate prognosis zzso The left zzso area was more closely concerned with the difference in zzso symptoms than the right one in both zzso and zzso distribution, but the zzso to the zzso ratio zzso zzso in the zzso areas in the zzso distribution was significantly lower in the moderate prognosis group than in the mild prognosis group, although no difference was seen for these values between the two groups in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso imaging, which makes possible an increase in zzso cell viability in the cerebral cortex, is useful not only for clarifying the zzso symptoms but also for evaluating the prognosis of zzso in patients with cerebral zzso
