zzso zzso in headache patients has revolutionized our understanding of these zzso Further insights into the zzso of headache syndromes have been provided by innovative zzso analysis using structural zzso This review highlights the recent advances made in studying migraine using zzso zzso 

Several independent studies have reinforced the crucial role for the zzso in acute and probably also chronic zzso Recently described structural abnormalities in the visual network of zzso areas could account for, or be caused by, the cortical zzso observed in zzso Although data from zzso studies are heterogeneous, a recent study suggests an increased density of zzso structures and decreased zzso matter in zzso areas in migraine zzso 

Given the rapid advances in functional zzso in particular newer techniques such as zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso functional imaging continues to play a significant role and opens new avenues in targeting the neural zzso in individual primary headache zzso
