zzso blood flow in the brain of patients with zzso cell zzso zzso gives rise to disorders in this organ and, occasionally, courses with no clinical zzso 

Our objective was to determine the most common zzso in the brains of patients with zzso in the eastern region of zzso 

We conducted a study with children and adults with zzso who were voluntarily included in the research zzso The 28 adult patients had no history of zzso crises of the central nervous system, and their ages ranged from 17 to 48 zzso In addition, 50 zzso patients between the ages of 2 and 17 years were zzso Images were obtained with the Cuban magnetic resonance imaging equipment zzso 01 at zzso zzso 

Both studies showed that cortical zzso zzso is the most frequent brain zzso among those found in the population of patients zzso The study revealed zzso of patients with silent zzso in adults and zzso in the zzso 

CA is the zzso that is most commonly seen in the population zzso The brain zzso that were found are possibly triggered by the effect of zzso in the blood flow in the zzso A population study must be conducted in order to determine the first disorders triggered by the blocked blood flow in the brains of these zzso There is also a need to evaluate the possible risk factors that zzso the development of these zzso
