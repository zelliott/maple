zzso is a zzso phase 1, randomized, zzso trial of zzso zzso cardiac stem cells zzso in patients with heart failure of zzso zzso undergoing coronary artery bypass zzso zzso In the present study, we report the surgical aspects and interim cardiac magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

A total of 33 patients (20 zzso and 13 control subjects) met final eligibility criteria and were enrolled in zzso zzso were isolated from the right zzso zzso harvested and processed during zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso or surgical zzso In zzso patients, zzso showed a marked increase in both zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 4 and 12 months after zzso infusion, zzso and regional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso decreased after zzso infusion (by manual zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso at 4 months zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso g zzso at 12 months zzso zzso zzso zzso mass decreased even more zzso zzso zzso g zzso at 4 months zzso and zzso zzso zzso g zzso at 12 months zzso whereas zzso viable mass increased zzso zzso zzso g at 4 months after zzso infusion zzso and zzso zzso zzso g at 12 months zzso 

Isolation of zzso from cardiac tissue obtained in the operating room is feasible and does not alter practices during zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso infusion produces a striking improvement in both global and regional zzso function, a reduction in zzso size, and an increase in viable tissue that persist at least 1 year and are consistent with cardiac zzso 

This study is registered with zzso trial number zzso
