We study the image zzso on the basis of locally zzso globally zzso zzso networks zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso the binding of zzso We introduce a lateral potential for each zzso so that only zzso with strong connections from their neighborhood can develop high zzso Based on the concept of the lateral potential, a solution to remove noisy regions in an image is proposed for zzso so that it suppresses the zzso corresponding to noisy regions but without affecting those corresponding to major zzso We show that the resulting zzso network separates an image into several major regions, plus a background consisting of all noisy regions, and we illustrate network properties by computer zzso The network exhibits a natural capacity in zzso zzso The zzso dynamics leads to a computer algorithm, which is applied successfully to zzso real zzso zzso A number of issues regarding biological zzso and zzso organization are zzso We argue that zzso provides a novel and effective framework for image zzso and zzso zzso
