The zzso of verbal stimuli elicits zzso zzso patterns within the zzso zzso zzso in healthy zzso In our study, patients with zzso and zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso were investigated during the zzso and retrieval of zzso associates using functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso asymmetry of zzso patterns in zzso inferior zzso and zzso zzso areas associated with language functions was zzso zzso zzso patterns in patients with zzso were more zzso than those in patients with zzso zzso There were no group differences with respect to zzso in frontal or zzso regions of interest zzso For both groups, frontal cortical zzso patterns were significantly more zzso than zzso patterns zzso For patients with zzso there was a strong trend toward a difference in functional asymmetry between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso A graded effect of zzso activity on zzso of the different regional zzso patterns is zzso
