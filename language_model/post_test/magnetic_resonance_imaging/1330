The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and high-resolution zzso zzso zzso in patients with suspected zzso zzso Twenty-two patients (19 women and three zzso with hyperprolactinemia (N zzso zzso increased growth hormone zzso (N zzso zzso increased zzso zzso (N zzso 1), and zzso zzso (N zzso 3) were studied with both zzso high-resolution CT scanning and zzso zzso zzso examinations consisted of zzso zzso zzso sections during contrast zzso The zzso examinations consisted of zzso zzso and zzso sequences with a zzso slice thickness on the zzso and zzso zzso Fourteen women had similar findings on CT and zzso (four zzso six zzso one wide zzso two empty zzso and one normal zzso The remaining eight subjects had conflicting zzso CT findings were compatible with a zzso in all eight patients, whereas zzso detected one enlarged zzso two empty zzso (one with zzso of the zzso zzso without evidence of zzso and five normal zzso Thus, both studies detected zzso accurately, but CT was frequently unable to diagnose correctly an empty zzso Because patients with possible zzso were not submitted to surgery, the accuracy of either zzso method cannot be assessed at this zzso However, we suggest that zzso is superior to CT because of its inherently greater zzso contrast, which allows clear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso nerves, cavernous zzso and carotid zzso
