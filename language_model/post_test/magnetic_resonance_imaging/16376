To determine whether zzso assessment of pulmonary artery flow zzso by cardiac magnetic resonance zzso would predict pulmonary vascular resistance zzso in patients with zzso heart disease characterized by an unrestricted zzso zzso 

Patients with an unrestricted zzso shunt who are at risk of zzso pulmonary vascular disease require zzso evaluation zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso combines zzso measurement of zzso by phase contrast imaging with invasive pressure measurement to accurately determine the zzso 

Patients referred for clinical assessment of the zzso were zzso The zzso was used to determine the zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso shunt zzso were compared with the zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso was undertaken in 26 patients zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso flow was zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso Mean pulmonary artery pressure was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Woods Units zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso was related to both zzso and zzso in an inverse exponential fashion by the zzso zzso equations zzso zzso zzso - zzso and zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso characteristic zzso analysis was used to determine zzso values for zzso and zzso above which the zzso could be regarded as clinically zzso A zzso of zzso or zzso zzso predicted a zzso of zzso or zzso zzso with sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and area under the zzso curve zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso or zzso predicted a zzso of zzso or zzso zzso with sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and area under the curve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso or zzso shunt zzso by zzso has potential to predict the zzso in patients with an unrestricted zzso shunt and could potentially determine zzso without having to undertake invasive zzso
