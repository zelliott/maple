zzso output was measured by gated magnetic resonance imaging zzso and by zzso in four zzso zzso The entire heart was examined in zzso slices at zzso and zzso in a plane parallel to the zzso zzso Each set of images was analyzed for chamber volume using a custom computer program to evaluate each zzso No geometric assumptions were zzso zzso output was calculated for right and left zzso and compared with the zzso zzso We found that the cardiac output of the right zzso compared well with that of the left zzso and that both fell within the range measured by zzso zzso zzso has the potential to assess the cardiac output of both the right and left zzso zzso between right zzso and left zzso function will permit zzso of left to right zzso or unilateral zzso volume zzso
