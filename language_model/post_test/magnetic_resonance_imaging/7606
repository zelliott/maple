The zzso plays a major role in the cardiovascular system and its function and structure are primarily affected by aging, eating habits, life style and other cardiovascular risk factors, inducing increased zzso which is associated with cardiovascular and cerebral zzso Our objective was to develop and validate a robust zzso one-dimensional wave propagation zzso model of the descending zzso This model with a zzso area, zzso and pressure zzso is built using geometric and zzso data measured on a specific person and is validated against in zzso data acquired on the same subject at three distinct anatomical locations along the zzso zzso We studied seven healthy volunteers, who underwent carotid zzso zzso and zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso zzso of our model in terms of changes in central pressure zzso with zzso zzso were consistent with previously described zzso zzso zzso validation averaged over the three descending zzso locations and the seven subjects provided low zzso errors zzso in percentage of the zzso clinical zzso between simulated and zzso data, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow rate: zzso Finally, we also found low zzso zzso when comparing simulated pressure in the zzso zzso location against zzso carotid pressure zzso In conclusion, this simple model performs similar to more complex models of the entire systemic zzso tree at a fraction of the cost, and could be of major usefulness in the zzso and local zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
