zzso patients with suspected zzso tumors were evaluated zzso with MR imaging at zzso zzso MR detected a zzso at its correct location in all eight patients who underwent zzso surgery, while CT showed a focal zzso in the correct location in only four of the eight zzso In patients who were clinically and zzso considered to harbor a zzso MR detected a focal zzso signal zzso in zzso and CT demonstrated a focal density zzso in zzso zzso zzso focal zzso zzso and zzso zzso were seen equally well with CT and zzso MR imaging protocol included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Although zzso images were superior in detecting focal zzso zzso some zzso were better seen on zzso zzso zzso zzso images showed focal zzso zzso better than zzso images zzso Our technique demonstrates zzso superior sensitivity to CT in detecting a zzso zzso
