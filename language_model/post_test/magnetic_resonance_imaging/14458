Eight patients with zzso zzso of the third zzso were examined with CT and zzso In six, surgical zzso was performed and the material was subjected to zzso zzso the zzso of trace elements were determined by zzso X-ray zzso zzso aspiration was performed in zzso The investigation showed that zzso zzso are often zzso or zzso relative to brain on CT zzso but sometimes have a center of increased zzso Increased density did not correlate with increased concentration of calcium or other metals but did not correlate with high cholesterol zzso zzso zzso appear more zzso on MR zzso than on CT zzso despite a homogeneous appearance at zzso High signal on short zzso sequences is correlated with a high cholesterol zzso A marked zzso of the zzso relaxation time is often noticed in the central part of the zzso Analysis of trace elements showed that this phenomenon is not related to the presence of metals with zzso zzso Our analysis of the contents of zzso zzso does not support the theory that differing metallic zzso are responsible for differences in MR signal intensity or CT zzso We did find that increased CT density and high MR signal correlated with high cholesterol zzso
