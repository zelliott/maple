To assess the potential use of sodium magnetic resonance zzso imaging of cartilage, with and without fluid suppression by using an zzso pulse, for zzso subjects with versus subjects without zzso at zzso zzso 

The study was approved by the institutional review board and was zzso with zzso The knee cartilage of 19 zzso zzso subjects) and 28 symptomatic zzso zzso subjects underwent zzso sodium MR imaging with use of two different zzso one without fluid suppression zzso three-dimensional zzso and one with fluid suppression zzso recovery zzso zzso uniform rate and smooth zzso zzso zzso suppression was obtained by using zzso with an zzso inversion pulse zzso zzso Mean sodium zzso and their standard zzso were measured in the zzso zzso zzso and lateral cartilage regions over four consecutive sections for each zzso The zzso zzso zzso and average means and standard zzso were calculated over all zzso for each zzso The utility of these measures in the detection of zzso was evaluated by using zzso zzso and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso correction was applied to the P values obtained with zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso were found to be significant zzso of all zzso zzso score of zzso and early zzso zzso score of 1 or zzso The minimum standard zzso provided the highest zzso zzso with the highest accuracy zzso sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso for both all zzso and early zzso zzso 

zzso sodium MR imaging at zzso T with fluid suppression by using zzso zzso is a potential zzso for zzso
