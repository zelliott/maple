The purpose of this article is to review some of the basic principles of imaging and how zzso zzso artifacts originate in MR zzso We will describe common ways to reduce or modify artifacts using readily available imaging techniques, and we will discuss some advanced methods to correct zzso and zzso zzso 

The presence of metallic implants in zzso can cause substantial image artifacts, including signal loss, failure of fat suppression, geometric zzso and bright zzso zzso These cause large resonant frequency changes and failure of many zzso zzso zzso zzso and pulse sequence selections can avoid or reduce artifacts, although more advanced imaging methods offer further imaging zzso
