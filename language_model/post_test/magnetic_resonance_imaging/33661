The purpose of this report is to describe our initial experience with techniques employing magnetic resonance imaging zzso to guide the choice of muscle to be zzso in patients suspected of having inflammatory zzso Five patients with a clinical diagnosis of inflammatory zzso zzso were zzso Four were zzso prior to zzso Four had repeated zzso either immediately following biopsy or to evaluate disease zzso Use of zzso to zzso muscle zzso was associated with abnormal zzso findings in all cases, including zzso demonstration of zzso zzso in three cases of idiopathic zzso zzso zzso changes were seen in one patient with probable zzso and in one patient with chronic inflammatory zzso and high serum zzso zzso levels zzso 45,000 zzso The precise location of the area sampled by biopsy was visible in only one of four zzso zzso zzso shows promise in identifying zzso muscle in patients suspected of having one of the inflammatory zzso however, further refinement of zzso techniques may be needed to zzso zzso zzso
