Prospective zzso study of zzso tears, diagnosed by a high-intensity zone within the zzso on zzso spine magnetic resonance imaging, and correlation with the clinical zzso 

To assess the prevalence of high-intensity zones in patients who are investigated for back and leg pain and to determine whether there are clinical features that can be used for diagnosis of the presence of a high-intensity zzso 

zzso in previous studies have shown that the presence of a high-intensity zone is associated with reproduction of a patient's pain on stress zzso zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be associated with back pain, but to date, no study has correlated the presence of a high-intensity zone with the clinical zzso 

The zzso spine magnetic resonance images in 156 patients in whom back and leg pain were investigated were analyzed for the presence and appearances of high-intensity zzso The clinical features of those patients with a high-intensity zone but with no evidence of neural zzso on magnetic resonance imaging were analyzed by zzso test and zzso zzso 

A high-intensity zone occurred in patients at a prevalence of zzso and usually occurred zzso zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso There were no features within the history, functional disability zzso or physical examination that aided in a clinical diagnosis of those patients with a high-intensity zzso 

A high-intensity zone is a common finding in patients in whom low back and leg pain are investigated, but the presence of a high-intensity zone does not define a group of patients with particular clinical zzso
