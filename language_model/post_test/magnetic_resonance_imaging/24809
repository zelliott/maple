Surgery for zzso spinal zzso zzso is today the most frequently performed procedure in the adult zzso zzso zzso benefit of surgery for zzso is well documented both in zzso and in zzso zzso In this paper, we present the results from zzso as an alternative surgical approach, which have theoretical advantages over other zzso In this study, we wanted to study the clinical and zzso results of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an objective method to zzso the degree of central zzso in the spinal canal, and was used to measure whether we were able to achieve an adequate zzso of the spinal canal with zzso as a surgical zzso 

All patients operated on with this approach zzso in the period 1 January 2008 to 31 March 2009 were included in the zzso All zzso complications were zzso Clinical results were measured by means of a zzso The patients that agreed to attend the study had an zzso taken of the operated zzso zzso before and after surgery of the actual level were measured by three zzso We then performed a correlation test between increase of area and clinical zzso We also tested for zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso There were zzso zzso none of them were life-threatening or zzso 46 patients attended the study and answered the zzso Thirty-four patients zzso reported clinical improvement, whereas six zzso patients reported no improvement, and two zzso patients reported that they were zzso Mean zzso was zzso Mean zzso was zzso Mean zzso for zzso was zzso and mean zzso for zzso was zzso Mean zzso were measured to 80 zzso before surgery and 161 zzso after zzso That gave an increase of zzso of 81 zzso zzso We found a significant positive correlation between increase of area and clinical zzso We also found consistent zzso and zzso zzso 

In this study, the clinical results of zzso were good, and comparable with other reports for zzso The rates of complications are also comparable with other reports in spinal zzso A significant increase in the spinal canal diameter was zzso Within the limitations a retrospective study zzso we conclude that zzso seems to be a safe and effective surgical approach for significant zzso the adult central spinal canal, and measurement of zzso before and after surgery seems to be a good way to zzso the degree of zzso
