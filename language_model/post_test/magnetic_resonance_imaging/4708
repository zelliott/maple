One hundred zzso patients with zzso disease were examined in the past 13 zzso Of these 45 were examined 3 or more times over a zzso exceeding one year and all such patients are included in this zzso Adult patients showed little progression of zzso There were few zzso in the blood counts, no increase in size of liver and zzso and changes in skeletal zzso were largely confined to pre-existing zzso Some children appeared to have more progressive disease, but since many of the children in this study were treated with zzso it is difficult to draw conclusions about the natural progression of the disease at earlier zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in gradual zzso of blood counts, decrease in the size of liver and zzso and parallel decreases in the serum zzso converting zzso and zzso zzso zzso symptoms were decreased in all patients, and skeletal zzso showed modest improvement in patients treated for two years or zzso The response of patients to low zzso frequency zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso 30 zzso therapy was indistinguishable from the response observed and previously reported by others with much larger zzso zzso the dosage from 30 zzso to 120 zzso was not attended by any significant changes in zzso zzso for the selection of patients for treatment with zzso are zzso We suggest that a starting dose of 15 to 30 zzso zzso 3 times weekly be used for all patients, regardless of severity or site of involvement, and that upward dosage adjustments be made only in such rare patients who may not respond adequately to this dose in 6 to 12 zzso
