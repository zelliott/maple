Silicon stabilized zzso zzso zzso is formed within the calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso system when a zzso zzso of zzso is fired at 1,000 degrees in the presence of zzso This paper proposes a composition range and zzso structure for zzso zzso zzso powder zzso transmission electron zzso infrared and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso show that zzso zzso is associated with the displacement of OH from an initial zzso zzso The resulting calcium zzso is modified by the incorporation of silicon into its structure with excess zzso contributing to an zzso zzso zzso has a zzso structure with a space group zzso akin to zzso with estimated lattice zzso of zzso A, zzso zzso A, zzso A, zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso zzso for zzso the zzso lattice with the average chemical composition of zzso set primarily by the mechanisms available for charge zzso While the formation of OH vacancies in zzso zzso the transformation to zzso two mechanisms of charge compensation in the zzso structure are zzso If zzso vacancies provide charge compensation, the composition of zzso is zzso derived for the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso If excess zzso zzso the composition is zzso derived for the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso The reaction occurs most effectively when zzso is added as a zzso suspension rather than by the zzso zzso decomposition of a silicon zzso zzso The material is a zzso of major biological interest because of its zzso and unique influence on skeletal tissue repair and zzso
