zzso chemotherapy for zzso liver zzso zzso reduces the accuracy of liver imaging which may zzso patients zzso zzso review of a prospective database to determine whether zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso prior to zzso chemotherapy affects zzso recurrence and long-term outcome after zzso 

Between 2003 and 2009, 242 patients with zzso underwent a zzso after zzso cycles of zzso or zzso zzso All had a zzso zzso immediately zzso The outcome of patients who had a zzso zzso prior to chemotherapy zzso group, zzso zzso was compared with those who did not zzso group, zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso changed the staging in zzso of zzso At a median zzso follow-up of 55 zzso months, there was a higher zzso of zzso recurrence at a new site in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group, zzso zzso and an increased rate of recurrence in patients with the same number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso group underwent more repeat zzso than the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso achieving similar long-term zzso 

A zzso zzso prior to chemotherapy reduces zzso recurrence and avoids a repeat zzso
