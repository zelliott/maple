The transplantation of primary human zzso is a promising approach in the treatment of specific liver zzso However, little is known about the fate of the cells following zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso could enable real-time tracking and long-term detection of transplanted zzso The use of zzso iron oxide particles as cellular contrast agents should allow for the zzso detection of zzso cells on high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso zzso were performed on primary human zzso to transfer the method of detecting zzso cells via clinical zzso into human zzso zzso For zzso zzso modified zzso zzso zzso particles were zzso zzso were investigated via a clinical MR scanner at zzso zzso and the particle zzso within single zzso was estimated using microscopic zzso The zzso primary human zzso were clearly zzso by zzso proving the feasibility of this new zzso zzso this method is a useful tool to investigate the effects of human zzso transplantation and to improve safety aspects of this zzso
