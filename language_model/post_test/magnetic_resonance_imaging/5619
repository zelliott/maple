The aim of this study was to characterize the magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in chronic zzso zzso zzso patients and to study whether the findings are associated with zzso exposure zzso 

The brain zzso scans of 71 zzso patients were independently re-evaluated and rated by two experienced zzso All the work tasks were analyzed and the chemical composition of lifetime exposure was zzso 

The zzso scans of zzso zzso patients zzso were classified as zzso Brain zzso in any brain area was found in zzso zzso patients zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso patients zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso was associated with the duration of exposure in years, and zzso zzso was associated with alcohol zzso zzso and zzso zzso were related to zzso 

Slight brain zzso is associated with zzso and there is a correlation between brain zzso and the duration of exposure in zzso However, all the zzso findings in zzso are zzso and thus zzso is useful mainly in the differential diagnosis of zzso
