zzso of dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging are increasing and require both high spatial resolution and high zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso contrast in particular require very high zzso zzso The sliding window reconstruction is a technique for increasing zzso zzso It has previously been applied to zzso and spiral zzso but these schemes require extensive correction and zzso during image zzso zzso raw data can be reconstructed simply and quickly using the fast zzso transform zzso This paper presents a new zzso sampling scheme and sliding window reconstruction that zzso fast scanning without needing correction or zzso This technique can be used on virtually any MR scanner since it requires no specialized zzso It is implemented here as a dual zzso echo sequence providing simultaneous zzso and zzso images with a time resolution of zzso zzso
