zzso zzso research provides detailed observations of the response patterns that natural sounds zzso human voices and speech, animal cries, environmental zzso evoke in the human zzso The zzso and zzso mechanisms underlying these zzso however, remain largely zzso Here we combine high spatial resolution (3 and 7 zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso modeling to reveal how natural sounds are represented in the human zzso We compare competing models of sound representations and select the model that most accurately predicts zzso response patterns to natural zzso Our results show that the cortical zzso of natural sounds zzso the formation of multiple representations of sound zzso with different degrees of spectral and zzso zzso The zzso derives these zzso representations through zzso neural processing channels and through the combined analysis of the spectral and zzso zzso in the zzso Furthermore, our findings suggest that a zzso resolution zzso may govern the zzso tuning of zzso populations throughout the auditory zzso Specifically, our zzso results suggest that zzso populations in zzso auditory regions preferably zzso coarse spectral information with high zzso zzso zzso zzso populations in zzso auditory regions preferably zzso zzso spectral information with low zzso zzso We propose that such a zzso analysis may be zzso relevant for flexible and zzso sound processing and may constitute one of the zzso zzso of functional specialization in auditory zzso
