To evaluate zzso and zzso zzso in gross tumor volume definition for adult zzso soft tissue zzso 

Imaging studies of 15 patients previously treated with zzso radiation were used in this zzso Five physicians zzso zzso orthopedic surgeons and a musculoskeletal zzso were asked to zzso each of the 15 tumors on zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso These contours were drawn twice by each zzso The volume and center of mass coordinates for each gross tumor volume were extracted and a zzso analysis was performed to measure the degree of volume zzso 

The median standard zzso in gross tumor volumes across observers was zzso of the average volume zzso zzso There was remarkably little variation in the zzso position of the gross tumor volume center of zzso For the 15 patients, the standard zzso of the zzso distance between centers of mass ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso to zzso of the gross tumor volume was common to all observers zzso zzso zzso The standard zzso in gross tumor volumes on repeat zzso was zzso zzso zzso with a standard zzso change in the position of the center of mass of zzso zzso zzso and a median overlap of zzso zzso zzso 

Although significant zzso differences were seen in gross tumor volume definition of adult zzso zzso the center of mass of these volumes was remarkably zzso Variations in volume definition did not correlate with tumor zzso zzso zzso should not hesitate to review their contours with a colleague zzso zzso or fellow radiation zzso to ensure that they are not zzso in zzso gross tumor volume zzso zzso should take into account variations in volume definition when considering tighter clinical target zzso
