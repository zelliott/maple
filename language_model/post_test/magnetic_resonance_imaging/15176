To evaluate the utility of easy zzso imaging system zzso in 27 diffuse zzso injury zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were examined with an magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso sequence and with zzso zzso women, 20 zzso age range, zzso years; median age: zzso zzso In this investigation, we excluded patients who exhibited complications such as acute zzso zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso or brain zzso We examined the zzso tests and correlated with findings from zzso Furthermore, we evaluated the degree of zzso enlargement in the zzso zzso index zzso Patients were divided into two groups: the enlargement group zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso and the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso All of the patients showed cognitive deficits as observed from the zzso test zzso Fifteen out of 27 patients by zzso zzso weighted images and fluid attenuated inversion recovery zzso 22 out of 27 patients by zzso zzso weighted images and 24 out of 27 patients by zzso showed abnormal zzso In zzso zzso weighted imaging, the white matter from the frontal zzso corpus zzso and zzso showed abnormal zzso With zzso 22 patients zzso showed blood flow degradation in the frontal zzso and 12 patients zzso in zzso zzso In the enlargement group, zzso Independence zzso zzso State zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Trail Making zzso zzso and zzso of Miyake zzso Test were significantly zzso zzso 12 patients without zzso enlargement who had no abnormal findings in zzso zzso weighted images and zzso abnormal findings were zzso in seven patients with zzso zzso weighted imaging and to 10 patients with zzso zzso of the zzso examination alone cannot fully explain zzso frontal lobe zzso However, addition of the zzso analysis derived from the single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data enabled us to understand regions where blood flow was zzso zzso where zzso functions conceivably might be zzso
