Neurological function in patients with slowly growing brain tumors can be preserved even after extensive tumor zzso However, the global process of cortical zzso and cerebral zzso cannot be understood without taking into account the white matter zzso The aim of this study was to predict the functional consequences of zzso white matter damage by computer zzso A zzso model was proposed, incorporating two cortical patches and the white matter connections of the zzso zzso zzso structural changes were modeled such that different aspects of the connectivity were altered, mimicking the biological zzso of zzso The network performance was zzso by comparing memory pattern recall and the plastic zzso capacity of the network was zzso The model predicts an optimal level of synaptic zzso boost that compensates for zzso connectivity zzso zzso density appears to change the optimal plasticity regime, but tumor size does zzso zzso zzso values that are too high lead to performance loss in the network and eventually to zzso zzso zzso of different zzso show differences in memory recall performance with slightly lower plasticity values for dense tumors compared to more diffuse zzso zzso results also suggest an optimal noise level that is capable of increasing the recall performance in zzso white matter zzso In conclusion, the model presented here is able to capture the influence of different zzso parameters on memory pattern recall decline and provides a new way to study the functional consequences of white matter invasion by slowly growing brain zzso
