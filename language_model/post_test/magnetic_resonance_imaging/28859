We combined information from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso to assess which cortical areas and in which zzso order show zzso zzso after right median nerve zzso Five healthy subjects were studied with the two imaging zzso which both revealed significant zzso in the zzso and zzso primary zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso areas, the walls of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso supplementary motor area zzso In zzso two separate zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso were zzso one zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and one zzso near the zzso or frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sites from zzso were used to zzso the solution of the inverse problem of zzso which allowed us to construct a model of the zzso sequence of zzso of the different zzso According to this model, the mean onset zzso for significant zzso at the zzso zzso was 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso at 23 zzso zzso 21-25 zzso The zzso PO was activated at 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso became active at 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso became activated at zzso zzso We conclude that zzso provides a useful means to zzso the inverse problem of zzso allowing the construction of zzso models of cortical zzso which may have significant implications for the understanding of cortical network zzso
