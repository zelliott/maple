zzso relatives of persons with schizophrenia carry elevated genetic risk for the illness and show deficits on zzso information processing zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to test whether zzso relatives show altered functional zzso in the prefrontal zzso zzso thalamus, zzso and anterior zzso during a working memory task requiring interference zzso 

Twelve zzso relatives of persons with schizophrenia and 12 healthy control subjects were administered an zzso verbal working memory version of the Continuous Performance Test during zzso An zzso zzso zzso sequence (15 contiguous, zzso zzso zzso was acquired on a full-body MR zzso Data were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with control subjects, relatives showed greater zzso zzso in the zzso and the anterior and zzso zzso When task performance was controlled, relatives showed significantly greater zzso in the anterior zzso When effects of other potentially zzso variables were controlled, relatives generally showed significantly greater zzso in the zzso zzso and anterior zzso 

This pilot study suggests that relatives of persons with schizophrenia have subtle differences in brain function in the absence of zzso These differences add to the growing literature identifying zzso vulnerabilities to zzso
