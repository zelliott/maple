Memory performance is the result of many distinct mental zzso such as memory zzso zzso and zzso of memory strength by emotional zzso These zzso which are zzso by partly distinct molecular profiles, are not always amenable to direct zzso zzso zzso models can be used to make zzso about specific mental processes and to study their genetic zzso Here we combined a zzso zzso analysis of zzso processes with high density genetic information derived from a zzso study in healthy young zzso After identifying the zzso model for a verbal memory task and zzso the zzso individual cognitive zzso we found a common zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso protein 2 zzso that was related to the model zzso reflecting zzso of verbal memory strength by negative zzso We also observed an association between the same genetic zzso and a similar emotional zzso zzso in a different population performing a picture memory zzso Furthermore, using functional zzso we found robust zzso differences in activity of the zzso zzso that were specifically related to successful memory zzso of negative versus neutral zzso Finally, we analyzed cortical gene expression data of 193 deceased subjects and detected significant zzso zzso differences in zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso of specific cognitive parameters can improve the understanding of genetic zzso of human learning and zzso
