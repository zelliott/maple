Juvenile zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of zzso It belongs to the zzso storage diseases, which manifest with loss of vision, seizures, and loss of cognitive and motor functions, and lead to premature zzso Imaging studies have shown cerebral and zzso zzso yet no previous studies evaluating particularly zzso zzso have been zzso This study evaluates the zzso volumes in adolescent juvenile zzso zzso zzso patients in a controlled zzso follow-up magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso volumes of eight patients (three female, five zzso and 10 healthy zzso and zzso control subjects were measured from two repeated magnetic resonance imaging zzso Three male patients did not have controls and were excluded from the zzso In the patient group, the first examination was performed at the mean age of zzso years and the second examination at the mean age of zzso zzso In the control group, the mean ages at the time of examinations were zzso years and zzso zzso 

Progressive zzso zzso was found in the patient zzso The mean total zzso volume decreased by zzso zzso during the zzso follow-up in the patient group, which zzso to a zzso annual rate of volume zzso The whole brain volume decreased by zzso per zzso The observed annual rate of zzso zzso also exceeded the previously reported zzso annual loss of total gray matter volume in juvenile zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest that progressive zzso zzso is one of the characteristic features of brain zzso in juvenile zzso zzso zzso in zzso
