zzso estimates of cerebral zzso properties, zzso cortical zzso are pivotal to studies of normal and pathological brain zzso These measures are based on automated or manual zzso procedures, which zzso the tissue contrast between gray and white matter on zzso MR zzso zzso contrast is unlikely to remain a constant property across groups of different age and zzso An important question is therefore how the sensitivity of cortical thickness estimates is influenced by zzso in zzso zzso The effect of adjusting for zzso in zzso contrast on age sensitivity of cortical thickness was tested in zzso healthy subjects from six different samples, enabling evaluation of consistency of effects within and between sites and zzso Further, the influence of Alzheimer's disease zzso diagnosis on cortical thickness with and without correction for contrast was tested in an additional sample of 96 zzso In healthy controls, regional increases in the sensitivity of the cortical thickness measure to age were found after correcting for zzso Across samples, the strongest effects were observed in zzso lateral zzso and zzso zzso Controlling for contrast zzso also increased the cortical thickness zzso sensitivity to zzso thus replicating the finding in an independent clinical zzso The results showed increased sensitivity of cortical estimates to zzso in areas earlier reported to be compromised in zzso including zzso zzso inferior and superior zzso zzso In sum, the findings indicate that adjusting for contrast can increase the sensitivity of MR zzso to variables of zzso
