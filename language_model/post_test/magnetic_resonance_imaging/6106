Changes of functional connectivity network of human zzso in different brain activity was investigated by combining spatial independent component analysis with zzso zzso First, zzso was localized by performing spatial independent component analysis on the data from block design visual motion zzso then low frequency correlations between zzso and other regions were zzso in two steady states zzso state and the state with continuous visual motion zzso to detect the functional connectivity zzso The results of experiment zzso The functional connectivity network of zzso was more extensive and was consistent with the known anatomical connectivity during zzso when subjects were viewing motion, the network was limited in the visual cortex, suggesting that zzso was acting in concert with a network specific to the visual motion processing zzso
