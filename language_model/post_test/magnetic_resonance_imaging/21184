The aim of this study was to compare fully quantitative cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reserve zzso zzso in patients with coronary artery disease zzso 

Absolute zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with PET have proven diagnostic and zzso roles in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging has been established more recently and has been validated against PET in normal zzso However, there are no studies comparing fully quantitative zzso against PET zzso imaging in patients with zzso 

zzso patients with known or suspected zzso zzso underwent quantitative zzso PET and zzso zzso imaging before coronary zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso correlated well with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the 2 lowest scoring segments in each coronary territory also correlated strongly zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Absolute zzso zzso values correlated significantly, but zzso with PET values both at rest zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and during stress zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Area under the zzso characteristic curve for zzso to detect significant zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and for zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso An zzso zzso predicted significant zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso and zzso zzso predicted significant zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

There is good correlation between zzso and zzso For the detection of significant zzso zzso and zzso seem comparable and very zzso However, absolute zzso values from PET and zzso are only zzso zzso therefore, although quantitative zzso is clinically useful, further refinements are still zzso
