Signal zzso of the zzso zzso were measured on zzso zzso MR images of 25 patients younger than 20 years zzso We found that the signal zzso in the eight patients who were 8 weeks old or younger were higher (shorter zzso than those in the 17 older zzso We also noted a difference in the signal zzso across the zzso zzso the signal being higher in the zzso part of the zzso than in the anterior zzso We attribute the high signal zzso to the rapid zzso zzso growth, so that at term zzso protein synthetic activity is at a zzso zzso an increase in the bound fraction of the water molecules of the zzso may also be present in the zzso zzso as compared with the older zzso but this remains to be zzso The higher signal in the zzso zzso zzso may be due to zzso in the zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso
