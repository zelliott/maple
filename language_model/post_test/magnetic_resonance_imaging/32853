To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the knee for zzso tear detection and zzso 

We zzso assessed zzso MR images of 58 patients (41 zzso 17 zzso age range zzso zzso with zzso confirmed zzso zzso First, we evaluated the performance of the zzso and zzso zzso MR images for the diagnosis of zzso zzso Second, we compared the correlation of tear types presumed from zzso and zzso zzso with zzso and tear zzso from zzso zzso Tears were classified on the zzso plane and the zzso plane zzso The diagnostic performance and tear zzso were compared statistically with zzso results, which is accepted as the standard of zzso 

8 of 58 patients were removed from the study group because they had complex or degenerative zzso A total of 62 tears were detected with zzso in 50 zzso On the zzso images, sensitivity and specificity values were zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso tears and zzso and zzso respectively, for lateral zzso zzso The corresponding values for zzso images were zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso tears and zzso and zzso respectively, for lateral zzso zzso There was no significant difference in tear zzso between the zzso results and the zzso zzso zzso zzso results zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso increases the sensitivity and specificity of zzso tear detection and especially zzso which is important for surgical procedure zzso
