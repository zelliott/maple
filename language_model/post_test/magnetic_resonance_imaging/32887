The zzso zzso trial has shown that the addition of ultrasound or zzso to zzso screening detects more breast zzso in women with dense breasts and at least one other breast cancer risk zzso This higher detection yield is accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso Unfortunately, this study was not zzso into groups with and without the addition of ultrasound and zzso It is therefore impossible to investigate if the improved detection rate also results in a smaller number of zzso zzso which would be the best indication of the ultimate goal - a decrease in breast cancer zzso Before any new and costly imaging is added to the breast cancer screening program, it is necessary to investigate if this will not merely increase the detection of zzso zzso If additional imaging is implemented too hastily it will be hard to turn it back, and impossible to assess it in a zzso zzso
