Although there is evidence for strong connectivity between the zzso and the visual zzso and some evidence for reduced zzso lobe gray matter volume in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder zzso few studies have directly examined the effects of zzso on zzso zzso The current study used functional and structural zzso to examine zzso zzso function and structure in male combat veterans with and without zzso Left zzso gray matter volume was reduced in zzso patients relative to the controls and correlated zzso with the severity of zzso zzso zzso activity in the lateral zzso complex to aversive and nonaversive pictures presented in novel and repeated presentations was not altered by zzso These findings suggest that zzso adversely affects zzso lobe volume but not the zzso of the lateral zzso complex to generally zzso trauma zzso zzso
