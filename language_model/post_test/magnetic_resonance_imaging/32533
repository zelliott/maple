zzso is a visual disorder starting at early childhood and characterized by reduced visual acuity not of optical origin or due to any eye zzso One expression of such an anomalous early visual experience is abnormal zzso zzso In a previous zzso study, faces that were presented to zzso eyes evoked little response compared to houses in zzso visual zzso Patients also demonstrated reduced recognition of facial zzso raising the possibility that these zzso abnormalities are related to zzso vision zzso Whether this deficit originates in low-level processing or is zzso by compromised zzso in zzso visual areas is zzso In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study, we explored the impact of zzso on the representation of object images presented in zzso biased central versus peripheral zzso zzso through manipulation of object zzso Small and large pictures were correlated to visual zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In low-level visual areas, the zzso eye showed significantly reduced zzso for centrally placed, small pictures than the sound eye, while zzso to large pictures was only slightly zzso Similarly, in zzso visual areas, the zzso eye showed marked reduction in zzso in the zzso zzso with normal zzso in the collateral zzso The zzso zzso zzso outcomes of this study support a zzso nature of the zzso effect observed in zzso visual zzso Taken together, these findings point to the regional extent and functional selectivity of zzso cortical reorganization that is related to abnormal visual development of one zzso
