Task performance often improves when tasks can be prepared in zzso However, the mechanisms that support advance preparation are highly zzso zzso under the hypothesis that zzso neural zzso during advance preparation is the hallmark of controlled processing, this study investigates the behavioral and neural effects of component preparation during zzso Toward this end, zzso was used to observe neural activity during preparation of response rules zzso zzso compared to preparation of stimulus set zzso zzso We predicted that zzso zzso would be observed for zzso and zzso switching when component preparation was isolated from zzso zzso The results indicated that preparation for both tasks was supported by common regions of zzso however preparation for switches of response rule was supported by zzso zzso of the anterior zzso zzso and left lateral prefrontal zzso zzso zzso was also eradicated in this condition with enough preparation time, and was associated with an increase in zzso zzso zzso of stimulus set were not marked by specific neural activity during the preparation zzso While the amount of preparation time affected overall performance, zzso task switches did not benefit more from preparation time than task zzso It was concluded that response rules can be reconfigured zzso due to the support of zzso zzso where preparation of stimulus sets is supported by a general type of zzso common to both zzso
