To determine efficacy of zzso zzso on total body iron and liver iron concentration zzso as estimated by serum zzso zzso and liver zzso zzso 

Thirty patients had baseline zzso zzso of the liver performed to determine zzso before starting zzso therapy and classified as normal zzso milliseconds zzso mild zzso zzso moderate zzso zzso and severe iron overload zzso zzso zzso was given zzso zzso The serum zzso zzso level was estimated every 3 zzso Liver iron is expressed as liver zzso The primary end point of the study was to determine change in zzso and liver zzso zzso values after 18 zzso of zzso 

All 30 patients had some degree of liver iron zzso 11 zzso zzso had zzso 15 zzso zzso had moderate while 4 zzso zzso had mild zzso The zzso therapy median zzso of all was zzso zzso zzso zzso and median liver zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso After 18 zzso zzso dropped significantly to a median of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while median liver zzso decreased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso which was not significant zzso 

zzso zzso at the doses used decreases total body iron, but does not significantly decrease liver zzso It is well tolerated by Indian zzso patients, with observed side effects including zzso zzso and transient zzso zzso zzso (and derived zzso can serve as useful method in non invasive monitoring of zzso in zzso patient zzso
