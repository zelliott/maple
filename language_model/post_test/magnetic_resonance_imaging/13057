zzso data, as obtained from zzso zzso techniques, is frequently transformed to a template brain space for pooling data across the zzso This transformation is often performed via an intermediate magnetic resonance image zzso of the zzso brain that is first registered to the template brain zzso However, in many instances, it is difficult, expensive or zzso to acquire zzso and since reconstructed functional data is lower resolution, the full information in zzso is not required for zzso We present here two alternative options for computing the transformation of functional data to a common template zzso These alternatives zzso the registration based on external landmarks placed on the head, and the external shape of the head, features that are considerably simpler and inexpensive to acquire than zzso We present zzso of the accuracy of using these alternative features for zzso and show that they give accuracy for functional data registration that is sufficient given the functional data resolution, and is comparable to existing methods that are commonly zzso
