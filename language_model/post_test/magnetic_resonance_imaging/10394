zzso zzso delay zzso is a common disorder in preschool and school-age zzso Conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso usually does not disclose zzso but a zzso delay is suspected as zzso or associated zzso zzso is a surrogate marker of zzso integrity but also of zzso zzso The goal of our study is to determine whether magnetic resonance zzso zzso is able to detect zzso in the white matter supporting the hypothesis of delayed zzso in children with zzso and normal zzso 

In this zzso study, we enrolled 12 consecutive children meeting the criteria if zzso and aged between 3 and 12 years zzso zzso zzso and 11 healthy children as control group zzso age zzso range zzso zzso on whom we performed conventional zzso and zzso We did not include children with abnormal zzso Single zzso (8 zzso was placed in the white matter of the left zzso zzso The mode of acquisition was zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso milliseconds and a TE of 30 zzso We measured the zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso y zzso zzso and ratios of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso 

In children with zzso we found a significant decrease of the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in relation to zzso The mean zzso ratio in zzso children was zzso zzso zzso and in controls it was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 21, P zzso zzso No differences were seen in the remaining zzso 

The lower zzso ratio in children with zzso in relation to controls may be a promising marker of this disorder and supports the hypothesis of delayed zzso MRS can provide important information in children with zzso zzso
