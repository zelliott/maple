We investigated the role of collagen in the zzso transfer zzso effect in contrast to other zzso By means of zzso made of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR parameters have been zzso in order to reduce the acquisition time and improve the sensitivity, as well as to minimize the contributions from zzso and zzso to the zzso induced signal zzso The same method was used to study cartilage ex zzso zzso zzso and zzso cartilage plugs) and in zzso zzso knee zzso zzso In phantom samples, the zzso signal zzso depended on the collagen concentration while contributions from the other zzso were found to be zzso In average, analysis of zzso images revealed a approximately zzso approximately zzso and approximately zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso type I collagen gels, cartilage plugs, and cartilage from the zzso areas of the goat knee, zzso zzso data revealed that treatment of cartilage plugs with bacterial zzso led to collagen depletion and zzso to a decrease of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso loss in cartilage plugs did not alter the zzso zzso A significant correlation was observed between the collagen content in these plugs and their respective zzso ratios and the rate constant k for the exchange process bound versus free zzso Finally, data obtained from in zzso zzso measurement of the goat knee demonstrated that zzso injection of zzso might not only cause degradation of zzso but also a change in collagen integrity in a zzso zzso We conclude that in zzso measurement of zzso ratios gives quantitative and qualitative information on the collagen status and may be applied for the routine evaluation of normal and abnormal zzso zzso
