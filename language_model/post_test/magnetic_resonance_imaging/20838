Over decades, all attempts to translate acute stroke zzso from discovery in zzso species to human clinical use have zzso This raised concerns about the zzso zzso of zzso studies in animals for outcomes in human stroke zzso To bridge this zzso zzso we used zzso zzso nonhuman primates subjected to an experimental protocol that zzso that of a zzso separately reported, clinical trial in which the human subjects underwent zzso cerebral aneurysm zzso Both zzso studies tested zzso by zzso a prospective therapeutic compound, in zzso zzso zzso strokes were produced by small zzso zzso caused by the zzso zzso We show that primates treated with zzso after the onset of zzso strokes exhibited significantly reduced numbers and volumes of strokes, as zzso by zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso These results correctly anticipated the outcome of the corresponding human trial, thus zzso this study design as a predictor of zzso efficacy in zzso This strategy may facilitate the evaluation of promising zzso before zzso similar studies in human zzso
