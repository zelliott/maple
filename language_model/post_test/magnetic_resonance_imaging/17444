We have investigated the acute and sustained zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso of zzso zzso using zzso dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso Seven patients with the zzso syndrome and zzso zzso zzso tumors underwent functional dynamic zzso zzso zzso of selected liver zzso at baseline and 60 zzso after the subcutaneous zzso administration of 100 zzso zzso and also after 3 months with three times daily zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the typical aspect of zzso liver zzso with a very bright signal on the zzso sequences and intense enhancement in the zzso phase after injection of zzso zzso 60 zzso after the zzso administration of 100 zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction in relative enhancement in the selected liver zzso as compared to zzso In 2 patients, however, there was no zzso reduction in the relative enhancement in the selected liver zzso 60 zzso after the zzso administration of 100 zzso zzso as compared to zzso Only in 2 patients did the zzso at 3 months show a decrease in relative enhancement in one of the selected liver zzso At 3 months, with 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso there was no correlation between the change in relative enhancement on zzso and the change in 24-hour zzso zzso There is thus only an acute effect of zzso on the zzso of liver zzso This study further shows that zzso dynamic zzso can be a very useful tool for studying zzso effects of medical therapies on liver zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso
