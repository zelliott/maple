MR zzso zzso is an image diagnostic method which provides us with the image of urinary retention under zzso zzso This time, zzso was conducted in the patients who were suspected to have urinary passage disorder, and its clinical usefulness was compared with that of drip infusion zzso zzso or retrograde zzso zzso 

The study was conducted in 65 patients who were suspected to have zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso was conducted by means of fast zzso method to obtain heavy zzso zzso The zzso was reconstructed by means of zzso zzso intensity zzso zzso As imaging zzso zzso zzso and zzso were conducted respectively in 65, 47 and 27 zzso zzso of clinical usefulness of zzso and its indications were conducted with respect to zzso the degree of urinary retention which is identifiable by zzso by zzso comparing performance of zzso and that of other image diagnostic methods based on the scores given to zzso and other methods according to the following zzso zzso tract is not identifiable 0 point zzso tract is slightly identifiable 1 point The zzso region is almost clearly identifiable 2 points The zzso zzso for obstruction is identifiable 3 zzso 

1) zzso urinary retention for which overall image of urinary tract was barely identifiable by zzso was identifiable by zzso 2) In the comparison between zzso and zzso 24 patients whose urinary tracts were totally zzso by zzso was given was zzso points in the average for the zzso of urinary retention by zzso zzso only poor images were zzso by zzso in the patients whose urinary flow was clearly seen in zzso The patients whose urinary flow was clearly seen in zzso was give zzso points in the average for the zzso of urinary retention by zzso indicating that relatively poor images were zzso by zzso in those zzso 

zzso urinary retention for which overall image of urinary tract was barely identifiable by zzso was identifiable by zzso zzso it is suggested that zzso is more useful in the case that only poor images were zzso by zzso zzso is not the one which can replace zzso including urinary zzso but is useful to identify the location of the urinary tract tumor which is zzso by zzso or to monitor the progress of the urinary obstruction caused by benign zzso
