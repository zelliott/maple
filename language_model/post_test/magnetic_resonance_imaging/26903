zzso zzso following zzso damage involves the loss of the capacity to form new zzso memories but leaves zzso memory processes zzso Current theories of zzso memory suggest the existence of two complementary memory zzso a zzso system that specializes in rapid acquisition of specific events and a zzso system that slowly learns through environmental statistical zzso and requires the initial support of the zzso zzso zzso to this notion, we demonstrate a zzso mechanism that enables rapid acquisition of novel arbitrary associations independently of the zzso This mechanism has been dubbed zzso zzso zzso and is believed to support the rapid acquisition of vocabulary in children as young as 16 zzso of zzso We used zzso to teach novel zzso associations to four profoundly zzso patients with zzso system zzso Patients were able to acquire arbitrary associations through zzso zzso despite profound impairment on a matched standard zzso memory zzso Most importantly, they retained what they learned through zzso after a week's zzso when they were around chance level on the standard zzso By contrast, two patients with unilateral damage to the left polar zzso zzso were impaired on zzso suggesting that this cortical region is critical for zzso learning through zzso Left zzso and zzso zzso might also play a role in learning through zzso zzso to current theories, these findings indicate that rapid acquisition of zzso zzso memory can be accomplished independently of the zzso and that zzso plasticity can be induced rapidly to support novel arbitrary zzso
