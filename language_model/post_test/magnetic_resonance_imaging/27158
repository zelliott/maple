There are currently no effective treatments to halt the muscle breakdown in zzso muscular zzso zzso although zzso clinical trials are being zzso Most of these trials have as an zzso the restoration of zzso in muscle zzso hence requiring sufficiently zzso muscle of recruited zzso The choice of the muscles to be studied and the role of zzso methods to assess muscle preservation therefore require further zzso 

We studied the degree of muscle involvement in the lower leg muscles of 34 patients with zzso zzso years, using muscle zzso In a zzso of 15 patients we correlated the muscle zzso findings with the zzso of open zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso Muscle zzso involvement was assigned using a scale zzso zzso 

In all patients we documented a zzso of involvement of the lower leg zzso the zzso compartment zzso zzso zzso was most severely zzso the anterior compartment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso least zzso Muscle zzso showed zzso involvement that correlated with the patient's age zzso zzso zzso We show a correlation between the zzso and zzso zzso changes, with zzso zzso grades associated with a more severe zzso tissue zzso The zzso was sufficiently preserved for bulk and signal intensity in zzso wheelchair users aged zzso zzso 

This study provides a detailed correlation between muscle zzso and zzso changes in zzso and demonstrates the value of this imaging technique as a reliable tool for the selection of muscles in patients recruited into clinical zzso
