Previously reported studied to zzso zzso cartilage have used zzso manual or zzso zzso techniques, demonstrating high accuracy and zzso However, none has been able to automate the zzso zzso This paper describes a fast, zzso zzso approach to zzso and thickness measurement of the zzso cartilage in zzso zzso images using active shape models zzso zzso experiments were performed to assess the accuracy and precision of the technique with in zzso images of both normal and abnormal zzso zzso accuracy was determined by comparing the results of the zzso with the boundaries delineated by a zzso The mean error in locating the boundary was zzso zzso To assess the precision of the measurement technique, the mean thickness of the zzso cartilage was calculated for repeated scans of five healthy zzso A mean zzso of variation zzso of zzso was obtained for the thickness zzso
