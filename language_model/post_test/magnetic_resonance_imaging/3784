zzso zzso metrics are thought to reflect changes in neurotransmitter zzso but changes in neurotransmitter levels have not been demonstrated in humans during a cognitive task, and the relationship between neurotransmitter dynamics and zzso activity during zzso has not yet been zzso We evaluate the concentration of the major zzso zzso and zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso and the cerebral zzso at rest and during a prolonged delayed zzso working memory zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso prefrontal zzso correlated positively with the resting zzso and zzso with the change in zzso during the zzso Further, only zzso increased significantly during the first working memory run and then decreased continuously across subsequent task zzso The decrease of zzso over time was paralleled by a trend towards decreased reaction times and higher task zzso These results demonstrate a link between neurotransmitter dynamics and zzso activity during working memory, indicating that functional zzso metrics depend on the balance of zzso and zzso required for cognitive zzso
