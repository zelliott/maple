Human minds often wander away from their immediate sensory zzso It remains unknown whether such mind wandering is zzso or whether it zzso relates to an zzso tendency to attend to salient stimuli such as pain and their associated brain zzso Studies of zzso interactions typically examine explicit manipulation of attention rather than spontaneous mind zzso Here we sought to better represent natural fluctuations in pain in daily life, so we assessed behavioral and neural aspects of spontaneous disengagement of attention from zzso We found that an zzso tendency to attend to pain related to the disruptive effect of pain on his or her cognitive task zzso Next, we linked behavioral findings to neural networks with zzso zzso evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging during pain coupled with thought zzso of mind zzso dynamic resting state activity zzso and diffusion zzso We found that zzso zzso default mode network zzso zzso were attenuated during mind wandering away from zzso zzso functional connectivity fluctuations between the zzso and zzso gray zzso zzso tracked spontaneous attention away from zzso and zzso across individuals, stronger zzso structural connectivity and more dynamic resting state zzso functional connectivity were associated with the tendency to mind wander away from zzso These data demonstrate that individual tendencies to mind wander away from pain, in the absence of explicit zzso are zzso by functional and structural connectivity within and between default mode and zzso descending zzso zzso
