zzso symptoms may be associated with dysfunction of the brain reward system in zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess the zzso response in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso during presentation of zzso and zzso zzso 

A total of 10 schizophrenic men (7 never zzso 3 zzso for at least 2 zzso and 10 zzso healthy male volunteers participated in an incentive monetary delay task, in which visual cues predicted that a rapid response to a subsequent target stimulus would result either in monetary gain or loss or would have no zzso 

Compared to healthy controls, zzso zzso showed reduced zzso zzso zzso during the presentation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the left zzso zzso was zzso correlated with the severity of negative (and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in one of the central areas of the brain reward system, the zzso zzso was correlated with the severity of negative symptoms in zzso zzso In zzso schizophrenic patients, a high zzso zzso turnover may increase the zzso in the reward system, thus interfering with the zzso processing of zzso cues by zzso zzso zzso This, in turn, may contribute to negative symptoms as such as zzso zzso and loss of drive and zzso
