We investigated the neural zzso with a focus on zzso zzso which govern corrective zzso in visually targeted zzso During zzso zzso subjects moved a zzso to capture targets presented at varying movement zzso zzso were performed in a rehearsed zzso and a novel viscous zzso random zzso zzso zzso Movement error feedback was provided after each zzso The viscous field invoked a significantly larger error at the end of the primary zzso zzso compensated by producing more corrections than they had in the zzso zzso Corrective zzso were appropriately scaled such that terminal error was similar between the two zzso zzso analysis identified two regions where the zzso signal correlated with the number of zzso per zzso a zzso region similar to the one noted in the task contrast and the zzso zzso zzso A separate zzso analysis identified brain regions where activity correlated with movement zzso This identified the same zzso region as above, bilateral zzso cortex, and left motor and zzso zzso Our data indicate that the zzso zzso and zzso play complementary roles in regulating ongoing actions when precise updating is zzso The zzso zzso have a key role in zzso motor decision-making, zzso for deciding if and when to correct a given movement by initiating corrective zzso and the zzso is more generally involved in amplifying and refining the command signals for movements of different zzso
