To estimate and compare the fractional distribution volume zzso of zzso injection and zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso of rat hearts subjected to various zzso of zzso 

zzso resonance zzso imaging and zzso were performed in rats subjected to 20, 30, 40, or 60 minutes of regional zzso followed by 1 hour of zzso The zzso of zzso injection and zzso were measured and compared by using zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso imaging, zzso 

The mean zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso in normal zzso was zzso zzso 1, whereas that in the entire area at risk increased significantly zzso zzso with 20, 30, 40, and 60 minutes of zzso to zzso zzso 1, 57% zzso 4, zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso 2, zzso The zzso was significantly zzso zzso greater in the core of zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso 5, and zzso zzso 5 with 30, 40, and 60 minutes of zzso zzso in the normal zzso or in the area at zzso 

The zzso of MR contrast material in the zzso rim was significantly zzso zzso zzso greater than that in the normal zzso but significantly less than that in the core of zzso zzso
