To evaluate zzso zzso volume as a predictor of survival in patients with cervical cancer using both zzso and external zzso magnetic resonance imaging in order to achieve high spatial resolution and delineate small volume zzso 

A zzso case zzso 

A zzso referral zzso for zzso zzso 

One hundred and six consecutive women with invasive zzso of the zzso underwent zzso and external zzso magnetic resonance imaging on a zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso images, zzso and zzso to the zzso were obtained and zzso volume was calculated on the zzso images by the standard technique of zzso the sum of the areas by the slice zzso Patients were treated in accordance with normal clinical practice and their subsequent outcome was zzso The relationships between clinical or imaging parameters and survival were assessed with Cox's zzso hazard zzso 

zzso zzso 

In 89 of these women, the zzso was Stage I and 88 of the 106 were treated principally by zzso The median zzso volume was zzso zzso zzso and lower zzso 22 and zzso The median length of follow up of surviving patients was 223 weeks zzso 158 and zzso zzso Stage, treatment type, zzso space involvement, invasion of the zzso closeness of the zzso margin, zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso volume, zzso invasion and zzso zzso disease were all significantly associated with survival in zzso zzso Only magnetic resonance imaging measurement of zzso volume remained consistently and strongly associated with survival after zzso analysis of parameters available prior to treatment zzso zzso zzso statistic zzso A receiver operating characteristic curve of zzso volume and zzso survival confirmed the utility of this investigation and suggested that a zzso around zzso zzso would predict survival with a positive zzso value of zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso 

zzso resonance imaging assessment of zzso volume using both an zzso and an external zzso approach provides an accurate prediction of prognosis in cervical cancer and defines a population of women at high risk of recurrence and zzso The zzso value of this investigation is superior to the clinical and zzso parameters previously zzso Use of this technique permits a more accurate choice of treatment zzso These results suggest that it is the size of zzso burden that determines the outcome rather than invasion beyond the anatomical margins of the zzso
