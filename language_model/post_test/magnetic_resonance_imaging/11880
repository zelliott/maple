To present an unusual case of two uncommon zzso complications of frontal zzso zzso zzso tumor and zzso zzso arising from frontal zzso of dental origin, and also two systemic complications of zzso zzso and zzso all occurring in an zzso zzso 

A 21-year-old man presented with a scalp swelling and zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging and zzso zzso scans revealed unilateral zzso of the frontal zzso and an zzso zzso with a direct connection to the scalp zzso Further history revealed that his symptoms occurred coincidentally with a tooth extraction 2 months before, and he was hospitalized soon after the tooth extraction for zzso and a lung zzso 

A combined zzso and zzso approach was required to treat the zzso and the associated zzso and scalp zzso 

zzso returned as zzso zzso from all three zzso The patient was free of disease at the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is well zzso however, there is little reported of frontal zzso arising from dental zzso The prevalence of zzso of dental origin will be zzso including the zzso of this particularly virulent zzso that persisted despite earlier treatment with zzso Also, the current thoughts on management of these cases will be discussed with particular reference to local therapy for zzso in addition to systemic treatment with zzso
