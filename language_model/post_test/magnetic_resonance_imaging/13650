The aim of this study was to evaluate coronary artery zzso with zzso zzso patients underwent MR imaging zzso zzso zzso days zzso zzso zzso after placement of 47 coronary zzso of 11 different types, using zzso echo zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For both sequences the low signal artifact was used to zzso the zzso whereas the zzso high signal before and zzso to the zzso was considered as a zzso zzso Exercise zzso test zzso had been performed zzso days before zzso No adverse event with possible relation to the MR examination was zzso All the zzso were recognized as signal void with zzso and all but one with zzso Of the 2 patients with positive zzso the first one, with a zzso on the left anterior descending coronary artery, presented low signal zzso to the zzso at both MR zzso suggesting dysfunction zzso zzso at conventional coronary zzso zzso the second one, with two sequential zzso on the right coronary artery, presented lack of signal zzso to the zzso at both MR zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso at zzso For the 44 remaining zzso in 36 patients with negative zzso MR high signal before and zzso to the zzso suggested zzso at both zzso MR seems to be a safe and promising technique for zzso evaluation of coronary zzso
