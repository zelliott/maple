How representations of visual objects are maintained across changes in viewpoint is a central issue in visual zzso Whether neural processes underlying zzso recognition involve distinct zzso within zzso visual zzso for distinct categories of visual objects remains zzso We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging in 16 healthy volunteers to map visual cortical areas responding to a large set zzso of zzso from 3 object categories zzso houses, and zzso each repeated once after a variable time lag zzso intervening zzso zzso were repeated with the same viewpoint (but different retinal zzso or with different viewpoint and zzso The task was kept constant across object categories zzso items as zzso zzso zzso We identified zzso adaptation effects by comparing neural responses to the first presentation versus repetition of each individual zzso We found that zzso adaptation effects partly overlapped with regions showing zzso responses (as identified using a separate zzso zzso These included the lateral zzso zzso zzso for faces, zzso zzso for houses, and lateral zzso complex zzso for zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso adaptation effects occurred only for faces repeated with the same viewpoint, but not with a different viewpoint, confirming previous studies using faces zzso By contrast, a region in right zzso zzso adjacent to but zzso with the more lateral and zzso zzso showed repetition effects for faces and to a lesser extent for other objects, regardless of changes in viewpoint or in retinal zzso zzso and zzso repetition effects were also found in bilateral zzso Our results reveal a common neural zzso in bilateral zzso and right zzso zzso underlying zzso and zzso recognition for multiple object zzso with only a relative preference for faces in zzso zzso but no selectivity in zzso
