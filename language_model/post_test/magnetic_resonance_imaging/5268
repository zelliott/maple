To document the magnetic resonance zzso imaging appearances of benign zzso zzso and zzso and to correlate quantitative thickness zzso with zzso findings from zzso biopsy zzso 

MR imaging studies and zzso biopsy specimens were analyzed zzso in 100 adults zzso men, 49 zzso with benign zzso zzso local institutional review board approval and informed consent had been obtained as part of a previous imaging zzso At zzso zzso MR imaging, the zzso roof and zzso was classified as zzso 1, pencil thin, less than 3 zzso 2, smooth zzso 3 zzso or zzso 3, small tags or stripes; or 4, focal zzso mass with a vertical striped zzso The zzso and lateral walls were classified as zzso pattern 1, pencil thin, less than 3 zzso pattern 2, mild zzso 3 zzso or larger with moderate zzso or pattern 3, zzso with zzso along the zzso zzso The frequency of these patterns, as well as zzso zzso and zzso recess zzso were zzso Wall thickness was measured and correlated with age, sex, and zzso findings from biopsy specimens by using zzso rank correlation and zzso U zzso 

In 100 patients, roof patterns zzso were identified in 16 zzso seven zzso 33 zzso and 44 zzso zzso and lateral wall patterns 1-3 were identified in 20 zzso 55 zzso and 25 zzso zzso zzso was identified in 95 zzso patients, zzso in 41 zzso patients, and zzso recess zzso was identified in 24 zzso of 200 zzso zzso including zzso thickness was higher in men zzso zzso zzso and correlated zzso with age zzso zzso In 62 zzso of 100 patients, biopsy specimens contained zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso wall zzso zzso zzso thickness at MR imaging was higher if zzso were identified in biopsy zzso 

zzso zzso has typical MR imaging appearances, including stripes in zzso zzso and zzso which may be useful to differentiate this condition from zzso zzso
