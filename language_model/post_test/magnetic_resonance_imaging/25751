zzso experiments were described that demonstrate that zzso is an effective tool for the zzso study of zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse sequences were successively applied to analyze the zzso patterns in a module operated without cells, with an artificially induced flow field zzso zzso zzso pulse sequences were also used to zzso resolve regions of cell growth in a zzso These experiments provide the necessary basis from which future flow and zzso studies can be zzso
