We studied the utility of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in detecting obstacles to reduction in zzso zzso of the hip zzso by comparing zzso findings with zzso zzso and zzso zzso In 36 patients there were 38 zzso 23 complete zzso and 15 residual zzso zzso and zzso sections of zzso images were zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso superior, and zzso portions of the zzso which were zzso obstacles to reduction, were zzso zzso and zzso were useful for assessing the shape of the anterior portion of the zzso In complete zzso zzso findings proved more valuable to detect zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso Four of ten zzso zzso showed intermediate intensity signals on zzso The zzso was characterized by zzso zzso tissue with new zzso formation and organized zzso zzso proved useful for detecting obstacles to reduction, as well as for assessing zzso and zzso zzso
