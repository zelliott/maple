zzso zzso have traditionally been classified into 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The purpose of this study was to review this classical versus zzso distribution in patients with zzso zzso 

We reviewed all patients with a first clinical stroke included in the zzso Stroke zzso between 1990 and zzso Among 71 patients with an acute stroke isolated to the zzso confirmed by zzso we selected all patients with zzso outside the classical territories and studied their clinical, zzso and zzso zzso 

A total of 21 patients zzso of all zzso stroke zzso showed zzso outside the classical territories, allowing us to delineate 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso territory (9 patients zzso involving anterior and zzso territories, with predominantly cognitive zzso including executive dysfunction, zzso zzso and zzso in zzso or bilateral zzso The most frequent stroke mechanism was cardiac zzso zzso Central territory (4 patients zzso with zzso on the central part of the thalamus, resulting in a variety of neurological and zzso signs, reflecting the involvement of several adjacent zzso zzso was the most frequent zzso zzso zzso territory (8 patients zzso involving zzso and zzso territories, with zzso as the most frequent zzso followed by zzso executive dysfunction, and zzso in zzso zzso zzso embolism and zzso were the main stroke zzso 

We describe 3 zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso with distinct manifestations and zzso We zzso that these zzso are the result of a variation in zzso zzso supply or reflect zzso zzso
