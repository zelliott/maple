zzso damage in zzso apart from zzso deficits has been widely zzso We aimed to test if cerebral injury occurs in zzso independently from visible zzso deficit by measuring cerebral zzso in patients with zzso without zzso or impaired zzso 

We performed zzso MR imaging including zzso zzso zzso and MR zzso in 58 patients with zzso and 11 zzso and zzso control patients with incidental zzso We compared changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso between all patients with zzso and controls, between patients with and without visible zzso deficit or zzso and controls, and between patients with and without visible zzso deficit or zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso 

We found that zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso decreased in all patients with zzso zzso was significantly increased in all patients compared with controls zzso zzso zzso In patients without impaired zzso or zzso zzso was significantly decreased compared with both controls zzso zzso zzso and patients with impaired zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The significant decrease of zzso and zzso in patients with zzso but without impaired zzso or zzso strongly suggests global zzso changes independent from visible zzso deficits that might reflect zzso zzso zzso Further, impaired zzso in zzso seems to induce additional zzso changes from increasing zzso stress that might, to some extent, mask the global zzso zzso
