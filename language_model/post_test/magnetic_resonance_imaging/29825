The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible contribution of zzso to detect zzso zzso zzso in the follow-up of lung transplant zzso Nine zzso and zzso transplanted patients were studied by an initial and a follow-up zzso zzso Images were evaluated zzso by zzso of ventilation zzso area and zzso by individually adapted threshold zzso and subsequent calculation of zzso lung zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso was diagnosed using pulmonary function zzso At zzso zzso was suspected if zzso lung volume had decreased by zzso or more at the follow-up zzso study compared with the initial zzso General accordance between pulmonary function testing and zzso was good, although zzso evaluation of zzso underestimated improvement in ventilation as obtained by pulmonary function zzso The zzso indicated zzso in 6 zzso According to pulmonary function tests, zzso was diagnosed in 5 zzso All diagnoses of zzso were also detected by zzso In 2 of these 5 cases, zzso indicated zzso earlier than pulmonary function zzso The results support the hypothesis that zzso may be sensitive for early detection of zzso and emphasize the need for larger prospective follow-up zzso
