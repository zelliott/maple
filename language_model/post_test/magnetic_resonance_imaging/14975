zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso including the superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been reported in schizophrenia zzso and bipolar disorder zzso zzso While most zzso studies have suggested gray matter volume and surface area reduction in zzso lobe regions, few have explored changes in zzso thickness in zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso from 94 subjects were used to yield gray matter volume, zzso surface area and zzso thickness for zzso and zzso cortical zzso zzso analysis suggests that there may be gender and zzso effects on the size and shape of the zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with reduced zzso in zzso in subjects with zzso but not in zzso In addition, zzso surface area was seen to be larger in zzso and asymmetry in zzso surface area was larger in zzso zzso with zzso had reduced thickness and smaller asymmetry in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso probably plays a more sensitive role than the zzso in structural abnormalities seen in zzso
