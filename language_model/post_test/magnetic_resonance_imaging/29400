zzso zzso in alcohol dependent adults has revealed zzso zzso and neural responses to alcohol-related stimuli that differ from those of zzso zzso zzso and craving responses have not been studied in zzso 

zzso young women zzso and female light social drinkers zzso ages zzso were administered an alcohol cue zzso task during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine brain response to alcohol-related zzso 

Alcohol dependent young women demonstrated significantly more blood oxygen level dependent zzso response than zzso during alcohol word presentation trials relative to neutral word trials in zzso anterior cingulate, left zzso and bilateral insular regions zzso However, controls showed greater response to alcohol words in some right zzso cortical zzso Increased craving after cue exposure correlated with increased zzso zzso zzso response to alcohol cues zzso among alcohol dependent zzso 

This pilot study corroborates previous reports of increased zzso and frontal response to substance cues and extends these findings to young alcohol dependent zzso This zzso reaction may zzso the elevated zzso response and altered cognitive reactions to alcohol stimuli that are observed in alcohol dependent zzso
