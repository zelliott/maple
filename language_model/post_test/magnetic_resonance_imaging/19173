A still photograph of an object in motion may convey dynamic information about the position of the object immediately before and after the photograph was taken zzso zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso zzso is one of the main brain regions engaged in the zzso analysis of visual zzso In two experiments we examined whether zzso is also involved in representing implied motion from zzso zzso We found stronger functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso within zzso during viewing of zzso photographs with implied motion compared to viewing of photographs without implied zzso These results suggest that brain regions involved in the visual analysis of motion are also engaged in processing implied dynamic information from zzso zzso
