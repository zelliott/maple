zzso is a language disorder in which reading ability is compromised because of poor zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of a zzso driven treatment for zzso on brain zzso response to language stimulation as measured by zzso MR zzso zzso 

Brain zzso metabolism was measured at two different time points (1 year apart) during four different cognitive tasks (three language tasks and one zzso zzso in dyslexic participants zzso zzso 8) and in control participants zzso zzso 7) by using a fast MR zzso imaging technique called zzso zzso zzso imaging (1 zzso zzso zzso The age range for both dyslexic and control participants was 10 to 13 zzso Between the first and second imaging sessions, the dyslexic boys participated in an instructional intervention, which was a zzso zzso 

Before treatment, the dyslexic boys showed significantly greater zzso zzso compared with a control group in the left anterior zzso zzso of zzso P zzso zzso of the brain during a zzso zzso After treatment, however, brain zzso zzso was not significantly different from that of the control group in the left anterior zzso during the same zzso zzso zzso the dyslexic participants improved in the zzso aspects of zzso 

zzso intervention that improved zzso performance in dyslexic boys was associated with changes in brain zzso levels as measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso
