zzso can be found with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso carriers without zzso zzso using a modified zzso view through the zzso but also in other patients and healthy individuals with standard zzso zzso Since it is currently unknown if carriers display a specific zzso zzso we compared zzso in carriers with other cardiac zzso zzso Besides, we aimed to determine the optimal imaging plane for the detection of zzso by comparing modified zzso views with standard zzso zzso Finally, we evaluated the accuracy of zzso to identify carriers in zzso family zzso 

Standard zzso zzso views with additional modified zzso views were zzso performed in carriers zzso zzso consecutive zzso control patients zzso zzso and zzso family members zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso of carriers and in zzso zzso of controls zzso zzso zzso in carriers showed deeper zzso into the zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso 59 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of two or more zzso had a sensitivity of 51% and specificity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso views doubled the sensitivity to detect zzso compared with standard zzso zzso In family zzso zzso zzso had a zzso positive zzso value to identify zzso 

Multiple zzso in the absence of left zzso zzso are highly specific for zzso zzso zzso and warrant clinical zzso A modified zzso view has a superior sensitivity compared with standard zzso views for zzso zzso zzso may be of additional value to identify carriers in family zzso
