To assess if zzso patients with zzso share similar disease characteristics with zzso patients or whether they have distinct features and alternative zzso DESIGN We collated clinical and zzso data on patients with zzso identified through the Oxford zzso clinical zzso zzso 4 zzso were tested using 2 sensitive zzso We describe the features of patients with zzso compare findings between patients with and without zzso and describe alternative diagnoses in zzso zzso

zzso percent of patients were zzso zzso Alternative diagnoses could usually be identified in zzso patients, including those fulfilling zzso diagnostic zzso Only zzso of patients had zzso zzso zzso and zzso had idiopathic zzso There were some important differences between zzso and zzso cases, including older onset age, higher proportion of zzso lower zzso of simultaneous zzso zzso lower frequency of zzso involvement, and higher prevalence of zzso zzso disorders in zzso zzso zzso severity and degree of recovery were similar in the 2 zzso 

Patients with zzso without zzso include a number of different diagnostic categories and it is not surprising therefore that they show important differences compared with zzso patients, even when considering only those fulfilling current zzso diagnostic zzso Thus, we suggest that diagnoses such as zzso zzso zzso disease, multiple zzso acute zzso zzso and zzso disorders should be zzso in the zzso diagnostic criteria and zzso and zzso zzso spectrum disorder zzso should be analyzed zzso
