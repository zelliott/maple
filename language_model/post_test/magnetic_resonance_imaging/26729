Double zzso zzso zzso zzso can provide quantitative maps of zzso quantities and features within porous media and zzso We propose and describe a novel zzso zzso consisting of wafers of highly ordered glass zzso zzso zzso and its use to validate and zzso a zzso zzso method to measure and map the local pore zzso Specifically, we employ zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with a recently introduced theoretical zzso to estimate a mean pore diameter in each zzso within the imaging zzso This simulation scheme accounts for all diffusion and imaging zzso within the diffusion weighted zzso zzso zzso and admits the violation of the short zzso pulse zzso These diameter maps agree well with pore sizes measured using both optical zzso and single zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso using the same zzso zzso analysis shows that the local pore diameter can be mapped precisely and accurately within a zzso using zzso zzso
