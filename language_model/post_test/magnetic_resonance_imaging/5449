The purpose of this study was to characterize the variety of zzso abnormalities of the zzso zzso in the pediatric zzso 

Patients with zzso abnormalities were identified through zzso search of zzso zzso from 1999 to zzso The patient's medical record, imaging studies, and surgical reports were zzso The zzso zzso were zzso based on the imaging zzso zzso results were reviewed in conjunction with the imaging zzso 

zzso patients were zzso zzso zzso were zzso into two imaging groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso avascular necrosis zzso The zzso injury group was zzso into zzso and lateral zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) were small zzso zzso and were located on the zzso zzso surface of the zzso zzso The lateral zzso zzso zzso 10) were larger zzso zzso zzso and were located on the zzso inferior aspect of the lateral zzso zzso AVN zzso zzso 5) affected development of the lateral zzso zzso zzso or both the zzso and lateral aspects of the zzso zzso zzso AVN occurred exclusively in athletes with history of remote zzso zzso zzso Seven of the 18 patients underwent elbow zzso zzso findings and treatment regimens are zzso 

zzso zzso should be considered in throwing athletes presenting with zzso elbow pain and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injuries may result from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occur in a characteristic vascular watershed zone resulting from the unique blood supply of the zzso zzso AVN may be unmasked years following treated zzso zzso fracture when the athletic demands upon the adolescent elbow increase, revealing the altered growth and zzso
