Although magnetic resonance zzso imaging has been established as an accurate diagnostic zzso for knee pathology, the zzso of this test is not zzso In this investigation, we formulated a mathematical equation to assess zzso and then used this formula to evaluate the use of knee MR as a diagnostic zzso in acute knee zzso We analyzed 105 consecutive MR scans performed at an imaging center with a diverse referral base, and identified 63 patients who had had symptoms for less than 6 zzso Based on average regional medical costs, we calculated that diagnostic zzso is more cost-effective than MR if zzso of the scanned patients eventually undergo zzso In our study population, zzso had zzso after the MR zzso zzso in this patient cohort representing a diverse orthopedic community, zzso alone would have been more zzso zzso analysis in this type of cost-benefit framework would be beneficial and may lead to the establishment of objective criteria by which MR can be used in the most cost-effective zzso
