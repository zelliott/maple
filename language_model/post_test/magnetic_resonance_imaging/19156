To employ a magnetic resonance zzso imaging technique for quantitative assessment of thin cartilage zzso and to validate the cartilage volume and thickness zzso 

We investigated 10 normal elbow zzso (age 20 to 69 zzso with a zzso zzso echo sequence with selective water zzso zzso 18 zzso TE 9 zzso zzso 25 degrees, resolution zzso zzso imaging time 19 zzso After zzso the image data to a zzso zzso zzso resolution, the cartilage plates were zzso reconstructed in zzso and the cartilage volume and thickness determined with a zzso zzso distance transformation algorithm, independent of the original section zzso The cartilage volume and thickness values were compared with CT zzso and zzso zzso 

The mean systematic difference between the elbow cartilage volume obtained from MR imaging and CT zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the mean random difference zzso zzso zzso Except for the zzso zzso zzso the zzso were not statistically significant zzso zzso to zzso In the zzso the mean cartilage thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso was overestimated relative to CT zzso zzso zzso and slightly underestimated relative to zzso ultrasound zzso zzso With few exceptions, there were no significant differences between zzso CT zzso and ultrasound in the other joint surfaces of the elbow zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso 

The technique presented can be applied for determining the cartilage volume and zzso thickness in zzso with thin cartilage layers with a reasonable degree of zzso
