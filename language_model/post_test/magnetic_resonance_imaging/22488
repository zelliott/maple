To describe and evaluate the accuracy of zzso zzso and a computer zzso program for zzso of visceral zzso tissue zzso 

zzso was performed on five patients with zzso coverage of the abdomen using two different zzso 1) a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso and 2) a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso The computer zzso program analyzed the data and calculated zzso volumes zzso from both zzso The data from one patient were additionally processed with the use of a manual zzso The zzso zzso of the proposed method using the zzso zzso sequence and the computer zzso technique was tested by repeated measures of the automated system analysis zzso 10) on zzso data from a single subject to calculate zzso 

zzso volumes measured by the zzso zzso sequences were consistently greater than those measured by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso volumes derived from the zzso images and measured by the computer zzso technique zzso the manual technique showed good correlation (K zzso zzso with a significant zzso benefit associated with the automated method (5 minutes zzso 1 zzso There was poor correlation between zzso volume measurement calculated by the manual technique and the computer zzso technique using zzso zzso The zzso of the computer zzso technique using data derived from zzso images was high, with a low zzso zzso zzso 

The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed method may be able to provide accurate zzso of zzso in a highly zzso and efficient zzso
