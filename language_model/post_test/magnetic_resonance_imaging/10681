Increased acoustic noise zzso during working memory leads to increased brain zzso in healthy individuals and may have greater impact in human zzso virus zzso zzso 

Compared with control subjects, zzso patients showed reduced AN zzso and lower zzso marker zzso in prefrontal and zzso zzso Competing use of the working memory network between AN and cognitive load showed lower dynamic range of the zzso responses in prefrontal and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that reduced reserve capacity of the working memory network in zzso patients and additional stress zzso zzso might exhaust the impaired network for more demanding zzso
