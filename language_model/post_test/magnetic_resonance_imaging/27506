zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso disease characterized by zzso diabetes zzso zzso nerve zzso diabetes zzso deafness, and neurological dysfunction leading to death in zzso zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso which lead to zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Case studies have found widespread brain zzso in late stage zzso However, it is not known when in the disease course these brain abnormalities zzso and whether there is differential vulnerability across brain regions and tissue zzso To address this zzso we zzso regional brain abnormalities across multiple imaging zzso in a cohort of young patients in relatively early stages of zzso Children and young adults with zzso were evaluated with zzso cognitive and structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso Compared to zzso data, the zzso group had intact zzso significant anxiety and depression, and gait zzso Compared to healthy and type 1 diabetic control groups, the zzso group had smaller zzso volume and zzso affected gray matter volume and white matter zzso integrity in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected in even the youngest patients with zzso symptoms, and some measures did not follow the typical zzso zzso zzso These results establish that zzso is associated with smaller zzso volume with specific abnormalities in the zzso and zzso even at the earliest stage of clinical zzso This pattern of abnormalities suggests that zzso has a pronounced impact on early brain development in addition to later neurodegenerative effects, representing a significant new insight into the zzso disease zzso zzso studies will be critical for confirming and expanding our understanding of the impact of zzso stress zzso on brain zzso
