The influence of psychoactive drugs on the central nervous system has been investigated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso However, it is not known how these drugs affect the intrinsic large-scale interactions of the brain zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso In this study, the effect of zzso zzso on intrinsic brain connectivity was zzso 

Twelve healthy, male volunteers received a zzso intravenous zzso infusion zzso hour 20 zzso zzso second hour 40 zzso zzso Before, zzso and after zzso administration, zzso brain connectivity was zzso In addition, heat pain tests were performed between imaging sessions to determine zzso zzso A zzso general linear model was used to determine drug and pain effects on zzso brain zzso 

zzso increased the connectivity most zzso in the zzso and visual zzso in relation to the zzso visual zzso A decrease in connectivity was observed in the auditory and zzso network in relation to regions responsible for pain sensing and the affective processing of pain, which included the amygdala, zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso variations related to fluctuations in pain scores were observed in the anterior zzso cortex, zzso zzso cortex, and the zzso regions involved in descending zzso of zzso 

Changes in connectivity were observed in the areas that explain zzso zzso profile with respect to analgesia and psychedelic and other side zzso In addition, pain and zzso changed brain connectivity in areas involved in zzso pain zzso
