The objective was to measure the effect of zzso oxygen inhalation on zzso relaxation times in skeletal zzso Healthy volunteers were scanned using three different zzso protocols while breathing medical air and zzso zzso zzso of zzso were made from regions of interest zzso within various skeletal muscle zzso Dynamic data of subjects breathing a sequence of zzso allowed the calculation of characteristic zzso and zzso times for dissolved oxygen in zzso zzso to previous findings, a statistically significant decrease in zzso in skeletal muscle was observed due to oxygen zzso We report approximate baseline characteristic values for the response of skeletal muscle to oxygen zzso This measurement may provide new zzso for evaluation of oxygen delivery and consumption in normal and diseased skeletal zzso
