We investigated neural zzso of zzso processing of bilateral zzso stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso were presented with two compound letters that were displayed simultaneously in the left and right visual fields, zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were recorded while subjects detected zzso global or local targets presented in one zzso in separate epochs of zzso While zzso responses were more accurate and faster to global than local targets, attention to the global level of bilateral visual zzso induced stronger zzso in the left and right zzso zzso relative to attention to the local zzso However, attention to the local level generated stronger zzso in bilateral superior zzso zzso compared with attention to the global zzso The results suggest that distinct neural zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso engaged in the global and local processing of bilateral visual zzso zzso
