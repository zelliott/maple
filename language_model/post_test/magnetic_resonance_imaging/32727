zzso and cognitive zzso typical of schizophrenia zzso patients are observed to a lesser extent in their adolescent and adult first-degree relatives, likely reflecting zzso abnormalities associated with genetic risk for the zzso The anatomical pathways for language are hypothesized to be abnormal and to zzso the positive symptoms of zzso zzso zzso relatives at high familial risk zzso for schizophrenia may clarify if these deficits represent trait markers associated with genetic vulnerability, rather than specific markers resulting from the pathological process underlying zzso 

zzso zzso scans from a zzso zzso scanner of young adult zzso subjects zzso and controls with no family history of illness zzso at low genetic risk zzso zzso were processed using zzso zzso We explored zzso and zzso zzso in regions associated with language zzso An extensive zzso battery of language measures was zzso 

No significant differences were observed between groups on any language zzso Controlling zzso volume, significantly smaller left zzso zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes and reversal of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso In addition, the L zzso zzso and R zzso zzso correlated with performance on tests of linguistic function in the zzso zzso 

zzso volume and reversed structural asymmetry in zzso regions hypothesized to be altered in zzso are also found in first degree relatives at zzso despite normal language zzso To clarify if these findings are zzso for zzso future studies would need to be performed of ill and well family members no longer within the age range of risk for illness to show these deficits segregate with schizophrenia within zzso Moreover, measures of complex language need to be studied to determine if zzso individuals manifest zzso in some aspects of language zzso
