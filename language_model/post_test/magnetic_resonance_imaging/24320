zzso repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation of the zzso zzso combined with occupational therapy significantly improves motor function of the affected upper limb in zzso zzso patients, but the recovery mechanism remains zzso 

To investigate the recovery mechanism using functional magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso zzso zzso patients were hospitalized to receive 12 sessions of zzso zzso repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation over the zzso zzso and daily occupational therapy for 15 zzso Motor function was evaluated with the zzso Assessment and Wolf Motor zzso zzso The functional magnetic resonance imaging with motor tasks was performed at admission and zzso The zzso index of activated zzso number in zzso areas 4 and 6 on functional magnetic resonance imaging was calculated zzso index range of zzso to zzso Patients were divided into two groups based on functional magnetic resonance imaging findings before the zzso group 1: patients who showed bilateral zzso zzso group zzso patients with unilateral zzso zzso 

Treatment resulted in improvement in zzso Assessment and Wolf Motor zzso Test in the two groups zzso The treatment also resulted in a significant increase in zzso index in group 1 zzso suggesting a shift in activated zzso to the zzso zzso Patients of group 2 showed a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results of serial functional magnetic resonance imaging indicated that our proposed treatment can induce functional cortical zzso leading to motor functional recovery of the affected upper zzso zzso it seems that neural zzso in the zzso zzso plays an important role in such recovery in zzso zzso zzso
