zzso zzso iron oxide particles result in zzso of zzso and zzso relaxation time zzso and can be used as MR contrast zzso We tested four hypotheses by evaluating MR images of zzso tumors after infusion of two iron oxide agents in comparison with a zzso zzso 1) zzso in contrast to zzso can be used as an intravenous MR contrast agent in zzso zzso 2) zzso enhancement, albeit delayed, is similar to zzso zzso 3) zzso MR images in contrast to zzso MR images may be compared with zzso specimens showing the cellular location of iron oxide zzso 4) zzso can serve as a model for viral zzso zzso 

In 20 patients, zzso and zzso were zzso administered at recommended clinical zzso MR imaging was performed 30 minutes and 4 hours after zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso MR imaging zzso zzso 17) was performed 6 and 24 hours after infusion in the first five patients and 24 hours after infusion in the remaining zzso MR sequences were zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and, in four cases, zzso zzso zzso Representative regions of interest were chosen on zzso and zzso images to compare each sequence and signal zzso 

Despite some degree of zzso enhancement in all tumors, no significant zzso or zzso signal intensity changes were seen after zzso administration at either examination zzso Fifteen of 17 patients given zzso had zzso and/or zzso zzso consistent with iron penetration into zzso zzso examination revealed minimal iron zzso of the tumor with strong zzso at the periphery of the zzso 

1) zzso can be used as an intravenous MR contrast agent in zzso tumors, mostly zzso zzso 2) Enhancement with zzso is comparable to but more variable than that with the zzso zzso 3) zzso examination showed a distribution of zzso particles similar to that on MR images, but at zzso the cellular zzso was primarily by zzso cells at the tumor zzso 4) zzso may be used as a model for viral zzso delivery in zzso brain zzso
