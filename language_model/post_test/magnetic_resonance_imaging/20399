Although there is an emerging consensus that the anterior zzso zzso zzso are involved in semantic memory, it is currently unclear which specific parts of this region are implicated in semantic zzso Answers to this question are difficult to glean from the existing literature for 3 reasons: 1) zzso of relevant patient groups tend to zzso the whole ATL zzso 2) while local effects of repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso are zzso more specific, only the lateral aspects of the ATL are available to zzso and 3) until recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies were hindered by technical limitations such as signal distortion and dropout due to magnetic zzso and also, in some cases, by zzso factors, including a restricted field of view and the choice of baseline contrast for zzso zzso By utilizing the same semantic task across semantic zzso zzso and zzso zzso in normal participants, we directly compared the results across the 3 methods for the first zzso The findings were highly zzso and indicated that crucial regions within the ATL for semantic representation include the anterior inferior zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and the anterior superior zzso zzso
