One case due to high fall was fully examined using zzso spiral zzso zzso zzso 3-D imaging creation and magnetic resonance imaging zzso The systemic and detailed autopsy was subsequently performed to compare with the results from imaging zzso The advantages and disadvantages of autopsy and imaging studies were then zzso 

Most of the important information such as zzso fracture and zzso could be obtained by imaging zzso Furthermore, imaging methods can predict injuries in internal body before autopsy and be minimal or zzso to the zzso However, the imaging techniques probably also can not find some details in comparison to autopsy in forensic practice and need to improve in their future zzso
