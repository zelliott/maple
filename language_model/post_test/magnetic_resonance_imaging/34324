zzso zzso represent a difficult surgical zzso The introduction of modern techniques of skull base surgery has zzso the interest of the zzso community in the surgical management of these zzso although very good results have been obtained by experienced zzso in cases of zzso zzso operated using traditional surgical zzso 

Thirty-one cases of zzso zzso have been operated on during a zzso period using two different zzso as far as the zzso Group A patients (13 zzso have been operated on using mostly either a zzso zzso or a zzso zzso Group B patients (18 zzso have been managed using a lateral skull base approach, either the anterior zzso or the zzso zzso zzso approaches have been used zzso 

zzso dissection and removal seemed to be easier in zzso operated zzso However, operations take longer and surgical complications such as zzso fluid leak and hearing loss were zzso zzso tumor removal could be achieved in an equal percentage of cases of both groups zzso zzso zzso The early zzso course was more favorable in group B zzso However, late permanent morbidity appeared to be similar in the two groups of zzso 

Skull base approaches facilitate tumor dissection and removal at the expense of increased surgical zzso However, the widened surgical field and increased angle of approach that the techniques of skull base surgery may offer can play a significant role in the removal of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso
