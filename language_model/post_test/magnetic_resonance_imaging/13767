zzso of cerebral zzso is crucial in order to zzso and differentiate zzso If we are to apply specific treatment zzso early while neurological deficits are still zzso we need a fast diagnosis that reliably predicts zzso 

The early clinical zzso into Oxford zzso is presented with an assessment of their zzso value in relation to zzso zzso zzso 

The various Oxford zzso correlate well to the topography of the zzso demonstrated by zzso to the vascular zzso as demonstrated by ultrasound techniques, and to the zzso zzso as determined by a full diagnostic zzso However, the correlation is not sufficient to guide potentially specific treatments of zzso if the treatment in question has serious side effects zzso zzso However, if the clinical diagnosis is supplemented with zzso zzso and perhaps MR zzso the zzso value of the diagnosis is extremely zzso 

Very early clinical diagnosis of cerebral zzso must be supplemented with zzso zzso to make the diagnostic precision sufficiently high to guide the application of specific treatments with potentially serious side zzso
