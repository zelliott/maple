zzso zzso is beneficial in severe zzso symptomatic carotid zzso The risk of stroke in moderate carotid zzso zzso is modest, and so the role of carotid zzso in this group is zzso zzso zzso is associated with advanced zzso and can be detected in the carotid arteries by magnetic resonance zzso This study evaluates whether magnetic resonance imaging detected zzso zzso zzso zzso can identify patients with symptomatic mild to moderate carotid zzso who are at higher risk of zzso transient zzso attack zzso and zzso 

Prospective zzso cohort study of symptomatic patients with mild to moderate zzso carotid zzso followed up for 2 years after imaging for zzso using magnetic resonance zzso 

Sixty four participants were followed up for a median of 28 months zzso range zzso after zzso of the carotid zzso Thirty-nine zzso zzso arteries showed zzso zzso During zzso five zzso strokes and a total of 14 zzso zzso events were zzso Thirteen of these zzso events, of which five were strokes, occurred in those with zzso carotid zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

MR zzso is a good predictor of zzso stroke and zzso in patients with symptomatic mild to moderate zzso carotid zzso This technique could help in the selection of patients for carotid zzso
