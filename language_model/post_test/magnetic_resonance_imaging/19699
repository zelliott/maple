In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system, zzso of zzso zzso are useful for diagnosis and patient follow-up but are strongly biased by the partial volume effect zzso We studied whether zzso correction might improve patient zzso based on binding potential zzso zzso 

Patients with a probable diagnosis of zzso with zzso bodies zzso 10 zzso or Alzheimer's disease zzso 13 zzso were studied zzso zzso zzso zzso images were reconstructed with and without zzso zzso Each patient zzso scan was also simulated to obtain zzso data whose characteristics were fully zzso In addition, 17 zzso scans were simulated with zzso zzso values mimicking zzso cases of zzso 

Without zzso zzso mean zzso zzso values were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso patients respectively, while with zzso zzso they were zzso and zzso zzso All patients were properly identified as having zzso or zzso when considering mean zzso zzso measured on their real or simulated zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso All 30 simulations mimicking zzso zzso and zzso patients were accurately classified with zzso zzso but without zzso correction 15 mean zzso zzso values were in a range where zzso and zzso could not be zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso values measured without zzso correction can be used to differentiate probable zzso and zzso due to the already severe reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso correction appeared useful for accurate differential diagnosis between zzso and zzso zzso
