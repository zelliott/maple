The large zzso coils used in zzso zzso simultaneously with the zzso zzso zzso wave, acoustic noise of high intensity that has raised concern regarding hearing zzso The sound pressure levels zzso and power zzso of zzso acoustic noise were measured at the position of the human head in the zzso of five zzso systems and with 10 different pulse sequences used in clinical MR zzso Each zzso including zzso rapid zzso echo zzso 113 zzso zzso zzso fast zzso echo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and spin echo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to have the high zzso rapid pulse rates, zzso pulse envelopes, and zzso zzso Since thickness and zzso were zzso zzso the zzso images generated more intense acoustic noise than the zzso zzso zzso The unfiltered linear peak values provided more accurate zzso of the zzso and spectral content of the zzso acoustic noise than the commonly used zzso zzso scale, which filters out the zzso low frequency zzso zzso analysis revealed predominantly low frequency energy zzso ranging from zzso to approximately 1 zzso with a steep high frequency zzso for each pulse zzso zzso protectors of known zzso ratings are recommended for all patients during zzso zzso
