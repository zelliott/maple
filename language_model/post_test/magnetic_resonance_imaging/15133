zzso of zzso with fast MR sequences for zzso zzso laser therapy zzso and zzso of the zzso results with a fiber-optic zzso 

In zzso experiments were conducted using an zzso gel mixture and pig liver zzso zzso zzso was performed using a laser power between 3 and 15 zzso zzso was performed using zzso relaxation time zzso and zzso resonance frequency shift zzso methods under acquisition of zzso and phase shift zzso zzso was measured with a fast zzso zzso zzso Four different sequences were used for zzso zzso zzso echo zzso zzso zzso zzso Recovery zzso zzso and zzso Recovery zzso zzso zzso The temperature was controlled using a fiber-optic zzso device and correlated with the MR zzso The range of applied and monitored temperatures exceeded 80 degrees zzso 

The temperature dependence showed a good linear relationship up to 60 degrees zzso zzso experiments for the zzso method delivered zzso of determination from zzso to zzso for zzso and from zzso to zzso for the pig liver zzso The zzso sequence had the highest temperature sensitivity zzso zzso liver zzso During zzso the zzso sequence exhibited a strong zzso zzso R zzso of this sequence was zzso in the zzso zzso The average temperature errors when heated up to 80 degrees zzso were zzso degrees zzso for zzso gel and zzso degrees zzso for the liver zzso zzso and zzso sequences exhibited the most linear relationship with temperature but were more dependent on tissue zzso 

The accuracy of the temperature measurement is sufficient for controlling the zzso area of the zzso zzso is the method of choice since it shows the best linear correlation with fiber-optic zzso If only zzso sequences are concerned, the zzso sequence is zzso It is the most zzso though not the most accurate, zzso zzso
