Previous studies have shown that the functional brain activity in the resting state is impaired in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso However, most studies focused on the relationship between different brain areas, rather than the zzso or strength of the regional brain zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the functional brain changes in zzso patients by measuring the zzso of the blood zzso level dependent zzso functional zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty mild zzso patients and zzso healthy elderly subjects participated in the zzso zzso The zzso of low frequency fluctuation zzso was calculated using zzso zzso 

Compared with the healthy elderly subjects, the mild zzso patients showed decreased zzso in the right zzso zzso cortex, right zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, and in the bilateral zzso zzso prefrontal zzso No brain region with increased zzso was found in the zzso group compared with the control zzso 

The reduced activity in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso observed in the present study suggest that the functional abnormalities of those areas are at an early stage of zzso The zzso analysis may provide a useful tool in zzso study of zzso
