zzso zzso zzso zzso are neither diagnostic nor zzso of zzso zzso zzso Nonetheless, bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso have been widely reported to be associated with zzso The aim of this study was to describe a unique zzso sign seen on the zzso brain in zzso present a retrospective chart review of patients with zzso over the past 10 years for evidence of similar zzso appearance, review literature for evidence of this sign, and generate a hypothesis to explain its zzso zzso 

We describe a previously zzso and unique zzso picture, the zzso Fork sign, in a patient with zzso We conducted a focused retrospective chart review of patients with zzso over the past 10 years, for evidence of similar zzso zzso We review literature (through zzso zzso and zzso for evidence of this sign and propose a hypothesis to explain the basis of this zzso zzso 

We describe the zzso Fork sign in a patient with zzso Of our 21 zzso reviewed patients with zzso who underwent zzso only one had this zzso Literature review identified 22 patients with this sign who had various conditions, all associated with zzso zzso Fourteen of these patients had documented evidence of severe zzso zzso We propose the hypothesis that zzso zzso is the basis of this zzso Fork zzso 

zzso Fork sign is a unique, previously zzso zzso picture that is seen not only in patients with zzso but also in other conditions that result in zzso zzso helping discriminate a specific zzso from the myriad of conditions that are lumped under the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We propose the hypothesis that zzso zzso may be the key factor in the zzso of this zzso
