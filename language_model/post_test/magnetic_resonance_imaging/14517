Recent human and zzso brain imaging studies have shown that the shape of the brain can be changed by zzso These zzso zzso in zzso are hypothesized to be driven by changes at the level of zzso zzso To examine whether the shape of the brain changes zzso we used zzso to examine changes in the volume of the zzso across the 4-6 day zzso cycle in the female zzso It is well known that changing steroid levels across the cycle influence zzso spine maturation and alter zzso density in the zzso our results show that the zzso cycle is associated with approximately zzso changes in zzso volume as seen by high-resolution zzso zzso Changes in zzso volume are, moreover, associated with a switch between zzso and zzso based navigation strategies in solving the dual choice zzso in the same zzso A second experiment, using zzso zzso suggests that these changes in zzso volume can occur over a 24 hour zzso In zzso we show that the brain is highly plastic at a zzso level of resolution zzso by zzso that zzso increases and decreases in zzso volume follow previously established patterns of changes in zzso and that these changes in volume predict changes in zzso
