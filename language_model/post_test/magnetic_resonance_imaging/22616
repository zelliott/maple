The purposes of our study were to determine the zzso changes in MR signal in bone after zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the size of the zone of zzso signal change produced by the zzso technique and to compare the size of the zone with published data for zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in 10 patients with a clinical and zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso A cooled zzso probe was inserted in the zzso Twelve minutes of zzso energy was applied from a zzso zzso generator in an zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and STIR sequences was performed at 1, 7, and 28 days after the procedure in seven zzso The three remaining patients had follow-up imaging at 28 days zzso The images were reviewed by two zzso who zzso the imaging features and measured the zzso zone of signal zzso when zzso The size of the zone of zzso signal change produced by the zzso technique was compared with published data for zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

A zzso band of homogeneous altered zzso signal distributed zzso parallel to the entire probe tract was seen zzso at 1 day, in the zzso neck zzso treated with the zzso zzso The band was low signal on the zzso sequence and high signal on the STIR zzso and the diameter of the zone was 27 zzso By 7 days, five of the seven treated bones showed a band of zzso signal zzso By 28 days, all 10 treated bones had a band of zzso signal zzso The zzso distance at 90 degrees to the probe measured on STIR images at 28 days was a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso measurement error, zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso probe and zzso zzso zzso error, zzso zzso zzso on zzso images without contrast material when a zzso zzso probe was zzso zzso generators with zzso software and internally cooled zzso zzso with longer exposed tips produce larger zones of zzso signal change than expected with zzso zzso 

zzso allows detection of zzso zzso signal change after zzso zzso The zzso signal change with a zzso delivery protocol is larger than zzso zzso
