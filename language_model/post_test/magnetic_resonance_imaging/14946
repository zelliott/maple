Language switching zzso is an important phenomena usually observed in some zzso zzso The ability to switch languages is a very fast, efficient and flexible process, being a fundamental aspect of zzso efficient language zzso The aim of the present study was to characterize the specific role of zzso specific prefrontal regions in the neural network involved in zzso in zzso patients, during awake brain surgery and using electrical stimulation mapping zzso 

In order to identify the neural regions involved in zzso we used, a new specific zzso protocol in two patients undergoing awake brain zzso Besides, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso testing and the assessment of daily conversational zzso patterns zzso were used as complementary imaging and behavioral zzso 

The outcome of the zzso zzso zzso comparison in both patients pointed out to the crucial involvement of the inferior and middle frontal zzso in zzso 

The present results add to previous findings highlighting the important role of zzso specific frontal structures in regulating zzso The new protocol developed here might allow zzso to plan ahead for surgical intervention in multilingual patients to ensure the preservation of regions involved in zzso and therefore the prevention of pathological language mixing after zzso
