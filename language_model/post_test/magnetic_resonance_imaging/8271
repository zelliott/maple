zzso may be important in the zzso of insulin resistance and the zzso syndrome in zzso 

The objective of the study was to determine the unique effect of zzso on the zzso syndrome in overweight Latino zzso 

Participants included 175 overweight children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso with a family history of type 2 zzso 

zzso syndrome was defined according to a pediatric adaptation of the Adult Treatment Panel III report and included zzso abdominal zzso elevated blood pressure, and zzso (impaired zzso zzso or impaired zzso tolerance from a zzso oral zzso tolerance zzso Body composition was estimated via zzso zzso zzso insulin sensitivity was zzso by the frequently sampled zzso zzso tolerance test, visceral fat was measured using magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso was determined in zzso zzso 

In simple linear regression, zzso was significantly and zzso related to zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and positively related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In multiple linear regression, zzso was significantly related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso independent of age, zzso zzso stage, body zzso and insulin zzso zzso of zzso established that zzso levels were approximately zzso higher in healthy overweight youth, compared with those with the zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In multiple zzso regression, zzso was a significant independent predictor of the zzso syndrome, even after adjustment for zzso including insulin sensitivity and visceral zzso 

zzso is an independent zzso of the zzso syndrome, and thus, zzso may play a role in the zzso of the disorder in overweight zzso
