The purpose of this study was to determine if zzso MR imaging with zzso selected with fat and water in phase and out of phase can help predict the likelihood of zzso or zzso zzso in bone zzso 

Thirty consecutive patients with 31 suspected bone zzso zzso underwent MR imaging, including two zzso zzso sequences identical in all parameters except zzso which was chosen such that fat and water were either in phase or out of zzso Relative ratios of the abnormal bone zzso signal intensity and a control site on the zzso and zzso images were zzso The images were also assessed independently by two zzso who were unaware of the patients' identities and clinical zzso zzso assessed decreased zzso signal intensity relative to control sites on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmation was obtained in 16 patients (17 zzso the remainder of patients had either established diagnoses or determination of zzso based on stability of findings at 1 zzso Relative ratios were compared with the zzso zzso test and receiver operating characteristic zzso curve analysis, and the zzso scores were evaluated with zzso curve zzso 

The relative zzso ratios were zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso curve analysis of the zzso ratios showed a zzso of zzso A ratio zzso value of zzso resulted in a zzso sensitivity and a zzso specificity for detection of zzso Both zzso achieved zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for detection of zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging of bone zzso zzso abnormalities can help predict the likelihood of zzso or zzso zzso
