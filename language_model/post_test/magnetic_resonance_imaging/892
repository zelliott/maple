We studied the zzso and spatial characteristics of neural responses zzso by viewing mouth movements using zzso 

We focused on differences in responses to mouth opening and closing movements by apparent motion, using an averting eyes condition as a zzso 

A large clear zzso zzso 1 M zzso peak zzso of approximately 160 zzso was zzso by both mouth zzso We modeled the neural sources using a brain electric source analysis zzso method and placed the sources zzso zzso the zzso border at human zzso zzso the primary visual zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The calculated activity of zzso zzso was large whereas the activity of the others was small or zzso zzso zzso as calculated separately for mouth closing and opening movements and eye movement, showed no significant different zzso and zzso We did not find any activity in the superior zzso zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that human zzso is active in the perception of both mouth and eye zzso Viewing mouth and eye movements elicits no significant differences in zzso activity, indicating that the perception of movement of facial parts is probably processed in the same zzso 

zzso activities in the human zzso zzso by viewing mouth movement were clarified by zzso
