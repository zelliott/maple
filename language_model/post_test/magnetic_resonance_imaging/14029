There is evidence of reorganization of zzso maps following cortical zzso in zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso However, there has been a striking lack of research on zzso plasticity following cerebral damage in adult zzso We describe two individuals with left zzso damage who zzso the locations of tactile stimuli whose presence or absence they can readily zzso We find that the zzso preserve the relative topography of zzso experiences, resulting in shifted and compressed representations of the hand zzso These results not only provide evidence for systematic zzso of zzso maps in humans, they also reveal that the systematic changes in cortical topography that have been documented using zzso methods may give rise to similarly systematic changes in zzso perception zzso
