A MR method is presented for measuring pulse wave zzso zzso and its application to assessing zzso in the human zzso zzso This one-dimensional zzso flow displacement method applies a single zzso comb zzso to the vessel, followed by an zzso frequency zzso zzso each zzso providing a zzso projection of the vessel, enabling one to track fluid zzso The currently implemented sequence excites nine slices within a zzso length of vessel and has a zzso resolution of zzso zzso and a total acquisition time of 140 zzso zzso zzso plots show zzso flow displacement zzso corresponding to fluid motion at each of the zzso zzso The zzso can be reliably calculated by zzso these zzso to a zzso In zzso studies using zzso tubes demonstrate no significant difference between results obtained using this method and those directly obtained using pressure zzso Compared to another MR method previously developed in our laboratory, the proposed method displays improved zzso resolution and enhanced ability to extract zzso from vessels exhibiting low peak flow zzso zzso data suggest that this method is feasible for in zzso application and may provide a more accurate zzso of zzso wave zzso among subjects exhibiting low peak flow zzso such as the elderly or those with impaired cardiac zzso
