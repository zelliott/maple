The purpose of this study was to apply image registration and zzso to standard zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso protocols in an attempt to improve the detection of minor changes in low grade zzso zzso Thirteen patients with low grade zzso zzso and minimal or no apparent change on serial zzso scans were zzso recruited for the zzso zzso pairs of images were compared zzso sequences in zzso and zzso sequences in zzso The image pairs were zzso zzso and zzso Three independent zzso assigned zzso ratings according to the dominant volume change for zzso registered and zzso image zzso There was a statistically significant improvement in the detection of zzso volume change using zzso registration and zzso and zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso The zzso and increased sensitivity of zzso images relative to zzso images were most apparent when registration was zzso Smaller degrees of low grade zzso zzso volume change are zzso using image registration and zzso techniques that can be applied successfully to images acquired with standard clinical zzso
