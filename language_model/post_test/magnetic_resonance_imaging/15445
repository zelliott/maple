To evaluate cerebral zzso zzso in patients with symptomatic unilateral middle cerebral artery zzso high-grade zzso or zzso using dynamic zzso contrast zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso was performed in 28 patients with symptomatic unilateral zzso high-grade zzso or zzso zzso parameters including relative cerebral blood flow zzso relative cerebral blood volume zzso relative mean transit time zzso and time to peak zzso were calculated and compared between the zzso or zzso side and zzso zzso Seven of the 28 patients underwent surgery or zzso therapy, and zzso changes between zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were found in the zzso or zzso zzso territories in all 28 zzso zzso differences were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso between the zzso or zzso side and the zzso zzso However, no significant difference was observed in zzso zzso In the seven patients with surgical or zzso therapy, the values of zzso and zzso significantly decreased after surgery or zzso therapy zzso 

zzso may be a useful tool for evaluating and monitoring cerebral zzso zzso in patients with symptomatic unilateral zzso high-grade zzso or zzso
