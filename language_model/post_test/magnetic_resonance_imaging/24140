The purpose of this study was to evaluate MR imaging findings of primary zzso zzso to compare them with zzso findings, and to determine if these findings help differentiate primary zzso zzso from other disorders that result in zzso liver zzso 

MR imaging was performed in 40 patients (27 men, 13 zzso age range, zzso years; mean, 47 zzso with primary zzso zzso over a zzso zzso In 16 patients who underwent zzso zzso transplantation and in seven patients who underwent needle zzso correlation was made between MR imaging and zzso zzso 

zzso signal changes in the liver zzso were seen on zzso images as peripheral zzso zones of increased signal intensity in 29 patients zzso as a zzso pattern in 15 patients zzso and as zzso zzso in 16 patients zzso zzso zzso involved the right lobe in three patients zzso and the left lobe in 11 patients zzso zzso of the zzso lobe was seen in nine patients zzso Features of portal hypertension were seen in 14 patients zzso zzso assessment showed zones of zzso zzso and zzso on the periphery of the zzso 

zzso zzso areas of high zzso signal intensity and zzso of zzso ducts are characteristic MR features of primary zzso zzso zzso correlation suggests that these features may be related to underlying zzso changes and zzso duct inflammation in patients with primary zzso zzso
