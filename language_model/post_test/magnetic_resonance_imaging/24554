The zzso profile of the head has a major effect on zzso signals, but zzso the zzso for the most important zzso skull, is only poorly zzso In zzso modeling studies, errors in modeled skull zzso have been considered to have a zzso effect on zzso source zzso However, as zzso models are very restrictive, those results cannot be generalized to other source zzso zzso In this work, we studied the sensitivity of zzso and combined zzso source zzso to errors in skull zzso using a distributed source model and zzso zzso zzso We used a zzso modeling zzso that reflected state-of-the-art practices of experimental zzso zzso surfaces were segmented and zzso zzso anatomical head models were constructed, and forward models were built with zzso boundary element method while varying the skull zzso zzso zzso and MN spatial filter zzso were compared across zzso and the zzso and spatial spread of the MN zzso were assessed using intuitive resolution zzso The results showed that the MN zzso is robust against errors in skull zzso the zzso had a moderate effect on zzso of lead fields and spatial filter zzso but the effect on corresponding zzso was zzso The zzso performance of the zzso or combined zzso MN zzso was only minimally affected by the zzso error, while the spread of the estimate varied zzso Thus, the uncertainty with respect to skull zzso should not prevent researchers from applying minimum norm zzso to zzso or combined zzso zzso Comparing our results to those obtained earlier with zzso models shows that general judgment on the performance of an imaging zzso should not be based on analysis with one source zzso method zzso
