Several studies have reported a higher zzso of learning and behavioral difficulties in association with frontal lobe zzso in children with benign childhood zzso with zzso spikes zzso We studied serial changes in frontal and prefrontal lobe volumes using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging in zzso with or without cognitive zzso and behavioral problems and evaluated correlations between prefrontal lobe growth and active seizure zzso zzso changes in regional cerebral volumes were measured in two patients with cognitive zzso and behavioral problems zzso and five patients without zzso deficits zzso Eleven normal subjects zzso old) served as zzso Volumes of the frontal and prefrontal zzso were determined using a zzso and the zzso lobe volume ratio was zzso zzso and prefrontal lobe volumes revealed growth zzso in zzso compared with zzso and control zzso In addition, zzso lobe volume ratio increased serially in zzso similarly to controls, but was stagnant or decreased in zzso zzso growth also revealed more rapid recovery in a zzso patient with shorter active seizure zzso These findings suggest that longer active seizure period as frequent zzso coupled with the occurrence of frequent zzso may be associated with prefrontal lobe growth zzso which relates to zzso zzso
