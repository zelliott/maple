In zzso magnetic fields, liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso spin systems exhibit line zzso dominated by their natural zzso Chemical shifts become zzso and zzso zzso zzso show predominantly the zzso zzso zzso However, weak polarization and zzso zzso down to a few zzso require special zzso such as zzso zzso zzso Devices zzso that also enable the simultaneous detection of broad band zzso of zzso spin zzso We acquired zzso of zzso and zzso zzso at detection fields varying from zzso zzso to zzso zzso after zzso the sample in a field of 250 zzso Down to a zzso zzso frequency of 40 zzso the zzso of zzso exhibited four clearly resolvable zzso The zzso simulation agreed well with the measured zzso zzso zzso exhibited two major groups of zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso below 150 zzso the separation of the two groups zzso reflecting the transition from zzso to strongly coupled spin zzso zzso determination of zzso from the peak separation is possible only at zzso zzso above 150 zzso The experimental setup allowed an easy adjustment of the detection field over several zzso This enabled us to adapt the detection field to the zzso measurement window providing the maximum spectral zzso zzso zzso may open new applications, such as monitoring zzso zzso zzso imaging, simultaneous zzso zzso or quantum zzso
