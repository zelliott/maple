Recent studies suggest that zzso disease is associated with cardiovascular and peripheral vascular zzso However, little is known about the underlying zzso and the relation with cerebrovascular disease or brain zzso in the zzso 

To determine if plasma zzso hormone zzso levels are associated with vascular brain changes and cortical zzso in the zzso 

Community based, zzso zzso 

268 participants of the Memory and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso years of age and without zzso for magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso 

The presence of brain zzso and zzso was determined using a standardized zzso zzso an established rating scale and a single zzso Plasma zzso levels were assessed using standard laboratory zzso The association between plasma zzso levels and zzso findings was analyzed using zzso and linear zzso zzso 

Higher zzso levels within the normal clinical range were significantly associated with zzso cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso and a higher proportion of zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso These associations were independent of potential zzso including zzso hormone therapy, in multivariable zzso zzso No association between plasma zzso levels and both zzso outcomes were observed in zzso In addition, neither in men nor in women was an association between zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels even within the normal clinical range are associated with zzso brain zzso and zzso vascular zzso in elderly zzso
