zzso overgrowth is one of the major residual zzso after the treatment of zzso zzso The present study was designed to determine the zzso factors for zzso overgrowth at skeletal maturity in patients with the zzso Medical records and zzso of 45 zzso disease patients who were treated with zzso therapy at our institution were reviewed zzso zzso analysis was carried out to determine the zzso for zzso overgrowth using the zzso zzso for continuous variables and the zzso test for zzso zzso Independent zzso zzso were identified using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso defined as zzso distance less than zzso zzso was observed in 10 patients zzso There was a strong correlation between the final zzso outcome and zzso overgrowth zzso zzso pillar height was the only statistically significant predictor for zzso overgrowth at skeletal maturity in zzso and zzso zzso The risk for the development of zzso overgrowth was much greater in the lateral pillar C hip zzso than in the lateral pillar B or zzso hip zzso For the patients with decreased lateral pillar zzso a careful follow-up is necessary to make an early decision of zzso zzso of the greater zzso
