zzso measurement of neural currents by means of zzso can potentially open a high zzso resolution zzso zzso window zzso for monitoring dynamics of zzso activity without loss of the high spatial resolution afforded by zzso Previously, we have shown that the alternating balanced steady state imaging zzso high sensitivity to weak periodic currents zzso to its amplification of periodic spin phase zzso This technique, however, requires precise synchronization of such zzso to the zzso zzso zzso we extend alternating balanced steady state imaging to multiple balanced alternating steady states for zzso of neural current zzso zzso and phantom experiments show that the zzso profile of the multiple alternating steady state signal carries information about the frequency content of driving zzso In addition, the method is less sensitive than alternating balanced steady state to precise zzso timing relative to zzso zzso Thus, multiple alternating steady state technique is potentially zzso to MR imaging of the zzso of periodic zzso zzso
