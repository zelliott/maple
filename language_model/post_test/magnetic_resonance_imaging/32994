The use of zzso imaging techniques for the zzso evaluation of zzso disorders is zzso The effectiveness of magnetic resonance zzso zzso for the evaluation of zzso disease, in particular, is well described in the zzso In addition, MR zzso has an evolving though less well documented role to play in the evaluation of other zzso diseases, including various benign and zzso zzso arising in isolation or in zzso syndromes such as zzso inflammatory conditions such as zzso and zzso zzso infectious zzso zzso disease, zzso disease, systemic zzso and zzso zzso MR zzso may be useful also for the evaluation of intermittent and zzso zzso zzso zzso of MR imaging over zzso zzso zzso for zzso evaluations include superb contrast resolution, lack of associated exposure to zzso radiation, ability to acquire zzso primary image zzso ability to acquire sequential image series over a long acquisition time, zzso imaging zzso and use of intravenous contrast media with better safety zzso MR zzso also allows dynamic evaluations of zzso zzso and zzso of areas of zzso narrowing and zzso masses by repeating sequences at different intervals after administering an additional amount of the oral contrast zzso zzso of MR zzso in comparison with CT include higher cost, less zzso more variable image quality, and lower spatial zzso The advantages and disadvantages of MR zzso performed with zzso of the oral contrast medium relative to MR zzso performed with infusion of the oral contrast medium through a zzso tube are less zzso
