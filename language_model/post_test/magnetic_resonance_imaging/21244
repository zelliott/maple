Growing skull fractures can be a challenging surgical problem facing pediatric zzso The goal of this manuscript was to describe an effective surgical method used to treat a growing skull zzso 

We present a case study of a 2-month-old boy who fell from his mother's arms and hit his head on the zzso he underwent zzso magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging before zzso with zzso zzso 

X-ray performed on admission revealed a zzso fracture with a gap of 8 zzso in the right frontal bone and a linear fracture in the right zzso zzso X-ray performed 37 days after injury demonstrated that the gap had increased to 25 zzso and the patient was diagnosed with a growing skull fracture of the right zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was performed on day zzso A combination of MR and CT images enabled the edge of the zzso tear to be plotted on a three-dimensional image of the skull, and this was used to estimate the location of the edge of the zzso tear on the zzso 

We achieved excellent outcomes in terms of zzso coverage and zzso zzso The combination of MR and CT images may be recommended for surgical repair of growing skull fracture in zzso
