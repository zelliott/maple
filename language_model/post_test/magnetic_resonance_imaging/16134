The notion of zzso stress causing reduced zzso size remains controversial in the zzso stress disorder literature, because human studies cannot discern the causality of zzso Here, we addressed this issue by using structural magnetic resonance imaging in rats to measure the zzso and other brain regions before and after zzso zzso restraint stress produced approximately zzso reduction in zzso volume, which was not observed in control zzso This decrease was not zzso correlated with baseline zzso volume or body zzso Total zzso volume and the sizes of the other brain regions and adrenal zzso were all unaffected by zzso This zzso zzso design study provides direct evidence that the zzso is zzso vulnerable and sensitive to chronic zzso
