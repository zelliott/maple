zzso zzso often respond to zzso but long term disease control is zzso The zzso administration of a chemotherapy agent with zzso properties such as zzso may increase the efficacy of zzso 

A dose escalation schedule of zzso was devised to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso of intravenous zzso when given on a zzso schedule during a course of zzso involved field zzso zzso zzso zzso twice daily to zzso zzso The starting dose was 20 zzso and the dose was increased by 15 zzso after every 3 patients provided no Grade 3 or 4 zzso to the National Institutes of Health Common zzso zzso toxicity zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso scans zzso and zzso were obtained before treatment and at the time of disease zzso Clinical entry criteria included an zzso scan demonstrating a diffuse intrinsic zzso tumor and a typical zzso history of evolving zzso zzso and a gait zzso zzso evidence of a high grade zzso was required for zzso brain stem zzso 

A total of 34 patients were zzso The median age of the patients was zzso years zzso zzso zzso and the median zzso duration was zzso months zzso zzso zzso The zzso was 110 zzso or a total cumulative dose of zzso zzso over 7 zzso The zzso toxicity was zzso The median progression free survival was 8 months zzso zzso zzso and the overall survival was 12 months zzso zzso zzso At last follow-up there were 5 long term survivors zzso who remained in continuous zzso after a mean follow-up period of 79 months zzso zzso zzso Fifteen of the 29 patients zzso with recurrence and or disease progression developed zzso tumor spread beyond the local radiation zzso 

The cumulative zzso for zzso is zzso zzso when administered zzso with involved field, zzso zzso in a zzso schedule for 7 zzso zzso Phase II and III clinical trials can be conducted safely at this zzso
