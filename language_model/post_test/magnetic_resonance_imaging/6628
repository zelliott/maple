Women with zzso zzso in zzso or zzso are known to be at substantially elevated risk for breast zzso With increasing acceptance of genetic testing, significant numbers of zzso carriers are being identified, but evidence-based guidelines for the management of women at zzso risk are zzso This article reviews the most commonly recommended zzso employed in breast cancer surveillance for women at increased zzso It is apparent that the standard techniques of breast zzso clinical breast examination, and zzso are zzso for the identification of zzso breast zzso At least half of the zzso in this population appear to be detected by physical examination in the intervals between routine zzso zzso Host factors zzso breast zzso and tumor features zzso zzso zzso likely contribute to the relative zzso of zzso These factors may be zzso by the deployment of screening techniques for breast cancer such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance zzso However, the effect of incremental screening on either stage at diagnosis or breast cancer mortality has not been zzso In addition, the impact of the relatively limited specificity of these techniques on the quality of life zzso of women at risk has not been zzso Further research is needed to evaluate the effect of incremental zzso screening on zzso to delineate the best way to integrate the different zzso in terms of sequencing and frequency, and to identify interventions that will minimize the impact of intensive surveillance programs on the zzso of the women engaged in zzso
