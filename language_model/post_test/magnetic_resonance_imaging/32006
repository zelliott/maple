This work was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of using a zzso phased array for zzso zzso zzso under magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wide by 15 zzso zzso operating at zzso zzso were spread around the periphery of a zzso zzso The head of the zzso was covered with a zzso thick latex balloon attached using zzso zzso This envelope was inflated with zzso water to provide acoustic zzso between the zzso and the zzso The underlying operating principle of this zzso is to rotate a plane ultrasound beam zzso For this purpose, eight adjacent zzso were excited with appropriate delay times so as to generate a plane zzso The exposure direction was changed by exciting a different set of eight zzso zzso zzso experiments conducted on 47 samples of pig liver under MR temperature monitoring demonstrated the ability of this zzso to generate zzso or zzso zzso zzso at depths up to 19 zzso with excellent angular precision by applying 20 zzso MR zzso was performed in zzso with segmented zzso imaging zzso echo zzso The zzso resolution was approximately 3 zzso zzso The average value for the temperature baseline in liver tissue close to the zzso was zzso degrees C zzso zzso degrees zzso The zzso dose delivered in zzso was zzso zzso during temperature zzso Excellent MR zzso was demonstrated, all MR acquisitions were performed without zzso artifacts or zzso zzso with the ultrasound zzso zzso zzso identified on zzso follow up showed good correlation with online MR zzso zzso The individual differences between zzso performed visually and using zzso zzso dose maps were about zzso of zzso This study demonstrated the feasibility of zzso zzso using a phased array zzso ultrasound zzso and zzso MR zzso
