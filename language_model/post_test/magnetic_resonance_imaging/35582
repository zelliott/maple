zzso biases in emotional processing are a major characteristic of zzso Recent research has shown that such negative biases are evident in high risk individuals even in the absence of personal history of depression, suggesting that they may serve as key vulnerability markers of zzso However, the neural basis of these zzso observations has not been fully zzso This study therefore aimed to zzso illustrate the neural processes involved in the zzso of emotional zzso words; and zzso examine whether these neural mechanisms are biased towards negative information in high risk zzso zzso for depression was defined by high zzso zzso We recruited a sample of high risk zzso N) and low risk zzso N) zzso young zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was acquired during the zzso and memory for positive and negative zzso zzso words zzso honest, zzso High risk volunteers showed greater responses in the right superior zzso zzso than low risk volunteers specifically during the zzso of negative zzso Moreover, zzso score was positively correlated with neural responses in the left anterior zzso during the zzso of negative words but zzso correlated within the same region during the retrieval of these zzso These results highlight a role of the zzso zzso in emotional processing and further suggest that negative biases in these neural processes may be involved in risk for zzso
