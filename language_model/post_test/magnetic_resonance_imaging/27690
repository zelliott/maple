Two recent reviews of the zzso literature on creativity have pointed to inconsistent findings across studies, calling into question the usefulness of the theoretical zzso motivating the search for its neural zzso However, it is argued that consistent patterns of neural zzso do emerge when the cognitive process and the zzso method are kept uniform across zzso To demonstrate this zzso the zzso likelihood zzso zzso method was used to conduct quantitative zzso of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments of zzso and metaphor - two processes related to creativity and included in the recent zzso The results demonstrated that zzso and metaphor reliably activate consistent but zzso brain regions across zzso zzso The implications of the findings for cognitive theories of zzso and metaphor are zzso Furthermore, these results demonstrate that to the extent that creativity has zzso sources, its neural zzso will vary as a function of the underlying cognitive zzso
