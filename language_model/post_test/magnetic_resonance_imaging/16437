zzso zzso is a rare disorder characterized by formation of zzso bodies within the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso secondary to a zzso zzso zzso Recent literature has described using only an anterior approach to the ankle for these zzso It is unclear how well, if at all, zzso of the zzso part of the ankle joint was zzso Most zzso occur years after surgery, as a result of incomplete zzso 

We treated five patients zzso age zzso years; range, 21 to zzso four male, one zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso We performed zzso loose body removal and total zzso using both zzso and anterior ankle zzso zzso At latest followup of a mean of zzso zzso 13 to zzso months, the functional result was assessed with the zzso zzso 

The zzso score improved from a mean of 67 zzso 58 to zzso points to a mean of 94 zzso 77 to zzso zzso zzso patient satisfaction was good to zzso We noted only one minor complication when a loose body was lost in the subcutaneous zzso and was removed two weeks after the zzso 

Our experience in this small group of patients seems to indicate that a 2 portal approach with total zzso and removal of loose bodies gives the best result and zzso the risk of zzso
