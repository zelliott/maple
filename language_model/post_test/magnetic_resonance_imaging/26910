To investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the diagnosis of small pancreatic zzso 

This study involved 31 patients with proven invasive zzso cancer of the zzso The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the maximum diameter of the zzso zzso zzso tumor size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The relationships between the zzso and various diagnostic tools, including zzso with dual time point zzso were zzso 

The tumors ranged from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso Thirty of the 31 patients zzso had a positive zzso zzso There were 5 patients classified as zzso 15 as zzso and 11 as zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso were zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso The sensitivity of zzso was significantly higher in comparison to CT and zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean standardized zzso values zzso did not show a significant difference in relation to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All the zzso tumors (from 13 to 20 zzso showed higher zzso in zzso with dual time point evaluation in the delayed phase compared with the early phase, which suggested the zzso were zzso 

These results indicate that zzso with dual time point evaluation is a useful zzso for the detection of small pancreatic zzso with a diameter of less than 20 zzso
