The zzso approach to zzso brain zzso has unparalleled potential for uncovering genetically and temporally resolved zzso mechanisms of higher brain zzso In order to zzso investigate the large and complex zzso brain, an zzso probe, or zzso must be inserted deeply, which requires the zzso to be not only long and stiff, but also sharp and smooth to reduce possible tissue zzso This study presents a zzso zzso zzso that encloses optical fibers within its insulation zzso zzso fibers and a zzso wire were tightly bound to each other and zzso coated with a smooth, thin layer of zzso This design satisfied the structural requirements for use in deep brain zzso The performance of the zzso was then examined in the zzso of the rat and zzso monkeys which were injected with zzso zzso carrying the zzso yellow fluorescent protein zzso zzso With zzso zzso via the optical zzso zzso expression was detected clearly in zzso which was confirmed by zzso analysis in the zzso With zzso and zzso recording, zzso zzso activities were isolated in the zzso The depth distribution of these units and the peak of the zzso zzso profile overlapped consistently with each zzso Thus, by developing a new probe, zzso methodology was successfully applied to a zzso zzso zzso This smooth zzso zzso is a promising tool for chronic in zzso experiments with various research targets including deep brain structures in behaving zzso
