zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso nude mice displayed growth zzso or zzso of up to 52 zzso In the study reported here, implanted zzso zzso were used for testing the role of zzso and vascular maturation in triggering the initiation of tumor zzso The zzso and impact of zzso maturation and zzso in zzso and growth of zzso zzso zzso were studied zzso by zzso contrast zzso MR data were supported by zzso zzso for zzso zzso as a blood pool marker and zzso muscle zzso zzso as marker for zzso mural zzso Although the tumor periphery showed higher levels of total and mature zzso than normal skin, the fraction of mature out of the total vessels as detected by zzso vascular maturation index zzso was significantly lower in the tumor both before and after tumor exit from zzso The zzso induced by the implanted zzso was unstable and showed cycles of vessel growth and zzso Surprisingly, this instability was not restricted to the immature vessels, but rather included also zzso of mature zzso During zzso zzso was predominantly peripheral with no zzso into the implanted zzso zzso of zzso positive zzso cells into the zzso was associated with functional zzso and tumor zzso Thus, zzso zzso and vascular maturation are an important checkpoint linking the zzso switch with initiation of tumor zzso
