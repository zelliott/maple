The zzso of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data to study the brain functions deals mainly with two zzso signal detection and extraction of the zzso zzso Signal detection consists of exploring and detecting those areas of the brain that are triggered due to an external zzso zzso of the zzso response deals with describing and measuring the zzso process of activated regions in the brain due to zzso The zzso response represents the change in oxygen levels since the brain functions require more zzso and oxygen upon stimulus that implies a change in blood zzso In the literature, different approaches to estimate and model the zzso response have been zzso These approaches can be zzso in model structures that either provide a proper representation of the obtained zzso but provide no or a limited amount of zzso information, or provide zzso insight but lacks a proper fit to the zzso In this paper, a novel model structure is studied for describing the zzso in zzso zzso fractional zzso We show that these models are flexible enough to describe the gathered data with the additional merit of providing zzso zzso
