What makes us become zzso A popular hypothesis is that if cortical zzso fire in zzso at a certain frequency band zzso we become aware of what they are zzso We tested this hypothesis adopting zzso techniques with good zzso resolution and zzso zzso Specifically, we examined the degree to which increases in zzso synchronization zzso in the gamma band were associated with awareness of a stimulus (its zzso and/or the emotional content of the zzso We observed increases in gamma band zzso within zzso cingulate, zzso zzso zzso cingulate, and superior zzso zzso to stimuli available to conscious zzso However, we also observed increases in gamma band zzso within the amygdala, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to emotional relative to neutral zzso irrespective of their availability to conscious zzso This suggests that increased gamma band zzso is related to, but not sufficient for, zzso
