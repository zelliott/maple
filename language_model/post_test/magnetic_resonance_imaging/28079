zzso syndrome, characterized by generalized zzso zzso and cerebrovascular zzso is an zzso zzso We evaluated clinical, laboratory, zzso and zzso findings in a series of 17 patients to improve diagnostic criteria for zzso zzso 

Patients with generalized zzso zzso and cerebrovascular events were included in the zzso All underwent neurological and zzso examination, skin zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging as well as magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and a comprehensive laboratory zzso 

zzso stroke was present in eight patients, and 15 reported transient neurological zzso zzso resonance imaging yielded cerebral abnormalities in 16 of 17, whereas zzso zzso scans were abnormal in only 12 of 16 zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed more zzso in individual patients than did zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso demonstrated patent zzso vessels in 16 of 17 zzso zzso biopsy showed distinct zzso findings in all zzso The involved vessels were small to zzso arteries at the border between zzso and zzso Early inflammatory reactions were followed by zzso proliferation and a late zzso zzso Laboratory examinations showed impaired zzso clearance in eight patients, whereas all other laboratory tests, including zzso zzso were zzso 

In this series, magnetic resonance imaging and skin biopsy were useful for confirmation of the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso resonance findings were not specific, but the high sensitivity for detection of zzso brain zzso helped to confirm the diagnosis in patients with transient zzso zzso features of skin zzso were characteristic if appropriate techniques were zzso
