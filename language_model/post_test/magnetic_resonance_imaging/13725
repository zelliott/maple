The performance modeling of zzso zzso at high magnetic fields of zzso T and more requires a physical approach that goes beyond conventional lumped circuit zzso The treatment of zzso and currents as variables in time and space leads to a coupled transmission line model, zzso the electric and magnetic fields are assumed zzso in planes zzso to the length of the zzso but zzso along its zzso zzso In this work a zzso transmission line zzso model is developed and successfully applied to analyze a zzso unloaded and loaded zzso line zzso electromagnetic zzso zzso zzso for animal zzso The loading involves a homogeneous zzso zzso insert of variable radius and zzso This model zzso is capable of zzso the resonance spectrum, field zzso and certain types of losses in the zzso while requiring only modest zzso zzso The boundary element method is adopted to zzso all relevant transmission line parameters needed to set up the transmission line zzso Both the theoretical basis and its engineering zzso are discussed and the resulting model predictions are placed in context with zzso A comparison between a conventional lumped circuit model and this distributed zzso is conducted, showing significant departures in the resonance response at higher zzso This zzso model is applied to simulate two zzso animal zzso one of zzso inner diameter, tuned to 200 zzso zzso T for zzso zzso and one of zzso inner diameter, tuned to both 200 and 300 zzso (7 zzso
