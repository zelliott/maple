To investigate the feasibility of zzso zzso in acute zzso artery zzso 

We reviewed a consecutive series of patients in whom zzso zzso was performed during the period from 1994 to zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso was done in an attempt to zzso the zzso artery in a series of nine patients with zzso artery zzso admitted to the zzso intensive care zzso At the time of initial assessment, all nine patients had major zzso deficits attributable to zzso zzso including two patients with zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso artery system was successful in seven of the nine patients (a range of 2 to 13 hours after the zzso Failure to zzso the zzso artery occurred in two patients, who died after progressing to zzso Complete recovery or only minimal zzso deficits were demonstrated in five of the nine zzso Despite zzso of the zzso artery, two patients had no major change in their zzso function, and both ultimately had severe zzso and were fully dependent on zzso A zzso zzso occurred in one patient but without clinical zzso Two patients had a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso in acute zzso artery zzso resulted in zzso in seven of the nine patients zzso Five of the nine patients recovered fully, including two patients who had had zzso zzso In light of the devastating natural course of acute zzso artery zzso these initial results are encouraging and indicate that zzso zzso may be a useful emergency treatment, even in patients with prolonged symptoms of zzso (up to 12 zzso
