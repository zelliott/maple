We examined the zzso effects caused by active and passive movements of toes and by zzso zzso zzso moving of the toe without actual zzso on zzso evoked magnetic fields zzso following stimulation of the zzso zzso nerve in normal zzso Active and passive movements significantly attenuated the zzso and zzso cortical components zzso zzso zzso with no zzso change, and the effects of the active movements were larger than those of the passive zzso In contrast, the subsequent zzso component with a zzso of about 100 zzso was enhanced only by the active zzso zzso both zzso and zzso mechanisms should be zzso The gating effects by movements on all components may occur in the primary sensory zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso because all of the equivalent current zzso zzso of the components in the zzso and each zzso zzso were located zzso Active movements of the toes zzso to the zzso nerve caused no significant gating zzso The zzso components were not consistently changed by zzso zzso but the middle- and zzso components were zzso Their zzso were located in the zzso zzso to the zzso nerve and in the zzso in bilateral zzso zzso we speculated that brain responses to zzso zzso particularly components generated in zzso were affected by zzso zzso
