zzso resonance imaging zzso of the zzso zzso including zzso was performed in 25 patients suspected of having dissection of the zzso zzso zzso was correlated with zzso CT and zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso was most closely followed by CT and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The specificity of zzso and zzso was equally good, at zzso zzso zzso was able to demonstrate the zzso zzso in all 9 cases of zzso zzso and there were no zzso zzso zzso of zzso and slow flow was possible on zzso density images, zzso echo images permitted detection of the entry and re-entry zzso The nature of the dissection was zzso correctly in 8 out of 9 zzso zzso is capable of providing all the relevant parameters necessary to decide appropriate treatment of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
