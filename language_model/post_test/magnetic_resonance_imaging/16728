The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes and zzso zzso function in infants with zzso high zzso zzso treated with zzso assisted zzso zzso zzso 

From January 2004 to July 2007, 33 patients zzso boys and 5 girls, age ranging from 3 to 10 zzso with high zzso zzso underwent zzso Clinical data of the zzso group were zzso compared with those treated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the same time zzso zzso function of these patients was evaluated using the following 3 zzso the Kelly score, zzso zzso volume zzso and magnetic resonance imaging between the ages of zzso and zzso zzso 

The mean operative time in zzso and zzso groups was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean length of hospital stay in the zzso group was shorter than that of zzso group zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso days, P zzso zzso No significant difference was observed between zzso and zzso groups regarding the Kelly score zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso Although magnetic resonance imaging revealed lower zzso rates of zzso in the zzso group than those of the zzso group at both zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso levels, this was not statistically different zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso group, lower zzso index, larger zzso volume, and higher zzso canal pressure at rest and during voluntary squeeze were observed in zzso group zzso zzso zzso However, there were no significant differences in the length of zzso zone zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and the presence of zzso relaxation zzso zzso vs zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can be achieved in patients with zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso assisted zzso zzso has advantages over zzso including shorter hospital stay and better position of zzso However, long-term follow-up is necessary to compare the benefits of zzso against zzso
