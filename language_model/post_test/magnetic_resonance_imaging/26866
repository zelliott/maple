zzso stem cells represent one promising source for cellular zzso In this study, we used cardiac magnetic resonance to examine the ability of highly enriched zzso zzso derived from zzso embryonic stem cells zzso to form zzso and improve zzso function of zzso rat zzso 

zzso enriched zzso were obtained by inducing cardiac differentiation of zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso resistance zzso At the time of zzso enriched zzso expressed zzso markers and markers of developing zzso but only zzso of them were zzso A growth zzso vehicle solution or zzso (5 to 10 million) suspended in the same solution was injected into zzso rat hearts 1 week after zzso zzso zzso zzso size was measured by cardiac magnetic resonance 1 day after zzso zzso Compared with vehicle treatment, treatment with zzso improved global zzso function 1 and 2 months after injection and significantly increased zzso function in initially zzso areas and border zzso zzso confirmed successful zzso and the persistence of zzso zzso that also expressed zzso muscle zzso zzso sites were observed between grafted zzso but only rarely between grafted and host zzso No zzso were observed in any of the zzso 

zzso enriched and zzso zzso were safe, formed stable zzso and zzso a long-term recovery of global and regional zzso zzso function after zzso
