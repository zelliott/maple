We hypothesized that the zzso zzso zzso is critical for making zzso zzso zzso the logical operation that if A zzso B and B zzso C, then A zzso zzso To test this, participants with focal zzso damage, zzso comparison participants, and zzso normal participants completed a zzso zzso task consisting an ordered set of arbitrary zzso Participants first learned through zzso the relationships of the patterns zzso zzso A zzso zzso B, zzso B zzso zzso zzso After initial learning, participants were presented with novel pairings, some of which required zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso C from the relationship zzso We observed that zzso damage led to a specific deficit in zzso zzso suggesting that an intact zzso is necessary for making normal zzso zzso Given the usefulness of zzso in zzso social zzso this deficit may be one of the basic features of social conduct problems associated with zzso zzso
