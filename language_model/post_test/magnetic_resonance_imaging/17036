When searching for a target object presented in a context of other, irrelevant objects, the zzso between target and surrounding context elements as well as the similarity between context elements themselves affect search zzso The present functional imaging study explored the cortical mechanisms involved in processing the same target when surrounded by context arrangements of varying zzso zzso showed that brain activity increased in the zzso zzso zzso and the middle zzso zzso as context zzso and local feature contrast zzso zzso with low zzso and local feature contrast, compared to contexts with high zzso and local feature contrast, increasingly involved areas near the corpus zzso and the zzso frontal zzso The results support the assumption that contextual grouping and local target detection both contribute to perform the visual search zzso
