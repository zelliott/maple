To evaluate zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with very large liver zzso or with liver tumors located adjacent to the liver zzso 

In this prospective zzso phase II trial, we treated 20 patients (19 liver zzso and one zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso All patients demonstrated no functional liver degradation prior to zzso zzso criteria were liver tumors zzso 5 zzso zzso A, zzso zzso 11, no upper zzso or liver tumors zzso or zzso 5 zzso adjacent to the liver zzso zzso B, zzso zzso zzso zzso planning for zzso was performed with three zzso zzso CT data acquired after zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging follow-up was performed 6 weeks and every 3 months post zzso zzso zzso were zzso local tumor control zzso of tumor growth after treatment followed by shrinkage of the zzso starting at 6 zzso and zzso zzso 

The mean tumor diameter was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in group A, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in group zzso On average, a minimal dose of 17 zzso in the target volume was applied zzso zzso zzso Severe side effects were recorded in two patients zzso One patient demonstrated an zzso zzso caused by tumor zzso after zzso of a zzso adjacent to the zzso duct zzso One patient developed zzso zzso that was treated by a single blood zzso and has zzso We frequently encountered moderate increases of liver zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso without clinical symptoms and thus considered to be zzso The median follow-up was 13 zzso In group A zzso zzso 5 zzso primary local tumor control after 6 and 12 months was zzso and zzso zzso in group B, it was zzso and zzso zzso All but one local recurrence (in a patient with diffuse tumor zzso were successfully treated during another zzso zzso leading to a primary assisted local control of zzso after 12 zzso 

zzso zzso based on individual dose plans and zzso CT data sets generated encouraging results in large liver zzso as well as in tumors located adjacent to the liver zzso
