To evaluate the cortical response to visual stimulation in patients with age-related zzso zzso zzso 

We conducted a prospective functional zzso study at zzso zzso in ten patients presenting with unilateral or bilateral zzso and five zzso zzso The visual stimulus was a sequence of resting phase zzso of a fixation point on a black background) followed by an zzso phase zzso at 2 zzso zzso data were recorded with zzso significant zzso response secondary to zzso zzso was statistically determined using the zzso 99 zzso 

The first objective was to estimate the feasibility of a functional study in the zzso zzso and patients complained about the duration of the examination, although each of the two active functional sessions lasted only zzso zzso The central point fixation was impaired for the zzso some deviated their gaze to center the fixation point on a zzso retinal zzso Because of substantial movement during zzso acquisitions, the data from two patients and one control were withdrawn from statistic zzso 

This study is one of the few evaluations reported on functional zzso in the elderly, because of technical constraints, patient fragility and their zzso zzso zzso the visual stimulus and the paradigm of zzso repeating patient information and support have helped demonstrate significant cortical zzso response in most subjects, even in the most affected zzso zzso of the visual zzso by functional zzso appears feasible in the zzso pathology of the elderly, providing an adapted management of the zzso zzso
