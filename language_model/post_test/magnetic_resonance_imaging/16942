The zzso pattern of the zzso zzso zzso is characterized by a remarkable zzso zzso that likely reflects zzso traits and genetic aspects of zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the zzso zzso pattern of patients with schizophrenia zzso and healthy controls zzso to determine group differences in zzso zzso pattern as well as gender differences between zzso 

zzso zzso patients zzso zzso and zzso HC zzso zzso matched on age and zzso were analyzed using magnetic resonance zzso The zzso pattern was classified into type I, II, or III based on the guidelines set by zzso and zzso in a previous zzso zzso analysis was used to investigate group and gender differences in the zzso pattern distribution, and zzso zzso was used to explore clinical zzso 

The distribution of zzso zzso pattern in HC zzso the results found in the previous study (left, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso right, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in that there were no gender zzso Moreover, the distribution in zzso was in accordance with that in the previous study (left, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso right, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Additionally, within zzso patients with the type III pattern had a higher total positive and negative syndrome scale score zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso In contrast, the distribution in the right zzso in the zzso group differed significantly from that observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but did not differ from HC zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso pattern is altered in zzso but not in zzso possibly reflecting gender differences in early zzso
