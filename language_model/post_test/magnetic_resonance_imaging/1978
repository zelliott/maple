We demonstrate that regions within human prefrontal zzso develop zzso models for patterns of events occurring in the sensory zzso zzso viewed a random zzso sequence of images, each presented zzso and each requiring a different button press zzso zzso occurred by chance within the presented series of zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we identified activity evoked by viewing a stimulus that interrupted a zzso zzso zzso was evoked by violations of both repeating and alternating patterns, and the zzso of this zzso increased with increasing pattern zzso zzso of repeating patterns, but not of alternating patterns, activated the zzso zzso
