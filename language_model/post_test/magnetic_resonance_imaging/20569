zzso disorder is a psychiatric disorder that starts in zzso The mechanism of action of zzso the most common treatment for attention deficit zzso disorder, is zzso In zzso the affinity of zzso for the zzso zzso zzso is higher than that for the zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study was to use zzso zzso zzso to measure the occupancy of brain zzso zzso by zzso in zzso in zzso 

We used zzso zzso zzso to determine the effective dose 50 zzso of zzso for zzso In a zzso design, healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso received zzso zzso zzso and zzso 10, and 40 zzso of zzso 75 zzso before zzso zzso Dynamic zzso zzso zzso imaging was performed for 2 hours with the High Resolution Research zzso The zzso reference tissue model with zzso zzso as the reference region was used to estimate binding potential zzso zzso in the zzso and other zzso zzso 

zzso was reduced by zzso in a zzso manner in zzso and other zzso zzso The global zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso therefore, the average clinical maintenance dose of zzso zzso zzso produces zzso to zzso occupancy of zzso 

For the first time in humans, we demonstrate that oral zzso significantly occupies zzso at clinically relevant zzso The zzso is lower than that for zzso zzso zzso suggesting the potential relevance of zzso zzso in the therapeutic effects of zzso in zzso zzso
