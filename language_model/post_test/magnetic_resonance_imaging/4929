To test efficacy and safety of zzso in subjects with clinically isolated syndrome zzso 

zzso with zzso were enrolled in a phase II, zzso zzso zzso zzso trial testing 80 zzso zzso on clinical and brain zzso zzso Brain zzso were performed zzso The primary zzso zzso was development of zzso 3 new zzso zzso or one clinical zzso within 12 zzso zzso meeting the zzso were offered additional weekly zzso zzso zzso 

Due to slow zzso enrollment was discontinued after 81 of 152 planned subjects with zzso were zzso and initiated study zzso Median zzso zzso numbers of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso A total of zzso of zzso recipients zzso zzso zzso met zzso compared to zzso of zzso recipients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Eleven zzso subjects zzso and 7 zzso subjects zzso met the zzso by clinical zzso zzso of subjects who did not develop new zzso zzso up to month 12 or to starting zzso was zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso of remaining free of new zzso zzso was significantly greater in the zzso group compared with zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso of remaining free of zzso zzso tended to be higher in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Overall, zzso was well zzso No clear zzso effect of zzso plus zzso was observed on zzso zzso 

zzso treatment significantly decreased development of new brain zzso zzso zzso activity, although it did not achieve the composite clinical and imaging zzso 

This study provided Class II evidence that zzso did not reduce the proportion of patients with zzso meeting imaging and clinical criteria for starting zzso therapy after 12 months, compared to zzso In an analysis of a secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with a reduced risk for developing new zzso zzso
