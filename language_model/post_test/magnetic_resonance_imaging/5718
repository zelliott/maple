We present a fully automated phase zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso for high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso is a region growing method and uses separate quality maps for seed finding and zzso which are retrieved from the full complex information of the zzso We compared our zzso with an established method in various phantom and in zzso data and found a very good agreement between the results of both zzso zzso zzso however, was significantly faster at low signal to noise ratio zzso and data with a more complex phase topography, making it particularly suitable for applications with low zzso and high spatial zzso zzso UN is freely available to the scientific zzso
