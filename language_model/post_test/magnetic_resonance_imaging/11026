To determine the characteristics of magnetic resonance zzso signals of normal growing cartilage and identify the difference in zzso relaxation times between zzso and zzso cartilage in zzso 24 zzso zzso of 12 zzso zzso were zzso on a zzso zzso GE MR zzso zzso was made between signal intensity on MR images and the structure shown in corresponding zzso zzso zzso values were measured in eight zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that MR imaging delineated five regions between the secondary zzso center and the zzso which zzso zzso to the zone of provisional zzso of the secondary zzso center, zzso of the secondary zzso center, zzso cartilage, zzso and zone of provisional zzso The zzso value in the zzso cartilage was much larger than that in the zzso cartilage zzso It is concluded that zzso findings could differentiate the different regions of growing zzso zzso is longer in zzso than in zzso cartilage, perhaps reflecting differences in water binding by zzso
