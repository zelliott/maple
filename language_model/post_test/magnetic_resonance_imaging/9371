Human behavior displays zzso zzso simple actions zzso into zzso zzso which work together to accomplish overall task zzso Although the neural zzso of such hierarchy have been the target of increasing research, they remain poorly zzso We propose that the zzso supporting zzso behavior may relate to those in zzso reinforcement learning zzso a zzso framework that extends zzso mechanisms into zzso zzso To test this, we leveraged a distinctive prediction arising from zzso In ordinary reinforcement learning, reward prediction errors are zzso when there is an unanticipated change in the prospects for accomplishing overall task zzso zzso zzso that prediction errors should also occur in relation to task zzso In three zzso studies we observed neural responses consistent with such zzso reward prediction zzso within structures previously implicated in reinforcement zzso The results reported support the relevance of zzso to the neural processes underlying zzso zzso
