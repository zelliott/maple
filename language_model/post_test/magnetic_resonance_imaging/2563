To zzso the zzso changes and zzso dynamics of regional functional MR imaging signals during voluntary hyperventilation using blood oxygen zzso contrast zzso zzso 

Seven male subjects were studied during voluntary hyperventilation zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso regulated by zzso zzso were made on zzso zzso MR images obtained with parameters of zzso zzso zzso time), flip angle of 30 degrees, and zzso size of 3 zzso 3 zzso 5 zzso zzso of the functional MR imaging signal to changes in zzso time delays in relation to zzso changes, and time zzso of functional MR imaging signal changes were assessed on a zzso zzso 

Within 20 seconds of starting zzso rapid and substantial decreases in the functional MR imaging signal (by as much as zzso were measured in areas of gray matter, which were significantly greater than the modest changes observed in white zzso zzso effects in areas of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were stronger than in zzso regions or in the zzso Signal decreases measured with functional MR imaging were significantly delayed with respect to the reduction in zzso zzso differences between regional time zzso did not reach statistical zzso 

Regional and zzso matter differences in functional MR imaging signal changes during controlled hyperventilation may reflect differences in zzso activity, vascular regulation, and/or zzso zzso When measuring brain zzso with functional MR imaging, zzso zzso differences due to zzso zzso may confound interpretation of zzso functional MR imaging signal zzso
