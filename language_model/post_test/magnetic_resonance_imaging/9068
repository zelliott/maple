zzso zzso zzso is mainly performed in children with catastrophic zzso and pre-existing severe zzso It is accepted that mainly patients at young ages with more or less complete loss of their hand function are suitable candidates for zzso However, we feel that FH should be considered also in some adults with devastating unilateral zzso zzso 

We report four cases of adults who underwent FH because of their intractable zzso zzso Three of the four patients had reduced but not complete loss of hand zzso zzso zzso of the zzso ratio still led to the decision to perform FH in order to achieve complete seizure zzso 

All patients had a surgical outcome of Engel class zzso one of them suffered from zzso zzso zzso zzso which were treated successfully by zzso No clinically relevant complications zzso 

We wish to point out that FH is a possible surgical option in cases with catastrophic zzso in zzso Patients and relatives should strongly consider that the likelihood of at least zzso impaired hand function or other zzso additional zzso may be zzso by the chance of freedom of zzso in a limited number of zzso In all of our cases, patients and relatives agreed that the surgical outcome led to a marked improvement of quality of life and that it had been the right decision to proceed with FH in spite of the expected negative impacts of the zzso Video examples of the zzso and zzso hand function of one sample patient are zzso
