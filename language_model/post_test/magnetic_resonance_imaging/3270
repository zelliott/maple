Medical images often consist of zzso objects corrupted by random noise arising in the image acquisition zzso Thus, image zzso is one of the fundamental tasks required by medical imaging zzso zzso means zzso method provides a powerful framework for zzso In this work, we investigate an zzso zzso scheme based on the patch zzso zzso for medical imaging zzso In contrast with the traditional zzso algorithm, the proposed zzso zzso zzso scheme has three unique zzso First, we use a restricted local zzso where the true intensity for each noisy zzso is estimated from a set of selected zzso zzso to perform the zzso zzso Second, the weights used are calculated thanks to the similarity between the patch to zzso and the other patches zzso Finally, we apply the steering kernel to preserve the details of the zzso The proposed method has been compared with similar zzso methods over synthetic and real clinical medical images showing an improved performance in all cases zzso
