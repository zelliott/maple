In zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso tracking of zzso plays an important role in monitoring and understanding numerous human diseases with high zzso zzso In this work, zzso iron oxide zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso values of the zzso obtained at a magnetic field of 3 T were zzso 196 and 516 zzso zzso , zzso The high zzso ratio can be expected to provide enhanced MR zzso The zzso were readily taken in by zzso and the high iron zzso was confirmed via zzso Blue zzso and zzso by zzso coupled plasma mass zzso zzso No significant zzso was found even at a high zzso loading of zzso zzso zzso per zzso A linear relationship between zzso and zzso values and the number of zzso labeled cells was observed in zzso As a result of the significantly higher zzso than zzso effects, an in zzso detection threshold of about zzso labeled cells was achieved with short labeling time and low zzso concentration using a clinical 3 T zzso zzso Thus, the zzso can be potentially useful as magnetic resonance zzso for targeting and tracking zzso
