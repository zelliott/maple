A statistically zzso way of conducting brain network analysis is still zzso zzso of different populations of brain networks is hard because zzso is inherently dependent on wiring cost, where cost is defined as the number of edges in an zzso zzso In this paper, we evaluate the benefits and limitations associated with using zzso zzso zzso Our focus is on comparing populations of weighted zzso zzso that differ in mean association weight, using global zzso Our key result shows that zzso over cost is equivalent to controlling for any zzso transformation of the weight set of a weighted zzso That is, when zzso over cost, we eliminate the differences in zzso that may be due to a zzso transformation of the weight zzso Our result holds for any zzso zzso measure, and for any choice of distribution over cost zzso zzso is therefore helpful in zzso differences in cost from differences in zzso By contrast, we show that the use of the weighted version of a zzso metric is generally not a valid approach to this zzso Indeed, we prove that, under weak conditions, the use of the weighted version of global efficiency is equivalent to simply comparing weighted zzso Thus, we recommend the reporting of zzso differences in weighted costs and zzso differences in zzso zzso measures with respect to different zzso over the cost zzso We demonstrate the application of these techniques in a zzso of an zzso working memory zzso We also provide a zzso Carlo method for zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we discuss the limitations of zzso zzso over cost, which may pose problems when some weights are zero, when zzso exist in the ranks of the zzso and when one expects subtle zzso zzso differences, which could be masked by zzso
