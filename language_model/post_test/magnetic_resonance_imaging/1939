zzso MR imaging zzso of the cervical spinal zzso was carried out in 13 healthy zzso A cold stimulus was applied, at different times, to three different sensory zzso regions zzso the right hand and zzso the thumb side of the palm, the little finger side of the palm, and the zzso below the zzso zzso of these areas is expected to involve the zzso zzso and zzso cervical spinal zzso segments zzso Whereas true zzso are expected to zzso to the region being zzso false zzso such as arising from noise and motion, are zzso The results demonstrate that zzso of active zzso into groups based on their intensity time courses discriminates false zzso from true zzso Following zzso the distribution of activity observed with zzso matched the expected regions of zzso zzso with the different areas of stimulation on the hand and zzso
