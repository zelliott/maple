zzso syndrome is associated with structural brain abnormalities and language zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether the superior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso both parts of the zzso zzso for language, are abnormal in zzso zzso 

The authors examined zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures of the superior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso for 17 zzso patients with zzso syndrome and 17 matched healthy comparison zzso For the subjects with zzso syndrome, the correlations of the superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes with performance on tests of language function were zzso 

The zzso zzso volume of the patients with zzso syndrome was smaller than that of the healthy subjects, even after differences in whole brain volume were controlled zzso The volume of the superior zzso zzso in the zzso syndrome patients was zzso similar to that of the comparison zzso For the subjects with zzso syndrome, neither superior zzso zzso nor zzso zzso volume was significantly correlated with performance on language tests after total brain volume was controlled zzso 

In zzso syndrome, zzso zzso volume may be selectively smaller than normal, although the effect of this volume deficit on language is not zzso
