Two infants with zzso zzso deletion syndrome were noted to have zzso enlarged zzso fissures on zzso zzso We compared the size of the zzso fissures in zzso studies from 17 other subjects with del zzso to zzso disease zzso The mean anterior zzso distance was used as an index of zzso zzso zzso zzso enlargement of the zzso fissures was present in 10 of 17 subjects with del zzso The zzso pattern, as well as follow-up scans in 2 patients, suggests delayed growth of the zzso region in these zzso zzso with del zzso consistently had disproportionate enlargement of the left zzso zzso compared to the zzso This observation suggests that a gene (or zzso in the deleted region affects the development of the left and right zzso zzso in different zzso zzso development of the zzso may explain some of the zzso features that are common among individuals with zzso deletion zzso
