zzso zzso made of modified zzso starch have a zzso zzso zzso into which water can penetrate with time to form a zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging was used to study the water penetration and the swelling of the zzso of these zzso The zzso immersed in water were zzso at different time intervals on a 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso images show clearly the swelling of the zzso and the water concentration zzso The rate zzso for water diffusion and the tablet swelling were extracted from the experimental zzso The water diffusion process was found to follow case II zzso at 25 degrees zzso zzso imaging also provided spin density profiles of the water penetrating inside the zzso
