While the prognosis of patients with zzso zzso remains poor despite recent therapeutic advances, variable survival times suggest wide variation in tumor biology and an opportunity for zzso zzso We used zzso analysis and zzso to measure the spatial relationship between zzso zone zzso proximity and survival in a cohort of 39 newly diagnosed zzso zzso We collected zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance images zzso at zzso zzso zzso therapy, and zzso therapy time points, measured tumor volumes and distances to the zzso and collected clinical zzso zzso and zzso Cox zzso showed that tumors involving the zzso and tumor growth rate during radiation therapy were independent zzso of shorter zzso and overall zzso These results suggest that zzso in close proximity to the zzso surface of the zzso convey a worse zzso observation that may be useful for zzso zzso
