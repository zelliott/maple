To evaluate a zzso zzso acquisition protocol and a new image rating scale for disease severity in patients with progressive zzso zzso zzso and multiple systems zzso zzso in a large zzso zzso 

The zzso protocol consisted of two-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso weighted zzso The 32 item zzso scale evaluated abnormalities within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso blind to zzso Among 760 patients in the study population zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had per protocol images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reliability were assessed through Cohen's zzso and scale structure through principal component analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso Internal consistency and reliability were zzso zzso and zzso zzso of extracted factors and total scores were tested for disease severity as per clinical zzso 

zzso and zzso reliability were acceptable for 25 zzso of the items scored zzso zzso zzso revealed four meaningful clusters of zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso other zzso zzso with good to excellent internal consistency zzso zzso zzso and moderate to excellent reliability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The total score significantly zzso for disease severity or zzso zzso scores zzso zzso for disease severity according to diagnosis zzso zzso zzso zzso The total score was significantly related to survival in zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicating good zzso zzso 

The scale is suitable for use in the context of zzso studies and can reliably and consistently measure zzso abnormalities in zzso and zzso Clinical Trial Registration Number The study protocol was filed in the open clinical trial registry zzso with ID No zzso
