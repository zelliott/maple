This paper proposes an efficient zzso scheme for zzso zzso medical zzso zzso The scheme uses 3-D motion zzso to create a zzso zzso data to be compressed by a 3-D image zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso A new block distortion measure, called zzso of residual zzso and three 3-D fast block matching zzso are used to improve the motion zzso process in term of speed and data zzso The 3-D image zzso process involves the application of two different zzso techniques based on the zzso of input zzso Our method can achieve a higher zzso and faster zzso time compared to other zzso zzso methods producing similar zzso zzso The combination of 3-D motion zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso contributes to the good zzso
