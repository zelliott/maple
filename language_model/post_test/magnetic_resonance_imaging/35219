The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the zzso probe level on the acoustic zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso thresholds for a zzso zzso stimulus were obtained from 40 young adults with normal hearing using an experimental system at four zzso probe levels zzso 75, 80, and 85 zzso zzso with a repeated measures experimental zzso 

A repeated measures analysis of zzso revealed that as the probe level increased over this zzso range, there was a mean decrease in zzso threshold of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the largest decrease for an individual participant of 12 zzso 

The results suggest that the level of the zzso probe tone as used in clinical zzso zzso and as specified in the American National zzso Institute zzso standard is sufficiently high to affect the acoustic zzso by zzso its zzso The effect is small, on average, but may be of clinical significance for some zzso
