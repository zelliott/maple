In this article, we review the use of zzso F zzso zzso resonance zzso for in zzso tracking of zzso and zzso in the course of tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso by zzso and are readily detected by zzso F zzso Because of the lack of any zzso F background in the body, observed signals are robust and exhibit an excellent degree of zzso As a consequence of progressive zzso of the labeled zzso cells into inflamed areas, zzso of inflammation can be localized as hot spots by simultaneous acquisition of zzso matched zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The identification of inflammation by zzso F zzso a time when the inflammatory cascade is zzso the possibility for an early detection and more timely therapeutic zzso Since signal intensity in the zzso F images reflects the severity of zzso this approach is also suitable to monitor the efficacy of pharmaceutical zzso Because zzso are zzso zzso and the zzso nucleus exhibits high magnetic resonance zzso sensitivity, zzso F zzso may be zzso for clinical inflammation zzso
