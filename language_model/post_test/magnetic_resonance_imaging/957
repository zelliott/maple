The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of standard zzso MR images alone in the diagnosis of zzso tears of the knee and in combination with other imaging zzso 

zzso patients (55 men, seven zzso age range, zzso zzso with a prior zzso examination who underwent zzso surgery of the knee during a zzso period were included in the study zzso Images were independently reviewed for identification of zzso tears by two musculoskeletal zzso blinded to zzso zzso zzso for zzso evaluation included zzso zzso fast zzso zzso density, zzso zzso fast zzso zzso density, and zzso fast zzso zzso density with zzso to zzso slice zzso Imaging groups for evaluation were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso reported a confidence level for the presence or absence of zzso tear in all imaging groups based on a zzso zzso zzso analysis considered zzso and lateral zzso zzso 

Forty patients had zzso zzso tears, and 16 had lateral zzso tears at zzso For zzso and lateral zzso tears, the accuracy zzso and zzso zzso of imaging in the zzso plane was comparable to other imaging groups but the mean confidence levels zzso and zzso zzso were zzso In one patient, the zzso plane alone correctly showed that no tear was zzso No statistically significant difference was observed between imaging plane groups of both zzso in the diagnosis of zzso tears zzso zzso zzso The zzso plane increased the accuracy of zzso and zzso planes of lateral zzso when zzso 

In standard knee zzso zzso the zzso imaging plane may be valuable for the detection and characterization of zzso zzso
