zzso of the zzso in zzso is associated with the development of new zzso and clinical relapses and zzso the presence of active zzso It is most commonly detected as enhancement on MR imaging performed with contrast agents that are costly and occasionally zzso We investigated whether the zzso status in white matter zzso may be indirectly zzso via examination of features on zzso and zzso images obtained before the injection of a contrast zzso 

We considered 93 brain MR imaging studies on 16 patients that included zzso zzso and zzso zzso images and predicted zzso wise enhancement after intravenous injection of a zzso zzso We then used these zzso predictions to determine the presence or absence of abnormal enhancement anywhere in the zzso 

On a zzso basis, enhancement can be predicted by using zzso measures with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso At the zzso level, enhancement can be predicted with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In many cases, breakdown of the zzso in acute zzso zzso may be zzso without the need to inject an MR imaging contrast zzso The zzso relies on intrinsic properties of tissue damage in acute zzso Although contrast studies are more accurate, they may sometimes be zzso
