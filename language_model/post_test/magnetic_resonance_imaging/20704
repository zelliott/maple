To determine if magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso is useful in the diagnostic zzso of muscular zzso and idiopathic inflammatory zzso for describing the topography of muscle zzso 

MR imaging was performed in 31 zzso 8 with zzso zzso types 1 zzso or 2 zzso 11 with zzso muscular dystrophy, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso protein zzso 3 with Becker muscular zzso and 9 with idiopathic inflammatory zzso including zzso zzso and sporadic inclusion body zzso 

Analysis of zzso images enabled us to describe the most affected muscles and the muscles usually spared for each muscular zzso In particular, examination of zzso zzso and leg muscles demonstrated significant differences between the muscular zzso On STIR images, zzso were present in zzso of our patients with muscular zzso 

A specific pattern of muscular involvement was established for each muscular zzso zzso observed on STIR images zzso fatty zzso and are not specific for inflammatory zzso
