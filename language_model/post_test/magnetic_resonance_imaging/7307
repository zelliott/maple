zzso studies have demonstrated an association between zzso zzso treatment and brain structure in human zzso A crucial unresolved question is whether this association reflects direct zzso effects of Li or indirect effects secondary to treatment or prevention of episodes of bipolar disorder zzso 

To address this knowledge zzso we compared manually traced zzso volumes in 37 BD patients with at least 2 years of Li treatment zzso group), 19 BD patients with zzso months of lifetime Li exposure over 2 years ago zzso zzso and 50 healthy zzso All BD participants were followed zzso and had at least 10 years of illness and a minimum of five zzso We established illness course and long-term treatment response to Li using National Institute of Mental Health zzso life zzso 

The zzso group had smaller zzso volumes than the controls or the Li group zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso However, the time spent in a mood episode on the current mood stabilizer was more than three times longer in the Li than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Even zzso patients with BD episodes while on Li had zzso volumes comparable to healthy controls and significantly larger than zzso patients zzso zzso zzso corrected p zzso zzso 

Our findings support the zzso effects of zzso The association between Li treatment and zzso volume seems to be independent of long-term treatment response and occurred even in subjects with episodes of BD while on zzso zzso these effects of Li on brain structure may zzso to patients with zzso illnesses other than zzso
