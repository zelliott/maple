A zzso method for zzso left zzso zzso zzso using zzso mesh models reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging is zzso The underlying geometry of the zzso mesh is obtained by using a zzso fitting method, and its zzso is performed by using a zzso shape zzso To achieve zzso we have performed detailed studies of the effects of zzso zzso selection on the accuracy of this method with in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso We have found that zzso calculations based on a zzso selection can accurately depict anomalies in zzso shape despite the presence of noise due to manual image zzso Our studies show that patients after zzso zzso exhibit significant zzso shape zzso in terms of zzso in particular at the zzso The zzso change in regional zzso was significantly lower suggesting regional differences in zzso due to zzso zzso This approach may add new insights into zzso deformation and enable better discrimination between normal and zzso zzso
