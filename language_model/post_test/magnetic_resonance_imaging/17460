Twenty-five to 50% of the patients with zzso zzso are potential candidates for zzso zzso zzso ultrasound has been employed to guide the zzso 

To evaluate this method in liver surgeries and compare it to other imaging zzso 

Thirty-five patients (20 zzso with median age of 56 zzso with zzso zzso were zzso studied between February 2001 and July zzso Patients had as primary zzso zzso cancer zzso neuroendocrine tumors zzso zzso cell zzso zzso melanoma zzso others zzso Each patient was submitted to at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso ultrasound was performed in all patients in order to detect liver zzso The number and location of liver zzso were compared to zzso zzso 

zzso ultrasound was useful in 23 zzso of the 35 surgeries and changed the planned surgical strategy in 9 zzso There was a statistical significant correlation between the mean number of zzso identified by zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso We found no statistical difference between magnetic resonance imaging and zzso ultrasound in identifying zzso zzso Fifty-five zzso were submitted to zzso zzso the gold standard method and zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso zzso ultrasound identified zzso of the smaller than zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso of them, zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso ultrasound is crucial in the evaluation and decision making in zzso zzso zzso ultrasound presents the highest sensibility in the detection of zzso zzso compared to other imaging methods, especially for small zzso
