The zzso mouse has a genetically zzso disease to zzso muscular zzso in zzso The disease zzso however, is not accompanied by the same level of fatty zzso and muscle zzso as occurs in zzso Thus, the presence of zzso changes in living zzso mice has been difficult to zzso We zzso zzso density and the zzso relaxation time of zzso with a resolution of 195 zzso 195 zzso 1000 zzso using zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging at 7 zzso These relaxation data were correlated with water content in both muscle and brain of zzso and zzso No differences were observed in zzso The zzso muscles had increased water content and zzso density and decreased zzso relative to zzso These data indicate that there are intrinsic changes in zzso (opposite to that which would be induced by fatty zzso and suggest that zzso imaging could be used to monitor progression and treatment in this animal zzso
