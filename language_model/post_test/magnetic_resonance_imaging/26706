zzso zzso signals zzso zzso within many zzso functional networks not only in awake humans and lightly zzso primates but also in animals under deep zzso characterized by zzso electroencephalogram zzso activity and zzso To understand the neural origin of spontaneous zzso fluctuations under such a deep zzso state, zzso zzso and cerebral blood flow zzso were simultaneously recorded from the bilateral zzso cortical regions of rats with zzso zzso zzso zzso Strong zzso zzso was observed between spontaneous zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which were also highly synchronized across the 2 zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to image spontaneous blood oxygen zzso zzso signals under the same zzso conditions and showed similar zzso zzso and dependence on zzso depth as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso correlations indicate a strong but zzso coherent network covering a wide range of cortical zzso The overall findings reveal that the spontaneous zzso fluctuations under unconscious zzso zzso conditions originate mainly from underlying neural zzso They provide insights into the zzso basis for the use of zzso and zzso zzso signals for zzso imaging spontaneous and zzso brain activity under various brain zzso
