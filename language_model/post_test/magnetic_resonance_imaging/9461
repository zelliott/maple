When using dental zzso systems, a zzso remains in the jaw after removal of the zzso In some cases, zzso magnets may be removed, whereas zzso magnets are zzso fixed on a natural tooth zzso The goal of this paper is to identify the impacts of the duration and orientation of exposure on these magnets in a zzso or 3 zzso zzso 

For this study, 30 zzso and 60 zzso magnets were zzso During the first experiment, they were exposed with free orientation for 64 zzso During the second experiment, the magnets were fixed in position and exposed at zzso and 3 zzso while aligned in a parallel or zzso zzso 

While the duration of exposure in zzso is zzso the orientation is zzso The coercive field strength of these zzso and zzso zzso is not sufficient to reliably withstand zzso in a zzso or zzso zzso when aligned in an zzso zzso At zzso zzso magnets were reduced to zzso zzso and zzso magnets to zzso zzso of their initial zzso At zzso all magnets were zzso 

As a zzso the worst-case scenario, zzso an zzso orientation, should be assumed when using a zzso zzso If an zzso can be postponed, the general dentist should remove zzso zzso If there is a vital indication, irreversible damage to the magnets is acceptable in consultation with the patient since the replacement costs are irrelevant given the underlying zzso
