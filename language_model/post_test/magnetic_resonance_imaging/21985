Very high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at a 4 zzso zzso magnetic field was used to map zzso dominance regions in the human visual cortical layers using the blood oxygen level dependent zzso contrast zzso The zzso response from primary visual zzso zzso exhibited a distribution of zzso dominance reminiscent of the zzso recordings of zzso and zzso zzso could be grouped into seven categories varying from zzso response to zzso response to zzso zzso zzso responses were found in the zzso draining veins as well as in the zzso Although large vessel zzso signals are easily zzso regardless of field strength, they demonstrate a zzso response to zzso input that could not be used to distinguish zzso zzso The difference in zzso response between a region activated by one eye and that activated by the other is only zzso on zzso This zzso the use of a difference paradigm to zzso the regions of zzso dominance zzso The data show that zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso activity in cortical columns when using differential techniques, opening up the possibility of mapping specialized populations of zzso in humans that are not accessible to zzso or other methods of invasive zzso
