The field of zzso zzso zzso has made great advances in recent years, converting thought to movement, with some of the most successful zzso measuring directly from the motor zzso However, the ability to record from additional regions of the brain could potentially improve flexibility and zzso of zzso In addition, zzso of the future will benefit from zzso zzso into the control zzso Here, we examine whether changes in passively induced zzso movement zzso are represented in different regions than zzso zzso via a MR compatible robotic zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso five healthy participants were exposed to combinations of zzso movement zzso and zzso in a zzso design followed by an zzso zzso We found that primary and secondary zzso regions were zzso as well as zzso motor area, zzso and zzso with greater activity from changes in zzso compared to changes in zzso This represents the first investigation into whole brain response to zzso changes in passive movement zzso In addition to zzso zzso these results have implications towards neural zzso of robotic zzso
