The brain combines visual information from the two eyes and forms a coherent zzso even when zzso to the eyes are zzso However, it is not clear how zzso from the two eyes are combined in visual zzso We measured zzso responses to single zzso presented zzso or pairs of zzso presented zzso or zzso with several combinations of zzso zzso had either the same orientation or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed a demanding task at fixation to minimize zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso presentation of compatible zzso zzso zzso evoked greater activity than zzso presentation of a single grating only when contrast was low zzso A model that assumes linear zzso of activity from each eye failed to explain zzso responses at zzso contrast or zzso However, a model with zzso contrast zzso such that activity from each eye reduced the gain for the other eye, fitted the results very zzso zzso presentation of zzso zzso evoked greater activity than zzso presentation of a single grating for all zzso However, activity evoked by zzso zzso was equal to that evoked by zzso zzso zzso an onset zzso zzso one eye 500 zzso before the other, which under attentive vision results in flash zzso had no impact on the results; the responses to zzso and zzso zzso were again zzso We conclude that when attention is zzso zzso suppression in zzso can be explained by a zzso model in which the mutual suppression between zzso zzso does not depend on the eye of origin, nor on the onset times, and zzso suppression is weaker than zzso zzso zzso zzso
