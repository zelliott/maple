zzso zzso echo pulse zzso sequences are commonly used in dynamic zzso zzso zzso studies to measure the contrast agent concentration in a tissue of interest over zzso However, due to improper tuning of the zzso zzso concentration uncertainty can be very high, even at high zzso ratio in the MR zzso In this work, an zzso procedure is proposed for selecting the optimal value of the zzso angle zzso given the expected concentration zzso The zzso condition ensures that every concentration in the assumed range has the lowest possible zzso By decoupling the zzso and zzso caused by the presence of the contrast agent, a zzso plot has been generated from which zzso can be read off for any study zzso Investigation of ten recent zzso studies showed that improper flip angle selection unnecessarily increases the concentration uncertainty, up to zzso and zzso on average for the typical zzso concentration ranges of 0-2 zzso in zzso tissue and zzso zzso in blood, zzso zzso show that the reduced noise levels on the concentration curves, observed at the optimal flip angle, effectively increase the precision of the kinetic parameters estimates (up to zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso in the case of an individually measured zzso input function zzso up to zzso for zzso 59% for zzso and zzso for zzso in the case of a standard zzso In zzso experiments confirm the potential of flip angle zzso to increase the zzso of the kinetic zzso zzso
