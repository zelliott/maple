The CT, zzso and zzso initial and follow-up imaging findings in zzso zzso zzso virus type 2 zzso encephalitis were zzso 

The clinical, laboratory and imaging findings in 12 patients zzso girls and four zzso with proven zzso zzso encephalitis with follow-up were zzso zzso zzso of brain involvement and distribution of zzso were studied and the contribution of zzso imaging to the imaging diagnosis of this disease was zzso A total of 24 CT and 22 zzso studies were performed with a mean follow-up time of 38 zzso 

Neonatal zzso encephalitis can be zzso or limited to only the zzso zzso zzso or zzso The deep gray matter structures were involved in 57% of patients, and zzso was seen in more than half of the zzso CT images were normal or showed mild abnormalities in the early stages of the zzso Conventional MR images may be normal in the early stages of the zzso zzso were initially seen only by zzso imaging in zzso of the patients and this zzso showed a substantially more extensive disease distribution in an additional 50% of zzso In zzso of patients, watershed distribution zzso changes were observed in addition to areas of presumed direct zzso zzso 

Neonatal zzso encephalitis has a variable imaging zzso zzso zzso is an important adjunct in the imaging evaluation of this zzso Watershed distribution zzso in areas remote from the primary zzso zzso may be zzso
