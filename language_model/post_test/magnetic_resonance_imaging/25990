During the 1990s, novel magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques have emerged that allow the zzso and rapid assessment of normal brain functioning and cerebral zzso Some of these techniques, including zzso imaging and zzso imaging, have already been used extensively in specialized centers for the evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular zzso Evidence is now rapidly accumulating that both zzso and zzso imaging, particularly when used in combination with high-speed MR zzso will lead to improvements in the clinical management of acute stroke zzso Other novel MR techniques, such as zzso imaging, diffusion zzso imaging, and blood zzso zzso functional zzso have not yet assumed a definitive role in the diagnostic evaluation of cerebrovascular zzso However, they are promising research tools that provide zzso data about zzso evolution as well as mechanisms of stroke zzso In this article, we review the basic principles underlying these novel zzso techniques and outline their current and anticipated future impact on the diagnosis and management of patients with cerebrovascular zzso
