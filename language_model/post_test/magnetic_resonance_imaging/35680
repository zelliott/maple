The objective of this study was to zzso and compare zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso levels in the zzso of patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso with and without magnetic resonance imaging zzso evidence for zzso zzso sclerosis zzso zzso 

zzso age matched healthy controls and 26 consecutive patients with unilateral zzso based on intensive zzso zzso were investigated with zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso (17 with unilateral zzso sclerosis zzso in zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso For statistical analysis one-way analysis of zzso zzso with post hoc multiple comparisons and zzso correction was zzso The significance level was based on zzso 

The mean zzso level zzso to the seizure focus was significantly decreased in zzso negative, respectively zzso positive patients in comparison to healthy controls zzso The lowest zzso level was noticed in the zzso positive group zzso zzso analysis highlighted a clear zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso between zzso zzso and zzso negative patients and healthy zzso Mean level of zzso and zzso was not significantly elevated or zzso However, in individual cases a significant zzso was noticed for zzso in zzso negative patients, respectively for zzso in zzso positive zzso 

zzso negative zzso patients have a different MRS profile than zzso positive patients zzso with marginal but significant decrease of zzso Our results reveal a clear zzso zzso between the zzso The value of zzso and zzso in focus detection in zzso patients remains zzso
