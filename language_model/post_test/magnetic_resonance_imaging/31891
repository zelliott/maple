Although functional zzso zzso based on blood zzso zzso zzso signal changes is a sensitive tool for mapping brain zzso quantitative studies of the zzso effects of pharmacological agents using zzso alone are difficult to interpret due to the complexities inherent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso methodology is potentially a more powerful zzso probe of brain function, providing measures of the changes in cerebral blood flow zzso and the cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso In this study, we implemented a quantitative zzso approach for assessing the zzso response to improve the stability of repeated zzso in combination with the zzso zzso method, to examine the zzso and zzso responses to caffeine zzso Ten regular caffeine consumers were zzso before and after a zzso caffeine zzso A zzso zzso spin labeling technique was used to measure zzso and zzso responses to visual zzso caffeine consumption and mild zzso For a region of interest defined by zzso zzso to the visual zzso the results were: zzso increased zzso zzso zzso mean and standard zzso visual stimulation increased both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and caffeine decreased zzso zzso zzso with a zzso change in zzso zzso zzso The zzso between zzso and zzso was significantly different in response to visual stimulation compared to caffeine zzso A zzso zzso methodology using zzso * is a promising approach for evaluating zzso and zzso changes in response to pharmacological zzso
