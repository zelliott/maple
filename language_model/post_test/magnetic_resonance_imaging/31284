Many studies have shown widespread but subtle pathological changes in gray matter in patients with zzso Some of these studies have related specific zzso to the genesis of auditory hallucinations, particularly in the left superior zzso zzso but none has zzso the relationship between zzso data and a specific scale for auditory zzso The present study aims to define the presence and characteristics of structural abnormalities in relation with the intensity and zzso of auditory hallucinations by means of magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso method applied on a highly homogeneous group of 18 persistent hallucinatory patients meeting zzso criteria for schizophrenia compared to 19 healthy matched zzso Patients were evaluated using the zzso scale for auditory zzso zzso of gray matter concentration in patients to controls were observed in bilateral zzso bilateral superior zzso zzso and left zzso In addition, specific relationships between left inferior frontal and right zzso zzso reductions and the severity of auditory hallucinations were zzso All these areas might be implicated in the genesis and/or persistence of auditory hallucinations through specific zzso zzso zzso abnormalities may help to define reliable zzso zzso for the genesis and persistence of auditory zzso
