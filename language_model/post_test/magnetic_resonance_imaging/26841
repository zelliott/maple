zzso and rats with zzso zzso zzso zzso have zzso of the heart and the great arteries caused by neural crest zzso zzso during zzso zzso narrow jugular veins have been found in babies during zzso for zzso However, the zzso system has not been examined in depth so zzso We hypothesized that abnormal patterning and/or size of the zzso veins could occur in rats with zzso This hypothesis was tested by microscopic magnetic resonance imaging zzso a high-resolution tool able to detect subtle changes of vessels in small zzso 

zzso from pregnant rats fed either zzso zzso zzso or vehicle on zzso were recovered near zzso A zzso zzso system with a zzso zzso fast spin echo sequence allowed diagnosis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso high-resolution sequences made assessment of the pattern and zzso of zzso veins zzso zzso were corrected for body size by dividing them by the length of zzso zzso zzso The results in zzso and control zzso groups were compared by zzso tests zzso 

zzso zzso zzso fetuses were smaller than controls zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso for body zzso of left zzso both zzso right superior zzso zzso and zzso veins were significantly smaller in zzso rats than in zzso 

The zzso veins are normally patterned but zzso narrow (except the internal zzso in rats with zzso The same embryonic NC zzso that accounts for cardiovascular zzso could also explain these zzso anomalies in zzso
