zzso is the most sensitive imaging zzso in juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso but has practical zzso zzso the scanning protocol is, therefore, necessary to increase feasibility and patient zzso

Children were classified into two clinical zzso active arthritis zzso 1; zzso and inactive disease zzso 2; zzso zzso features were evaluated using a zzso score, zzso zzso zzso cartilage zzso bone zzso bone zzso changes, zzso fat pad zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso examination was successfully completed in all 47 zzso No scan was excluded due to poor image zzso zzso zzso was more frequent in group 1 zzso but was also seen in zzso of the knees in group zzso zzso fat pad zzso was more prevalent in group 2 zzso zzso zzso of the score was good zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso knee zzso is feasible in the assessment of disease activity in zzso children with zzso Signs differing among children with active and inactive disease include zzso fat pad zzso and zzso zzso
