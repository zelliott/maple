zzso complications secondary to iron overload remain a significant matter in patients with zzso dependent zzso 

To evaluate cardiac zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso was performed in 3 zzso of zzso dependent zzso 99 with zzso major zzso 20 with zzso zzso zzso and 10 with acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured and all patients underwent zzso zzso 

In TM patients cardiac zzso zzso values zzso 20 zzso were found in 37 zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with age zzso zzso and zzso with zzso values zzso zzso A positive correlation was found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso Out of 37 patients with zzso zzso 18 zzso had serum zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso 3 patients had cardiac zzso zzso zzso In AA zzso zzso zzso values were found in 2 patients, who received 234 and 199 zzso units, respectively, and were both on zzso therapy (in one patient zzso value was 399 zzso zzso values were zzso zzso but not significantly, with the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In our experience, 37% of TM patients had a zzso iron overload assessed by zzso zzso this value is higher than in zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement was a poor predictor of zzso zzso In patients with zzso more than 200 zzso units zzso were required to induce cardiac zzso in spite of zzso therapy and, in one patient, of normal zzso zzso
