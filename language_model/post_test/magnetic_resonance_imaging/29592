The article presents an zzso for calculation of flip angles in zzso experiments to generate echoes with zzso zzso based on the extended phase graph zzso The zzso can be used to zzso the echo envelope and thus the point spread function zzso in zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso zzso experiments while minimizing the total zzso zzso zzso at 3 T using echo trains with zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate a reduction in zzso power by a factor of 3-5 while maintaining high image zzso
