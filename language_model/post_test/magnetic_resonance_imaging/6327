zzso resonance zzso imaging of zzso zzso zzso due to a zzso aneurysm has been evaluated in relation to CT findings on 30 zzso In the acute stage, particularly less than 24 hours after the bleeding episode zzso zzso zzso appeared of high intensity relative to the surrounding brain on a zzso weighted zzso image but zzso where the corresponding CT scan showed blood zzso of zzso value over 60 zzso A zzso weighted zzso image was able to reveal subtle evidence of zzso not visible on the CT zzso The zzso weighted zzso image was not as zzso Blood zzso zzso greater than zzso appeared zzso but mild and moderate zzso zzso less than zzso was indistinguishable from normal zzso MR imaging was also sensitive to zzso and chronic zzso (5 zzso Three out of four zzso appearing normal on CT showed high intensity on zzso weighted zzso Thirteen out of 24 zzso zzso larger than 5 zzso in diameter on zzso were detected on zzso weighted zzso Smaller zzso less than 4 zzso were not zzso MR imaging was able to indicate the zzso one in cases of multiple zzso by showing zzso zzso more clearly than zzso We conclude that MR imaging is very helpful for diagnosing zzso particularly when CT is normal, and in indicating aneurysm location as well as zzso zzso
