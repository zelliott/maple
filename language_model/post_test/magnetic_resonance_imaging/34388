This study sought to determine whether volumes of the zzso and zzso are disproportionately smaller in subjects with zzso syndrome than in normal comparison subjects and whether volume reduction is greater in zzso syndrome subjects with zzso 

The subjects were 25 adults with zzso syndrome zzso with zzso and 25 cognitively normal adults who were individually matched on age, sex, and zzso zzso resonance imaging measures included volumes of the zzso amygdala, and total zzso zzso of the zzso syndrome subjects had follow-up scans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso syndrome subjects had significantly smaller volumes of the zzso but not the amygdala, than their comparison subjects, even when total brain volume was controlled zzso Volumes of both the zzso and the zzso were smaller in the zzso zzso syndrome subjects than in their comparison subjects, even when total brain volume was controlled zzso Age was not correlated with volume of the zzso or zzso among the zzso zzso syndrome subjects and the comparison zzso age was correlated with volume of the amygdala, but not the zzso among the zzso syndrome subjects with zzso Changes in volume over time were not statistically significant for either the zzso or the zzso zzso 

zzso volume, while disproportionately small for brain size in individuals with zzso syndrome, remains fairly constant through the fifth decade of life in those without zzso All subjects over age 50 who had zzso syndrome demonstrated volume reduction in the zzso as well as clinical signs of zzso zzso was also associated with volume reductions in the zzso that exceeded reductions in total brain zzso
