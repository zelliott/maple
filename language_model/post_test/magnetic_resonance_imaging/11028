To establish the zzso of a standardized region of interest zzso drawing procedure in delayed zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of cartilage zzso 

A large zzso in lateral and zzso zzso zzso cartilage was drawn in images of 12 healthy male volunteers by 6 investigators with different skills in zzso The procedure was done twice, with a zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso and zzso zzso 

The mean zzso zzso for both compartments ranged between zzso and zzso for the 6 different investigators without correlation to their experience in zzso zzso zzso zzso was low in both the lateral and the zzso zzso cartilage, zzso and zzso zzso The larger zzso in lateral than in zzso cartilage was related to slightly longer and thinner zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso are both low when a large standardized zzso is used in zzso The experience of the investigator does not affect the zzso which further supports a clinical zzso of the zzso
