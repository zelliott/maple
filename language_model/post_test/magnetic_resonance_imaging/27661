Current evidence suggests that older adults have reduced suppression of, and greater implicit memory for, distracting zzso due to age-related declines in zzso control zzso In this study, we used zzso to examine age differences in the neural zzso of zzso control and their relationship to differences in zzso and subsequent memory for zzso Older and younger adults were shown a rapid stream of words or zzso superimposed on objects and performed a zzso task on either the letters or the objects, while ignoring the other zzso Older adults were more distracted than younger adults by the overlapping words during the zzso task, and they subsequently showed more zzso for these words on an implicit memory zzso A zzso analysis of the imaging data revealed a set of regions, including the zzso zzso and inferior zzso cortex, that younger adults activated to a greater extent than older adults during the zzso condition, and activity in this set of regions was zzso correlated with zzso for the distracting zzso zzso connectivity analyses using right and left zzso zzso seeds revealed a network of putative control regions, including bilateral zzso cortex, connected to the frontal seeds at zzso Older adults showed reduced functional connectivity within this zzso network, suggesting that their greater zzso may be due to decreased activity and zzso within a cognitive control network that normally acts to reduce interference from zzso
