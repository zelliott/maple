zzso evidence implicates zzso transport zzso typified by the presence of zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso as an early event in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso Work identifying zzso precursor protein zzso as a zzso motor zzso for zzso zzso transport further implicates zzso transport in zzso zzso zzso zzso detects zzso transport dynamics in zzso zzso Here we pursue an understanding of the role of zzso in zzso transport in the central nervous system by applying zzso to zzso zzso and to the visual zzso in living mice zzso for either wild type or a deletion in the zzso gene zzso for each zzso Following zzso or zzso zzso injection, we performed zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso Three zzso whole brain zzso were compared on a zzso basis using zzso zzso zzso zzso of transport to structures connected to injection sites via zzso fiber tracts was also zzso zzso confirmed consistent placement of zzso injections and no zzso difference in zzso to the zzso zzso mice had significantly reduced transport from the zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso after zzso and reduced transport to the zzso zzso after 25 zzso zzso transport deficits in the zzso animals were also identified in the visual zzso These data support a zzso role for zzso in zzso transport within the central nervous system and demonstrate the power of zzso for assessing zzso zzso involved in memory and zzso
