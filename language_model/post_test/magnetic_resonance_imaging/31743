The origin of zzso zzso has always been a matter of zzso The aim of our study was to identify the nerve origin of this zzso 

Prospective case zzso This study was conducted at zzso zzso a private referral zzso for zzso and skull base zzso 

A total of 200 cases of zzso zzso were included in the zzso All the zzso were removed surgically zzso the zzso zzso The origin of the zzso was sought at the zzso of the internal auditory zzso 

A total of 200 consecutive cases was included in the zzso The origin of the zzso was limited to one nerve at the zzso in 152 cases zzso per zzso Out of these cases, the zzso originated from the inferior zzso nerve in 139 cases zzso per zzso from the superior zzso nerve in nine cases (6 per zzso from the cochlear nerve in two cases zzso per zzso and from the facial nerve in two cases zzso per zzso 

The vast majority of zzso zzso originate from the inferior zzso zzso the zzso of involvement of this nerve increases as the zzso size zzso An origin of zzso zzso from the inferior zzso nerve can be considered as one of the explanatory factors for the poor functional outcome of the extended middle zzso zzso approach, and probably accounts also for the better hearing preservation rate reported in some series for the zzso zzso
