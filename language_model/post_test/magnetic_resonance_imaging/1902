zzso measures of the zzso zzso and the zzso have been used to predict which zzso individuals with memory problems will progress to meet criteria for zzso on zzso but their relative accuracy remains zzso 

To compare zzso measures of the zzso zzso and the zzso for predicting who will develop zzso 

zzso volumes of the zzso zzso and the zzso were obtained in 137 individuals zzso four groups: 1) individuals with normal zzso both at baseline and after 3 years of follow-up zzso zzso zzso 2) subjects with memory difficulty but not zzso both at baseline and after 3 years of follow-up zzso zzso zzso 3) subjects with memory difficulty at baseline who were diagnosed with probable zzso within 3 years of follow-up zzso zzso zzso and 4) patients with mild zzso at baseline zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of both the zzso zzso and the zzso were different for each of the zzso comparisons between the groups zzso zzso zzso and were correlated with tests of memory zzso zzso zzso However, the volume of the zzso zzso differentiated the subjects from those destined to develop zzso with considerable accuracy zzso whereas the measure of the zzso did zzso 

These findings are consistent with zzso data showing substantial involvement of the zzso zzso in the zzso phase of zzso and suggest that, as the disease zzso zzso change develops within the zzso which is measurable on zzso
