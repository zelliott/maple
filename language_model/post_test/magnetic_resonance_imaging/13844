Conventional zzso analysis zzso methods now simplify the representation of lower limb geometry and electrical properties for body composition zzso In the present study, a three-dimensional model of the lower limb was assembled by zzso of magnetic resonance zzso images zzso for zzso zzso skeletal muscle, and zzso An electrical network was then associated with this zzso zzso and zzso zzso were made in six lean subjects (3 men and 3 women, age zzso zzso zzso zzso Assuming zzso zzso for the zzso zzso of the muscle, the model predicted in the examined subjects an zzso profile that zzso well to the zzso zzso zzso predicted and measured zzso were similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso P zzso not zzso The resistance profile zzso through a simpler model, muscle area estimates along the lower limb and total leg muscle volume zzso zzso zzso for men and zzso zzso for zzso with a mean of the absolute value of relative error with respect to zzso of zzso zzso zzso The new approach suggests that zzso can reasonably estimate the distribution and volume of muscles in the lower zzso of lean zzso
