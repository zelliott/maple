To characterize the zzso role of diagnostic imaging, and course in patients with zzso nerve zzso 

A retrospective review of medical records of all 6 patients with zzso nerve zzso who were seen at the Massachusetts Eye and zzso zzso Boston, from January 1, 1991, to July 31, zzso 

The initial visual acuity ranged from zzso to no light zzso All 6 patients underwent zzso including zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, or zzso zzso zzso was performed on 4 patients, and the condition of 1 patient was evaluated with color zzso zzso to assess the zzso nerve zzso In 1 patient, a zzso zzso scan was suggestive of an zzso nerve zzso zzso in the other 5 patients, including 2 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging, failed to demonstrate an zzso During a follow-up period of up to 25 months, 4 patients showed no improvement in visual zzso 1 patient improved from no light perception to bare light perception, and 1 patient improved from zzso to zzso 

These data suggest that final visual outcome was dependent on initial zzso visual zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were usually not helpful in establishing the presence of zzso nerve zzso although they may be useful in evaluating zzso zzso
