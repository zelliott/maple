We have established an imaging protocol in order to zzso the normal zzso structures in the zzso zzso Thirty volunteers without a history of car accident or head or neck trauma underwent MR imaging with zzso zzso sections in three zzso zzso The zzso ligaments were clearly seen in every case and had three different zzso in zzso round, zzso or zzso A broadening from lateral to zzso in the zzso plane was observed in all zzso The zzso ligament was clearly demonstrated in 26 out of 30 zzso The ligament was flattened where it arched across the zzso zzso the insertions the ligament twisted into an zzso zzso The lower zzso membrane had a median portion merging with the zzso and a lateral portion separated from zzso Between the zzso and zzso this membrane either merged totally with zzso or was partly separated from it by a thin layer of zzso The zzso zzso membrane was clearly zzso It either merged with the zzso or was partly or totally separated from it by a fat zzso The anterior zzso membrane was zzso seen and could not be zzso Our refined MR protocol improves the zzso of the zzso zzso structures, and may in the future give new insight into post-traumatic neck disorders up to now poorly zzso
