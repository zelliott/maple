It is well established that zzso activity is positively related to effective zzso memory zzso However, in biological systems often optimal levels of activity are contrasted by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso activity are commonly attributed to unsuccessful memory formation, whereas the zzso levels of zzso activity related to unsuccessful memory formation have been rarely zzso It is still unclear under what circumstances such zzso levels of zzso activity zzso To clarify this issue, we aimed at creating a condition, in which zzso zzso activity is associated with zzso zzso We assumed that such zzso activity occurs when zzso information is embedded in zzso distracting information, which can be considered as zzso 

In the present zzso study, we zzso neural zzso of zzso memory formation in a zzso design with zzso memory zzso remembered versus zzso and noise zzso by high versus low zzso as zzso zzso showed that zzso failure was associated with zzso activity in the zzso condition and with zzso activity in the low distraction zzso Thus, we revealed evidence for a zzso function relating zzso activity with zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that intermediate levels of zzso activity are optimal while both too low and too high levels appear zzso for zzso memory zzso zzso levels of zzso activity seem to occur when zzso information is added to zzso zzso If such zzso noise is reduced zzso zzso activity is lower and thus optimal for zzso memory zzso
