To define the state of different structures of the fractured zzso spine which may play a role in the immediate and long-term mechanical stability on MR images and to investigate the relationship of these findings with the zzso zzso of spinal zzso 

The state of the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso discs and the zzso body were defined using clinical, experimental and zzso zzso The state of these structures was reported for each fracture on the zzso examinations and the different zzso features appropriate for different fracture classes were zzso 

zzso examinations of 70 patients with 100 fractures of the zzso spine were used for this zzso 

Wide variations were seen in the state of the structures zzso We could not find a zzso pattern to relate these findings with the zzso zzso zzso 

MR findings should be integrated into future zzso schemes of zzso spine zzso This would enable specific data about the structures involved in the stability of the spine to be zzso Prospective studies using the criteria developed in this study may help resolve some of the controversies concerning the diagnosis and prognosis of these injuries as well as the development of new zzso zzso
