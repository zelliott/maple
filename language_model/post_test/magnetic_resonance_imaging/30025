In present study we determined the long term in zzso integration and zzso modeling of an in zzso engineered cartilage zzso zzso engineered zzso zzso tissue was cultured on calcium zzso zzso and implanted into zzso defects into the zzso zzso in zzso zzso follow-up was performed at 2, 8, 26 and 52 weeks, zzso were harvested 26 and 52 weeks zzso zzso of cultivated tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso was comparable to in zzso cartilage and cells produced in zzso cartilage specific zzso In zzso 26 and 52 weeks zzso defects were resurfaced with zzso zzso the implants were well integrated with no gap at the interface between the engineered zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso zzso of type II collagen was detected 26 and 52 weeks after zzso The modified zzso score increased from 26 to 52 zzso zzso evaluation revealed a decrease in zzso in tissue engineered cartilage from zzso of native cartilage after 26 weeks to zzso after 52 zzso In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the integration and maturation of tissue engineered cartilage zzso attached on a bone substitute carrier implanted in zzso defects over a long zzso
