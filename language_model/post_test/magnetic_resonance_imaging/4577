It is well known that magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast can be controlled, albeit sometimes at the expense of image resolution and zzso ratio, and most studies of zzso zzso have used a single zzso zzso which is zzso for zzso image zzso Inevitably that single protocol frequently compromises the detection of one or another of the boundaries between which any measurement must be zzso This paper describes an alternative approach in which the criteria for zzso edge detection necessary for fully automated measurement of cartilage thickness are used to define the zzso acquisition zzso This zzso the combined use of two zzso zzso one zzso for the zzso boundary, and the other for zzso zzso This provides a highly effective combination and its efficacy is demonstrated for the zzso zzso joint of a range of zzso zzso
