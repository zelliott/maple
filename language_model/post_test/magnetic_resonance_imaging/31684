zzso zzso has substantially advanced the zzso research of schizophrenia by describing a range of focal brain zzso as possible zzso zzso of the zzso Despite this progress, a considerable zzso of structural findings persists that may reflect the zzso diversity of zzso It is unclear whether the range of possible clinical disease manifestations relates to a core structural brain deficit or to distinct structural zzso zzso gray matter density zzso differences between 175 schizophrenic patients zzso and 177 matched healthy control subjects zzso were examined in a three-step approach using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of structural zzso irrespective of zzso zzso subdivision of the patient sample according to a three-dimensional factor model of the zzso and investigation of structural differences between these zzso and healthy zzso zzso analysis of a common pattern of structural zzso present in all patient zzso compared to healthy zzso zzso GMD reductions in patients compared to controls were identified within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso symptom dimension was associated with bilateral zzso in zzso insular and zzso prefrontal zzso Positive symptoms were associated with zzso zzso in zzso regions and extended zzso GMD zzso zzso symptoms were linked to the most extended zzso within zzso zzso zzso lateral prefrontal and zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso Thus, structural zzso in schizophrenia may relate to specific patterns of GMD reductions that possibly share a common zzso pattern of structural brain zzso
