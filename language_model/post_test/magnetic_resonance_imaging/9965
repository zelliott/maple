To use receiver operator characteristics zzso analysis for assessing the diagnostic performance of three zzso MR sequences at zzso and 3 T in detecting cartilage zzso created in zzso zzso 

zzso cartilage zzso were created in 27 zzso knee specimens at the zzso the zzso and lateral zzso and the zzso and lateral zzso zzso MR imaging was performed using a fat saturated zzso zzso echo zzso sequence (in plane spatial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two fat saturated zzso density weighted zzso sequences zzso spatial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and high spatial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The images were independently analyzed by three zzso concerning the absence or presence of zzso using a zzso confidence zzso zzso of the differences for the individual sequences were calculated based on comparisons of areas under zzso zzso zzso 

The highest zzso for all three zzso were consistently obtained for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences at zzso The corresponding zzso at zzso T were zzso and zzso the differences between zzso and 3 T were statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso sequence were zzso zzso at 3 T and zzso at zzso T and the differences between zzso and zzso were not zzso 

With zzso zzso MR sequences diagnostic performance in detecting cartilage zzso was improved at 3 zzso For a standard, lower spatial resolution zzso sequence no significant differences, however, were zzso
