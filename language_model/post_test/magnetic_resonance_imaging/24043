zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that is an excellent tissue zzso In order to characterize mass transfer in this material, as well as to demonstrate in principle the ability to zzso measure zzso diffusion in zzso we measured the diffusion zzso of the magnetic resonance zzso contrast agent zzso zzso zzso acid zzso through zzso using a clinical MR zzso The method involved filling zzso zzso zzso zzso with known zzso of zzso zzso Then by using a fast inversion recovery spin echo MR imaging zzso a signal zzso zzso was created in the MR image that corresponded to a second, known concentration of zzso By collecting a series of MR images through the zzso wall as a function of time, the displacement of this second known zzso zzso could be zzso Application of zzso second law of diffusion yielded the diffusion zzso Seven separate experiments were performed using various combinations of initial zzso of zzso within the zzso cups zzso zzso or 125 zzso and tracked zzso contours zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The experimental results and the predictions of zzso law were in excellent zzso The zzso of zzso through zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Separate zzso studies showed that the diffusion zzso of zzso through this zzso did not change with an applied pressure of up to zzso zzso zzso zzso could be made within 30 zzso if suitable zzso zzso were zzso Due to the excellent zzso and fast data acquisition time, this technique is very promising for future in zzso studies of species transport in zzso
