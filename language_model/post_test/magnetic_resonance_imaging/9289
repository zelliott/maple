zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is a new zzso for visualizing zzso distribution in zzso such as the brain after stroke or after administration of drugs of zzso We have recently shown that zzso zzso is a zzso agent that can cross the zzso zzso After zzso by zzso the zzso of zzso zzso is trapped in brain zzso In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using this to map the changes of zzso concentration in mouse brain after focal zzso The decrease in tissue zzso concentration in the zzso region of mouse brain was clearly zzso by zzso The hypoxic zone mapped by zzso was zzso well correlated with the zzso area in the brain zzso by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso Finally, we observed a decrease in the size of the hypoxic region when the mouse zzso higher levels of zzso This finding suggests that zzso with specifically designed zzso is a promising imaging zzso for visualizing zzso distribution in brain zzso especially in an zzso zzso We believe that this imaging method can be used for monitoring the effects of therapeutic intervention aimed at enhancing brain zzso supply, which is crucial in minimizing brain injury after zzso
