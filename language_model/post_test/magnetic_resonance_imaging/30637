We sought to investigate the zzso effects of a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as their zzso over time, in a rabbit model of experimental zzso 

The zzso are nuclear zzso factors that control a variety of cellular functions, with the potential effects required to induce plaque zzso and zzso 

zzso was induced in rabbits zzso zzso zzso by the combination of zzso injury and a nine-month zzso zzso zzso The rabbits were zzso into a continued HC diet, a normal zzso zzso diet, NC plus zzso NC plus zzso zzso and NC plus zzso plus zzso zzso All rabbits underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso and after six months of treatment and were then sacrificed for zzso zzso 

All groups had a similar vessel wall area by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso between zzso at zzso zzso progression was seen in the HC diet group (15 zzso zzso p zzso zzso In the NC and NC plus zzso zzso groups, progression was abolished zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The NC plus zzso and NC plus zzso plus zzso zzso groups had significant plaque zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was independent of plasma zzso zzso All NC groups had similar zzso profiles at the end of zzso zzso analysis of the NC groups showed a decreased zzso content and zzso zzso activity and an increased smooth muscle zzso content of zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso of plasma zzso levels zzso progression of zzso zzso elicits zzso of zzso zzso and the combination zzso plus zzso zzso has additive zzso effects on zzso This is paralleled by structural zzso in plaque zzso which may increase plaque zzso These observations support the beneficial effects of statins on zzso and show additional zzso benefits of combining a zzso zzso with zzso
