Previously we described from 20 patients' data with our new zzso prediction zzso the zzso changes following zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study is to extend the zzso for 48 months, and to carry out zzso analysis of several different zzso 

20 zzso zzso zzso were followed for a zzso period after zzso zzso zzso The delivered dose on the tumor surface was zzso zzso zzso planning and image fusion were done with the zzso Target zzso software, mathematical and statistical zzso were carried out with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Volumes of tumor zzso zzso zone and zzso referred to as zzso zzso were measured on image fused control zzso and planning CT zzso The measured volumes were zzso with respect to the reference zzso Mean values of volumes were determined, then zzso were fitted to the mean using the zzso curve fitting zzso The accuracy of our results was verified by zzso the predicted data with the measured zzso 

We have found that the zzso reaches its maximum two times after zzso during the 48 months follow up zzso We have shown that small tumors react more rapidly and creating greater volumes of the zzso zzso than bigger zzso 

The zzso prediction approach proposed here reveals the dynamics of triple ring for 48 zzso The derived zzso and the zzso analysis carried out afterwards help to zzso design the best treatment, zzso follow up the patient's condition and zzso plan zzso if zzso
