We studied the feasibility of zzso zzso spin labeling zzso at zzso 

zzso were performed to find the optimal labeling parameters for zzso with particular attention to the zzso specific zzso rate zzso zzso zzso experiments (four zzso were performed to find the B1 efficiency at the labeling position with and without zzso pads placed around the head, and to study the optimal labeling duration (four separate zzso Finally, feasibility of zzso zzso imaging was zzso 

zzso showed that a lower B1 efficiency should be compensated by a lower effective flip angle of the zzso a moderately shorter labeling zzso and a longer repetition zzso B1 efficiency in the internal carotid arteries just below the carotid siphon was approximately zzso and zzso with and without zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments showed an optimal labeling duration of zzso although longer labeling zzso up to zzso resulted in similar zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was demonstrated in a single zzso 

Despite decreased B1 efficiency, sufficient labeling efficiency can be achieved for zzso zzso at zzso with zzso zzso However, image quality is still limited compared with zzso probably due to imaging zzso and further research is needed to zzso zzso
