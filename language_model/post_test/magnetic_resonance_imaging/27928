We studied the cases of 15 patients who underwent zzso magnetic resonance imaging evaluation after being treated with metal spinal zzso zzso stabilization was required in traumatic injuries for eight patients, cancer destruction in four patients, late cervical zzso in one patient, zzso in one patient, and zzso in one zzso A variety of stainless steel and titanium spinal implants were zzso The images were evaluated for spinal and implant positioning and artifact zzso Both stainless steel and titanium implants were zzso safely and there was no evidence of implant migration of local zzso zzso The titanium spinal implants allowed zzso spine imaging without the significant image distortion characteristic of the stainless steel zzso The stainless steel implants created significant artifact that impaired the usefulness of the magnetic resonance imaging zzso
