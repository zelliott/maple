We aimed to characterize the extension of zzso after a first zzso zzso zzso zzso using body surface map zzso and its relationship with zzso size zzso with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Thirty-five patients were studied 6 months after a first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso All cases had zzso disease and an open zzso The extension of zzso was analyzed by means of a zzso zzso zzso size was zzso with zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was observed in 5 patients zzso 2 of whom zzso had zzso segment with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso was observed in 8 patients zzso 7 of whom zzso had zzso segment with zzso zzso Patients with inferior zzso zzso zzso showed a larger number of zzso in zzso zzso zzso than patients with anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso leads; zzso When the study group was zzso as a whole, the total number of zzso detected in zzso did not correlate with the number of zzso segments zzso zzso In anterior zzso a number of zzso zzso (2 zzso was related to a higher number of zzso segments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The same was observed in inferior zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In a stable phase after a first zzso zzso zzso zzso absence of zzso does not mean zzso zzso Using zzso extension of zzso is much higher in inferior zzso a separate analysis depending on zzso location is zzso A major zzso extension of zzso is related to larger zzso size both in anterior and in inferior zzso
