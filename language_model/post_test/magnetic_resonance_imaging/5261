zzso relaxation has recently been found to be sensitive to liver zzso and has potential to be used for early detection of liver zzso and zzso Liver zzso imaging and accurate mapping are challenging because of the long scan time, zzso motion and high specific zzso zzso Reduction and zzso of spin lock times zzso are an efficient way to reduce scan time and zzso energy deposition of zzso imaging, but maintain the zzso precision of zzso zzso This work analyzes the precision in zzso zzso with zzso in particular two, spin lock times, and explores the feasibility of using two specific zzso zzso for efficient and accurate liver zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were derived by theoretical analysis and zzso simulations first, and tested zzso by in zzso rat liver zzso imaging at 3 zzso The simulation showed that the zzso of 1 and 50 zzso gave optimal zzso zzso in a range of zzso zzso In the experiment, no significant statistical difference was found between the zzso maps generated using the zzso zzso combination and the maps generated using the six zzso of zzso 10, 20, 30, 40, zzso zzso according to one-way zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso for liver and p zzso zzso for zzso
