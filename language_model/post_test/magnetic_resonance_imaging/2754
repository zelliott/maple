The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of zzso in determining vascular involvement in zzso zzso with zzso zzso Six patients with zzso syndrome were investigated preoperatively by means of zzso Following standard zzso MR imaging in the zzso and zzso planes, two successive two-dimensional zzso zzso acquisitions were obtained in the zzso plane, the first with zzso the second with zzso zzso zzso data were compared to zzso data in four cases, and to surgical findings in all six zzso zzso demonstrated displacement zzso zzso 2) and zzso zzso zzso 2) of zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso or zzso of zzso and/or right zzso vein zzso zzso zzso Close correlation between zzso zzso and surgery was zzso These preliminary results suggest that zzso is a zzso diagnostic method complementary to MR imaging for detecting vascular involvement in zzso zzso with zzso zzso
