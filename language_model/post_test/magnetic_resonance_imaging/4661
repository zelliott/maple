The zzso of symptoms in schizophrenia may reflect zzso of underlying zzso zzso Factor zzso studies have consistently identified three symptom factors, zzso negative and zzso as independent dimensions of schizophrenic zzso This study examined the relationship of these symptom dimensions with volumes of specific brain zzso zzso and zzso schizophrenia spectrum patients were clinically evaluated with the Comprehensive Assessment of zzso and History zzso and scanned with a zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of interest zzso were manually traced on 5 zzso and 3 zzso zzso slices by a single technician, blind to all aspects of subject zzso zzso between zzso volumes and zzso of symptom severity were zzso zzso of zzso were then used to test for specific relationships between each of the three symptom dimensions and zzso zzso Tests were made of each dimension, controlling for all zzso zzso symptom severity was significantly correlated with larger zzso volumes zzso third and zzso zzso and smaller zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso Both psychotic and negative symptom severity predicted increased third zzso zzso zzso symptom severity uniquely predicted decreased superior zzso zzso volume as well as increased zzso horn zzso Within the psychotic symptom dimension, hallucinations alone predicted left superior zzso zzso zzso No significant associations between zzso symptoms and any zzso were zzso These results provide clues to the zzso of specific brain regions underlying symptom clusters in zzso and provide further zzso evidence for the construct of independent dimensions of zzso within schizophrenia and related psychotic zzso
