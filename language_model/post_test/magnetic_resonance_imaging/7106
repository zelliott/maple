zzso resonance zzso imaging is a sensitive means of detecting zzso and zzso forms of brain zzso This study zzso the zzso zzso deficits in 49 adult patients with zzso detected by MR zzso MR imaging was performed zzso days following zzso analyzed for the injury type and graded for zzso A battery of zzso tests was performed prior to hospital discharge or at the time of initial follow-up visit zzso zzso 15 patients were so severely impaired that testing could not be done and 3 died prior to zzso The zzso test scores were grouped into 3 levels of zzso The overall zzso scores were compared with MR zzso severity ratings and a positive correlation found zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso severity, type and location resulted in specific zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso location and severity can be accurately identified by acute phase MR are associated with specific types of zzso deficits in a high percentage of testable zzso
