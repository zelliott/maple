As zzso scanning devices like computer zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso become more zzso there is also an increasing need for powerful computers that can handle the enormous amounts of data with acceptable response zzso We describe an approach to zzso some of the more frequently used image processing operators on distributed memory zzso It is desirable to make such specialized machines accessible on a network, in order to save costs by sharing zzso We present a zzso approach that is specifically tailored to the interactive work with volume zzso Our image processing server zzso a volume zzso method that allows the user to assess the zzso of anatomical zzso We can enhance the presentation by combining the volume zzso on a viewing station with additional zzso zzso which can be manipulated in zzso The methods presented were verified on two applications for different zzso
