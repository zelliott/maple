White matter zzso zzso on zzso zzso are common in stroke patients and healthy elderly zzso The detailed anatomical distribution of these zzso in stroke patients has not been zzso 

A total of 112 stroke or transient zzso attack patients and 87 matched control subjects from the Sydney Stroke Study underwent zzso scans that included a zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso were delineated from each zzso zzso by an automated zzso Region of interest and zzso statistical zzso mapping approaches were applied to examine the volume, distribution, and severity of zzso of the patient and control groups, and zzso with large or zzso zzso 

Stroke subjects had significantly more zzso than controls in all brain regions except the zzso lobe and in all zzso territories except the anterior zzso and anterior zzso zzso In the zzso regions, average zzso volumes in patients were zzso those in zzso The total number of discrete zzso was not different in the 2 groups, but stroke patients had more large zzso zzso and high-intensity zzso zzso with zzso zzso had more zzso than those with large zzso who, in turn, had more zzso than control zzso zzso zzso subjects had more zzso than subjects with large zzso or zzso zzso Those with anterior zzso territory zzso had more zzso in the frontal zzso zzso with single or multiple zzso did not differ in volumes of zzso 

Stroke patients have significantly more zzso in nearly every brain region than healthy zzso Those with zzso zzso are particularly zzso zzso represent a significant proportion of the zzso zzso burden in stroke and transient zzso attack zzso
