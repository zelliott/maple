zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a rare cause of zzso Although morbidity and mortality have greatly decreased in recent years as a result of early diagnosis and timely medical treatment, when coma occurs the prognosis remains zzso We evaluated whether emergent zzso zzso has a role in the treatment of patients with brain zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Three patients developed large zzso zzso with coma and zzso fixed and zzso pupils resulting from zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Two patients underwent emergent surgical zzso as soon as brain zzso developed, and these patients had complete functional zzso One underwent delayed surgical zzso and remained severely zzso 

Our results provide preliminary evidence that emergent zzso zzso is effective in patients with brain zzso from zzso zzso zzso provided that the clinical onset is zzso We therefore recommend consideration of this aggressive surgical technique for such patients, who may survive with good zzso
