Because of its high intrinsic contrast resolution, magnetic resonance imaging zzso has largely replaced zzso zzso zzso in the diagnosis of central nervous system zzso diseases, and the use of contrast media in zzso of the zzso has increased zzso zzso zzso being, by far, the most used zzso Our paper will focus on the current indications for zzso MR imaging of the zzso and will outline the current role and the future trends in contrast medium zzso administration in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso are now routinely employed in zzso of the brain and spine and have been shown to be relatively safe and well tolerated at standard doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso Although there is general consensus on the usefulness of CM administration in zzso of the zzso some controversy still persists on the type of CM to be used, on the administration zzso and on the imaging zzso The current trend is toward selective employment of zzso the effect of which can be enhanced by zzso Transfer zzso techniques, to increase the sensitivity of the zzso Double or triple doses of CM can be useful in the detection of small zzso zzso with faint enhancement, in zzso studies of the brain zzso and in MR zzso zzso zzso closely resembles the features of an optimal zzso because it is zzso has a low zzso and a low zzso and may be particularly zzso when high doses are zzso
