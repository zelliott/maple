To zzso compare zzso zzso zzso and zzso spectral zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for the differentiation of tumor from zzso and for zzso of zzso wall layers in zzso cancer zzso 

The local ethics committee approved the zzso and written informed consent was obtained from each zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was performed in specimens obtained from 23 patients (16 men, seven zzso median age, 64 years; age range, zzso zzso immediately after zzso Seven patients underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso spectral zzso MR images were obtained in the zzso zzso zzso in signal intensity between tumor and zzso and between tumor and zzso wall layers were evaluated by using visual scoring and zzso of zzso relaxation zzso zzso differences were evaluated by using the zzso signed rank test and a zzso zzso zzso All images were compared with zzso zzso slices zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR images provided the best differentiation between tumor and zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean visual signal intensity scores were zzso for zzso MR images, zzso for zzso spectral zzso MR images, and zzso for zzso MR zzso zzso relaxation times were 97 zzso zzso zzso for tumor and 70 zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overlap was noted between the tumor and the circular layer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and less overlap was noted between the tumor and the zzso layer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging provides superior zzso of zzso wall layers and better differentiation of tumor from zzso in zzso cancer specimens compared with zzso MR imaging and zzso spectral zzso MR imaging by using zzso zzso zzso
