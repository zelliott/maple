We examined the association of sympathetic zzso and reduced blood flow with mechanical dysfunction in adjacent zzso regions late after zzso zzso zzso 

Using a well characterized zzso model of left zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso we previously showed that zzso normal adjacent zzso regions demonstrate mechanical zzso 

Ten sheep underwent coronary zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed before and 8 weeks after zzso for measurement of zzso mass, volumes, ejection fraction and regional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso before and after administration of zzso were infused before death for measurement of sympathetic zzso blood flow and blood flow reserve from matched zzso zzso 

From baseline to 8 weeks after zzso zzso zzso volume increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the decline in zzso zzso was greater in adjacent (19 zzso zzso to 8 zzso zzso than in remote zzso regions (20 zzso zzso to 19 zzso zzso p zzso zzso No difference in regional blood flow or blood flow reserve was found between adjacent and remote regions, whereas zzso zzso zzso was lower in adjacent than in remote zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso from zzso to base at 8 weeks after zzso zzso correlated closely with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

In mechanically dysfunctional zzso regions adjacent to chronic zzso zzso zzso in the remodeled left zzso blood flow and blood flow reserve are zzso yet sympathetic zzso is zzso zzso sympathetic zzso in adjacent zzso regions, in association with regional mechanical dysfunction, may contribute to zzso zzso after zzso
