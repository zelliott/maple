zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has great potential for measuring mechanisms of functional changes in Alzheimer's disease zzso and mild cognitive zzso but task zzso studies have produced conflicting results, partly due to failure to account for underlying zzso changes and to variations in patients' ability to perform the zzso zzso zzso has potential for assessing brain function independently from a task, but greater understanding of how networks of resting functional connectivity relate to the functioning of the brain is zzso We combined resting zzso and task zzso to examine the correspondence between these methods in individuals with cognitive zzso 

Eighty elderly zzso control subjects, 25 mild cognitive zzso 30 zzso underwent a combined zzso magnetic resonance imaging protocol including task zzso and resting zzso Task zzso data were acquired during the execution of a memory paradigm designed to account for differences in task zzso zzso and zzso confounds were modeled for both zzso zzso 

zzso recognition was associated with increased task zzso zzso in lateral prefrontal regions in zzso relative to control zzso this overlapped with increased resting zzso functional connectivity in the same zzso 

Our results show that task zzso and resting zzso are sensitive markers of residual ability over the known changes in brain zzso and zzso occurring in zzso and suggest that resting zzso has a potential to measure the effect of new zzso
