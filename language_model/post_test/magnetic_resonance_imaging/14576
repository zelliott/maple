The study examined gray matter volume across psychosis diagnoses organized by zzso and zzso categories from the zzso Network on Intermediate zzso zzso zzso 

In total, zzso zzso with psychosis zzso with zzso 90 with zzso disorder, and 115 with psychotic bipolar I zzso zzso of their first-degree relatives zzso were relatives of individuals with zzso 106 of individuals with zzso disorder, and 129 of individuals with psychotic bipolar I zzso and 200 healthy comparison subjects were zzso Gray matter volumes from zzso zzso images were analyzed using the zzso zzso for zzso and outcomes were determined at a false discovery zzso threshold of zzso 

Across the psychosis dimension, zzso zzso and relatives with psychosis spectrum disorders zzso showed substantial overlapping gray matter reductions throughout the zzso whereas relatives without psychosis spectrum zzso had normal gray matter volumes relative to comparison zzso Across zzso diagnoses, schizophrenia and zzso zzso showed overlapping gray matter reductions in numerous cortical and zzso regions, whereas psychotic bipolar zzso showed limited gray matter reductions localized to the zzso zzso relative to comparison zzso All relative groups had gray matter volumes that did not differ from comparison zzso 

Across the zzso psychosis categories, these findings indicate extensive zzso gray matter reductions in psychosis zzso and relatives with psychosis spectrum disorders, possibly reflecting lifetime psychosis burden, but normal gray matter in zzso zzso Traditional zzso psychosis grouping revealed partially divergent gray matter zzso for zzso with schizophrenia or zzso disorder zzso zzso or zzso gray matter zzso relative to those with psychotic bipolar disorder (smaller reductions were limited to zzso zzso The zzso zzso of psychosis appears useful in defining more zzso disease categories that may help identify underlying psychosis zzso and develop a biologically driven diagnostic system and targeted zzso
