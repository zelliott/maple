Brain zzso is a proposed zzso marker of irreversible zzso damage in multiple sclerosis zzso The brain zzso fraction zzso is the ratio of brain zzso volume to the total volume within the surface zzso We developed a zzso measure of zzso using commercially available zzso and zzso software zzso analysis time per zzso We measured zzso in 78 patients with zzso and 17 healthy zzso zzso was lower in a cohort of patients with zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso to controls zzso range zzso zzso zzso correlated zzso with third zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso but not with total zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso correlated zzso with expanded disability status scale zzso score zzso zzso and disease duration zzso zzso zzso zzso compared the relative abilities of zzso variables to predict clinical zzso By zzso of age, zzso third zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the best predictor of disability score zzso zzso Third zzso zzso was the best predictor of disease duration zzso zzso None of the zzso variables differed between zzso zzso zzso and secondary progressive zzso zzso disease course zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso and the accuracy against a phantom was zzso We conclude that zzso zzso in zzso can be reliably and readily zzso by a zzso zzso zzso studies are warranted to determine if this method provides a sensitive zzso marker of the zzso disease zzso
