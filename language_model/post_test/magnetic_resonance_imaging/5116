We aimed to describe and compare zzso vein flow patterns of patients with zzso and zzso systemic zzso zzso after zzso switch repair for zzso of the great arteries zzso We hypothesized that zzso magnetic resonance imaging would enable characterization of retrograde collateral flow across the zzso vein in cases of systemic zzso zzso zzso 

This is a retrospective, zzso zzso Twelve patients with zzso switch repair for zzso were zzso zzso flow index was measured with zzso magnetic resonance zzso comparison was made between patients with documented systemic zzso zzso obstruction zzso and a control group of patients without zzso obstruction zzso 

Patients with systemic zzso zzso obstruction had a distinctive zzso flow pattern that was retrograde and an increased amount of zzso flow compared with patients without obstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 103 zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with systemic zzso zzso obstruction have a characteristic collateral flow across the zzso zzso zzso vein flow measurement may be used for the assessment of zzso zzso in patients after zzso switch repair for zzso However, diagnostic accuracy needs to be tested in a larger zzso
