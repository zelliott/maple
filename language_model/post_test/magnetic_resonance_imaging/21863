In a study of patients with focal zzso the hypothesis was explored that different zzso of zzso are related to specific zzso of cerebral zzso 

Forty patients had zzso performed with zzso In addition, patients received a psychiatric evaluation with the following psychiatric zzso the zzso depression zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the social stress and support zzso Patients were zzso in two groups according to the zzso of the zzso Nine patients were excluded based on poor quality scans zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and left or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

There were no overall differences between the left and right zzso groups on measures of zzso zzso were found between scores on some of the rating scales and regional cerebral blood zzso Specifically, for patients with left sided zzso higher scores on the zzso depression inventory were associated with lower zzso zzso and bilateral frontal zzso and higher zzso zzso For patients with right sided zzso higher scores on the zzso zzso inventory were associated with increased zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions and bilateral frontal zzso 

The results do not support the notion that zzso zzso zzso are associated with different levels of depression, zzso or personality zzso They support the view that certain zzso symptom patterns are related to specific regional zzso depending on the zzso of a zzso zzso
