zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso were performed in patient groups with zzso heart disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso without zzso zzso was divided into 20 segments and each segment was scored as one of 4 grades zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso mildly zzso 2 zzso severely zzso and 3 zzso zzso according to the zzso zzso zzso enhancement in MR was interpreted zzso A decreased in the zzso of zzso showed in 54 of 141 zzso zzso 13 zzso measured by zzso zzso segments in zzso in 32 of 66 in zzso and in 103 of zzso in zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso showed decreased zzso in 18 of 141 zzso zzso in 18 of 66 in zzso and in 27 of zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed a higher zzso of these zzso abnormalities than did zzso in the zzso zzso And also in the zzso zzso decreased in the zzso of zzso occurred more frequently in zzso than in zzso In zzso decreased zzso zzso appeared more frequently in segments 1, 2, 9, and 10 zzso zzso than in other zzso but in zzso such decreases occurred more often in segments 17, 18, 19, and 20 zzso zzso signal intensity with zzso appeared in more segments in the zzso group than in the zzso or zzso zzso We concluded that zzso had the most extensive and severe structural zzso zzso and zzso zzso three groups, and that the combination of these three examinations was useful for evaluating the characteristics of zzso zzso
