The lack of suited diagnostic tools providing insight into patient specific flow characteristics of the zzso zzso is one of the main problems in functional zzso zzso methods currently used do not provide the necessary information for flow zzso But the flow distribution is essential for a zzso zzso in particular for cleaning, zzso and zzso of the zzso air as well as for the zzso function of the zzso To overcome this current situation a cooperation project of the zzso surgeons and computer graphic engineers was established to develop the computer assisted planning system zzso zzso zzso for zzso in the human zzso combining Computer zzso zzso zzso with advanced Computer zzso zzso The idea of the zzso system is to perform patient specific zzso simulations in the patient's zzso zzso Therefore a geometrical model of the zzso airways is derived from the patient's zzso zzso A zzso of the surrounded flow volume is made by a zzso zzso To establish the flow simulation zzso zzso zzso are performed on the zzso A tailored zzso is offered to the surgeon that zzso the flow pattern to the patient's zzso data shown in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The surgeon can not only analyze the patient's current respiratory situation he has also the possibility to describe the planned surgical zzso The goal is to simulate the flow distribution that can be expected after the surgical intervention and to offer a possibility to validate various surgical zzso To verify the simulation results experimental investigations and zzso are made in zzso zzso Silicon Models of patient's nose channels are made to analyze flow zzso The CT or MR scans of the same patients are used as input data for the zzso The experimental outcome is compared to the simulation results to validate this diagnostic zzso
