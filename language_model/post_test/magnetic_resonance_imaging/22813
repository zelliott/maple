The zzso is believed to play a key role in processing emotionally zzso zzso events that require further online processing by cortical zzso zzso disorders such as depression and anxiety have been associated with zzso of the amygdala, but it is unknown whether zzso treatment directly affects zzso responses to emotionally significant zzso 

The current study assessed the effects of 7 days administration of the selective zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on zzso responses to masked presentations of fearful and happy facial expressions in zzso volunteers using blood zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso A zzso zzso design was used with volunteers zzso to 20 zzso zzso versus zzso 

Volunteers receiving zzso showed decreased zzso responses to masked presentations of threat compared with those receiving zzso zzso also reduced responses within the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso specifically during the zzso zzso These neural differences were accompanied by decreased recognition of fearful facial expressions assessed after the zzso By contrast, there was no effect of zzso on the neural or behavioral response to the happy facial zzso 

These results suggest a direct effect of zzso zzso on zzso response to zzso stimuli in zzso Such effects may be important in the therapeutic actions of zzso in depression and zzso
