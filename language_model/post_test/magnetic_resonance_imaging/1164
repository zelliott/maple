To investigate the zzso behavior of the blood zzso dependent zzso signal applying the zzso zzso phase to functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso phase was zzso for a group of four subjects using three functional runs of different visual stimulation zzso In order to consider the zzso of the zzso zzso phase, a correlation analysis was performed between the zzso of the phase shift and the associated zzso zzso In activated brain regions, correlation was performed between the mean zzso zzso phase and the spectral density phase zzso 

The zzso of the zzso zzso phase show the zzso zzso of the phase shift between zzso time zzso For brain regions with zzso stationary behavior, the mean zzso zzso phase supports the results obtained by spectral zzso 

The zzso zzso phase provides a description of the zzso behavior of the zzso signal even for the zzso zzso In particular, zzso changes of the phase shift can be zzso This makes the zzso zzso phase more suitable for the investigation of zzso dynamics than an average phase lag obtained by correlation or spectral zzso
