How much we desire a meal depends on both the constituent foods and how hungry we are, though not every meal becomes more desirable with increasing zzso The brain therefore needs to be able to integrate hunger and meal properties to zzso the correct incentive value of a zzso The present study investigated the functional role of the zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso hunger and dish zzso Furthermore, it explored neural responses to dish descriptions particularly susceptible to zzso following zzso We instructed participants to rate how much they wanted food menu items while they were either hungry or zzso and compared the rating differences in these zzso Our results point to the representation of food value in the amygdala, and to an integration of attractiveness with hunger level in the zzso zzso Dishes particularly desirable during hunger activated the zzso and the zzso Our results specify the functions of zzso structures in the context of food zzso and point to a complex neural representation of dish qualities which contribute to zzso zzso
