The goal of the vascular space occupancy zzso imaging technique is to use selective zzso of the blood signal to zzso relative changes in cerebral blood volume zzso In accordance with recent work, we show that changes in the local zzso fraction zzso with zzso can significantly impact the zzso zzso thereby limiting our ability to zzso zzso from zzso zzso Here we calculate zzso change using a zzso method which zzso for the Dynamic zzso zzso fluid zzso By combining data from two separate zzso acquisitions that eliminate either the blood signal zzso or the zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso zzso may then be used to simultaneously solve for the relative changes in zzso and zzso with zzso The method is applied across the whole brain during a zzso task, offering insight into the relationship between changes in zzso and zzso associated with global zzso zzso of mean changes in zzso in different volumes of interest obtained from the proposed method compare much better with previous zzso PET data than traditional zzso methods that do not account for a zzso zzso with zzso This confirms the necessity of incorporating the dynamic zzso volume into zzso calculations of zzso
