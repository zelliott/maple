Regional changes in brain structure have been reported in patients with altered visceral sensitivity and chronic abdominal pain, such as in irritable zzso zzso It remains unknown whether structural brain changes are associated with visceral zzso zzso we present the first study in healthy individuals to address whether zzso variations in gray matter volume zzso in zzso regions correlate with visceral zzso In 92 healthy young adults zzso zzso we assessed zzso sensory and pain thresholds and performed zzso zzso zzso to zzso linear zzso models with visceral sensory and pain zzso respectively, as independent variable and zzso in a zzso regions of interest zzso as dependent zzso All results were zzso error zzso corrected at a level of zzso and zzso for zzso The mean zzso zzso thresholds were zzso zzso for first sensation and zzso zzso for pain, without evidence of sex zzso Lower zzso sensory threshold zzso increased zzso correlated significantly with reduced zzso in the thalamus, zzso zzso zzso cortex, zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso amygdala, and zzso zzso (all zzso Lower zzso pain threshold was associated with reduced zzso in the right zzso zzso These are the first data supporting that increased visceral sensitivity zzso with decreased gray matter volume in zzso brain zzso These findings support that zzso in brain zzso not only occur in clinical pain conditions but also occur according to normal zzso variations in visceral zzso
