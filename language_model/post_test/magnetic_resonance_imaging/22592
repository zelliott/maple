To compare zzso zzso zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the zzso diagnosis and zzso of acute and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso enrolled 45 patients clinically suspected of zzso zzso comparing them with a control zzso We obtained zzso zzso CT scans as well as zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso zzso echo zzso zzso sequences at zzso zzso Two zzso scrutinized the presence of blood at 26 different regions in the zzso zzso space zzso 

Three of 45 patients had normal CT and zzso scans, and zzso was excluded by zzso zzso We demonstrated zzso on CT scans in 28 of 42 zzso patients, zzso sequences in 15 of 42 zzso patients, and zzso sequences in 42 of 42 zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery sequences were superior to CT in 16 of the 26 evaluated zzso 

The zzso sequence was superior for zzso diagnosis and zzso of acute and zzso zzso zzso representing a potential tool in this zzso
