A zzso zzso 

To examine the function of the zzso during zzso limb activities in patients with chronic low back pain and healthy zzso 

zzso stabilizing function of the zzso may be an zzso factor in spinal zzso However, a study designed specifically to test the dynamics of the zzso in chronic spinal disorders is zzso 

zzso patients with chronic low back pain due to chronic zzso as zzso via clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging, and 29 healthy subjects were zzso Both groups presented with normal pulmonary function test zzso A dynamic magnetic resonance imaging system and specialized zzso readings were used with subjects in the zzso zzso zzso during tidal breathing zzso and zzso zzso of the upper and lower zzso against external resistance with zzso were zzso Standard pulmonary function tests, including respiratory muscle drive zzso and zzso were also zzso 

Using zzso analysis of zzso smaller zzso excursions and higher zzso position were found in the patient group zzso during the upper zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso zzso changes were found in zzso and middle points of the zzso A zzso analysis of zzso showed a steeper slope in the zzso zzso in the patient group both in the upper zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso conditions zzso 

Patients with chronic low back pain appear to have both abnormal position and a steeper slope of the zzso which may contribute to the zzso of the zzso
