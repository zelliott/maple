Spinal zzso pathology can be functionally very important in neurological zzso zzso studies have demonstrated the involvement of spinal zzso zzso matter zzso and white matter zzso in several diseases, although the clinical relevance of abnormalities detected zzso is difficult to assess without a reliable way to assess zzso zzso and zzso in zzso In this study, the feasibility of zzso and zzso zzso was investigated in the upper cervical spinal zzso of 10 healthy subjects, using high-resolution images acquired with a commercially available zzso zzso pulse sequence at zzso For each healthy subject, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso areas were segmented and total volumes calculated from a 15 zzso section acquired at the level of zzso zzso disc and zzso transfer ratio zzso values within the extracted volumes were also determined, as an example of zzso and zzso quantitative zzso in the cervical zzso Mean zzso zzso total zzso zzso area zzso and total zzso volume zzso of the section studied across 10 healthy subjects were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso total zzso zzso area zzso and total zzso volume zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso volume fraction zzso was zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso of the total zzso volume zzso was zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso of the total zzso volume zzso was zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso and zzso % zzso of variation for measuring the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso and for measuring the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The difference between zzso and zzso was found to be statistically significant zzso This study has shown that zzso and zzso zzso in the cervical zzso is possible and the MR imaging protocol and analysis method presented here in healthy controls can be potentially extended to study the cervical zzso in disease states, with the option to explore further quantitative zzso alongside zzso
