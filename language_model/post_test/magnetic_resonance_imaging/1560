Because healthy zzso twins share an identical genetic complement, they provide a unique opportunity to explore the genetic and environmental zzso of brain zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the similarities between measures of cerebral and zzso volumes and surface zzso in zzso twins compared with a matched control zzso zzso of automated and manual methods were used to evaluate total brain volume, gray matter, white matter, zzso and volumes of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An artificial neural network zzso was used to measure the zzso thalamus, zzso and zzso zzso of surface zzso included an index of zzso and zzso zzso surface area and cortical zzso The cerebral volume regions, including the gray matter, white matter and zzso volumes, were highly correlated within zzso twin pairs, with nearly all correlation zzso zzso The zzso was also highly correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso high correlations were found for the cortical depth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The surface measures, however, demonstrated the least correlation within twin pairs and thus are more prone to environmental zzso The high to moderate correlations between zzso twins compared with the matched controls highlights the role of zzso in both prenatal and zzso zzso
