To investigate the difference in enhancement effects and zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso and 3 zzso zzso and to zzso the contribution of the high magnetic field to contrast enhancement in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso containing water with or without zzso zzso zzso at different zzso were scanned using zzso and zzso zzso scanners of the same manufacturer and under the same temperature conditions and scanning zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were estimated from serial zzso and zzso values of the zzso using linear zzso zzso enhancement ratios in zzso and zzso zzso images were compared at zzso and zzso 

The zzso and zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso at zzso were slightly lower than those at zzso the contrast enhancement ratio improved in both zzso and zzso images as a result of zzso zzso of the water at zzso 

The decrease in zzso of the zzso at zzso appears to be so small that zzso zzso of the water improves contrast enhancement, suggesting a potential clinical advantage in administration of zzso at high field zzso
