zzso differences in the anatomical structure of the brains from 51 healthy male subjects zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by deformation field zzso in a zzso zzso The magnetic resonance images of the brains were zzso registered onto the image of a reference brain: the registration zzso simulated an elastic deformation of each brain zzso zzso so that the zzso intensity differences with the reference brain were zzso A three-dimensional deformation field was calculated for each source brain that zzso the anatomical differences between the source brain and the reference zzso zzso of zzso volume differences between each zzso brain and the reference brain were zzso They showed age-related differences in zzso defined regions of zzso Major volume decreases were found in the white matter and zzso of the zzso as well as in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and motor zzso including the underlying white zzso These findings suggest that aging between the second and sixth decade predominantly affects zzso zzso and cortical areas of the zzso system, forming the zzso zzso Additionally, a pronounced age-related decline in volume was observed in the zzso anterior cingulate, zzso and lateral prefrontal zzso Almost no differences were observed in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso showed a pronounced zzso zzso these volume differences occur at a relatively early period of the human life zzso It may be speculated that these structural differences accompany or zzso differences in zzso functions and zzso
