Previous brain imaging studies suggest that stroke alters functional connectivity in motor execution zzso Moreover, current understanding of brain plasticity has led to new approaches in stroke zzso Recent studies showed a significant role of effective zzso of zzso activity in the zzso zzso motor zzso and zzso zzso motor zzso network for motor outcome in patients after zzso After a zzso stroke, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during movement reveals cortical reorganization that is associated with the recovery of zzso The aim of the present study was to explore connectivity zzso within the zzso areas combining motor zzso with a novel zzso zzso robotic device zzso zzso Patients completed training at home and underwent serial MR evaluation at baseline and after 8 weeks of zzso Training at home consisted of squeezing a gel exercise ball with the zzso hand at zzso of maximum strength for 1 zzso 3 zzso The zzso analysis revealed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both stroke patients and healthy controls after the zzso zzso of the present study suggest that enhancement of zzso activity could benefit zzso dysfunction in stroke zzso These results also indicate that connectivity zzso between motor areas might assist the counterbalance of a functionally abnormal zzso in chronic stroke survivors and possibly other patients with motor zzso
