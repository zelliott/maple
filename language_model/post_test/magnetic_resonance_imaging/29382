We tested parallel processing of visual information using the redundant targets effect zzso in 12 zzso and 13 matched zzso The paradigm was a simple reaction time zzso task with targets presented in the same zzso opposite zzso or both zzso zzso In older zzso zzso zzso the zzso gain invoked by redundant targets did not exceed probability measures, suggesting compromised zzso processing of parallel information in this zzso compared with controls or younger zzso The difference between crossed and zzso reaction times zzso an index of zzso transfer time zzso was greater in older than younger zzso Moreover, the zzso was zzso correlated with the corpus zzso zzso total area and body in controls, supporting the concept of a zzso relationship of zzso zzso This relationship was not found in zzso although the zzso area of the zzso zzso and body but not zzso volume zzso was significantly smaller in zzso than zzso These results suggest that chronic alcohol abuse together with advancing age exert subtle disruption on parallel zzso processing zzso on zzso zzso
