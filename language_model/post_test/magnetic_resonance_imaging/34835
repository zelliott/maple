zzso zzso allows for a high dose of focused radiation to be delivered to a small zzso such as an zzso zzso zzso The clinical change and brain response over time to this localized high-dose radiation can be quite zzso 

The objective of this study to describe and zzso the imaging changes following zzso for zzso 

The clinical presentation and the imaging changes following zzso in two patients were studied over the course of 1-2 zzso 

The imaging findings include diffuse low zzso and contrast enhancement on zzso zzso zzso were apparent on zzso MR images with prominent contrast enhancement on zzso zzso Ring enhancement occurred over zzso While new changes appeared over 12 months, these changes diminished during the second zzso 

zzso zzso inflammatory changes that are generally zzso but can lead to zzso zzso These imaging changes are often zzso and therefore must be interpreted in light of clinical zzso and the time course since zzso These patients should receive routine MR imaging within 3 months after zzso with follow-up imaging at 6, 12, and 18 zzso
