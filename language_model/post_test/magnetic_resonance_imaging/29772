zzso lateral sclerosis zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative system disorder affecting both upper and lower motor zzso Despite supportive zzso zzso the involvement of the upper motor zzso is often difficult to assess at an early stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso provides an estimate of the orientation of zzso zzso in white matter on the basis of the diffusion characteristics of zzso zzso is generally higher in directions along zzso tracts than perpendicular to zzso This degree of zzso of diffusion can be measured as fractional zzso Changes in tissue structure due to zzso of the zzso zzso can lead to a modification of the degree of zzso which can be detected by diffusion zzso zzso We investigated 15 patients with zzso six of whom had no clinical signs of upper motor zzso involvement at the time of zzso investigation, but developed zzso tract symptoms later in the course of their zzso These patients met the El zzso criteria as their disease zzso We found a decrease in fractional zzso in the zzso zzso corpus zzso and zzso in all 15 ALS patients, including the patients without clinical signs of upper motor zzso zzso compared with healthy zzso zzso analysis showed a negative correlation between fractional zzso and central motor zzso time obtained by zzso magnetic zzso allowing spatial differentiation between the zzso zzso tract zzso that supply the upper and lower zzso Thus, diffusion zzso zzso can be used to assess upper motor zzso involvement in ALS patients before clinical symptoms of zzso tract zzso become apparent, and it may therefore contribute to earlier diagnosis of motor zzso zzso
