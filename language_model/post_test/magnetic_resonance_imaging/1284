The potential of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for the assessment of zzso zzso zzso was investigated in 17 zzso The severity of AS was graded by continuous wave zzso ultrasound as severe in 10 of 17 patients and as moderate in the remaining 7 zzso zzso MR demonstrated a flow zzso zzso and/or zzso to the zzso valve plane in all 17 zzso This flow zzso was seen as a signal void with four typical features: zzso a high-velocity jet phenomenon zzso to the valve plane during zzso closely related to the zzso orifice (8 of zzso zzso a turbulent zzso signal void in continuity with the jet, which zzso for a variable extent into the zzso (17 of zzso zzso a signal void just zzso to the valve plane during zzso zzso reflecting zzso acceleration of blood flow (5 of zzso and zzso a void at the valve plane due to zzso zzso zzso of zzso The following features or a combination zzso appeared to correlate with more severe grades of AS as zzso on zzso MR zzso zzso identification of narrow high-velocity jet zzso zzso extensive propagation of the turbulent signal void into the zzso and zzso presence of a zzso acceleration zzso Assessment of the severity of AS with zzso MR is still zzso However, zzso MR can identify the presence of AS and several flow phenomena that correlate with more severe degrees of zzso
