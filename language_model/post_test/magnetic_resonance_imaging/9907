Dynamic zzso zzso imaging zzso following a contrast agent zzso allows the extraction of information on tissue zzso The dynamic signals obtained from zzso are modeled by zzso zzso models which integrate the zzso zzso zzso These models use ordinary differential equations zzso to describe the exchanges between the zzso and zzso plasma and the zzso zzso Their least squares fitting takes into account measurement noises but fails to deal with unpredictable fluctuations due to zzso sources of variations zzso anxiety, zzso zzso measurement errors in the input function, zzso Adding zzso components to the zzso leads to zzso differential equations zzso In zzso zzso are zzso observed with an additional measurement zzso We propose to estimate the parameters of these noisy zzso by maximum likelihood, using the Kalman zzso In zzso the contrast agent injected in vein arrives in plasma with an unknown time zzso The delay zzso zzso a zzso in the drift of the zzso and zzso models, which is estimated zzso zzso based on the zzso and zzso zzso models are compared to real zzso zzso They show that the use of zzso provides zzso in the zzso zzso A simulation study confirms these zzso
