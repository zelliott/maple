Currently available data on zzso volume have been based on indirect methods of measurement and are mostly limited to adult zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the normal development of zzso volume by means of direct zzso made on zzso zzso MR zzso 

The volume of the normal zzso zzso in children and adolescents was measured by using zzso MR sequences with a section thickness of zzso to zzso zzso The clinical study group consisted of 199 pediatric patients with clinically normal zzso function and no abnormal findings on routine MR zzso The volume of the zzso zzso was also measured in all the zzso 

A phantom study revealed measurement errors within zzso In the clinical study, the measured zzso volumes showed a growth spurt during zzso which was more prominent in zzso zzso zzso volumes showed gradual growth without such a zzso Among zzso to zzso the zzso zzso volumes were significantly larger for boys than for zzso 

zzso development of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso was determined by means of zzso MR zzso With this technique, we found a gender difference in the volume of the zzso zzso
