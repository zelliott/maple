zzso moving table MR imaging has been successfully evaluated for zzso tumor staging and zzso zzso In previous studies it was demonstrated that three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso with lateral zzso can provide very efficient zzso coverage when the zzso field of view zzso is zzso To reduce respiratory artifacts, data acquisition in the zzso region of the patient typically must be performed during one single breath zzso This consequently restricts acquisition time and thus spatial zzso In this work, a novel reconstruction method is introduced for zzso zzso moving table data acquisition with lateral zzso The method features table position correction completely in zzso and is compatible with zzso parallel imaging zzso Parallel imaging can be applied to increase spatial resolution while maintaining the zzso zzso A sophisticated protocol for zzso moving table zzso was zzso The impact of zzso zzso on the featured imaging method was evaluated in phantom and volunteer zzso Finally, the protocol was zzso toward minimizing residual zzso Moving table zzso zzso with lateral zzso was performed in 5 healthy volunteers and was compared with lateral zzso data acquired with a zzso accelerated protocol providing increased spatial zzso
