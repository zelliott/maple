To examine new sequences that restrict acquisition of spins to those excited by both of the zzso zzso in missing pulse steady state free zzso zzso zzso 

New zzso sequences were created by replacing one of the slice selective zzso zzso with an zzso zzso for inner volume imaging, and with a chemical shift selective zzso pulse for chemical shift zzso The inner volume sequence was applied to a reduced field of view at the center of a resolution zzso resulting images were evaluated for differences in the zzso zzso The zzso sequence was applied to volunteers, as well as to and fat, water, and zzso acid zzso zzso were evaluated with zzso zzso 

The inner volume sequence eliminated the zzso zzso while zzso fat and water levels were suppressed to that of noise by the zzso zzso 

zzso suggest a novel steady state technique for rapid inner volume or chemical shift zzso
