Whereas we can use several human zzso zzso zzso cell lines for basic and zzso research, an zzso zzso cell line has not been reported to zzso We have treated a case of an zzso zzso developing in the right upper zzso of a zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso cell line, zzso was newly established and characterized for its zzso growth rate and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was also analyzed in zzso nude zzso 

zzso cells were round, zzso or zzso with an abundant zzso and have been maintained continuously in zzso for over 150 passages during more than 15 zzso These cells zzso cancer zzso 125 zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso into the culture zzso zzso cells were zzso when implanted in nude mice with tumors reaching a volume of 1000 zzso at around 50 zzso zzso features of tumors formed in mice were essentially the same as those of the original zzso exhibiting a zzso proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso cells with prominent areas of zzso and zzso zzso spaces zzso corresponding to the potential of zzso zzso formation in the original zzso They showed zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and CA zzso but negative for zzso zzso 1 zzso and factor zzso zzso 

The established cell line represents a biologically relevant new tool to investigate the molecular pathology of human zzso zzso and to evaluate the efficacy of novel zzso both in zzso and in zzso
