Recent guidelines on stroke zzso from the American Academy of zzso zzso recommend magnetic resonance imaging zzso over zzso zzso zzso for stroke diagnosis when patients present within 12 hours of zzso We sought to estimate the proportion of stroke zzso that is performed within 12 zzso 

Using the best available data, we estimated total time from symptom onset to zzso with a zzso Carlo zzso We modeled 3 times to zzso time to zzso time to emergency department zzso zzso and time to zzso zzso Total time to zzso was estimated by summing these time components while varying model parameters around our base zzso zzso analyses assessed the relative importance of model parameters to overall zzso zzso 

In 2009, we estimate that zzso of stroke patients underwent zzso zzso received an zzso in the zzso and zzso of all zzso were obtained on hospital day 0 or zzso We estimate that zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso of stroke zzso are obtained within 12 hours of zzso zzso analyses revealed that even large clinical changes zzso decreasing time to zzso would only moderately influence this zzso For example, if mean time to presentation were reduced to 30 minutes (from the base case estimate of 16 hours), the proportion of stroke zzso performed within 12 hours would only increase to zzso 

Stroke guidelines favor the use of zzso over CT only during the first 12 hours from symptom zzso yet less than one-third of stroke zzso are actually performed within this zzso
