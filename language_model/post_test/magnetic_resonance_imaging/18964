1) zzso a computerized technique to accurately compare acoustic zzso size on routine zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 2) use this technique to determine the growth pattern in a large series of patients with acoustic zzso who were conservatively zzso 3) describe the natural history of patients with acoustic zzso who did not receive surgical intervention and those who underwent zzso zzso 4) correlate the size and growth rate of acoustic zzso to clinical presentation and auditory and zzso zzso and 5) recommend guidelines for the management of patients with acoustic zzso 

A retrospective study from 1974 to 1999 of patients with unilateral acoustic zzso who had conservative treatment by serial imaging studies zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

All patient charts were evaluated for presenting symptoms, reasons for the type of management given, and clinical zzso Charts were also reviewed with respect to serial zzso assessment, zzso and zzso auditory evoked zzso Imaging studies were analyzed using a computer technique so that serial studies could be compared to determine growth zzso 

zzso computer analysis of tumor size and growth rate was statistically the same as the zzso description of the tumor size and growth zzso Of 70 patients who were older than 65 years of age old at the time their tumor was discovered, 4 zzso required intervention and 18 zzso were dead of unrelated zzso These patients had a mean follow-up of zzso years zzso zzso zzso Overall, growth rate for zzso patients was zzso zzso per zzso zzso tumors did not grow or zzso in zzso zzso zzso growth rate for surgical zzso zzso patients was zzso zzso per zzso zzso tumors did not grow or zzso after zzso zzso of acoustic zzso in zzso of zzso Three patients zzso required revision surgery because of tumor growth or the development of zzso Neither auditory nor zzso testing was a reliable measure for determining tumor zzso 

zzso of the zzso tumor diameter on zzso scans is a reliable method for following acoustic zzso zzso There is no need to perform a rigorous analysis of tumor size to determine whether the tumor is growing zzso The vast majority of patients older than 65 years with acoustic zzso do not require zzso The indications for intervention should be based on a combination of rapid tumor growth with the development of zzso
