We previously described zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the female zzso as a zzso zzso objective means of zzso sexual zzso response in women without sexual zzso These studies showed an increase in zzso zzso ranging from 50 to zzso in healthy women during sexual zzso 

This study sought to evaluate the zzso zzso response in women with female sexual zzso disorder zzso after administration of zzso and zzso We performed a zzso zzso zzso zzso study to assess the zzso zzso response using dynamic zzso in women with zzso after administering zzso and zzso followed by audiovisual sexual stimulation zzso 

zzso zzso women with zzso underwent two zzso zzso zzso were zzso to receive either zzso zzso 100 zzso during the first session followed by zzso during the second session, or zzso zzso followed by zzso During each session, baseline MR images were obtained while subjects viewed a neutral zzso zzso then zzso zzso or zzso After 30 minutes, a series of zzso were obtained at zzso intervals for 10 time points while subjects viewed zzso 

A positive sexual zzso response was achieved if zzso volume increased zzso from zzso 

Thirteen of 19 zzso subjects achieved a zzso increase in zzso zzso from baseline when administered zzso or zzso 30 minutes after dose zzso At 60 minutes after administration, zzso zzso subjects receiving zzso and zzso zzso subjects receiving zzso had responded zzso value zzso 

zzso did not augment the zzso response in women with zzso zzso a majority of women in this study did not have impaired zzso zzso as measured by zzso suggesting that zzso is not predominantly a disorder of zzso zzso
