Block and zzso stimulus designs are typically used in zzso studies depending on the importance of detection power or zzso zzso The extent of vascular contribution to zzso in block and zzso zzso response is not zzso With zzso the extent of vascular zzso in the zzso response during block and zzso design tasks was zzso Blood oxygen zzso zzso contrast data from healthy volunteers performing a block design motor task and an zzso memory task requiring performance of a motor response were analyzed from the regions of interest zzso surrounding the primary and supplementary motor zzso Average zzso signal change was significantly larger during the block design compared to the zzso zzso In each subject, zzso signal change across zzso in the zzso had higher variation during the block design task compared to the zzso design zzso Scaling using the resting state fluctuation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso variation due to vascular origins, reduced the zzso zzso zzso in every subject during both tasks but significantly reduced zzso zzso across subjects only during the block design zzso The strong zzso source of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso response during the block design compared to zzso task indicates that study designs zzso for statistical power through enhancement of the zzso contrast zzso zzso block zzso can be affected by enhancement of zzso sources of zzso zzso
