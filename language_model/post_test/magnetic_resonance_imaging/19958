zzso in zzso plaques is particularly prominent in complicated zzso and has been recently identified as a marker of plaque zzso This observation has led to a growing interest in the development of imaging techniques with the ability to zzso and zzso the extent of plaque zzso Such feature may play an important role in identifying those zzso more prone to zzso and zzso and in the guidance and monitoring of therapeutic zzso Several zzso have emerged as potential candidates for imaging zzso in zzso zzso They include magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso optical zzso These techniques differ in their achievable spatial and zzso resolution, zzso cost, zzso degree of zzso capability to image zzso plaques in various vascular territories and ability to discern different plaque zzso specifically the presence of zzso zzso imaging, a rapidly evolving multidisciplinary field devoted to the zzso of specific zzso processes at the cellular or molecular level, appears particularly well suited for this purpose because of its ability to target and zzso individual molecules specific to zzso In this manuscript we will review current evidence on the potential application of the various zzso with a particular emphasis in molecular zzso
