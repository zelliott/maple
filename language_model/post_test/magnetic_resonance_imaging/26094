zzso zzso calculations were performed on the series of clusters zzso where M zzso B, Al, and zzso zzso where M zzso C, zzso and zzso zzso where M zzso P and zzso and zzso where M zzso S and zzso These clusters were constructed to model the effect of changing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso distances on the bridging oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso For all clusters zzso we observed a general trend that the magnitude of zzso increases zzso with increasing zzso bond distance and zzso group number, suggesting that group number and zzso oxygen distance can serve as a better predictor of the bridging oxygen zzso zzso constant than zzso zzso
