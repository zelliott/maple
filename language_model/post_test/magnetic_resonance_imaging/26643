Most zzso studies in zzso patients are analyzed using the general linear model zzso which assumes a known zzso response function zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, independent component analysis zzso can extract zzso level dependent zzso responses without imposing constraints on the zzso zzso might therefore detect responses that vary in time and shape, and that are not detected in the zzso zzso In this study, we compared the findings of zzso and zzso analyses in 12 patients with idiopathic generalized zzso zzso zzso was used to extract independent components from the functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso A zzso method identified component time courses significantly related to the generalized zzso zzso without constraining the shape of the zzso The results from the zzso analysis were compared to those from the zzso zzso zzso maps and zzso maps showed significant correlation and revealed zzso responses in the thalamus, zzso nucleus, and default mode zzso In patients with a low rate of zzso per minute, the zzso analysis detected zzso signal changes within the zzso and the zzso nucleus that were not revealed by the zzso In conclusion, zzso is a viable alternative technique to zzso analyses in zzso studies related to generalized zzso This study demonstrated that the zzso response largely resembles the standard zzso and that zzso analysis is zzso However, zzso is more dependent on a sufficient number of events than zzso zzso
