Our objective was to analyze zzso zzso blood flow patterns within the total zzso connection zzso using in zzso phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

Sixteen zzso patients were zzso recruited at 2 leading pediatric institutions for PC zzso evaluation of their zzso zzso Patients were divided into 2 zzso Group 1 comprised 8 patients with an zzso zzso zzso and group 2 comprised 8 patients with a lateral tunnel zzso zzso A zzso stack of 5 to 10 zzso PC zzso slices with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was acquired and a zzso flow field was zzso 

Analysis revealed large zzso in zzso zzso and zzso flow structures in zzso zzso On average, there was no difference between zzso and zzso zzso in the proportion of inferior zzso zzso flow going to the left pulmonary artery zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, for zzso zzso the presence of a zzso offset was a primary zzso of inferior zzso zzso flow distribution to the pulmonary arteries with a significant bias to the offset zzso 

zzso flow structures within zzso and zzso zzso were reconstructed and analyzed for the first time using PC zzso zzso flow patterns were shown to be different, not only on the basis of zzso or zzso considerations, but with significant influence from the superior zzso zzso connection as zzso This work adds to the ongoing body of research demonstrating the impact of zzso geometry on the overall zzso zzso
