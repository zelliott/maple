zzso of the zzso zzso region present a considerable surgical zzso Their location combined with the close anatomical relation to sensitive and important vascular and nervous structures can make total removal difficult and sometimes zzso zzso and zzso approaches, despite their zzso offer poor exposure and require zzso or rotation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso approaches are restrictive when a spacious superior exposure is necessary, while the vascular structures hidden by the zzso themselves appear only at the end of a rather tedious zzso The direct anterior zzso route, although effective for zzso zzso can be restrictive for zzso placed or broad-based zzso A true lateral exposure provides an attractive alternative, the only anatomical obstacles being the horizontal part of the zzso artery and the zzso zzso with its articulation with the lateral zzso zzso A lateral approach was used in 15 patients with zzso located zzso of the zzso zzso resulting in 12 total and three zzso zzso In no case has there been inadequate zzso exposure and there were no complications of instability, zzso leak or infection directly related to the zzso Important advantages of the approach include: excellent exposure of the zzso zzso zzso early and safe exposure of vascular structures, preservation of stability, minimal risk of infection, elimination of the need for zzso zzso and simplicity of instruments and zzso
