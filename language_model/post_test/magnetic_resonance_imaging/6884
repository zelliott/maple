A zzso man was admitted to our hospital with progressive zzso in both feet and gait zzso MR imaging revealed a large cervical disc zzso resulting in significant spinal zzso zzso with zzso of the spinal zzso on zzso images at zzso Immediately after undergoing anterior cervical zzso the patient developed severe weakness of his left hand and lower zzso MR imaging obtained 5 days after surgery revealed a long segment zzso between zzso and zzso on zzso zzso This long segment zzso disappeared after 2 weeks of steroid zzso We suspect that the persistent, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents spinal zzso zzso due to zzso and trauma resulting from the disc zzso However, the transient long segment zzso may represent zzso probably due to minor trauma of an already compromised cord, during the zzso zzso zzso should be aware that even careful surgery can result in a significant change in zzso studies and neurological zzso
