zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso time series are investigated with a zzso method based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso method to extract local zzso zzso zzso The spectrum of zzso zzso of each zzso time series is zzso by spectral characteristics including its maximum and the corresponding zzso We found that the range of zzso zzso in zzso with zzso is close to 1, whereas zzso are close to zzso in white matter zzso without zzso The maximum dimension decreases going from white matter to gray matter, and is lower still for activated time zzso The zzso of the zzso is higher in activated zzso The proposed method becomes particularly effective when combining these spectral characteristics into a single zzso Using these zzso zzso it is possible to identify activated areas in the human brain in both hybrid and in zzso zzso data sets without knowledge of the stimulation paradigm zzso
