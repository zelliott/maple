To determine the prevalence of specific cerebral zzso of zzso sclerosis complex zzso and neurological outcome in cases diagnosed zzso with cardiac zzso 

We reviewed all fetuses diagnosed zzso with cardiac zzso which had undergone detailed ultrasound evaluation and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging zzso and which were recorded in the database of a single institution covering the period January 1992 to December zzso 

Fifty-one fetuses were included in the zzso zzso was performed at a mean zzso zzso zzso age of 30 zzso 3 zzso weeks and showed specific zzso of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso of pregnancy was chosen by the parents in 26 zzso Neurological development was studied in 20 cases, follow-up lasting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso events occurred during the follow-up period in zzso of zzso Neurological complications occurred in zzso of patients who had cerebral zzso at zzso and in zzso of patients with normal zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the two groups of patients zzso zzso zzso 

In fetuses with cardiac zzso detailed ultrasound examination and zzso cerebral zzso are able to diagnose most zzso cerebral zzso but fail to determine neurological zzso
