zzso is a key component of adaptable zzso behavior and is known to depend on a network of frontal and zzso brain zzso However, the mechanisms by which this network supports reasoning and adaptable behavior remain poorly zzso Here, we examine the relationship between reasoning, executive control, and zzso function in a series of zzso reasoning zzso Our results demonstrate that, in accordance with previous studies, a network of frontal and zzso brain regions is recruited during zzso Our results also reveal that this network can be zzso according to how different zzso respond when distinct reasoning demands are zzso While increased rule complexity zzso activity within a right zzso network including the middle frontal zzso and the superior zzso cortex, zzso reasoning zzso the requirement to zzso rules on to novel zzso the left inferior zzso prefrontal zzso and the lateral zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso extent of the inferior frontal zzso associated with simpler executive demands, is not zzso sensitive to rule complexity or zzso zzso These findings zzso well with the hypothesis that different reasoning demands are supported by different frontal and zzso zzso
