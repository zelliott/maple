A class of fast magnetic zzso imaging methods using continuously zzso zzso for zzso (three spatial and one zzso zzso is zzso zzso may start immediately following the application of an zzso zzso pulse, thus enabling measurement of spin density, chemical shift, and relaxation rates of zzso zzso For spatial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are used to sample a ball in k zzso The two types of zzso presented include: zzso continuously zzso zzso with continuously rotating direction used for zzso zzso imaging and zzso continuously zzso zzso followed by a zzso directed along discrete zzso Design criteria are given and zzso and zzso reconstruction methods are zzso zzso zzso functions and zzso ratios are derived while considering zzso zzso effects, and zzso zzso zzso Experimental zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso images collected at zzso T are zzso The zzso images were acquired with zzso spatial resolution ranging from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso ranging from 600 to 700 zzso thus allowing for the separation of water and zzso signals within a zzso The zzso images, acquired with 500 and 800 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resolution, were resolved in the time domain, yielding zzso localized zzso
