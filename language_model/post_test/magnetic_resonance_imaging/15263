This study characterized the zzso Horizon zzso zzso for use in mouse models of zzso spinal zzso injury zzso and investigated the feasibility and reliability of using magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a method to accurately measure zzso volume after mouse zzso zzso zzso female zzso mice received a mild (30 zzso moderate zzso zzso or severe zzso zzso zzso injury at the zzso zzso zzso zzso control mice received a zzso zzso zzso zzso recovery was assessed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Mouse zzso zzso zzso locomotor rating zzso Next, zzso zzso spinal cords were collected between the zzso and zzso spinal roots, and stored in zzso saline (PBS) at 4 degrees C until zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were determined using zzso images on a zzso zzso zzso was performed on zzso zzso zzso sections processed from the same spinal cords for zzso determination of zzso zzso volume and zzso basic protein spared white matter zzso Area of spared white matter at the epicenter was also zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso zzso produced precise, graded zzso zzso in zzso zzso volumes were positively correlated with force of impact, and zzso correlated with spared white matter and functional zzso Additionally, similar zzso volumes were detected using zzso zzso and zzso analysis, although zzso may be more sensitive for milder zzso These results give researchers more options in how to analyze spinal zzso injuries in animal zzso
