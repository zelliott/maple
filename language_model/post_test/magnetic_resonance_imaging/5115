To show that zzso areas of the lung demonstrated on zzso zzso scanning in children with primary pulmonary tuberculosis zzso may be of low signal intensity on zzso 

Review of magnetic resonance imaging scans zzso zzso in 6 children scanned because of zzso zzso areas demonstrated on zzso zzso scanning prior to zzso confirmation of pulmonary zzso 

zzso included zzso consolidation in 6 children zzso central necrosis in 6 children zzso zzso in 2 children zzso and zzso in 6 children zzso Low zzso signal in the areas of necrosis was demonstrated in all 6 children zzso and in an area of at least 2 zzso 2 zzso 1 child also showed an area of high signal zzso zzso consolidation demonstrated zzso high signal in all the children zzso Both children with zzso demonstrated at least 1 zzso with a low signal in addition to the majority of zzso zzso Post zzso the consolidation and all zzso zzso demonstrated enhancement, whereas the areas of lung necrosis and low signal zzso showed no zzso 

Lung zzso necrosis in primary pulmonary zzso in children may be of low signal intensity on zzso and STIR magnetic resonance zzso This may be zzso to zzso obstruction and is probably due to the zzso zzso
