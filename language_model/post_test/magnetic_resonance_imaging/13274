The zzso of early zzso in large zzso brain cannot be accomplished with zzso zzso zzso due to its limitations in the early phase, nor can it be identified with zzso protein 2 zzso zzso due to the fragility of large thin zzso We zzso that zzso zzso of thick brain sections can accurately identify early zzso in the entire monkey zzso Using zzso brains of one rat and three zzso a zzso zzso zzso protocol was developed to outline the zzso region over the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso of adjacent thick and thin sections in a rat brain indicated complete correspondence between zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso sections in monkey brain possessed the increased structural stability necessary for the extensive zzso zzso procedure permitting zzso of the zzso region as a percent of total monkey brain, giving zzso volumes of zzso zzso and zzso of total zzso zzso zzso images of the intact thick brain tissue sections provided a zzso representation for comparison to zzso zzso The zzso volume of zzso from the zzso sections registered with zzso images agreed well with the volume calculated directly from the stained sections of zzso zzso zzso brain tissue section zzso zzso provides a new method for determining zzso volume over the entire brain at early time points in a zzso zzso model of zzso zzso
