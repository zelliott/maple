The study used zzso to investigate brain zzso in participants who were able to listen to and successfully comprehend two people speaking at the same time zzso The study identified brain mechanisms associated with zzso concurrent zzso as compared with zzso a single zzso zzso showed an increase in the functional connectivity among areas of the language network in the dual zzso The increase in synchronization of brain zzso for zzso was brought about primarily by a change in the timing of left inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso bringing the zzso zzso into closer correspondence with zzso zzso The results show that the change in zzso timing was greater in participants with lower working memory capacity, and that recruitment of additional zzso in the zzso occurred only in the areas adjacent to the language network that was activated in the single zzso The shift in zzso zzso may be a brain marker of how the brain adapts to high-level zzso
