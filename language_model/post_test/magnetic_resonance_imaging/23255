Ambitious international efforts are zzso to produce zzso mice for each of the 25,000 mouse zzso providing a new platform to study zzso development and zzso zzso large-scale methods for zzso assessment of prenatal mice will be essential to this zzso zzso zzso currently relies on zzso techniques but these are not well suited to large volume zzso The qualitative nature of these approaches also limits the potential for detailed group zzso Advances in zzso imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso may zzso these zzso We present a zzso approach to generate detailed virtual zzso of the whole zzso combined with the novel use of a zzso zzso for automated zzso zzso Using individual zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified new zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso we used advanced zzso techniques to produce a zzso zzso zzso from 6 zzso zzso creating an average image with greatly enhanced anatomical detail, particularly in zzso zzso This methodology enabled zzso assessment of zzso differences between zzso zzso and zzso knockout mice zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a new zzso generated from these three groups, quantitative organ volumes were automatically zzso We demonstrated a difference in mean brain volumes between zzso and zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso volumes were also found between zzso and zzso mice zzso zzso Our work demonstrates the feasibility of combining zzso zzso zzso with automated analysis techniques to distinguish novel mouse zzso
