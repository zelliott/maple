The purpose of the study was to evaluate the management and interpersonal zzso of zzso zzso and demonstrate the present diagnostic zzso 

zzso and four patients with 113 complex zzso zzso masses zzso zzso zzso zzso III and 44 zzso were included and zzso between April 1996 and May zzso total, 71 zzso masses were characterized by two zzso in consensus initially as the first diagnosis zzso 1), and then by a zzso zzso 2) and a zzso zzso 3) independently in a blinded zzso 

Only 11 patients zzso were symptomatic (one zzso zzso six III and four zzso Only one had zzso cell zzso zzso on final zzso whereas the others zzso zzso 10) had benign zzso An overall pathological result was obtained in 71 masses zzso zzso zzso II, three zzso 27 III and 39 zzso The overall zzso of zzso in surgically treated patients was zzso zzso zzso and zzso for each category, zzso The interpersonal zzso was significant among the three groups (especially in zzso II, zzso and the overall category was changed in zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso After correlation with final zzso and presumed benign character of zzso zzso zzso (all patients having reached zzso zzso the differences were not zzso 

It is challenging to minimize unnecessary surgical procedures in zzso category zzso According to these results, it may make practical sense to group zzso II and zzso masses in one zzso
