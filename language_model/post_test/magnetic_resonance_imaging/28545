We report a case of zzso in the thigh of a 42-year-old zzso CT examination depicted a peripherally zzso zzso mass without zzso On zzso images of zzso the mass showed slightly high signal intensity relative to muscle, with the exception of the lower pole, which showed high signal zzso On zzso images, the mass showed high signal intensity and zzso zzso The lower pole showed low signal intensity on zzso images and was thought to be zzso zzso Low signal intensity structures on both zzso and zzso images were observed within and around the zzso They were thought to be zzso vessels, although this was not confirmed at zzso zzso should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a tumor in the thigh when MR images show the mass with slightly high signal intensity on zzso images, zzso zzso and flow voids within or adjacent to the zzso
