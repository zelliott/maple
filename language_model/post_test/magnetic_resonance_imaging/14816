This project aimed to determine if a zzso measure of functional connectivity can identify zzso zones from zzso zzso signals, as well as to investigate the zzso significance of such a measure on seizure outcome following zzso lobe zzso To this end, we zzso analyzed 23 adult patients with intractable zzso lobe zzso zzso who underwent an invasive zzso zzso evaluation between January 2009 year and January zzso A follow-up of at least one year was zzso The primary outcome measure was complete zzso at last zzso zzso connectivity between two areas in the zzso lobe that were sampled by two zzso zzso contacts was defined as zzso correlation zzso of zzso activity between those zzso zzso signals were filtered between 5 and 50 zzso prior to computing this zzso The mean and standard zzso of the off diagonal elements in the connectivity zzso were also zzso Analysis of the mean and standard zzso of the functional connections for each patient reveals that zzso of the patients who had weak and zzso connections were seizure free one year after zzso zzso whereas zzso of the patients who had stronger and more zzso connections within the zzso lobe had recurrence of zzso This suggests that zzso zzso is ineffective in preventing seizure recurrence for patients in whom the zzso lobe is characterized by zzso connected, zzso zzso This pilot study shows promising potential of a simple measure of functional brain connectivity to identify zzso and predict the outcome of zzso zzso
