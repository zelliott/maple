To determine the effect of humanized zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso on zzso zzso activity in zzso 

A randomized, zzso zzso trial in 72 patients with active zzso and secondary progressive zzso was zzso Each patient received two IV infusions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 4 weeks apart and was followed up for 24 weeks with serial zzso and clinical zzso 

The treated group exhibited significantly fewer new active zzso zzso zzso versus zzso per zzso and new enhancing zzso zzso zzso versus zzso per zzso than the zzso group over the first 12 zzso There was no significant difference in the number of new active or new enhancing zzso in the second 12 weeks of the zzso The number of zzso zzso zzso zzso that enhanced on the baseline zzso that continued to enhance 4 weeks following the first treatment was not significantly different between the two zzso The number of patients with acute zzso zzso was not significantly different in the two groups during the first 12 weeks (9 in the treated group versus 10 in zzso but was higher in the treatment group in the second 12 weeks zzso versus 3; p zzso zzso The study was not, however, designed to look definitively at the effect of treatment on zzso zzso Treatment was well zzso 

zzso treatment with zzso zzso against zzso zzso results in a significant reduction in the number of new active zzso on zzso Further studies will be required to determine the longer term effect of this treatment on zzso and clinical zzso
