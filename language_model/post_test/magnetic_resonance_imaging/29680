The present method enables the zzso assessment of mean pulmonary zzso pressure from magnetic resonance phase mapping by computing both physical and zzso zzso The physical parameters include the mean blood flow zzso over the zzso area of the main pulmonary artery zzso at the zzso peak and the zzso zzso zzso zzso area value, whereas the zzso parameters are related to each patient, such as zzso weight, and heart zzso These parameters have been measured in a series of 31 patients undergoing zzso heart zzso and the zzso mean pulmonary zzso pressure value zzso has been compared with the mean pressure value obtained from zzso zzso in each zzso A significant correlation was found that did not differ from the identity line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean and zzso absolute differences between zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The method was also applied to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso pressures in the same patient zzso We conclude that this zzso method, which combines physical zzso the zzso and zzso parameters zzso to each zzso improves the accuracy of zzso to zzso estimate pulmonary zzso zzso
