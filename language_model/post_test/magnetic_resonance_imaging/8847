Spin relaxation taking place during zzso zzso zzso can be assessed by measuring the zzso and zzso rotating frame relaxation rate zzso zzso and zzso These relaxation parameters can be altered by utilizing different settings of the zzso zzso thus providing a useful tool to generate contrast in zzso In this work, we investigate the zzso of zzso and zzso due to zzso interactions and zzso exchange zzso exchange between spins with different chemical shift zzso not zzso on the properties of conventional zzso and zzso zzso with particular emphasis on the latter ones which were not fully described zzso The results of simulations based on relaxation theory provide a foundation for zzso practical considerations for in zzso applications of rotating frame relaxation zzso Rotating frame relaxation zzso obtained from zzso and from the human brain at 4 T are presented to confirm the theoretical zzso
