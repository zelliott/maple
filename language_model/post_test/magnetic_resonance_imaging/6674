We describe a novel method of reconstructing images of an zzso zzso zzso distribution inside an zzso conducting subject in magnetic resonance electrical zzso zzso zzso zzso is a recent medical imaging technique combining electrical zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso to produce zzso images with improved spatial resolution and zzso In zzso we inject electrical current into the subject through surface zzso and measure the zzso zzso of the induced magnetic flux density using an zzso zzso Here, we assume that zzso is the direction of the main magnetic field of the zzso zzso Considering the fact that most biological zzso are known to have zzso zzso values, the primary goal of zzso should be the imaging of an zzso zzso zzso zzso However, up to now, all zzso techniques have assumed an zzso zzso distribution in the image reconstruction problem to simplify the underlying mathematical zzso In this paper, we zzso formulate a new image reconstruction method of an zzso zzso zzso zzso We use the relationship between multiple injection currents and the corresponding induced zzso zzso zzso results show that the zzso can successfully reconstruct images of zzso zzso zzso zzso While the results show the feasibility of the method, they also suggest a more careful design of data collection methods and data processing techniques compared with zzso zzso zzso
