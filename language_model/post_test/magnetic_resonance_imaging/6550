The aim of this study was to evaluate the roles of zzso dynamic and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso in detecting wrist joint inflammation in early zzso arthritis zzso zzso 

zzso early zzso patients zzso symptom duration 5 months, range zzso zzso underwent zzso NC zzso laboratory and clinical zzso zzso wrist zzso scans were zzso scored for zzso bone zzso and zzso by two independent readers using the recently published zzso arthritis zzso scoring system zzso Twenty NC scans were zzso zzso by measuring maximum zzso zzso in three small areas of each zzso From the same locations on the zzso dynamic zzso zzso acid zzso enhancement rates zzso were zzso The average zzso zzso of the whole wrist region was also measured and average zzso were zzso zzso between zzso and NC zzso zzso were zzso zzso between imaging methods of the wrist and the global measures of inflammation zzso and clinical zzso were also zzso 

Strong correlations emerged between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reflecting similar performance of the methods in detecting local zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso correlated with zzso scoring of zzso and bone zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso rate zzso correlated with zzso scores, zzso and zzso zzso No correlation between the clinical parameters and the imaging methods was zzso zzso reliability for scoring zzso zzso bone zzso and bone zzso from zzso MR images were high zzso zzso zzso correlations zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reliability for zzso and zzso zzso of 10 randomly picked scans was found to be high, with an zzso correlation of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso information about wrist joint inflammation can be obtained with zzso dynamic zzso and quantitative zzso NC zzso zzso also allows zzso and zzso scoring of bone zzso and zzso of the zzso Dynamic zzso and NC zzso are safe and easy to perform, and they can be used in a long-term follow-up of zzso zzso
