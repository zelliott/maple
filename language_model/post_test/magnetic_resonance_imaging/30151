zzso zzso the process of transforming similar representations or memories into highly zzso zzso zzso is a key component of many functions ascribed to the zzso zzso models have stressed the role of the zzso and, in particular, the zzso zzso and its projections into the zzso zzso in pattern zzso We used high-resolution zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during incidental memory zzso Although activity consistent with a bias toward pattern completion was observed in zzso the zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso activity consistent with a strong bias toward pattern separation was observed in, and limited to, the zzso zzso These results provide compelling evidence of a key role of the human zzso zzso in pattern zzso
