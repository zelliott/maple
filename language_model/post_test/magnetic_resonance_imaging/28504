We studied magnetic field intensity in the magnetic resonance imaging suite at our hospital and its possible effect on several different types of aneurysm clips, including one zzso zzso zzso six zzso zzso one Mayfield, six zzso zzso zzso one zzso zzso four zzso and zzso zzso zzso We carefully observed the clips for any zzso or zzso movements along the path from the door towards the magnetic resonance imaging zzso The magnetic field strength was zzso zzso at the entrance of the room, with an acute increase of magnetic strength at 310 zzso away from the entrance to the room, 90 zzso to the entrance of the zzso The magnetic strength continued to increase at a rate of zzso zzso for every 20 zzso up to the entrance to the zzso No movement was observed in any of the clips at the entrance to the suite except for the zzso zzso zzso clip, which showed small movement in the zzso plane of the zzso At the entrance to the zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Mayfield clips were aligned on the walls of the test container perpendicular to the magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clips showed no movement throughout the path of the stretcher or near the zzso
