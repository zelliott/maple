To test zzso and zzso MR imaging techniques within the extreme time constraints of stroke evaluation before therapy, and then, with MR imaging, zzso patients into those without zzso those with zzso zzso and those with cortical zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso images and zzso zzso and zzso images were zzso Trace zzso images and zzso zzso maps were automatically zzso and immediately available for zzso 

zzso patients with acute stroke symptoms underwent imaging within 6 hours of symptom zzso 35 were eligible for the therapy zzso The mean time from entering the emergency department to beginning MR imaging was 45 minutes; the mean total MR imaging time was less than 15 zzso Immediate image analysis directly affected individual clinical zzso Four patients showed evidence of no zzso seven, of zzso zzso and 24, of acute cortical zzso Sixteen patients underwent zzso thirteen had zzso zzso zzso were treated zzso and in seven, zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging for acute stroke is feasible and zzso before therapy zzso zzso MR imaging permitted immediate zzso of 35 patients with symptoms of zzso stroke and thus helped avoid the risks from zzso and zzso agents in some or spurred the judicious use of more aggressive intervention in zzso
