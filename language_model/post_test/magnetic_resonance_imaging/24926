Prospective study on magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso findings of the cervical zzso 

To zzso the age-related changes of the cervical spinal zzso and the cervical spinal canal and the relationship between the spinal zzso and the spinal canal in zzso subjects using zzso and zzso 

Tokyo, zzso 

The zzso area of the cervical spinal zzso and the ratio of the zzso diameter to the zzso diameter zzso were investigated, using zzso in 229 zzso zzso The zzso spinal canal diameter and zzso diameter of the cervical zzso body were also measured on plain lateral zzso The canal body ratio zzso which was defined as the diameter of the spinal canal divided by that of the zzso body, was zzso 

The zzso spinal zzso area correlated zzso with zzso zzso did not correlate with zzso The zzso correlated zzso with zzso The correlation between spinal zzso area and zzso was significant but weak and the correlation between zzso and zzso was not zzso 

The zzso area of the cervical spinal zzso measured by zzso decreased with age, while zzso remained zzso The zzso spinal canal became zzso with zzso The spinal zzso area and the shapes of the spinal zzso were independent from the spinal canal diameter in zzso zzso These facts should be considered when evaluating zzso findings in patients with cervical spinal zzso
