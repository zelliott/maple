An objective of the study was to compare sensitivity of low- and extra zzso frequency magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and to assess differences between symptoms in obtained zzso A study was conducted using experimental zzso in rats zzso zzso were formed by two injections of zzso blood into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with magnetic field strength of 7 T and zzso with magnetic field strength of zzso T were used in the zzso zzso was carried out 3-5 h after the zzso Both zzso revealed the presence of pathological zzso in all zzso Extra zzso frequency zzso showed the specific signs of zzso caused by the zzso effect of zzso in zzso and zzso images zzso and low frequency zzso - in zzso zzso The comparable sensitivity of low- and extra zzso frequency zzso in zzso zzso was zzso
