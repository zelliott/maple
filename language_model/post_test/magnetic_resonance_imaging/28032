Geometric zzso of the left zzso zzso following zzso zzso and zzso insult is associated with zzso load zzso Regional zzso based on 3-D reconstructions of the zzso are used to calculate the regional zzso The technique uses surface zzso to derive local zzso and zzso zzso Following the validation of the procedure on simple geometric shapes, the effect of acute zzso on the regional load zzso was studied in six open chest zzso Short axis magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans were used to reconstruct zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images by applying our zzso shape zzso before and after acute coronary zzso Regional zzso as well as local wall thickness by the volume element method were calculated before and after acute zzso and were used to approximate regional zzso by a regional stress index zzso zzso evaluation using zzso blue zzso was used to divide each zzso to normal zzso zzso zzso and border zzso zones in the zzso case, and to the zzso matched regions in the zzso zzso zzso affects the local zzso and loads both at zzso and zzso At zzso zzso rose significantly only in the zzso Similarly, at zzso the highest increase in load was detected in the zzso but increases in zzso and zzso load were seen in all zzso zzso the load zzso following acute zzso helps delineate the mechanisms affecting geometric zzso zzso following zzso zzso
