An experimental technique for producing a zzso spinal trauma which zzso a slipped zzso disc or a fractured vertebra was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging and zzso The results were evaluated with respect to their clinical zzso 

A total of 69 zzso rats were used for this zzso An inflatable zzso balloon device was placed zzso or zzso to the spinal zzso in order to produce a spinal zzso 30 rats were used to compare neurological zzso between zzso and zzso zzso 30 animals underwent graded zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed and the results were compared to zzso 

Using this technique, the balloon device can be placed zzso to the spinal zzso The zzso time had a direct effect on changes on magnetic resonance images and zzso in zzso but a longer zzso time did not produce increased zzso The zzso zzso scans showed zzso changes immediately after spinal zzso zzso they are the appropriate way for diagnosing acute spinal zzso Although the zzso zzso scans did not change after spinal zzso they are important for diagnosing zzso zzso 

With this technique common zzso spinal trauma can be readily zzso zzso resonance imaging allows early detection of zzso changes in experimental spinal zzso injuries in the zzso
