As an alternative tool to identify cortical motor areas for planning surgical zzso in children with focal zzso the present study proposed a maximum a zzso probability zzso zzso of zzso tract zzso zzso by diffusion MR zzso 

zzso imaging zzso was performed in 17 normally developing children and 20 children with focal zzso An independent component analysis zzso combined with zzso model was performed to identify unique zzso pathways originating from zzso finger, and leg areas determined by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in healthy children and electrical stimulation mapping zzso in children with zzso Group analyses were performed to construct zzso probability maps of primary motor pathways connecting zzso zzso and zzso limb of internal zzso and then zzso to design a novel zzso zzso that can sort individual zzso fibers associated with three classes of zzso zzso fingers, and zzso A systematic zzso approach was applied to train an optimal zzso A match was considered to occur if classified fibers contacted or surrounded true areas localized by zzso and zzso 

It was found that the zzso provided high accuracy for the zzso fibers terminating in proximity to the zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso for fingers, zzso for leg zzso and zzso for zzso zzso for fingers, and zzso for leg zzso within 2 zzso 

This study provides preliminary evidence that in the absence of zzso and zzso data, the zzso approach can effectively retrieve the locations of cortical motor areas and underlying zzso courses for planning zzso zzso
