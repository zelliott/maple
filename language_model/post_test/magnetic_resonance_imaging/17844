zzso interference zzso has significant therapeutic promise for the genetic treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are able to deliver small interfering zzso zzso into zzso cells with high zzso efficiency and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso was constructed as a magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso for the delivery of zzso zzso targeting the human zzso cell line zzso The zzso characterization of the zzso was zzso The zzso complexes exhibited a higher zzso efficiency in transferring zzso zzso into zzso cells compared with a zzso delivery system, which resulted in more significant gene suppression at both the zzso zzso and protein expression zzso Then, the level of zzso zzso was significantly zzso and a remarkable level of tumor cell zzso was zzso As a result, the tumor growth in the nude mice zzso zzso model was significantly zzso The targeting ability of the zzso was successfully zzso by zzso scans performed in zzso and in zzso Our results strongly indicated that the zzso can potentially be used as a targeted zzso zzso for altering gene expression in the treatment of zzso zzso and for detecting the tumor in zzso as an effective zzso zzso
