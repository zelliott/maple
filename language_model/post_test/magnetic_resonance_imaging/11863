During the past decade zzso has gained increasing popularity for detection of zzso zzso in patients with coronary artery zzso However, about zzso to zzso of the patients submitted for zzso do not have an adequate acoustic zzso The purpose of this study was to compare high-dose zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso as alternative strategies for detection of zzso zzso in patients with inadequate image quality by zzso 

Of 296 patients which were zzso submitted to zzso 45 patients zzso had two or more segments that could not be evaluated according to the zzso of the American Society of zzso They underwent zzso and zzso studies, which were evaluated using a zzso zzso zzso segments were attributed to zzso territories of the coronary zzso The results of zzso detection were compared to the results of coronary zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

In comparison to coronary zzso zzso yielded a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a positive zzso value of zzso a negative zzso value of zzso and a diagnostic accuracy of zzso For zzso results were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These values were not significantly zzso 

In patients not suitable for zzso both zzso and zzso are reliable strategies for detection of zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the patient criteria, technical considerations, local logistics and experience of the zzso
