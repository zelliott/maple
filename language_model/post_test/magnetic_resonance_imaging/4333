The activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso which plays a role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso appears to be modulated in resting zzso during different zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso In particular, a significant decrease zzso of the zzso activity was observed, with respect to healthy subjects, in zzso patients who were in zzso or in the very early stages of zzso A similar trend was found to be associated with patients affected by active zzso A statistically significant decrease in the zzso activity was also observed in patients with the progressive zzso By contrast, core 2 zzso activity did not appear correlated with duration of the zzso Interestingly, zzso individuals under treatment with zzso an zzso agent, showed levels of activity which were comparable with those observed in healthy zzso Together, these observations suggest that zzso of core 2 zzso activity is linked to the occurrence of acute zzso in the zzso form and to the progressive form of the disease, probably caused by altered expression of zzso which are involved in zzso zzso and/or interaction with the zzso Additionally, it appears that the zzso zzso may provide a useful marker of the disease activity and the effects of zzso zzso
