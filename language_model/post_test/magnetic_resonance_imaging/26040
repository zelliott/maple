Previous research has provided evidence for brain abnormalities in zzso but their relationship to specific clinical symptoms and syndromes remains zzso 

With an zzso demographically similar sample of 53 schizophrenic patients and 29 normal control subjects, cerebral gray and white matter volumes zzso for zzso volume and age were determined for regions in the prefrontal lobe and in the superficial and zzso zzso lobe using zzso magnetic resonance imaging with zzso zzso zzso 

As a group, schizophrenic patients had zzso bilateral zzso in gray matter in the zzso zzso and zzso lobe regions zzso but not in white matter in these zzso In the zzso zzso gray matter reductions were found zzso in the superior zzso zzso zzso but not in the zzso and zzso While there were no overall group differences in white matter volumes, widespread zzso in prefrontal white matter in schizophrenic patients zzso zzso zzso were related to higher levels of negative symptoms zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as measured by the zzso for the Assessment of zzso zzso A post hoc analysis revealed that schizophrenic patients with high negative symptoms had generalized prefrontal white matter reductions zzso that were most severe in the zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that gray matter deficits may be a fairly common structural zzso of zzso whereas reductions in prefrontal white matter may be associated with schizophrenic negative zzso
