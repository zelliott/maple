Patients with zzso neglect zzso zzso lines toward zzso zzso It has been zzso that IN might be induced by an attempt at compensation, as part of the crossover effect, where patients with an zzso bias when zzso long lines, cross over and develop a zzso bias on short lines or as a release of an approach zzso behavior that might be zzso or zzso To test these alternative hypotheses we had a patient with IN from a right zzso frontal zzso zzso lines that contained no zzso a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and bilateral zzso If this patient had zzso neglect zzso because of a crossover effect or compensation, zzso cues should have influenced zzso more than zzso zzso zzso however, found that only zzso cues induced a significant change zzso zzso providing support for the zzso zzso zzso Further support of this zzso zzso grasp hypothesis comes from the observation that this patient also had zzso extinction to simultaneous zzso
