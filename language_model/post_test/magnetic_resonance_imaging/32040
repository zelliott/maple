To examine the association between zzso volumes, general brain zzso and zzso E zzso zzso in patients with a remote traumatic brain injury zzso 

zzso zzso analyses of the zzso and lateral zzso were performed in 58 patients with zzso of varying severity on average zzso years after the zzso The zzso zzso was determined using standard methods and correlated with the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso or lateral zzso volumes did not differ significantly in those patients with the zzso zzso zzso vs those without this zzso 

The zzso zzso was not associated with the development of zzso or zzso zzso after traumatic brain zzso If the zzso zzso is associated with an zzso outcome after traumatic brain injury as proposed, this association may involve mechanisms other than those responsible for the development of brain zzso
