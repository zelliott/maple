zzso spontaneous leaving behavior zzso is an uncommonly reported zzso The aim of this study was to determine its frequency, clinical significance, and especially its zzso zzso 

We analyzed zzso the spontaneous zzso LB occurring in complex partial zzso zzso of 138 patients with medically zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso with excellent zzso seizure outcome and zzso finding of zzso zzso The relation of LB occurring in different zzso of zzso to the side of zzso was zzso 

The overall frequency of zzso LB was zzso of 517 zzso and zzso of 123 zzso Among the 12 patients with zzso zzso 9 patients had zzso focus zzso to language dominant side, whereas the remaining 3 had seizure onset in the zzso zzso zzso 8 of 11 patients with zzso LB had zzso in the zzso side, and only three patients' zzso originated in the dominant zzso zzso it was more likely for patients with left zzso to show zzso LB and for those with right zzso to display zzso LB zzso zzso zzso 

LB may represent a potential zzso zzso When LB occurs zzso it may indicate seizure onset in the dominant zzso zzso and LB occurring zzso indicates zzso side seizure onset in patients with zzso
