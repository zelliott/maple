zzso is shaped by environmental challenge in the context of zzso zzso zzso and cognitive processes evoke patterned changes in bodily state that may signal emotional state to zzso This dynamic zzso of visceral state is zzso zzso by sympathetic and zzso divisions of the zzso nervous zzso zzso neural zzso convey representations of the internal state of the body back to the brain to further influence emotion and zzso zzso and zzso studies zzso specific regions of zzso zzso in the zzso generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso within these regions may predict zzso zzso response patterns within and between bodily zzso with implications for zzso zzso Feedback from the zzso is mapped zzso in the brain to influence zzso signals, and ultimately at the cortical level to zzso and reinforce affective responses and zzso feeling zzso Again zzso and patient studies suggest discrete neural zzso for these zzso notably regions of zzso and zzso zzso Individual differences in conscious access to these zzso representations predict differences in emotional experience, but equally the zzso of heightened zzso level may evoke changes in emotional zzso through engagement of the same neural zzso zzso of feedback may impair emotional zzso and, in the context of inflammatory states give rise to zzso affective and zzso expressions of zzso Changes in visceral state during emotion may be mirrored in the responses of others, permitting a corresponding representation in the zzso The degree to which individuals are susceptible to this zzso predicts individual differences in questionnaire ratings of zzso Together these zzso and clinical studies highlight the dynamic relationship between mind and body and help identify neural zzso that may translate thoughts into zzso zzso and bodily states into feelings that can be zzso
