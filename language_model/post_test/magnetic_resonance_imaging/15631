To investigate structural abnormalities in bipolar disorder zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso in closely matched patients and controls, and to examine the relationship of clinical features with regional gray matter zzso zzso 

zzso patients (six zzso aged zzso years zzso years, zzso zzso with zzso bipolar I disorder were compared with 25 control subjects, matched on age, sex, and years of zzso zzso analyses were conducted on high-resolution zzso brain magnetic resonance imaging to detect regional zzso volume differences between groups, ensuring statistical correlation for age, sex and total zzso zzso Within the patient groups, regional zzso changes were also zzso 

Compared to controls, BD patients had increased zzso volume in left zzso zzso and decreased zzso volume in left middle zzso zzso Family history, psychotic symptoms and zzso status were associated with regional zzso abnormalities in BD zzso 

This study presents evidence of gray matter volume abnormalities in adults with bipolar I zzso Regional variation in relation to clinical factors suggests a zzso basis for clinical zzso and zzso the possibility of trait zzso
