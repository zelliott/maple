This overview addresses the remarkable efficiency of the zzso heart as a pump of unique capacity to quickly vary output and ejection zzso and its relation to zzso zzso fiber architecture, integrity of collagen scaffold and zzso and appropriate electrical zzso The unique functional capacity of the zzso depends critically on the organization of cardiac muscle fibers in layers of zzso zzso zzso the zzso cavity in a pattern that allows a special twisting motion during zzso and early zzso essential to the mechanical efficiency of the normal zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso The important contribution of advances in imaging techniques is zzso especially magnetic resonance with tagging and zzso analysis to define fiber zzso these zzso are made without the use of implanted devices that can distort structure and even impair zzso The impact of loss of optimal fiber orientation and geometry of the zzso as a result of diseases that cause heart failure is zzso along with the possibility of improvement by carefully planned surgical restoration of zzso zzso The very encouraging results yielded by these therapeutic strategies are critically dependent on a clear understanding of the relation of structure and function that our analysis attempts to zzso zzso there is full acknowledgment of the unanswered questions that are inevitable but equally essential to the continuing search that scientific progress depends zzso
