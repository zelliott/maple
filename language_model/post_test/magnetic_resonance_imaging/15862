The authors investigated the effect of zzso facet zzso zzso on zzso disc zzso zzso facet joint zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Using kinetic zzso zzso zzso zzso which was defined as a difference in symmetry of more than 7 degrees between the zzso of the facet zzso was investigated in 900 functional spinal units zzso subjects) in zzso neutral, and extension zzso Each segment at zzso zzso and zzso was assessed based on the extent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso According to the presence of zzso they were classified into two zzso one with zzso and one with facet zzso For each group, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso motion were zzso 

The zzso of zzso was zzso at zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso Age and gender did not show any significant relationship with zzso Additionally, no correlation was observed between zzso and zzso zzso however, was found to be associated with a higher zzso of highly zzso facet zzso at zzso when compared to patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso was not observed to have any effects upon zzso zzso zzso 

No significant correlation was observed between zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, zzso was shown to be associated significantly with the presence of high grades of zzso at zzso This suggests that at active sites of zzso motion, zzso may zzso to the development of facet joint zzso
