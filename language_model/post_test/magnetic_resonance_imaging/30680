We evaluated the diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance zzso zzso in pediatric patients with a solitary kidney and/or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso We present our evolving experience with this imaging zzso 

A total of 30 patients with a mean age of zzso months with a known or suspected solitary kidney with or without clinical symptoms underwent ultrasound of the urinary tract as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso The results of these diagnostic imaging studies were then compared with each other and set against the results of the final diagnosis established at surgery and by zzso if zzso 

zzso zzso or zzso zzso buds suspected on ultrasound in 11 of the 30 patients were confirmed in all 11 by zzso While accompanying zzso zzso insertions were shown in only 3 patients by zzso they were zzso in all 4 by zzso The other 7 patients with zzso zzso buds had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to detect 10 zzso zzso 

The diagnostic value of zzso appears to be superior to that of other imaging tests, even to that of zzso zzso which with zzso zzso is currently considered the gold standard for evaluating zzso suspected solitary zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso buds and zzso zzso zzso
