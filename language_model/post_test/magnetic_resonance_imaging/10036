Previous studies of zzso differences in functional imaging during spatial and language tasks have been zzso Furthermore, among women, such differences may occur during zzso phase compared to the rest of the zzso zzso In order to examine further gender differences, functional zzso was performed in 12 male volunteers and 12 female volunteers (in the zzso zzso during mental rotation and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso P values of zzso for the specific regions of interest zzso revealed cerebral zzso differences in both zzso During mental rotation tests, higher levels of zzso were noted in the right zzso zzso zzso and bilateral inferior zzso cortex, while in women this occurred in the right inferior and zzso zzso right superior frontal cortex, and left zzso zzso During zzso tests, higher levels of zzso in men was found in the left zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that differences in cerebral activity during cognitive tasks can be shown between men and women in the zzso zzso Gender differences while performing a mental rotation task were more prominent than during a zzso zzso
