Recently, a large-scale genetic zzso study has shown significant association of single zzso zzso zzso in the protein zzso C zzso zzso gene with cerebral zzso particularly, with zzso zzso To extend the findings, we tested association of two zzso previously zzso and zzso zzso with silent zzso zzso zzso which has drawn substantial attention in the aging zzso Disease association was tested in the zzso study zzso zzso with and without zzso were recruited from people who underwent a zzso examination including brain zzso Two zzso were zzso and proven to be in complete linkage zzso zzso zzso and thus showed comparable results of disease association, which were reproduced in two panels collected zzso In the entire population involving 295 cases and 497 controls, two zzso remained to be significantly associated with zzso under a dominant model even after adjustment for zzso factors such as hypertension zzso genetic effects of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso adjusted odds zzso zzso zzso zzso As the two zzso appear to be common only in Asian people, further replication study is warranted in the other Asian populations as well as the zzso
