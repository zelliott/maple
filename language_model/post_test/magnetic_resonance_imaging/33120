zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on pelvic zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso are an important feature of the modified New York zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso are often difficult to zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso can be detected also on magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso early in the disease course before they can be seen on zzso The goals of this study were to assess the zzso of erosion and related features, zzso extended erosion zzso and zzso zzso of excavated zzso in the zzso using a standardized zzso zzso 

Four readers independently assessed zzso and short zzso inversion recovery sequence zzso images of the zzso from 30 AS patients and 30 controls (15 patients with zzso back pain and 15 healthy zzso zzso 45 years zzso zzso zzso and zzso were recorded according to standardized zzso zzso was assessed by percentage zzso among six possible reader pairs, zzso statistics zzso as zzso zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso as sum zzso for all readers zzso 

zzso zzso were detected in all AS patients and six controls by zzso 2 zzso The median number of zzso zzso affected by erosion recorded by four readers in 30 AS patients was zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso joint portion zzso zzso zzso For all 60 subjects and for all four readers, the zzso value for erosion was zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso for erosion was zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso For comparison, the zzso and zzso values for bone zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso can be detected on zzso to a comparable degree of reliability as bone zzso zzso despite the significant zzso of their appearance on zzso
