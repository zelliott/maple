In this study we systematically explored the impact of left zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso spatial zzso We investigated 16 zzso first ever stroke patients, focusing on strokes of the Middle zzso zzso zzso and 15 healthy control subjects with a parallel and serial search zzso None of the zzso patients had a zzso or zzso We systematically varied the zzso zzso or zzso of a single zzso and the zzso position zzso or right position in the search array of ten zzso of critical zzso zzso sites were evaluated using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results show that patients had no specific problem with parallel zzso In serial search patients showed a left to right zzso increase in response time for zzso and they omitted more items if the critical feature was located on the right side of the items in the right half of the zzso For low performing patients we found an overlapping zzso area around and anterior to the zzso zzso zzso area 6 and zzso encompassing the frontal eye zzso We conclude that zzso zzso strokes may lead to search zzso in spatial attention, in particular in shifting to the right side of the visual zzso zzso rightward shifting zzso reduces the chance of detecting zzso item features (but not zzso This suggests that spatial attention works with different reference zzso with spatial orientation being more basic than analyzing spatial aspects of zzso
