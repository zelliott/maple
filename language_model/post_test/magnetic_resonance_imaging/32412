zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso play a central role in zzso wall zzso affecting stability of zzso caps covering zzso zzso The objective of this study was to determine the spatial distribution of zzso mass and zzso mass and activity of carotid zzso zzso zzso and relate it to the distribution of zzso zzso 

Fresh zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso segments were cut zzso from the common, zzso zzso and external zzso zzso were subjected to total protein zzso and analyzed by zzso for zzso and -9 and zzso and zzso mass and by zzso for zzso zzso zzso at or near the zzso with highly zzso zzso contained higher zzso levels and activity than segments distant from the zzso highly zzso or zzso plaque contained lower zzso levels and activity and higher zzso zzso zzso streak, zzso with zzso and zzso and fully zzso zzso were enriched in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

The spatial distribution of zzso and zzso in carotid zzso zzso is highly heterogeneous, reflecting zzso location, size, and zzso This study provides the first zzso maps of differential distribution of zzso and zzso over zzso zzso
