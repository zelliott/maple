The purpose of the study is to report the occurrence of zzso zzso after zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

Records of four patients with visual deterioration after zzso zzso were zzso including clinical findings, zzso results, and treatment zzso 

zzso zzso developed 7 to 30 months after gamma knife zzso All patients experienced an abrupt change in visual zzso Clinical findings indicated anterior visual zzso zzso zzso of field loss included nerve fiber bundle and zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso showed swelling and enhancement of the affected portion of the visual apparatus in three zzso zzso zzso were administered in all patients and one partially zzso One patient also received zzso oxygen without zzso 

Although rare, zzso zzso may follow zzso to zzso near the visual zzso zzso dose planning guided by zzso with restriction of the zzso dose to the visual pathways to less than 8 zzso will likely reduce the zzso of this zzso
