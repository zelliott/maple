This article reviews the preliminary experiences and the results obtained on the human brain at 4 T at the University of zzso zzso and functional images are zzso zzso to initial expectations and the early results, it is possible to obtain high-resolution images of the human brain with exquisite zzso contrast, zzso structures especially in the zzso zzso and thalamus, which were not observed clearly in zzso images until zzso These zzso images are possible using a new approach that achieves zzso contrast for different zzso values at approximately the same repetition time and has built-in tolerance to variations in B1 zzso For functional images, the high field provides increased contribution from the zzso and the zzso bed because the zzso zzso in zzso from these zzso vessels increase zzso with the magnitude of the main zzso Images obtained with short echo times at 4 zzso and by implication at lower fields with zzso longer echo times, are expected to be dominated by contributions from large zzso vessel or zzso effects from the large zzso such images are zzso because of their poor spatial correspondence with actual sites of zzso zzso
