The aim of the present study was to examine whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso based method for zzso in zzso measurement of vein blood flow in rats could be used to estimate zzso blood flow zzso zzso were performed using a zzso (7 zzso zzso scanner with a short echo time phase contrast zzso measurement pulse zzso The method was evaluated in zzso by flow zzso in an acrylic pipe and in zzso by recording left zzso vein blood flow in normal and unilaterally zzso zzso In a subset of animals zzso was measured by a direct method using zzso In zzso a high accuracy was found between applied and zzso measured flow rates in the range from zzso to 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso the zzso measured left zzso vein blood flow was zzso higher in unilaterally zzso animals compared to control animals zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 g body zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g body zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed comparable values zzso zzso zzso zzso g body zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g body zzso P zzso zzso In addition, the left kidney volume was recorded by zzso with an increase amounting to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso group compared to zzso Finally, a positive correlation was seen between left zzso vein blood flow and zzso measured zzso volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso is a zzso tool by which measurement of zzso vein blood flow can be performed, and it is concluded that zzso zzso vein flow zzso can be used to estimate zzso in small zzso
