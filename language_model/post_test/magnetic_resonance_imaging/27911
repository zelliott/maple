zzso injury, a major hazard of central nervous system zzso zzso was investigated using sequential studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in beagle dogs with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso All dogs receiving zzso zzso of neon showed no signs of radiation injury to 3 years after zzso Dogs receiving zzso or zzso 13 zzso neon or zzso succumbed to radiation necrosis and died zzso weeks after zzso The findings of imaging studies for all dogs who succumbed to radiation necrosis were normal until 3-6 weeks before zzso zzso studies were performed using zzso T zzso zzso and inversion recovery imaging zzso and high-resolution zzso zzso PET with zzso zzso and zzso The same zzso slices zzso 1-2 zzso were zzso repeatedly zzso after zzso until zzso The earliest zzso changes were seen as decreased zzso activity in the zzso of the zzso zzso with PET or an increase in signal intensity in the zzso white matter on zzso zzso imaging on zzso From the time this increase in signal intensity was first observed, zzso and zzso values increased steadily in both the gray and white matter until zzso The changes in white matter were consistently greater than those in gray zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso examinations support the theory that both cellular and vascular mechanisms are involved in radiation zzso
