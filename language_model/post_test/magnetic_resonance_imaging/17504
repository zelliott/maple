The objective of this magnetic resonance imaging study was to evaluate the role of degenerative changes, zzso spinal zzso and zzso of spinal nerve roots in chronic low back zzso and zzso pain in Finnish zzso The degree of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso discs and zzso of the nerve root canals was zzso and the zzso diameter and zzso area of the zzso zzso canal were measured in 108 zzso with zzso and 90 zzso zzso The zzso diameters at zzso levels were significantly smaller in the patients with zzso than in the zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso disc and zzso or zzso of the zzso disc and zzso of the nerve root canals at level zzso were more frequent among the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the magnetic resonance imaging findings provided a total explanatory rate of only zzso zzso of the zzso canal in the zzso direction was more likely to produce zzso and radiating pain than zzso disc zzso or narrowing of the zzso nerve root zzso
