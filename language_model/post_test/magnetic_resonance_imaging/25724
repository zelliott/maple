To 1) correlate spinal MR features and modes of clinical presentation associated with symptomatic zzso deterioration following longstanding spinal zzso 2) correlate degree of zzso deficit with spinal MR appearance in these zzso and 3) determine the relationship between new symptoms and ongoing zzso zzso 

zzso examination of MR images, and correlation with clinical data, in 94 consecutive zzso 

zzso patients presented with either an increase in degree of zzso or ascending zzso zzso Spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found most zzso Whereas in patients with complete motor and sensory deficit zzso zzso was the most frequent finding zzso zzso of patients with useful motor function had normal spinal zzso There was a significant association zzso less than zzso between zzso zzso and the MR findings of zzso zzso and zzso whereas a normal zzso was over twice as frequent in patients without spinal zzso zzso MR imaging led to an active change in management in zzso of patients, with improvement following surgery in all operated zzso 

Although zzso is a zzso and zzso cause of delayed zzso zzso MR will frequently show other abnormalities such as ongoing zzso zzso MR imaging should be performed urgently in all patients with new symptoms to enable early treatment to prevent irreversible loss of zzso
