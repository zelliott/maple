There has been a great deal of interest in understanding how the human brain processes zzso food cues, and knowing how such cues elicit craving responses is particularly relevant when current eating behavior trends within zzso societies are zzso One substance that holds a special place with regard to food preference is chocolate, and studies that used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso have identified neural regions and electrical signatures that are zzso by chocolate cue zzso This review will examine zzso and zzso findings from studies that used zzso food and chocolate cues as zzso with a focus on responses observed in samples of healthy participants, as opposed to those with zzso zzso The utility of using zzso and chocolate stimuli as a means of understanding the human reward system will also be zzso as these findings may be particularly important for understanding processes related to pathological zzso and addiction to illicit zzso Finally, research from our own lab that focused on chocolate stimulus processing in chocolate zzso and zzso will be discussed, as the approach used may help bridge zzso and zzso findings so that a more complete understanding of zzso stimulus processing in the zzso and spatial zzso may be zzso
