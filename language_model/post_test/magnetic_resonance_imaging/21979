This study used magnetic resonance imaging to zzso the extent and pattern of tissue volume deficit and zzso fluid volume enlargement in younger versus older chronic zzso relative to normal zzso In the present analysis, we divided our previously reported group of 62 alcoholic men into a younger group zzso zzso 33, age mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and range zzso 26 to 44 zzso and an older group zzso zzso 29, age mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and range zzso 45 to 63 zzso to examine whether, in addition to extent, the two age groups differed in pattern of tissue type and regional brain volume abnormalities zzso with magnetic resonance zzso Brain volumes were adjusted for normal variation in head size and age established from a group of healthy controls and were expressed as zzso The younger group had significant cortical gray, but not white, matter volume deficits and zzso and zzso enlargement relative to zzso zzso The older group had volume deficits in both cortical gray and white matter and zzso and zzso enlargement that significantly exceeded the younger alcoholic zzso An analysis of six cortical regions revealed that, although both age groups had gray matter volume deficits throughout the cortex, the older alcoholic group had a selectively more severe deficit in prefrontal gray matter relative to the younger alcoholic zzso Similarly, the cortical white matter volume deficit in the older zzso was especially severe in the prefrontal and frontal zzso The differences in brain zzso between the two alcoholic groups cannot easily be attributed to potential alcohol history differences typically related to age because the two groups had similar disease zzso and amounts of lifetime alcohol zzso These results provide in zzso evidence that the frontal zzso are especially vulnerable to chronic alcoholism in older zzso
