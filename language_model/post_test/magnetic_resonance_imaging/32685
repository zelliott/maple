False recognition, a type of memory distortion where one claims to remember something that never happened, can occur in response to items that are similar but not identical to previously seen items zzso related false zzso or in response to novel items zzso unrelated false zzso It is unknown whether these 2 types of memory errors arise from the same or distinct neural zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared the neural activity associated with true recognition, related false recognition, and unrelated false recognition for abstract zzso True recognition and related false recognition were associated with similar patterns of neural activity, including activity in the prefrontal cortex, the zzso cortex, and the zzso zzso zzso By contrast, unrelated false recognition was associated with activity in zzso zzso These results indicate that false recognition is not a zzso phenomenon, but rather can reflect the operation of 2 distinct cognitive and neural zzso
