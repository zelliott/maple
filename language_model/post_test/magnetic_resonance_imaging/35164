zzso zzso zzso structures have crucial functions in episodic zzso but also in semantic memory zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso activity within the zzso is increasingly used to predict zzso memory zzso Based on the hypothesis that zzso and zzso memory functions are both hosted by the zzso the present study wanted to explore the relationship between zzso related zzso in the zzso as assessed before and the capacity of zzso functions after zzso Patients with chronic unilateral left zzso and right zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso performed a standard word list learning test zzso and zzso and a zzso procedure before the operation using a semantic decision zzso zzso processing caused significant bilateral zzso zzso in both patient zzso While right zzso patients showed asymmetry of zzso zzso with more zzso in the left zzso left zzso patients had almost equal zzso in both zzso zzso zzso left zzso versus right zzso patients revealed greater activity within the right zzso whereas no significant difference was observed for the reverse zzso Greater effect size in the zzso region zzso to the seizure focus was significantly and positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso Greater effect size in the zzso zzso was correlated with better zzso verbal zzso especially in left zzso zzso These results suggest that functional imaging of zzso tasks may be useful to predict zzso verbal memory in zzso They also advocate a common zzso basis for zzso and zzso processes in the zzso
