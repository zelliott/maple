To improve diagnostic accuracy and achieve high levels of treatment success in patients with zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso the author of this study applied advanced technology zzso in distinguishing the various syndrome types according to the different zzso locations and evaluated new minimal access surgical techniques to treat each zzso 

Two hundred cases were zzso evaluated using a standardized set of zzso functional and symptom zzso a collection of new physical examination zzso MR zzso open MR zzso injections, zzso zzso minimal access surgery, and formal outcome assessment with the zzso zzso Index, pain zzso and analog pain zzso 

Four primary types of zzso syndromes were identified based on the different locations of zzso Type I, zzso at the exit of the greater zzso notch in concert with zzso muscle zzso Type II, zzso at the level of the zzso spine, zzso zzso and lesser zzso notch zzso Type III, zzso in association with zzso zzso muscle zzso at the entrance of the zzso zzso and Type IV, zzso zzso of terminal zzso The application of new, targeted minimal access surgical techniques led to sustained good to excellent outcomes zzso improvement in the pain score or functional zzso in zzso of zzso Most of these patients obtained most of their improvement within 4 weeks of surgery, although some continued to experience progressive improvements up to 12 months after zzso 

The application of advanced zzso to categorize zzso syndrome origins into 4 major zzso and the subsequent treatment of each zzso with a tailored strategy greatly improved therapeutic outcomes as compared with those reported when only a single treatment paradigm was applied to all zzso
