zzso is a zzso process that culminates in the spread of cells from a primary tumor to a distant site or zzso For tumor cells to be able to zzso they have to locally invade through basement membrane into the zzso and the blood zzso Eventually they zzso from the blood and colonize in the secondary zzso This process involves multiple interactions between the tumor cells and their zzso The zzso surrounding tumors has a significant impact on tumor development and zzso A key factor in the zzso is an zzso zzso The zzso pH of solid tumors is more zzso in comparison to normal tissue as a consequence of high zzso and poor zzso It plays an important role in almost all steps of zzso The past decades have seen development of technologies to zzso measure zzso and/or zzso zzso Most successful zzso are zzso and sensitivity and accuracy have dramatically zzso zzso imaging the distribution of acidity helps us understand the role of the tumor zzso in cancer zzso The present review discusses different MR methods in measuring tumor pH along with emphasizing the importance of zzso tumor low pH on different steps of zzso more specifically focusing on zzso transition zzso and anti cancer zzso
