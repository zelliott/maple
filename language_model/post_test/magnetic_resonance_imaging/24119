Previous studies have reported significant zzso indicating an emerging relationship, between severity of auditory hallucinations and reduced size of zzso lobe cortical regions implicated in language zzso The present study used high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso along with assessment of functional zzso via a zzso listening task zzso to extend these zzso 

Thirty patients with schizophrenia and a history of auditory hallucinations participated in the zzso All were completely zzso Eleven subjects were currently zzso at the time of the zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were obtained and regions of interest were manually traced using the zzso package zzso et al zzso Whole brain, bilateral zzso zzso and anterior superior zzso zzso volumes were zzso zzso completed a zzso zzso zzso 

Increased severity of hallucinatory experience was significantly associated with smaller left anterior superior zzso zzso zzso Current zzso demonstrated a reduction in right ear advantage on the zzso 

The results suggest that auditory hallucinations are zzso by a zzso dysfunction in zzso neural networks, of which the superior zzso zzso forms one zzso The findings are also consistent with theories proposing abnormal zzso in the zzso of auditory zzso
