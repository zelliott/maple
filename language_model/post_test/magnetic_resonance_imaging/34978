To evaluate the outcome of surgical zzso of large and massive zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to evaluate the relationship between the size of zzso tumors and the surgical zzso 

We zzso reviewed the charts of 34 consecutive patients affected by large or massive zzso tumors that underwent zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso The main outcome measures included visual zzso visual field testing, zzso zzso zzso function, and zzso zzso zzso zzso time ranged from 1 to 4 zzso 

zzso of the surgical intervention included 1 patient with visual loss zzso 2 patients with third nerve zzso zzso and 6 patients with de zzso zzso zzso In this setting, zzso was an expected outcome more than a true complication and occurred in 5 patients zzso 

Although this is a relatively small and retrospective series, these findings suggests that the surgical zzso of large and massive zzso tumors carries significant risks of surgical complications including visual loss, zzso zzso and third nerve zzso These complications may occur as consequence of excessive zzso reduced working room, blind dissection behind the increased bulk of the zzso or release of tight zzso between the tumor and the surrounding zzso zzso
