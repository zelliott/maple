zzso zzso has the potential to increase the success of treatment by decreasing uncertainties concerning zzso position and zzso We pursue integrated diagnostic quality zzso functionality with zzso systems to boost the possibilities of image guidance by providing images with superior zzso contrast during zzso However, the use of MR images in zzso can be hindered by geometrical zzso due to magnetic field zzso zzso A method for fast correction of these zzso is presented and zzso Using a 20 zzso square phantom containing a regular grid, a measure of residual deformation after correction is zzso At very low zzso strength (which leads to large zzso a maximum displacement of zzso zzso is shown to be reduced to zzso zzso Next, the method is applied in zzso to the case of pelvic body zzso extraction for prostate zzso treatment zzso Here, again with low zzso strengths, zzso of up to 6 zzso can be reduced to 2 zzso All results are provided within a lag time of 8 zzso We discuss implications of image zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso since the zzso zzso in these treatments are very zzso We argue that, although field zzso cannot be prevented from zzso distortion correction is not always necessary in zzso This work opens new possibilities for investigating zzso zzso plan adaptations and ultimately zzso treatment zzso
