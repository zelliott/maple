To independently evaluate zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR sequences for pulmonary embolism zzso zzso 

Prospective investigation, including zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR sequences on a zzso unit, in addition to zzso zzso zzso Two independent readers evaluated each sequence independently in random zzso zzso zzso zzso values and zzso agreement were calculated for each zzso excluding sequences judged zzso zzso was also calculated according to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso sequences showed the highest sensitivity zzso and zzso reader 1 and reader 2, respectively), specificity zzso and zzso and agreement zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso although less sensitive overall zzso and zzso were sensitive for the detection of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and showed high specificity zzso and zzso and good agreement zzso value zzso zzso sequences showed lower sensitivity zzso and zzso specificity zzso and zzso and agreement zzso value zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso at zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences demonstrate lower sensitivity, except for zzso zzso but high specificity and zzso The negative zzso value of zzso sequences was insufficient to safely rule out zzso 

zzso zzso zzso MR sequences are very specific and can identify zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso sequences show high sensitivity for zzso zzso zzso A normal MR zzso result does not exclude zzso zzso zzso agreement is better for zzso than zzso MR zzso
