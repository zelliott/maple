zzso to the peripheral nerves in the upper zzso results in changes in the zzso and at multiple sites throughout the central nervous system zzso We studied the long-term effects of an injury to the median nerve in the zzso with a focus on changes in the zzso Four patients with isolated injuries of the median nerve in their 20s were examined a mean of 14 years after the zzso zzso zzso was monitored during tactile stimulation of the fingers of the injured and healthy hand using functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 zzso The zzso state and clinical outcome were also zzso zzso in the primary zzso zzso was substantially larger during tactile stimulation of the injured hand than with stimulation of the zzso zzso We also saw a zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the injured median nerve resulted in a substantially increased dominance of the zzso zzso However, stimulation of the healthy zzso nerve resulted in a decreased dominance of the zzso zzso zzso showed low sensory zzso zzso and increased motor zzso in the injured zzso zzso there were abnormalities predominately in the sensory zzso However, there was an overall improved mean result compared with a five year follow-up in the same zzso The cortical changes could be the result of cortical zzso after a changed zzso signal pattern from the injured zzso Even though the clinical function improved over time it did not return to normal, and neither did the cortical zzso
