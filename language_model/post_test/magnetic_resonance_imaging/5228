This study aims to examine zzso changes of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso signal associated with acupuncture on zzso zzso 

Ten (10) healthy adults participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso During the zzso zzso the participants were instructed to lie zzso they did not perform any cognitive zzso 

Three zzso zzso scans were conducted for each zzso a first zzso scan zzso a zzso scan zzso and a second zzso scan zzso after zzso Individual zzso maps were calculated for each zzso 

During zzso consistent with previous studies, the default network regions showed significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso increased zzso zzso within the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso In contrast, during zzso zzso within zzso is still significantly higher than zzso while zzso and zzso showed decreased zzso 

These findings imply that stimulating zzso can change the zzso of the intrinsic cortical activity of the zzso In particular, a continuous and temporally consistent effect of acupuncture within zzso not the common brain circuit of pain including zzso and zzso was zzso Considering the cognitive functions and deficits of the relevant areas in mild cognitive impairment and zzso disease, acupuncture on zzso could potentially affect both psychiatric and neurological zzso Thus, stimulating zzso may be a candidate method for improving cognitive zzso
