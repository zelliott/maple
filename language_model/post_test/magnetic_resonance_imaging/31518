Major depression is characterized by a zzso zzso an enhanced responsiveness to, and memory for, zzso negative zzso However, it is not yet clear whether this bias represents 1) impaired zzso cognitive control over affective responses, potentially linked to deficits in zzso prefrontal zzso zzso or 2) enhanced bottom-up responses to zzso laden stimuli that zzso cognitive control mechanisms, potentially linked to deficits in zzso and anterior zzso zzso 

We used an zzso interference task using emotional zzso to test for zzso versus bottom-up dysfunction in the interaction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A total of 27 patients with major depression and 24 control participants was zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out as participants directly attended to, or attempted to zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with control subjects, patients with depression showed an enhanced zzso response to unattended zzso stimuli zzso to unattended zzso By contrast, control participants showed increased activity in right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso areas zzso when ignoring fear stimuli zzso to zzso which the patients with depression did not zzso In addition, the depressed participants failed to show evidence of zzso cognitive adjustments zzso activity in bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso on zzso zzso but the control group did show zzso 

These results suggest multiple sources of zzso in emotional and cognitive control zzso in depression, implicating both zzso and bottom-up zzso
