The authors hypothesized that supplementary motor zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso in chronic zzso users, studied 4 to 36 hours after their last episode of use, would disappear by Day 28 of zzso during zzso zzso Eleven zzso users and 16 comparison subjects were scanned during right zzso and left zzso zzso tasks on a GE zzso zzso scanner zzso with a whole body echo zzso zzso Image analyses were conducted in zzso using an zzso approach to define each zzso area zzso zzso in cerebral zzso were examined in the left and right primary motor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The authors found diminished zzso for zzso zzso from Day 0 to Day zzso For zzso the authors also zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso on Day 7, but not Day 0 or Day zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso on Day 0, but not Day 7 or Day zzso zzso diminished BA 4 zzso on Day 28, but not Day 0 or Day 7; and zzso diminished zzso zzso on Day 0 and Day 28, but not Day zzso For zzso the authors found zzso diminished zzso zzso on Days 0 and 7 but not on Day zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso on Days 0, 7, and zzso and zzso diminished zzso zzso on Days 0, 7, and zzso These results suggest that residual diminished brain zzso is still observed after zzso zzso use in motor cortical zzso
