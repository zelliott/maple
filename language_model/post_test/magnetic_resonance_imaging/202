The purpose was to evaluate the ability of three magnetic resonance zzso techniques to detect liver zzso and to determine which zzso technique zzso zzso or combination of techniques is optimal for the zzso of zzso fat using zzso as a zzso Twenty patients with zzso proven zzso and 24 control subjects underwent zzso zzso MR zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso in zzso of phase MR imaging zzso and zzso MR imaging zzso examinations of the zzso Blood or urine zzso were also performed for zzso zzso Both MRS and zzso data allowed to detect zzso with a high sensitivity zzso for zzso 1 for zzso and specificity (1 for zzso zzso for zzso but not zzso Strong correlations were found between fat fraction zzso measured by zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as with low density zzso zzso and cholesterol zzso A zzso analysis showed a good agreement between the zzso measured by MRS and zzso zzso correlation analyses failed to improve the correlation with zzso zzso when MRS or zzso data were combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso from MRS or zzso appear to be the best parameters to both detect zzso and accurately zzso fat liver zzso
