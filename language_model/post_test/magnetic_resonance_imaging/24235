We aimed to characterize regional geometry in relation to load in two groups of patients with zzso zzso zzso and right zzso pressure overload zzso in relation to a group of subjects with normal left zzso zzso zzso 

Both these diseases are associated with marked changes in zzso shape and function, which have not been studied with detailed three zzso zzso 

Three zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to characterize the zzso geometry and regional stresses of the left zzso in patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso wall zzso and zzso motion were calculated from surface and volume zzso 

Hearts with zzso exhibited more zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso than normal and zzso zzso The stress zzso were lowest in the zzso hearts, compared to normal and zzso hearts, due to the larger zzso There was a more significant difference between lateral wall motion and other regional wall motions in the zzso and zzso hearts as compared to normal zzso 

It is suggested that zzso and stress mapping by zzso zzso zzso can be used as an important clinical tool for characterizing and distinguishing between healthy and diseased zzso The results provided here validated previous knowledge on zzso and zzso known from zzso imaging zzso
