To compare the volume of the zzso and zzso zzso in elderly individuals with and without depressive disorders, and to determine whether the volumes of these regions correlate with scores on memory zzso 

Clinical and demographic differences, as well as differences in regional gray matter volumes, were assessed in 48 elderly patients with depressive disorders and 31 control zzso Brain zzso zzso scans were processed using statistical zzso mapping and zzso zzso zzso tests were administered to subjects in both zzso 

There were no zzso gray matter volume differences in the zzso or zzso zzso In the elderly depressed group only, the volume of the left zzso zzso correlated with scores on the delayed naming portion of the zzso learning zzso There were also significant direct correlations in depressed subjects between the volumes of the left zzso right and left zzso zzso and immediate recall scores on verbal episodic memory tests and visual learning zzso In the control group, there were direct correlations only between overall cognitive performance (as assessed with the zzso and the volume of right zzso and between the total score on the zzso learning test and the volume of the right and left zzso zzso 

These findings highlight different patterns of relationship between cognitive performance and volumes of zzso zzso structures in depressed individuals and healthy elderly zzso The direct correlation between delayed zzso memory recall scores with left zzso volumes specifically in elderly depressed individuals provides support to the view that depression in elderly populations may be a risk factor for zzso
