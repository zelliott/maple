zzso zzso zzso is associated with high long-term cardiovascular mortality and zzso zzso hypertension and left zzso dysfunction are possibly associated with residual or zzso zzso arch obstruction zzso and abnormal zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, knowledge regarding these patients' functional health status late after repair is zzso 

A total of 133 adults who underwent surgical repair of zzso in childhood and youth zzso zzso were examined in this zzso cohort zzso Median age zzso at surgery was 10 zzso years and 44 zzso years at zzso zzso age and zzso healthy subjects served as zzso 

zzso of previous cardiovascular zzso current cardiac and zzso function, exercise capacity, blood pressure levels, as well as the presence of residual or zzso zzso arch obstruction zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso (including tissue zzso bicycle exercise testing, zzso ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, zzso CT scan of the zzso zzso were zzso Analysis of zzso function and zzso hormones was performed by blood and urine tests at rest and after zzso physical zzso zzso health status was assessed by means of the zzso health zzso 

The prevalence of hypertension was high zzso of the cohort had blood pressure levels above the recommended levels, half of those despite zzso zzso were common zzso and most often performed due to zzso valve dysfunction and zzso Above half of the cohort had a zzso zzso zzso which was strongly associated with ascending zzso zzso and zzso valve zzso A total of zzso of the patients had a mild to moderate zzso which was only zzso associated with the presence of hypertension as well as to exercise capacity and zzso zzso of cardiac zzso Both zzso and zzso patients had increased left zzso mass, normal ejection zzso reduced zzso zzso function, and impaired zzso function compared with controls, with differences being more pronounced in zzso zzso zzso hormone levels were slightly increased among zzso whereas zzso and zzso function parameters were normal at rest and during zzso zzso to moderate zzso had no significant influence on the measured zzso zzso scores among patients were only slightly lower compared with those from zzso However, patients with reduced exercise performance and those taking daily cardiovascular medication scored significantly lower in several mental and physical categories compared with patients with zzso patient and with those with preserved exercise zzso 

zzso correction of zzso only repairs the anatomical zzso but not the associated zzso and zzso Increased left zzso mass, zzso and zzso dysfunction, zzso valve dysfunction, zzso and hypertension are zzso zzso is only zzso associated with mild and moderate degrees of zzso and not associated with changes in zzso hormone levels and zzso zzso Despite late zzso functional health status is overall only slightly impaired in patients after surgical correction of zzso compared with healthy zzso Nevertheless, the zzso with reduced exercise capacity and need for cardiovascular medications have a considerable impairment of both physical and mental aspects of functional zzso
