zzso responses to speech sounds that are zzso are suppressed compared to responses to the same speech sounds during passive zzso This phenomenon is referred to as zzso suppression, a potentially important zzso zzso control zzso In an earlier study, we found that both adults who do and do not zzso demonstrated a reduced zzso of the auditory zzso and zzso responses to speech during active production relative to passive zzso It is unknown if auditory responses to zzso zzso acts are suppressed in children or if the phenomenon differs between children who do and do not zzso As zzso is a zzso speech disorder, examining zzso suppression in children may identify possible neural differences underlying zzso close to its time of zzso We used zzso to determine the presence of zzso suppression in children and to characterize the properties of zzso suppression in children who zzso We examined the auditory zzso as this was the earliest robust response zzso across our child participants and the most likely to reflect a zzso zzso Both children who do and do not zzso demonstrated zzso suppression of the auditory zzso However, children who zzso had a delayed auditory zzso peak zzso to vowel sounds compared to children who do not zzso indicating a possible zzso in their ability to efficiently integrate auditory speech information for the purpose of establishing neural representations of speech zzso
