Opening the zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso makes it possible to expose the zzso zzso the ambient zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We examined the zzso anatomy and the surgical indications for use of the zzso zzso 

The zzso anatomy encountered in the zzso approach for zzso in and around the ambient zzso was studied in three zzso On the basis of these zzso studies, the zzso approach was used during surgery in three live patients with such zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso which indicates the entrance of the anterior zzso artery as it enters the zzso horn of the lateral zzso was thought to be a key zzso landmark of the zzso zzso A cortical incision for entry into the zzso horn should be made in the inferior zzso zzso to minimize the potential damage to the zzso zzso and to the speech zzso After the zzso is opened zzso to the zzso point between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso the zzso cerebral artery zzso in the ambient zzso can be observed with minimal zzso zzso of the zzso In this study, surgical procedures using the zzso approach were successfully performed on patients with zzso zzso zzso whose zzso ran close to the zzso point or higher, whose zzso zzso zzso zzso were fed mainly by the zzso and whose zzso hiatus zzso zzso into the zzso horn through the zzso with no resulting zzso visual or memory zzso 

The zzso approach is especially useful in surgery for zzso in and around the ambient zzso
