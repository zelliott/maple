the purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of zzso zzso measured by zzso stress cardiac magnetic resonance zzso using visual zzso zzso and a quantitative zzso zzso reserve index zzso in the absence of zzso coronary artery disease zzso in women with systemic lupus zzso zzso with zzso chest pain zzso 

zzso heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in zzso Previous studies demonstrated the presence of zzso defects using zzso stress zzso in patients with zzso and no zzso zzso consistent with zzso coronary dysfunction in patients without zzso 

Twenty female zzso patients with typical and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso Patients with established cardiovascular disease were zzso zzso was performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso stress zzso zzso in zzso patients and in 10 zzso reference control zzso zzso patients also underwent zzso coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso was scored visually and zzso zzso 

among 18 patients with complete data, no patient had zzso zzso however, 8 of 18 zzso displayed visual zzso defects on stress zzso compared with 0 in 10 control subjects zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso in patients versus controls was zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso linear zzso revealed that zzso was the only predictor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

we observed a zzso prevalence of abnormal stress zzso zzso by zzso in the absence of zzso zzso in zzso patients with zzso zzso Compared with controls, reduced zzso was observed in zzso patients, and zzso presence was a significant predictor of an abnormal zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso in zzso patients without zzso zzso is due to zzso zzso potentially caused by zzso coronary zzso Further research in a larger zzso population is zzso
