To reveal the role of cortical zzso in the zzso of West syndrome associated with zzso zzso we studied their numbers and topography, focusing on the differences between patients with infantile spasms and without infantile zzso We reviewed the clinical date on the seizure types, seizure evolution and zzso status of 13 zzso 8 patients with infantile spasms (the West syndrome zzso and 5 patients without infantile spasms (the zzso syndrome zzso The number, size and location of the cortical zzso were evaluated on 5 zzso zzso MR zzso The average number of cortical zzso of the West syndrome group was zzso per patient, being larger than that of the zzso syndrome group zzso The West syndrome group included two patients with only one zzso The average number of the cortical zzso in the zzso zzso of the West syndrome group was zzso which was larger than that of the zzso syndrome group zzso From these results, a large number of cortical zzso which suggest involvement of larger cerebral cortical regions, increase the possibility of the West syndrome in patients with zzso zzso On the other hand, some patients with only one or few cortical zzso developed West syndrome, which may suggest the presence of a region critical on the development of West zzso Our results also suggest that zzso in the zzso zzso might be more significant than those in other zzso However, the results of this study are diverse, to some extent, which may have resulted from variable zzso of the cortical zzso It is necessary to conduct further study, including a greater number of patients, to reveal zzso zzso in West zzso
