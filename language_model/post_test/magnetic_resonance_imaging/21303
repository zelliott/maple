zzso zzso zzso zzso with functional zzso zzso may help zzso mechanisms underlying the generation of zzso However, the introduction of zzso zzso in the MR environment has inherent risk and data quality implications that require consideration prior to clinical zzso Previous studies of zzso and depth zzso have confirmed low risk under specific circumstances at zzso and zzso However, no studies have assessed risk and image quality related to the feasibility of a full zzso zzso To this end, commercially available platinum zzso zzso zzso zzso grid or zzso zzso and 4 or zzso depth zzso were secured to the surface of a custom-made phantom mimicking the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso temperature increase of zzso and surrounding phantom material, and zzso fluctuations in zzso contacts were measured in a GE Discovery zzso zzso MR scanner during a variety of imaging zzso typical of an zzso zzso An zzso grid was also used to zzso the spatial extent of zzso zzso The spatial extent of zzso artifact in the presence of an zzso was also assessed for typical imaging parameters that maximize zzso sensitivity at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slice zzso zzso zzso zzso Under standard conditions, all zzso exhibited no measurable displacement and no clinically significant temperature increase zzso during scans employed in a typical zzso experiment, including 60 zzso of continuous zzso However, high zzso zzso such as fast zzso zzso produced significant heating in almost all scenarios zzso that in some cases exceeded zzso zzso zzso in the frequency range that could elicit zzso stimulation zzso zzso were well below the threshold of 100 zzso zzso signal intensity was significantly reduced within zzso of the zzso for the imaging parameters used in this zzso Thus, for the conditions tested, a full zzso protocol poses a low risk at zzso however, zzso sensitivity may be reduced immediately adjacent to the zzso In addition, high zzso sequences must be zzso
