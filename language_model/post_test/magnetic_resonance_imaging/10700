The author reviewed literature and reports on spine imaging, selected key articles in which novel imaging strategies were zzso and prepared a review of currently developing imaging strategies in zzso disc zzso 

To provide a review of imaging in zzso disc zzso that covers the current methodology briefly and describes developing techniques in zzso 

zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging provide excellent zzso images of the zzso However, zzso imaging of the spine does not reliably identify the source of pain in patients with zzso disc zzso Many functional imaging techniques are suited to the study of the zzso Some of these techniques will improve our understanding of zzso disc zzso and clinical zzso 

The author selected reports in the current literature for further review and attempted to describe zzso the material in the reports that are most relevant to spine zzso 

New and potentially useful imaging strategies for spine imaging include dynamic zzso zzso dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion imaging, and magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso advances in magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso imaging continue to offer more opportunities to investigate and diagnose back pain and zzso disc zzso
