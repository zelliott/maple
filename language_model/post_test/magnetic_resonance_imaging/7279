zzso zzso zzso are frequent in Parkinson's disease zzso and they may be present already at early zzso zzso zzso impairment is associated with Parkinson's disease zzso and zzso frontal and zzso cortical zzso Few studies have addressed cerebral structural zzso of different verbal zzso tasks in early stage zzso We therefore studied gray matter volumes of zzso zzso images using zzso zzso in relation to semantic, zzso and alternating verbal zzso in younger zzso age zzso zzso early stage zzso disease duration zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and healthy controls zzso zzso zzso We found a significant association between worse zzso zzso and smaller zzso namely right zzso gray matter volume in the zzso group only zzso error corrected p zzso zzso zzso semantic zzso was associated with smaller gray matter volumes in left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and at trend level with smaller bilateral zzso gray matter volume across groups zzso zzso zzso but not in the separate zzso or control zzso There were no significant relationships between alternating zzso and gray matter volumes in the whole sample or in the groups zzso The fact that zzso zzso but not semantic or alternating zzso was associated with zzso gray matter volume at early stage zzso suggests that different zzso tasks rely on different neural zzso and that language networks supporting semantic search and zzso switching are unrelated to brain gray matter volume at early disease stages in zzso
