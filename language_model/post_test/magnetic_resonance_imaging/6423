The brain processes light information to visually represent the environment but also to detect changes in ambient light zzso The latter information zzso zzso responses and exerts powerful effects on physiology such as synchronization of the zzso clock and suppression of zzso In zzso zzso information is zzso from a discrete subset of zzso retinal zzso cells via the zzso tract to various zzso and zzso regulatory structures including the zzso zzso zzso the master zzso zzso In humans, light also acutely zzso zzso but the cerebral zzso of this effect are zzso We assessed regional cerebral blood flow in 13 subjects attending to auditory and visual stimuli in near darkness following light zzso zzso zzso of different zzso zzso 17, zzso and 0 zzso during the biological zzso The bright broadband zzso light suppressed zzso and enhanced zzso zzso imaging revealed that a large-scale zzso attention network, including the right zzso zzso was more active in proportion to the duration of light zzso preceding the zzso zzso in the zzso decreased in proportion to previous zzso These findings have important implications for understanding the effects of light on human zzso
