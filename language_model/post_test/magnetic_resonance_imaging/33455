A prospective study was performed on 14 patients with zzso proven focal zzso zzso zzso using a zzso scan with zzso acid zzso and a zzso scan with zzso sulfur zzso zzso zzso was relatively normal in the region of the zzso but during the clearance phase zzso of the tumors were detected by a hot spot of zzso Depending on the relative contrast achieved between the tumor and normal liver, this hot spot appeared early or later, but was always present at 60 zzso In three tumors, a zzso pattern was observed within the hot spot due to a central zzso zzso was observed during the zzso phase in zzso of the zzso sites and normal zzso zzso in only zzso The zzso of zzso appears greater with zzso zzso than with CT or zzso zzso The high prevalence of hot spots may be due to careful technological conditions when obtaining zzso zzso Late images, overexposed films, multiple views and stimulation of gallbladder zzso increased tumor zzso The hot spot sign may be a useful tool when combined with the results of other imaging zzso in the diagnosis of zzso The peculiar pathology of zzso with fibrosis, zzso zzso and zzso proliferation might explain this zzso zzso
