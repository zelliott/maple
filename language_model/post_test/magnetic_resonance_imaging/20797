Given that multiple sclerosis zzso hits zzso the brain zzso we hypothesized that this should result in a distributed pattern of functional connectivity zzso zzso To this aim, we zzso using zzso zzso zzso intrinsic zzso and functional network connectivity zzso of brain large-scale zzso networks from 85 patients with zzso zzso zzso and 40 matched zzso 

Independent component analysis was used to analyze zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of each cluster of each zzso network zzso was compared between controls and patients zzso of zzso adjusted for age, zzso and gray matter zzso The zzso zzso was used to assess interactions among zzso 

Compared to controls, patients with zzso experienced a decreased zzso zzso in regions of the zzso zzso executive control zzso working memory zzso default mode zzso zzso and visual zzso They also had an increased zzso zzso in regions of the zzso and auditory zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly correlated with disability and zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso when compared to controls, zzso analysis showed that the zzso had an increased connectivity with the zzso and a decreased connectivity with the zzso An abnormal connectivity between the zzso and sensory networks was also zzso 

zzso abnormalities within and between large-scale zzso networks occur in patients with zzso and are related to the extent of zzso zzso and the severity of zzso zzso studies should ascertain whether such functional abnormalities zzso a systematic vulnerability to disease progression or, conversely, protect against the onset of clinical zzso
