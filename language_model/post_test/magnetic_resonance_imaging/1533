The purpose of this study was to determine the location of the zzso bright spot in patients with zzso zzso before zzso 

A total of 54 patients with zzso zzso were zzso included in this zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were reviewed to identify the location of the zzso zzso zzso lobe that indicates zzso hormone zzso zzso Images were acquired with a zzso machine by using zzso zzso sections in two or three zzso planes and a 300 zzso 512 zzso 

The bright spot corresponding to zzso storage was identified in 44 zzso zzso Two groups of patients were defined by the height of the zzso Group A patients zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso less than 20 zzso in zzso and group B zzso zzso zzso had zzso 20 zzso or zzso In group A, the bright spot was identified in 25 patients zzso it was located in the zzso in 24 of these cases zzso In group B, the bright spot was identified in 19 patients zzso it was in an zzso location in 14 of these cases zzso 

MR imaging can be used to depict the zzso bright spot in most patients with zzso zzso before zzso The bright spot is usually identified at its expected location within the zzso in patients with zzso zzso less than 20 zzso in zzso whereas an zzso location is common when zzso zzso are larger more than 20 zzso
