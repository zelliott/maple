zzso age effects in normal control volunteers were investigated using magnetic resonance imaging in the following eight zzso zzso lateral zzso thalamus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nucleus zzso Two hundred and zzso control subjects, ranging in age from 19 to 85 years, were scanned on a zzso T GE system zzso or a zzso T zzso system zzso Volumes of zzso structures, adjusted for zzso size, were estimated using zzso FIRST software, which is fully zzso zzso age effects were found for all volumes when the entire age range was zzso however, the older subjects zzso years of zzso showed a stronger correlation between age and structural volume for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso than middle-aged zzso years of zzso zzso zzso subjects were studied at both sites, and age effects in these groups were comparable, despite differences in magnet strength and acquisition zzso This agreement lends support to the zzso of the zzso tools and procedures used in the present zzso
