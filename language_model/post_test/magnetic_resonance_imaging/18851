zzso delivers only indirect information about the three-dimensional shape of the zzso zzso validation with zzso methods is necessary, in particular in severe zzso above 50 zzso zzso zzso with conventional zzso zzso yielded satisfactory results for zzso up to 50 zzso zzso but only in frontal view, zzso in two zzso A true three-dimensional validation is possible only with MR zzso however this is difficult due to severe technical zzso In the present study 26 patients with Cobb angles between 26 zzso and 116 zzso were examined both with MR zzso and zzso Comparing the shape of the spinal zzso as measured by the two methods we found that a) the gross zzso shape of the spinal zzso is well reproduced by the zzso model, b) the lateral zzso error is about twice as large as with conventional zzso and c) that the zzso errors increase with increasing Cobb zzso This means that the zzso model reconstruction must be modified for severe zzso
