zzso batteries for zzso do not precisely meet the criteria for comprehensive mapping of cognitive functions within minimum data acquisition times using standard scanners and head zzso The goal was to develop a battery of zzso zzso for zzso that can also be used in other brain imaging techniques and zzso zzso Participants were 61 healthy, young adult volunteers zzso females and 13 zzso mean age: zzso zzso zzso zzso from the university zzso The battery included 8 zzso for basic zzso zzso zzso emotional zzso and complex zzso working memory, zzso control, zzso cognitive zzso Imaging was performed using standard functional imaging capabilities zzso MR zzso standard head zzso zzso and functional data series were zzso using Brain Voyager zzso and zzso zzso zzso For basic zzso zzso zzso for individuals were within a distance of zzso zzso of the group zzso of the target regions and for complex cognitive zzso between 7 zzso and 15 zzso Based on zzso and zzso zzso the distance between the zzso zzso was zzso zzso There was spatial zzso between individual zzso however, as shown by the distances between the zzso found with zzso and zzso zzso the coordinates for individual cases can be used to represent those of the zzso The findings show that the zzso brain mapping battery described here can be used in basic science studies that investigate the relationship of the brain to the mind and also as functional zzso in clinical studies for diagnosis, follow-up and zzso zzso
