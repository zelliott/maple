The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional and zzso results of zzso rotator cuff repair, and to analyze the factors affecting the integrity of zzso repaired rotator cuff tears of the zzso 

One hundred zzso consecutive shoulders that underwent zzso rotator cuff repair, had a zzso zzso evaluation and were followed for at least two years were enrolled in this zzso The mean age was zzso years zzso 38 to 74 zzso and the mean follow-up period was 39 months zzso 24 to 83 zzso 

The rotator cuff was completely healed in 131 zzso out of 169 shoulders and zzso tears occurred in 38 shoulders zzso At the last follow-up visit, the mean score for pain during motion was zzso zzso 0 to 4) in the completely healed group and zzso zzso 0 to 4) in the group with zzso tears zzso zzso zzso The average zzso strength was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and the mean University of California at Los Angeles score was zzso zzso 26 to zzso and zzso zzso 23 to zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The complete healing rate was zzso in the group less than 50 years of age zzso zzso zzso in the group over 51 years but less than 60 years of age zzso zzso and zzso in the group over 61 years of age zzso shoulders, p zzso zzso it was zzso in the group with zzso tears (30 zzso zzso in the group with zzso tears (71 zzso and zzso in the group with zzso or massive tears zzso shoulders, p zzso zzso All of the rotator cuffs with a global fatty zzso index of greater than two preoperatively had zzso zzso 

zzso repair of zzso rotator cuff tears led to a relatively high rate of zzso zzso However, the minimum two-year follow up demonstrated excellent pain relief and improvement in the ability to perform the activities of daily living, despite the structural zzso The factors affecting zzso healing were the patient's age, the size and extent of the zzso and the presence of fatty zzso in the rotator cuff zzso
