zzso zzso alternating current stimulation zzso at 5 zzso applied for 10 zzso at 1 zzso intensity over the hand area of the primary motor zzso zzso results in sustained changes in cortical zzso as previously zzso 

Here we have assessed safety aspects of this stimulation method by measuring zzso zzso zzso levels, examining electroencephalogram zzso traces and analyzing anatomical data by using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso 18 healthy volunteers participated in the zzso zzso was applied at 5 zzso for a duration of 10 zzso over the left zzso at an intensity of 1 zzso 

After stimulation no significant changes were detected in zzso levels, no structural zzso were observed in the anatomical scans and no pathological changes were found in the zzso zzso 

Our data imply that the application of zzso is safe at least within these parameters and with these applied zzso
