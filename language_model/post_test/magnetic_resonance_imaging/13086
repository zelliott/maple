In zzso imaging sequences like fast spin echo zzso the point spread function zzso in the phase zzso direction contains significant secondary zzso zzso This is due to zzso in adjacent zzso data obtained at different echo times caused by zzso zzso and leads to zzso and hence reduced image zzso Recently, zzso multiple coils for signal reception has become the standard zzso for MR systems due to the additional flexibility that parallel imaging zzso methods can zzso zzso methods generally obtain more data than is required to reconstruct an zzso Here, this zzso in information is exploited to reduce zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso phase zzso zzso lines are acquired at different echo times alternately in the regions of zzso (called zzso This moves the resulting ghost zzso to the edges of the field of zzso This property of the ghost then makes them amenable to removal using zzso zzso With zzso array zzso data it is possible to reconstruct data over the region of the zzso from both echo zzso By combining this data, a significant reduction in zzso can be zzso We show this approach to be effective through simulated and acquired zzso zzso
