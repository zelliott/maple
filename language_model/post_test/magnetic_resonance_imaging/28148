zzso white matter zzso zzso seen on magnetic resonance imaging scans are associated with cardiovascular disease and vascular risk zzso To assess the association between zzso and zzso we studied 111 people, aged 65 to 85 years, randomly zzso and zzso by age and sex, from participants in the Rotterdam zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance images in the zzso plane were obtained for all zzso zzso zzso was zzso assessed by the presence of zzso measurement of zzso to media wall thickness zzso and the presence of zzso zzso A possible or zzso zzso zzso on an zzso was used as an indicator of coronary zzso The ankle to arm zzso blood pressure ratio zzso was determined, and peripheral zzso disease was defined as an zzso lower than zzso in at least one zzso zzso zzso was significantly more pronounced in people with zzso The difference in common carotid zzso was zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso whereas the odds ratio of zzso associated with plaques in the carotid zzso was zzso The degree of internal carotid artery zzso was not, however, associated with zzso The mean zzso was significantly lower in people with zzso than in those without zzso with a difference of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The odds ratio of zzso associated with peripheral zzso disease and a possible or zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso indicated by increased common carotid zzso carotid zzso and a lower zzso is related to zzso
