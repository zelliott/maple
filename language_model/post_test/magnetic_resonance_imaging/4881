To explore the vascular risk factors and zzso profiles of patients with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso depression zzso 

Thirty-five SID patients, 37 patients with zzso zzso vascular disease without depression zzso and 40 normal controls zzso participated in this zzso zzso The SID and zzso groups were recruited from the Department of zzso First zzso Hospital, zzso Medical University between October 2010 and September zzso And the NC group came from Medical Center, First zzso Hospital of zzso Medical University over the same zzso The vascular risk factors of all participants were assessed by the zzso zzso Depression symptoms were assessed by the geriatric depression scale zzso and Hamilton depression scale zzso while cognitive functions by the zzso state examination zzso and Montreal cognitive clock drawing task zzso 

Both the SID zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso groups showed significantly higher zzso scores than the NC group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Compared with the NC group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso scores were significantly lower in the SID zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso There were significantly lower zzso scores in the SID zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso groups versus the NC group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and similarly in the SID group versus the zzso group zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso of zzso the orientation, language and memory scores in both SID zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groups were significantly lower than those in the NC group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso scores in the SID group zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower than those in the NC group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso And the thinking and perception scores in the SID group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower than those in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and NC zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the SID group, no significant correlation was found between the zzso scores and zzso zzso There were a negative correlation between the zzso zzso scores and zzso zzso zzso and zzso scores zzso zzso zzso 

The SID patients demonstrate multiple zzso deficits, especially in thinking, perception and zzso No significant correlation between vascular risk factors and depression symptoms is found in SID zzso
