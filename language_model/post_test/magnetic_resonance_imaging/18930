The segregation of visual scenes based on zzso information is a fundamental process of early zzso zzso can be defined by simple cues, such as zzso as well as by more complex cues, such as zzso zzso recording studies in monkeys suggest that the neural processing of complex contours starts as early as primary visual zzso Additionally, zzso studies in monkeys indicate an important contribution of higher order areas to these zzso Using functional zzso we have investigated the level at which neural zzso of texture segregation can be found in the human visual zzso zzso evoked by line zzso with and without zzso zzso was compared in five healthy zzso Areas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were activated by both kinds of line textures as compared with blank zzso Textures with boundaries forming a zzso pattern, relative to uniform zzso evoked significantly more activity in areas zzso zzso less reliably in zzso but not in zzso or zzso These results provide evidence that higher order areas with large receptive fields play an important role in the segregation of visual scenes based on zzso zzso
