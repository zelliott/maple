zzso assessment of spinal inflammation in patients with zzso zzso zzso relies primarily on magnetic resonance imaging zzso although little is known about the distribution of inflammatory zzso within the structures of the zzso Our objective was to compare the distribution of inflammatory zzso centrally and zzso within the zzso and zzso spine zzso zzso 

We studied 49 patients with AS who were scanned with STIR and zzso zzso zzso of the whole zzso zzso were read by 2 musculoskeletal zzso with a third reader as the zzso zzso included 6 zzso zzso We recorded bone zzso zzso on STIR images from each zzso body, separately identifying central and lateral zzso The latter were defined as images that included or were lateral to the zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso 

zzso was present in 263 zzso of 588 zzso and 86 zzso of 245 zzso zzso the mean number of affected zzso and zzso zzso per patient were zzso and zzso zzso zzso was present in the lateral aspect of 219 zzso of 588 zzso zzso and 45 zzso of 245 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were more common zzso than centrally for all zzso zzso except for zzso zzso of only the lateral slices was observed in as many as zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso of spinal inflammation by zzso may omit zzso in up to zzso of inflamed zzso zzso if both scanning and image assessment do not include zzso slices that extend to the lateral edges of all zzso
