We employed a zzso zzso design in combination with functional imaging to examine the influence of metric changes in zzso zzso on zzso zzso rates and cortical zzso zzso viewed a zzso stimulus defined by zzso depth zzso zzso resulted from zzso between zzso disparity and zzso perspective cues that specify different zzso zzso zzso zzso results revealed that zzso zzso rates were positively correlated with the degree of perceived zzso zzso imaging revealed systematic increases in activity that paralleled the zzso results within anterior zzso zzso prior to the onset of zzso zzso We suggest that this cortical activity predicts the frequency of subsequent zzso zzso a putative zzso role for these areas in initiating zzso zzso In contrast, areas implicated in form and depth processing zzso and zzso were sensitive to the degree of zzso but failed to show increases in activity when these cues were in zzso
