zzso screws composed of zzso zzso zzso were used for graft fixation and studied zzso with serial magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans at 8, 16, and 24 months after zzso zzso zzso anterior cruciate ligament zzso reconstruction in 10 zzso Conventional spin zzso zzso density, and zzso double echo sequences were zzso as well as zzso zzso fast spin echo zzso All but one of the screws (19 of zzso were evident in all serial zzso These showed minimal decrease in size over zzso The one screw that had completely disappeared 8 months after reconstruction had cracked during zzso None of the reconstructed zzso zzso showed clinical instability, persistent zzso or zzso adverse reactions to the zzso Two patients developed abnormal signal in the zzso zzso one developed fluid anterior to the zzso and the other developed increased signal within the zzso The abnormal signal resolved with time in both zzso Other than the preceding changes, no abnormalities were detected on conventional zzso zzso fast spin echo sequences showed a variable amount of increased signal around the tunnels, suggesting zzso or zzso zzso zzso The changes noted near the tunnels on the zzso scans most probably represent a general reaction to surgical insult rather than a reaction to the zzso screws, as similar changes were noted at the zzso harvest zzso
