Several zzso tracts can be accurately located using conventional zzso zzso Images zzso of the human brain, including the zzso tract zzso which appears as a T zzso zzso zzso zzso patch in the zzso part of the zzso of the internal capsule zzso Here we use zzso zzso zzso to assess the quantitative zzso properties of the zzso at the zzso level in 22 healthy young male zzso We used three different imaging zzso the T zzso and T zzso relaxation times zzso zzso and T zzso and the zzso Transfer zzso zzso These zzso obtained in the zzso were compared with those in the anterior two-thirds of the zzso We observed longer T zzso and T zzso and lower zzso in the zzso region compared with the adjacent zzso zzso zzso This effect is consistent with the presence of sparsely distributed, zzso zzso described in previous zzso studies and, as such, might reflect lower zzso density and/or different zzso of zzso in the zzso
