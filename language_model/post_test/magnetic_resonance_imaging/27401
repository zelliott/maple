zzso deaf individuals receive little or no auditory zzso and when raised by deaf parents, they acquire sign as their native and primary zzso We asked two questions regarding how the deaf brain in humans adapts to sensory zzso zzso is meaning extracted and integrated from signs using the same classical left zzso zzso network used for speech in hearing individuals, and zzso in deafness, is superior zzso zzso encompassing primary and secondary auditory regions reorganized to receive and process visual sensory information at short zzso Using zzso constrained by individual cortical anatomy obtained with zzso we examined an early time window associated with sensory processing and a late time window associated with zzso zzso We found that sign in deaf individuals and speech in hearing individuals activate a highly similar left zzso network (including superior zzso regions surrounding auditory zzso during zzso processing, but only speech in hearing individuals activates auditory regions during sensory zzso Thus, neural systems dedicated to processing high-level linguistic information are used for processing language regardless of zzso or hearing status, and we do not find evidence for zzso of zzso connections from visual systems to auditory zzso
