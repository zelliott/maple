The zzso is a new zzso design to generate motion zzso test lines in three dimensions on an zzso plane through a fixed zzso The theory has been published zzso The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the application of the zzso on a group of rat brains to estimate brain volume and external surface zzso Each brain was first split into its two zzso and then embedded into a ball filled with zzso following a zzso named the zzso zzso with the idea of reducing the error zzso After rolling the ball at random it was scanned by magnetic resonance imaging into a stack of parallel systematic zzso this is the zzso zzso design which, combined with the zzso zzso idea, proves to be very zzso The zzso used only an equatorial section of the ball, and in the present case the zzso of error of the volume and surface area zzso of an individual brain was about zzso As it is design zzso the zzso may prove its strength mainly to estimate population zzso
