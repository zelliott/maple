zzso resonance zzso imaging, when used in conjunction with zzso and zzso can be a powerful tool for breast zzso There are various clinical scenarios in which MR imaging may provide key information that leads to an zzso in treatment plans zzso by demonstrating features that were zzso at physical examination or conventional zzso Although many benign and zzso entities enhance at contrast zzso breast MR imaging, the zzso characteristics and kinetic profiles of zzso help narrow the differential zzso To zzso the quality of the zzso and kinetic information yielded by breast MR imaging, the zzso must attend to various practical and technical zzso A bilateral breast zzso should be used with prone positioning of the zzso An MR imaging system with a zzso magnet is needed, and the magnetic field must be homogeneous across the field of view, which should include both zzso A zzso sequence should be applied first to identify any zzso and should be followed by three-dimensional imaging with a zzso zzso zzso sequence after the intravenous administration of a zzso zzso To minimize artifacts, a direction other than the zzso direction should be selected for phase zzso To suppress the signal from fat, a zzso pulse should be applied during imaging, or the zzso MR imaging data should be zzso from the zzso MR imaging data during zzso The imaging section thickness should be 3 zzso or less, the zzso size should be less than 1 zzso in each zzso direction, and the total acquisition time should be less than 2 zzso
