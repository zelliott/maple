In the state of North zzso zzso Germany, a survey was conducted on zzso examinations ordered by general practitioners zzso Part II of this study aims to determine the quality of the process and zzso The reference standard is the assessment of both zzso and physicians without board certification in zzso working at a university hospital and in zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso were asked to zzso Participating zzso filled out a questionnaire for each zzso The patients recorded the symptoms prompting the imaging zzso The zzso or other physicians performing the examinations were asked to provide the images and written reports and to complete a zzso A file was created for each of the zzso patients with image documentation of at least one zzso Each file, which included medical history, physical findings, imaging documentation and written report, was zzso forwarded to a zzso zzso and to a physician without board certification in zzso working in a university hospital and in an zzso zzso All physicians were requested to complete a structured questionnaire for each zzso 

The referral diagnoses were rated as medically plausible in zzso the indications for imaging found correct in zzso the examination techniques considered appropriate in zzso the clinical question answered in zzso the interpretation judged medically correct in 50% and all incidental findings documented in zzso In retrospect, 32 % of the examinations were judged zzso The sequence of multiple examinations performed on a particular patient was rated as appropriate in zzso The interpretation revealed zzso zzso The zzso of the referral diagnoses had a significant impact on the appropriateness of subsequent diagnostic zzso zzso deficits showed zzso performance by zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso coding zzso of cardiovascular zzso 

In the zzso scenario, the process quality proved to have moderate deficiencies and the outcome quality severe zzso In consequence, zzso and zzso should be more zzso by sharing information and exchanging zzso zzso zzso should be zzso zzso and examinations performed by physicians without board certification in zzso should undergo stricter quality zzso A more intensive interdisciplinary collaboration is needed to determine the optimum zzso of diagnostic imaging of zzso and cardiovascular zzso
