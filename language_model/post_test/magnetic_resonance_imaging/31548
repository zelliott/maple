zzso spin labeling zzso zzso zzso data differ in important respects from the more familiar blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso data and require specific processing zzso In this paper, we examined several factors that may influence zzso data analysis, including data storage bit resolution, motion zzso zzso for cerebral blood flow zzso calculations and nuisance zzso zzso Continuous zzso data were collected at 3 T from 10 subjects while they performed a simple zzso task with an zzso length of 48 zzso These data were then analyzed using systematic variations of the factors listed above to identify the approach that yielded optimal signal detection for task zzso zzso in statistical power were found for use of at least 10 bits for data storage at 3 zzso No significant difference was found in motor zzso regarding using simple zzso or zzso zzso but the former presented minor but significantly zzso larger peak zzso value in visual zzso While zzso head motion patterns were observed in synthetic data and zzso zzso data when zzso images were zzso to a common target, independent realignment of label and control images did not yield significant improvements in zzso in the zzso zzso It was also found that zzso calculations should be performed prior to spatial zzso and that modeling of global fluctuations yielded significantly increased peak zzso value in motor zzso The zzso of all zzso data processing approaches is easily accomplished within an zzso zzso zzso and is advocated for most zzso zzso data zzso
