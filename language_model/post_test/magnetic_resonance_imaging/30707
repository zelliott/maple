The prevalence of clinically silent zzso tumors in specific populations is poorly zzso It is known that, in advanced age groups, the number of clinically manifest zzso constitute a small proportion of the actual number of zzso The goals of the current study were to determine the frequency of zzso patients with zzso in advanced age and to identify risk factors for zzso in this zzso 

Between May 2000 and November 2002, zzso zzso from a specifically defined geographic area of Vienna who were age 75 years underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and were evaluated for the presence of a zzso zzso All zzso were examined clinically and zzso as well as by a zzso The patients' medical histories were carefully documented with regard to previous diseases, medication, and lifestyle, as were their laboratory zzso The collected data were correlated and similarities among subjects with zzso were zzso 

Nine zzso that were unknown until the time of investigation were observed among the zzso women included in the trial zzso to a calculated prevalence of zzso clinically silent zzso in 75-year-old zzso No tumors were found among zzso Associated clinical changes or deficits were not observed in any zzso Apart from advanced age and female zzso no other accepted or well known risk factors were observed in the tumor zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in the elderly female population were more common than was believed to be the case to zzso Known and zzso risk factors were found to be less important than age and zzso The high frequency of this zzso should be considered when deciding on the treatment of patients with zzso discovered, clinically zzso zzso
