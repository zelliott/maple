We used magnetic resonance imaging in a prospective zzso study to evaluate the components of zzso involvement in zzso to determine whether the entire zzso disk is an zzso and to gauge how useful this imaging technique is in detecting zzso of the zzso Thirty-one patients with zzso and 14 controls with mechanical spinal disease were zzso Images of the zzso and zzso spine were obtained using plain zzso zzso bone zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso sequences before and after zzso injection and fat zzso and zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging signal abnormalities reflected inflammation and zzso of the zzso bone underlying the affected zzso zzso signal enhancing after zzso and fat zzso on zzso images, high signal on zzso zzso These abnormalities were often visible early in the disease process, at a time when there were not yet any clinical manifestations or zzso or bone scan zzso In addition to showing involvement of the classic spinal zzso magnetic resonance imaging also demonstrated evidence of inflammation and zzso of the central part of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirming that the center of the disk is an zzso and that inflammatory zzso is the mechanism underlying at least some cases of zzso seen in patients with zzso
