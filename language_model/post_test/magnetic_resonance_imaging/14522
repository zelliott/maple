zzso zzso zzso provides a critical road map for zzso surgery but it has become increasingly difficult to interpret as technology has allowed the number of zzso channels to zzso zzso methods from zzso we aimed to simplify data analysis and increase consistency between zzso by using zzso surface projections of zzso zzso zzso zzso We analyzed 139 zzso from 48 intractable zzso patients zzso zzso and 20 zzso who had zzso recordings, zzso surgery, and at least one year of zzso zzso We zzso and plotted zzso zzso frequency band signal power over time onto zzso surface renderings for each patient, to create color zzso zzso Two independent zzso interpreted the zzso data using visual analysis zzso zzso blinded to any clinical zzso zzso agreement rates between zzso and zzso visual analysis or surgery were about zzso for side of seizure zzso zzso for zzso and just under zzso for zzso zzso These agreement rates were improved when flexible thresholds or frequency ranges were allowed for zzso especially for zzso zzso Interestingly, agreement was better for patients with good surgical outcome than for patients with poor zzso zzso using zzso was measurably faster and considered zzso easier to interpret than visual zzso These findings suggest that zzso could be an improved diagnostic method for zzso seizure zzso in patients with intractable zzso and may also be useful for mapping normal brain zzso
