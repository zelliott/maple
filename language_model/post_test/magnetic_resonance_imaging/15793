In patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease the zzso mechanism causing zzso injury is considered to be zzso however compromise of cerebral zzso is considered to be a significant zzso zzso of the zzso source is accepted as the major benefit from carotid zzso zzso however improvement in cerebral zzso may be another beneficial outcome as suggested by zzso zzso zzso Blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be used to map the cerebrovascular reserve zzso The aim of this study was to assess the effects of carotid surgery on cerebral zzso in patients with carotid artery disease using a zzso zzso zzso and assessment of zzso zzso 

zzso patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery zzso were scanned using a clinical zzso MR zzso zzso was done immediately prior to and between 4 and 8 weeks after zzso zzso carbon dioxide was administered to achieve transient episodes of zzso The data was analyzed using zzso Software Library zzso software to derive percentage signal change zzso for the zzso matter of the middle cerebral artery zzso territory for both zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso to the zzso zzso to derive an zzso zzso Index zzso for all patients zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso improved significantly following zzso zzso preoperatively zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no change in zzso in the zzso zzso and white matter zzso territories zzso zzso Also, the zzso was significantly more shifted to the zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with an impaired zzso preoperatively were found to show the greatest improvement in zzso and zzso following zzso zzso 

zzso resulted in improved zzso in patients with carotid artery disease as shown by the absolute and zzso asymmetry of zzso response to zzso These findings show that benefits from zzso may go beyond removal of the zzso source, by improving the cerebrovascular zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso may be a useful clinical tool in predicting this therapeutic potential in patients with severe carotid artery zzso
