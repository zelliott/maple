Clinical review of pediatric patients with zzso zzso and zzso analysis using zzso zzso spine zzso 

To evaluate the usefulness of the signal changes observed on MR images of the zzso for the early diagnosis of zzso and to investigate the zzso of the signal changes based on the stresses in zzso as predicted using zzso zzso Furthermore, to evaluate the usefulness of the signal change to predict the zzso healing following conservative zzso 

Since zzso zzso can achieve zzso healing zzso it is important to diagnose this disorder as early as zzso zzso there is no zzso zzso and reliable diagnostic tool for the early zzso 

zzso pediatric patients with zzso were zzso zzso defects were examined and their stages as revealed on CT scans were zzso High signal changes zzso of the zzso on zzso zzso zzso were compared with the zzso stages of the zzso Among them, 16 patients, including 15 boys and 1 girl, were treated conservatively for at least a zzso zzso zzso healing of the fracture site was evaluated on CT, and the results were compared between two groups with or without zzso at the initial zzso Using a three-dimensional zzso zzso model of the zzso segment, stress zzso in the zzso and zzso regions were analyzed in response to 400 N zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Based on zzso 68 zzso defects were classified as zzso 8 very early, 24 zzso 16 progressive, and 20 terminal zzso All defects in very early and zzso stages zzso showed zzso on zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Among 16 progressive zzso eight zzso showed zzso while no defects of the terminal stage zzso were found to have zzso In total, 29 zzso defects were treated conservatively out of 16 zzso In 19 of the zzso positive zzso 15 zzso showed zzso healing after the conservative treatment, whereas none of the 10 zzso negative defects zzso showed any zzso The results were statistically significant at P zzso zzso zzso Stress results from the zzso model indicated that zzso zzso showed the highest value in all loading zzso and the zzso showed the second zzso 

The correlation between the high stresses in the zzso and the corresponding zzso suggest that signal changes in zzso could be used as an indicator for early diagnosis of zzso The zzso of the zzso provided useful information to diagnose early stage zzso Furthermore, the zzso may be a good indicator as to whether a zzso union will result from conservative zzso
