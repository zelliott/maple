zzso hearing loss zzso is complicated by additional disabilities in about zzso of cases, but the epidemiology of associated disorders, in terms of type, frequency and zzso is still not clearly zzso Additional disabilities in a deaf child have important consequences in assessing and choosing a therapeutic treatment, in particular when considering cochlear zzso zzso or hearing aids zzso The aim of this paper was to evaluate frequency, type and severity of additional zzso disabilities in children with profound bilateral zzso hearing loss and to investigate the relationship between disability and the zzso of zzso 

Eighty children with profound bilateral zzso hearing loss zzso age zzso zzso were investigated by means of a diagnostic protocol including clinical, zzso and zzso procedures together with genetic and zzso tests and zzso investigation by brain zzso 

Fifty-five percent of the sample exhibited one or more disabilities in addition to deafness, with zzso zzso and motor disorders being the most zzso The risk of additional disabilities varied according to zzso with a higher zzso in zzso zzso deafness, in cases due to zzso pathology (in comparison to unknown and zzso non zzso zzso and in the presence of major brain abnormalities at zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso of deafness may be a significant risk indicator for the presence of zzso zzso A zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso investigation is needed for zzso prognosis and for planning therapeutic intervention, especially in those children zzso to cochlear zzso
