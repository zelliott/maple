A high-resolution zzso imaging method is presented (called zzso which exploits the spin zzso capability of an zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence to measure apparent zzso zzso relaxation zzso and generate contrast based on microscopic tissue zzso zzso zzso images of the human zzso lobe were acquired at four different echo times from six subjects at zzso and eight subjects at zzso to investigate the effect of magnetic field strength zzso and the zzso zzso time zzso on zzso zzso contrast was identified and zzso was zzso for long zzso zzso zzso and short zzso (7 zzso at zzso and 6 zzso at zzso in gray matter, white matter, and cerebral spinal zzso The zzso relaxation rate zzso zzso of gray and white matter each increased approximately zzso with field strength and zzso was zzso related to zzso The average zzso value of gray matter was zzso and zzso smaller than that of white matter at zzso and zzso zzso These results are consistent with higher levels of zzso zzso and increased blood volume in gray matter compared to white matter in this region of the zzso
