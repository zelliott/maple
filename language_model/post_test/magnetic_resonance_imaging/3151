To evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso and ultrasound zzso criteria for breast implant zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso silicone breast implants and 22 zzso implants were evaluated with surface zzso MR imaging and US and surgically zzso MR criteria for implant failure were a collapsed implant shell zzso zzso zzso of silicone outside the shell zzso zzso and zzso zzso US criteria were collapsed zzso low-level echoes within the zzso and zzso echoes of zzso zzso 

Among zzso zzso MR imaging depicted 39 of 40 zzso 14 of 28 with minimal zzso 49 of 54 intact implants were correctly zzso US depicted 26 of 40 zzso zzso four of 28 with minimal zzso and 30 of 54 intact zzso Among zzso zzso MR imaging depicted four of five implants with zzso of both zzso and nine of 10 as intact; US depicted one zzso and helped identify two of 10 as zzso zzso accurately depicted the status of 29 of 30 zzso implants with MR imaging zzso 

MR imaging depicts implant integrity more accurately than zzso neither method reliably depicts minimal leakage with shell zzso zzso is useful in screening zzso implant zzso
