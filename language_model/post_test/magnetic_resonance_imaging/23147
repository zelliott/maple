zzso is a pathological hallmark of drug zzso However, little is known about the zzso zzso of this impaired impulsive control network on drug zzso Twenty two zzso heroin dependent zzso subjects and 15 cognitively normal zzso subjects participated in this zzso zzso functional connectivity zzso was employed to measure abnormalities in the intrinsic zzso functional connectivity zzso network activity and the zzso zzso zzso 11th version was used to measure zzso Linear zzso analysis was applied to detect the neural zzso underlying zzso by zzso zzso network activity with impulsive zzso In the HD group, higher zzso scores and significantly enhanced zzso network activity were found, especially in bilateral thalamus, right zzso and inferior frontal zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso network activity was seen in the left zzso and even switched to positive correlation pattern in right zzso relative to the zzso zzso The zzso network strengths in the HD group were positively correlated with zzso in the right zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cortex, and zzso correlated in left zzso zzso In the zzso group, the left zzso zzso connectivity was positively zzso and right zzso frontal zzso and zzso connectivity were zzso correlated with zzso zzso Our study demonstrates different zzso of the impulsive network in HD and zzso zzso zzso zzso network connectivity in HD subjects may contribute to the loss of impulsive zzso This further zzso our understanding of the neural zzso of behavior dysfunction in zzso
