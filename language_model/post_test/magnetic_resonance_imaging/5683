In this study, we describe and adapt the relevant methods of magnetic resonance zzso and zzso to estimate total brain volume zzso cerebral and zzso volume and their volume zzso within the zzso The study included 15 (8 zzso 7 zzso controls and 15 (8 zzso 7 zzso patients with Alzheimer's zzso The patients' MR images were obtained in both zzso and zzso zzso The volume and volume fraction of the total brain, zzso and zzso were determined on MR images using the zzso approach of zzso zzso The volume zzso of the zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso in the control group were zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso planes, and zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso planes, zzso The volume zzso of the zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso in the zzso group were zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso planes, and zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso planes, zzso The zzso subjects showed significantly lower cerebral and zzso volume fraction to zzso than the control subjects zzso No significant difference was found in either group with regard to gender or planes zzso The present evaluation of zzso cerebral and zzso volume and volume zzso can be done on any complete set of MR imaging, in which the plane scan distance and zzso factor are known, as they are in zzso In conclusion, the cerebral and zzso to zzso volume zzso can be important tools in determining brain zzso and can be estimated by the zzso zzso
