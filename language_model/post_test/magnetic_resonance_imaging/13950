To determine 1) the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso MRS in the motor zzso 2) the extent to which zzso MRS imaging zzso detects abnormal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compounds in early stages of zzso and 3) the zzso changes over time in zzso 

Sixteen patients with zzso or probable zzso 12 with possible or suspected zzso and 12 healthy controls underwent structural zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data were zzso with zzso zzso data to obtain zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the left and right motor zzso and in gray matter and white matter of zzso regions in the zzso 

The zzso correlation zzso of zzso was zzso in the motor zzso tissue and zzso in zzso zzso zzso When zzso data for patients were compared with those for controls, the zzso + zzso ratio in the motor zzso region was significantly reduced, primarily due to increases in zzso and zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso A similar, although not zzso trend of increased zzso and zzso and reduced zzso levels was also observed for patients with possible or suspected zzso Furthermore, in zzso studies, decreases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in motor zzso but not in zzso regions in zzso 

zzso changes measured by zzso zzso may provide a surrogate marker of ALS that can aid detection of early disease and monitor progression and treatment zzso
