The development of new surgical zzso zzso zzso zzso and the diffusion of zzso zzso therapy, has increased the importance of an accurate zzso staging in patients with zzso zzso The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of zzso ultrasound zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the local zzso staging of zzso zzso zzso the two methods were assessed with a zzso K zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso were staged with zzso and body zzso zzso and then underwent radical zzso The zzso staging was compared with the zzso findings of the operative zzso 

zzso was more accurate zzso with better sensibility zzso positive zzso value zzso zzso and negative zzso value zzso zzso than zzso in the evaluation of T zzso zzso was more accurate zzso with better specificity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than zzso in the evaluation of N zzso The zzso test obtained a K value of zzso for the T zzso and zzso for the N zzso 

zzso and zzso are complementary methods in the zzso staging of zzso zzso zzso is more accurate in determining zzso wall penetration of the zzso while zzso is more accurate in the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso The low value of the K index confirms the zzso of the two zzso Further studies with new imaging techniques such as zzso zzso external zzso zzso zzso and three zzso ultrasound are needed to identify the most effective single examination in the zzso staging of zzso zzso
