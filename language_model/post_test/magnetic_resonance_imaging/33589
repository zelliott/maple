To determine whether zzso magnetic resonance imaging can detect ethanol zzso in zzso 

zzso were treated with a single high dose of ethanol zzso zzso or with a zzso ethanol diet zzso for up to zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed before and after intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Enhancement zzso zzso was significantly lower in ethanol treated animals on zzso scans zzso zzso zzso zzso a significant difference in intensity was seen on zzso scans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed severe zzso zzso In the chronic groups, there was no significant difference in intensity zzso zzso enhancement zzso zzso was significantly lower on zzso scans only at 2 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated progressive ethanol zzso 

zzso resonance imaging can distinguish between normal and certain types of ethanol damaged zzso on zzso zzso zzso however, does not correlate with progressive microscopic liver zzso
