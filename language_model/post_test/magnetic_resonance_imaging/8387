Studies on simple zzso motor and cognitive tasks have shown that the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso areas are involved in free response zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether these brain regions are also involved in free generation of responses in a more complex creative behavior: musical zzso Eleven professional pianists participated in the zzso In one condition, zzso the pianist improvised on the basis of a visually displayed zzso In the control condition, zzso the participant reproduced his previous improvisation from zzso Participants were able to reproduce their improvisations with a high level of zzso and the contrast Improvise versus zzso was thus essentially matched in terms of motor output and sensory zzso However, the Improvise condition required storage in memory of the zzso We therefore also included a condition zzso where the pianist improvised but was instructed not to memorize his zzso To locate brain regions involved in musical creation, we investigated the zzso in the zzso contrast that were also present in zzso contrasted with a baseline rest zzso zzso brain regions included the right zzso prefrontal cortex, the zzso motor area, the zzso portion of the zzso zzso cortex, and the left zzso part of the superior zzso zzso We suggest that these regions are part of a network involved in musical creation, and discuss their possible functional zzso
