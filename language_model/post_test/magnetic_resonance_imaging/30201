When switching tasks, if stimuli are presented that cue two of the tasks in the task set zzso zzso zzso performance slowing is observed on all tasks, including those not cued by the zzso zzso This slowing has been coined the zzso effect, and may reflect zzso tuning of the response style under conditions that appear to require adjustments in control over the course of zzso Recent work on the function of the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso has suggested that this neural region may be recruited under such zzso In the current task switching study, we used tightly matched experimental and control conditions to isolate the zzso zzso As predicted, zzso zzso was associated with the zzso effect, supporting an account stating that the role of the zzso is to signal a break in task inertia in order to zzso tune the response style due to conditions that may require adjustments in control over the course of zzso This result may extend the conflict monitoring account of zzso zzso to situations where conflict occurred on past trials zzso conflict is not zzso by the current zzso and/or may support a more generalized account of zzso function involving monitoring internal states for conditions that may require adjustments in control over the course of zzso
