The zzso has a pivotal role in deciphering the emotional significance of sensory stimuli enabling emotional memory zzso We have previously shown that prefrontal zzso in zzso monkeys project to the zzso mainly from their deep zzso suggesting feedback zzso If sensory areas convey signals pertinent to the state of the environment, they should issue zzso projections to the amygdala, arising mainly from the upper zzso consistent with the flow of information from zzso to zzso sensory zzso Here we addressed this hypothesis in cases with injection of zzso in sites of the zzso known to have robust connections with prefrontal zzso and mapped connections in insular and zzso zzso associated with sensory processing and zzso The zzso zzso pole, the zzso and zzso areas, and the zzso and zzso zzso had the densest connections with the amygdala, and the lateral zzso pole, the zzso region, and the zzso zzso had zzso zzso Most areas projected to the zzso predominantly from the upper zzso suggesting zzso communication, and received zzso zzso zzso primarily in their superficial zzso suggesting feedback zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso issued projections to the zzso from its deep zzso suggesting feedback communication, and received zzso zzso projections most densely in layers zzso which project to the zzso These findings may help explain how the zzso can attach emotional value to environmental zzso participate in the sequence of information processing of emotions, and zzso the formation of emotional zzso
