We compared statistical zzso maps zzso of zzso regional gray matter differences between zzso lobe zzso zzso patients with unilateral zzso zzso zzso determined by manual zzso analysis relative to a healthy control population using standard and zzso zzso zzso zzso We also investigated the impact of customized zzso templates on zzso Standard and zzso zzso analyses of gray matter concentration zzso and gray matter volume zzso correctly identified zzso regardless of the template used for zzso The distribution of zzso and zzso abnormalities differed according to the technique zzso v zzso GMC v zzso but was not dependent on template type zzso v zzso within each zzso In particular, zzso GMC reduction was confined to zzso of zzso whereas zzso reduction was observed in the zzso head, body, and zzso Unlike standard and zzso GMC reduction, symmetrical zzso reduction was observed in bilateral thalamus, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cortex, zzso cortex, and zzso zzso in both left and right zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso of GMC zzso regional distribution of gray zzso and zzso zzso volume per zzso reduction can identify focal zzso that has been zzso with manual region of interest techniques, although effects are attenuated in analyses of zzso Unlike zzso of zzso analyses of zzso revealed similar zzso abnormalities as previous zzso zzso and zzso studies of intractable zzso We suggest that in studies of neurological disorders, zzso zzso analyses of zzso may reveal subtle zzso changes that are not identified in analyses of zzso
