zzso are gradually represented in zzso after extensive experience, and yet they can influence behavior after minimal zzso What kind of representations support such rapid statistical zzso The zzso zzso lobe zzso can represent information from even a single experience, making it a good candidate system for assisting in initial learning about zzso We combined anatomical zzso of the zzso high-resolution zzso and zzso pattern analysis to identify representations of objects in cortical and zzso areas of human zzso assessing how these representations were shaped by exposure to zzso zzso viewed a continuous visual stream containing hidden zzso zzso of objects that reliably appeared nearby in zzso We compared the pattern of blood oxygen zzso activity evoked by each object before and after this exposure, and found that zzso cortex, zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by increasing the zzso similarity of their constituent zzso Most regions exhibited zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso represented zzso in a forward-looking zzso zzso These findings suggest that object representations in zzso come to mirror the zzso structure of the environment, supporting rapid and incidental statistical zzso
