zzso is thought to play a key role in cocaine addiction onset and zzso therefore, we hypothesized that different zzso of impulsive personality may be significantly associated with brain structural abnormalities in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso individuals and 38 zzso using controls completed the zzso scale zzso five different zzso of zzso sensation zzso lack of zzso lack of zzso and positive and negative zzso and were scanned on a zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso analyses zzso to detect differences in gray matter zzso and white matter zzso volumes between cocaine users and controls, and to measure differences in the way that zzso relates to zzso and zzso volumes in cocaine users zzso zzso 

zzso individuals had lower zzso volumes in a number of sections of the zzso cortex, right inferior frontal zzso right zzso left zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and bilateral zzso They also had lower zzso volumes in the left inferior and zzso frontal zzso superior zzso zzso right anterior zzso cortex, zzso and zzso There was a positive correlation between trait zzso and zzso volume in the left zzso frontal zzso of zzso individuals, a pattern directly opposed to the association in zzso zzso in cocaine users lack of zzso was zzso correlated with zzso volume in the zzso and the zzso 

zzso zzso may influence cocaine dependence by zzso its zzso zzso in zzso zzso
