The authors compare in zzso zzso of three magnetic resonance contrast agents in humans in terms of their kinetic zzso 

Blood and urine samples were taken before and after the intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso or zzso at zzso zzso to healthy zzso zzso and urine were zzso for zzso copper, and zzso using zzso coupled plasma atomic zzso zzso 

zzso caused the highest increase in zinc zzso among the three zzso zzso did not cause a significant increase in zinc zzso In serum, although zzso exhibited a decrease in zinc zzso the difference between the drugs was not statistically zzso 

The difference in observed zinc zzso among the zzso studied reflects in zzso zzso of the magnetic resonance contrast media and zzso with the respective kinetic inertia for zzso rather than zzso stability zzso zzso was found to be the most zzso zzso among the three drugs zzso
