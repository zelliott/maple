Rapid zzso of tissue zzso in zzso by MRS or zzso can be achieved using zzso zzso coils with identical B1 field zzso at the observation zzso of the zzso and tissue water zzso zzso sodium is used as an example for zzso the zzso zzso zzso coils for such zzso in zzso In the setting of sodium imaging, the challenge of zzso zzso zzso is to zzso the sodium and zzso channels because the fourth harmonic of the sodium frequency is very close to the zzso zzso A zzso method for effectively decoupling these two zzso zzso is presented in this zzso The method is demonstrated with the design of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The performance of the zzso probe is reported at zzso zzso in terms of zzso ratio, B1 zzso and image zzso
