There are few methods to discern driving risks in patients with early zzso and mild cognitive impairment zzso We aimed to determine whether structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso zzso of probable zzso pathology and a measure of disease severity in those zzso linked to objective ratings of zzso driving performance in older adults with and without zzso zzso 

In all, 49 zzso participants from an Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (15 diagnosed with zzso zzso and 34 demographically similar zzso underwent structural zzso and zzso driving zzso 

zzso zzso of the left zzso was associated with zzso ratings in lane control but not with other discrete driving zzso zzso in left zzso volume zzso higher risk for zzso lane control ratings in the patients with zzso (B zzso zzso standard error zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not in controls (B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The odds ratio and zzso confidence zzso for zzso lane control in the zzso group was zzso zzso which was attenuated to zzso zzso after accounting for the contribution of left zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that there may be a link between zzso zzso and difficulties with lane control in persons with zzso zzso Further study appears warranted to better discern patterns of brain zzso in zzso and zzso disease and whether these could be early markers of clinically meaningful driving zzso
