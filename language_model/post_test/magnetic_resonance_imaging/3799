Central diabetes zzso is a rare clinical condition with a zzso zzso Up to zzso of cases are classified as zzso although many of these are thought to have an zzso zzso Published data have suggested that anterior zzso is common in zzso idiopathic diabetes zzso We aimed to assess the zzso of anterior zzso in a cohort of adult patients with idiopathic diabetes zzso 

We performed a retrospective review of the databases of two zzso investigation zzso This identified 39 patients with idiopathic diabetes zzso All had undergone magnetic resonance imaging scanning and dynamic zzso testing zzso insulin tolerance testing or zzso and short zzso zzso to assess anterior zzso zzso 

One patient had partial growth hormone zzso no other anterior zzso hormonal deficits were zzso zzso percent had at least one zzso disease in addition to central diabetes zzso 

Our data suggest that anterior zzso is rare in adult idiopathic diabetes zzso zzso screening of these patients for anterior zzso may not, therefore, be zzso The significant prevalence of zzso disease in this cohort supports the hypothesis that idiopathic diabetes zzso may have an zzso zzso
