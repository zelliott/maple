We present global and regional rates of brain zzso measured on serially acquired zzso brain MR images for a group of Alzheimer's disease zzso patients and zzso normal control zzso subjects using the analysis procedure described in Part zzso Three rates of brain zzso the rate of zzso in the zzso the rate of lateral zzso enlargement and the rate of zzso in the region of zzso zzso were evaluated for 14 zzso patients and 14 zzso NC zzso All three rates showed significant differences between the two zzso However, the greatest separation of the two groups was obtained when the regional rates were zzso This application has demonstrated that rates of brain zzso especially in specific regions of the brain, based on MR images can provide sensitive measures for evaluating the progression of zzso These measures will be useful for the evaluation of therapeutic effects of novel therapies for zzso
