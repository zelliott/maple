To evaluate the relationship between zzso zzso blood zzso and common carotid zzso thickness zzso in aging zzso 

An zzso and zzso case control study was zzso zzso were contacted and enrolled voluntarily according to a database containing zzso cases that received carotid zzso examination at our hospital in the previous two zzso zzso pairs of subjects zzso male, 30 zzso aged zzso years, average 63 zzso underwent dynamic zzso magnetic resonance zzso study of the zzso zzso The average peak enhancement percentage of the second to fourth zzso zzso was used to represent the zzso zzso zzso status for each zzso The common carotid zzso presence of zzso peak enhancement percentage, body mass index zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were acquired for statistical zzso 

The average peak enhancement percentage was significantly lower in thickened zzso group compared to the normal zzso group zzso zzso 23 zzso 90 zzso 27, zzso The carotid zzso zzso correlated with zzso peak enhancement percentage zzso zzso The zzso peak enhancement percentage was significantly lower in subjects with presence of any carotid plaque zzso Common carotid zzso was the only significant variable that was zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso after adjusting for the effect of sex, age, blood pressure, zzso total cholesterol, zzso and zzso level in linear zzso model zzso 

Our data demonstrate the negative association between zzso zzso blood zzso and common carotid zzso These results suggest that common carotid zzso may provide the information of tissue zzso status of the zzso bone zzso
