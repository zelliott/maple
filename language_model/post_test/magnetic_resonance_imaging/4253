To describe the zzso zzso zzso an infrequently described manifestation of zzso arthritis, and to speculate on its zzso through gross zzso zzso correlation and MR zzso 

One hundred and zzso conventional ankle zzso were obtained and reviewed in 76 patients with clinically diagnosed zzso zzso Additional imaging of three zzso was obtained utilizing CT and MR zzso In addition to evaluating zzso changes, note was made of the presence and location of a zzso zzso zzso along the zzso border of the zzso zzso zzso zzso dissection and zzso examination was performed in an attempt to determine the exact zzso of this zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso notch was identified in 52 of 121 zzso zzso Seventy-five percent of notches were zzso and extended down to the horizontal ankle joint level, while zzso of notches were zzso with extension below the zzso The majority of zzso zzso demonstrated zzso marginal zzso and/or joint zzso zzso zzso dissection revealed a zzso zzso fold within the zzso zzso zzso recess without underlying zzso cartilage zzso 

The zzso notch within the zzso zzso zzso is a frequent manifestation of zzso arthritis and appears to result from zzso proliferation rather than from mechanical zzso
