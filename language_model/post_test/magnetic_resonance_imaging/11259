zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso remains a clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso is new imaging technique that allows direct evaluation of cellular zzso This method is mainly used in zzso especially in fusion with computer zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of zzso in diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso 

The results of zzso scan performed in 120 patients who had suspected recurrence disease were analyzed zzso The zzso diagnosis was established on the basis of zzso examination or clinical zzso zzso results were compared with 76 computer zzso zzso 30 magnetic resonance imaging zzso 81 zzso zzso 75 chest zzso zzso and 91 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cancer was demonstrated on zzso in 69 patients zzso In 24 patients local zzso 33 liver zzso 23 pulmonary zzso and in 36 other zzso were zzso A total of 116 suspicious zzso were zzso The final diagnosis of recurrence was obtained in 56 patients zzso zzso zzso and accuracy for zzso findings were: for zzso 98, 94 and zzso for zzso test 68, 82 and zzso for CT scan 85, 91 and zzso for zzso scan 96, 86 and zzso for ultrasound test 71, 96 and zzso for X-ray 87, 96 and zzso zzso zzso influenced surgical decisions in zzso of zzso 

zzso is a very useful diagnostic method in case of patients with suspected recurrence of zzso zzso Its usefulness is higher than the serum level of zzso and other conventional imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
