Most reports regarding pediatric zzso have focused not only on zzso zzso but also on spinal zzso However, the clinical characteristics of zzso with spinal zzso are quite different from those of zzso due to zzso Type I zzso The objectives of this study were to identify clinical characteristics of pediatric zzso and to determine whether surgery prevents or zzso the zzso associated with zzso 

We reviewed the records of 16 pediatric patients with zzso and zzso Type I zzso The patients' ages ranged from 3 to 15 years, with mean age of zzso zzso None of the patients had spinal zzso 

zzso was observed in 2 of the 16 patients, motor weakness in 8 patients, sensory zzso in 10 patients, and zzso in 13 zzso As the initial surgical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in seven patients and zzso zzso zzso in nine zzso The motor function improved in 7 of the 8 affected patients, and the sensory zzso improved in 9 of the 10 affected zzso The magnetic resonance images obtained after the surgery revealed marked decrease of the zzso size in all zzso Of the 13 patients with zzso 5 showed improvement, 5 stabilization, and 3 zzso 

Compared with adolescent and adult zzso pediatric zzso shows a much lower zzso of sensory zzso and pain, but quite a high zzso of zzso Surgery is effective in improving or stabilizing zzso in these zzso
