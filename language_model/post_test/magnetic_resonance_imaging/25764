This study was designed to serially analyze the magnetic resonance zzso appearance of zzso zzso zzso during the first year of zzso and to determine if the zzso location of the zzso tunnel affects the MR appearance of the zzso An additional goal was to analyze the effect of the zzso placement of the zzso tunnel placement on knee extension and zzso Two groups were defined by comparing the zzso relationship of the zzso tunnel to the slope of the zzso roof from a lateral zzso of the knee in full zzso The roof zzso group consisted of nine patients who had the zzso tunnel placed anterior to the zzso intersection of the slope of the zzso zzso The zzso group was composed of zzso patients who had the zzso tunnel placed zzso and parallel to the slope of the zzso zzso MR scans were obtained at zzso 12, 24, 36, and greater than 48 weeks zzso The signal zzso of zzso in both groups were identical at 1 week, but increased in the zzso group by 3 months and remained increased at 12 months zzso zzso less than zzso In contrast, the MR signal of zzso in the zzso group remained unchanged during the first zzso zzso with zzso zzso had extension deficits but remained zzso zzso zzso was impossible to view directly with the knee in full zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
