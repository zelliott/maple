We present the design process of a zzso volume zzso for magnetic resonance zzso of the mouse brain at zzso The zzso zzso copper oxide zzso has been designed through an zzso process of three-dimensional zzso simulations and validation against room temperature copper zzso Compared to previous designs, the zzso pair provides substantially higher zzso zzso over an extended volume of interest sufficiently large to image biologically relevant zzso A zzso zzso cooling system maintains the zzso probe at zzso zzso loading and probe zzso can be carried out zzso with the zzso at operating temperature, enabling much higher zzso The operation of the probe is a routine, consistent zzso zzso ratio in a mouse brain increased by a factor ranging from zzso to zzso as compared to a zzso zzso zzso zzso for mouse brain zzso We demonstrate images zzso at zzso for an entire mouse brain zzso with zzso ratio of 18 and a total acquisition time of zzso revealing zzso unseen at lower zzso Phantom zzso show an effective spatial resolution better than zzso
