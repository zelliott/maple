The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnosis and staging of gallbladder cancer zzso Images of dynamic zzso of zzso system combined with MR zzso zzso of 18 patients with zzso proved gallbladder cancer were correlated with pathological and operative zzso zzso or diffuse wall zzso was present in 10 zzso In five patients, the tumor appeared as a zzso or zzso zzso A tumor replacing the gallbladder was found in two patients and a small cancer in zzso duct in one zzso The tumor featured early and irregular enhancement, which persisted throughout the dynamic zzso zzso zzso were found by zzso in 13 patients and were depicted by the dynamic zzso in 11 zzso Local invasion to liver was found by surgery in 12 patients and correctly detected by zzso in 11 zzso zzso detected zzso invasion in three out of six patients and none of the three cases with zzso zzso In conclusion, dynamic zzso is useful and reliable in staging of advanced gallbladder zzso zzso combined with zzso is sensitive in detection of zzso zzso liver invasion as well as liver and zzso zzso zzso It is more difficult to delineate the invasion to zzso and zzso zzso by zzso
