To date, the use of structural MR imaging (including zzso and zzso or zzso inversion zzso zzso is the standard method to diagnose tumor progression and to assess zzso treatment zzso However, several studies have suggested that zzso zzso PET adds valuable clinical information to the information derived from structural MR imaging zzso We evaluated the effectiveness and zzso of the addition of zzso PET to structural MR imaging for the management of treatment with zzso and zzso zzso in patients with zzso high-grade zzso compared with MR imaging alone from the perspective of the German zzso Health zzso 

To evaluate the incremental zzso of the additional use of zzso zzso a decision tree model was zzso zzso of zzso PET was defined as correct identification of both tumor progression before zzso treatment initiation and zzso treatment response and was evaluated for the combination of zzso PET and MR imaging compared with MR imaging zzso zzso were estimated for a baseline scenario and for a more expensive zzso The zzso of the results was tested using deterministic and zzso sensitivity zzso 

The use of zzso PET resulted in a number needed to diagnose of zzso that is, 3 additional patients have to be diagnosed to avoid 1 wrong zzso The incremental zzso ratio of zzso zzso imaging compared with MR imaging alone was zzso zzso zzso zzso for the baseline scenario and zzso for the more expensive scenario per additional correct zzso The zzso sensitivity analysis confirmed the zzso of the zzso 

The model suggests that the additional use of zzso PET in the management of patients with zzso high-grade zzso treated with zzso may be zzso zzso of zzso PET has the potential to avoid zzso and corresponding costs, as well as unnecessary side effects to the zzso
