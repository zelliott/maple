Few studies have attempted to validate the zzso zzso The accuracy of identifying zzso and other zzso mechanisms of zzso will be increasingly important in evaluating potential stroke zzso The aim of this study was to determine the value of zzso syndromes in predicting zzso zzso and the value of zzso zzso in predicting zzso zzso as final stroke zzso 

From 1990 to 1994, 591 patients with cerebral zzso who were from northern Manhattan and over the age of 39, were zzso zzso Data were collected on the admitting clinical syndrome zzso or zzso and brain imaging zzso zzso syndromes were zzso as pure motor zzso zzso pure sensory syndrome zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso Brain imaging findings were classified as zzso zzso or zzso Positive zzso values, sensitivities, and zzso of zzso syndromes for identifying zzso zzso were zzso The final mechanism of zzso was determined after review of all the diagnostic tests and compared among the zzso zzso 

zzso syndromes occurred in 225 zzso zzso was the most common zzso syndrome, accounting for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso syndromes had an overall positive zzso value zzso of zzso for detecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among the 195 patients who presented with a zzso syndrome and had this condition confirmed zzso 147 were classified as having a final diagnosis of zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accounted for 17 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 17 zzso and other unusual causes 4 zzso 

While zzso zzso especially zzso and zzso are highly zzso of zzso in about one in four patients presenting with zzso syndromes confirmed zzso the condition is associated with zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso and cardiac evaluations are still warranted even among patients with zzso
