Although cigarette smokers are at increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis zzso the effect of smoking on the progression of zzso remains zzso 

To establish the relationship between cigarette smoking and progression of zzso using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes 

zzso survey and zzso follow-up for a mean of zzso years, ending January 15, zzso 

Partners zzso Center zzso zzso a referral center for patients with zzso 

Study participants included 1465 patients with clinically zzso zzso zzso zzso with mean zzso age at baseline of zzso zzso years and disease duration of zzso zzso zzso Seven hundred zzso patients zzso were zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso were current zzso 

Smoking groups were compared for baseline clinical and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics as well as progression and sustained progression on the Expanded zzso zzso zzso at 2 and 5 years and time to disease conversion to secondary progressive zzso In addition, the rate of zzso change in the brain zzso fraction and zzso zzso zzso volume were zzso 

Current smokers had significantly worse disease at baseline than zzso in terms of Expanded zzso zzso zzso score zzso P zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and brain zzso fraction zzso P zzso zzso In addition, current smokers were significantly more likely to have primary progressive zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso in smokers progressed from zzso to secondary progressive disease faster than in zzso zzso ratio for current smokers vs zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso In addition, in smokers, the zzso zzso volume increased faster zzso zzso zzso and brain zzso fraction decreased faster zzso zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that cigarette smoke has an adverse influence on the progression of zzso and zzso conversion from a zzso to a progressive zzso
