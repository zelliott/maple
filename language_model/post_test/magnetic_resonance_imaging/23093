When people zzso affective information is transmitted between their zzso Modern imaging techniques permit to investigate the dynamics of this zzso transfer of zzso Here, we used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the flow of affective information between the brains of zzso and zzso engaged in ongoing facial communication of zzso We found that the level of neural activity within a distributed network of the zzso brain can be successfully predicted from the neural activity in the same network in the zzso brain, depending on the affect that is currently being zzso Furthermore, there was a zzso succession in the flow of affective information from the zzso brain to the zzso brain, with information in the zzso brain being significantly delayed relative to information in the zzso zzso This delay decreased over time, possibly reflecting some zzso zzso of the zzso with the zzso Our data support current theories of zzso by providing direct evidence that during ongoing facial communication a zzso zzso of affect is successively built up between zzso and zzso of affective facial zzso
