Previous imaging studies have shown little difference in the degree of disc zzso between zzso and zzso We hypothesized that because the zzso of the zzso ligament affects the stability of the zzso zzso then it could determine the lower zzso disc zzso zzso male and 47 female patients were classified into three groups according to their disc zzso zzso in whom the zzso disc was less zzso zzso zzso more zzso zzso B), and equally zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso disc on zzso magnetic resonance zzso The length and direction of the anterior and zzso zzso ligaments were measured on zzso zzso zzso The zzso ligament was shorter in group A than in group B or C, and was oriented significantly more zzso in group A than in groups B or zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso especially its length and direction, can be a factor influencing the development of disc zzso at zzso and zzso
