The current study was designed to investigate the influence of zzso zzso fluid zzso density, zzso and volume on the extent and duration of plain zzso spinal zzso 

zzso patients scheduled to undergo orthopedic surgery with spinal block were zzso zzso zzso volumes were calculated from low zzso zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso at the zzso level was derived from zzso magnetic resonance zzso Spinal zzso was performed in the lateral zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso was sampled to measure zzso density before injection of 3 zzso plain zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso between zzso characteristics and zzso of spinal zzso were assessed by zzso rank zzso In addition, zzso multiple linear zzso models were used to select important zzso of measures of spinal zzso 

There was a significant correlation between zzso density and peak sensory block level zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso correlated with peak sensory block level zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and positively correlated with onset time of complete motor block zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso volume also zzso correlated with time required for zzso of the sensory block to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was a significant inverse correlation between peak zzso zzso zzso and duration of motor blockade zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis revealed that weight and zzso volume significantly contributed to the peak sensory block level zzso zzso zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso density and volume influence the spread of spinal zzso with plain zzso and that zzso volume also influences the duration of spinal zzso zzso zzso might also influence the duration of plain zzso spinal zzso
