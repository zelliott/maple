Previous studies have shown that zzso strokes are common and zzso We sought to characterize the risk factors, stroke zzso timing of acute stroke evaluation and frequency of zzso therapy in zzso zzso strokes compared with community zzso zzso 

The hospital records of patients admitted for acute zzso stroke between 1996 and 2002 were zzso Acute stroke was defined as occurrence of stroke symptoms within 72 zzso and zzso status was assigned if the patient was currently admitted for another illness at the time of the zzso Patient demographics such as medical versus surgical service, admission diagnoses, clinical features including stroke risk factors, access to zzso therapy and immediate outcome were zzso 

Of zzso patients with acute zzso stroke, 161 zzso had strokes occurring while already in the hospital zzso compared to zzso zzso that occurred in the zzso community zzso zzso two thirds of zzso occurred on medical services zzso zzso and one third on surgical services zzso zzso Mean age, male zzso zzso zzso and risk factors including hypertension, diabetes and smoking history were of similar zzso in zzso and zzso but penetrating artery disease was the cause of only zzso of zzso compared to zzso of zzso zzso The mean modified Rankin scale for zzso at presentation was zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Of 161 zzso patients, 21 zzso had neurological assessment within 3 h of symptom zzso compared to zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso and the rate of zzso therapy was not significant between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso are common and zzso than zzso The use of zzso therapy in zzso patients was limited because of time of recognition and zzso zzso Increased vigilance for timely neurological assessment of these patients is zzso
