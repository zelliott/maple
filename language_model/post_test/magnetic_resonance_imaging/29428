zzso is an increasingly common condition and is associated with excess morbidity and zzso including clinical and zzso cardiac zzso The role of hormones involved in energy zzso including zzso and zzso in cardiovascular function remains incompletely zzso zzso we sought to evaluate the association between systemic zzso and zzso levels with indexes of cardiovascular structure and zzso 

We measured serum zzso and zzso levels in 25 clinically healthy obese men and 25 lean controls, using commercially available zzso We also assessed right and left zzso structure and function using cardiac magnetic resonance zzso We then investigated the association between serum zzso and zzso levels with cardiac indexes, using zzso and zzso zzso 

There was an independent association between serum zzso levels and zzso right zzso mass zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso right zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and right zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as right zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no significant association between serum zzso and indexes of left zzso structure or zzso We also identified an association between serum zzso levels and resting heart rate zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was an association between serum zzso and zzso left zzso mass on zzso but not on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with right zzso cardiovascular indexes and serum zzso is associated with resting heart zzso These associations indicate a close interaction between the zzso and cardiovascular systems in zzso
