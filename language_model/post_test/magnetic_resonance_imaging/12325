We propose a zzso zzso constant model for the zzso of highly curved fiber tracts in diffusion zzso zzso An zzso zzso obtained via zzso provides the overall shape of the tract and allows us to examine the zzso zzso at the level of zzso planes normal to the zzso Each zzso is modeled as a zzso constant image, allowing us to address changes in measured diffusion due to the curving of the tract while still capturing overall tract zzso zzso on both synthetic and real data show improved zzso quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in areas of crossing zzso
