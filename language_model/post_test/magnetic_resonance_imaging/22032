Previous studies of a cohort of 100 patients with zzso have shown that a history of zzso severe zzso is associated with a modest impairment of cognitive zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether zzso patients with and without a history of severe zzso have zzso in the brain that are identifiable by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso and to investigate the putative relationship of any structural brain abnormalities with cognitive zzso 

zzso and MRS of the brain were performed in 22 patients from the original zzso Eleven zzso patients with no history of severe zzso zzso zzso were compared with 11 zzso patients who had a history of five or more episodes of severe zzso zzso zzso 

Nine patients zzso had abnormal zzso Two types of abnormalities were zzso high-intensity rounded zzso zzso 3 zzso in zzso distributed in the zzso white matter zzso in four zzso and cortical zzso in five zzso Five patients in group B had cortical zzso whereas no patient in group A demonstrated this feature zzso zzso zzso MRS of the frontal and zzso zzso showed no differences in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso ratios between groups A and zzso Patients with cortical zzso showed a zzso trend toward reduced performance on Rapid Visual Information zzso 

Brain abnormalities demonstrated by zzso are common in patients with zzso of long duration and are suggestive of premature aging of the zzso zzso per zzso may be an important zzso factor, but a significant association was observed between a history of zzso severe zzso and cortical zzso which may be related to the modest impairment of cognitive function that has been reported zzso
