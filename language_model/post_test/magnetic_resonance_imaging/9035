Several functional and structural imaging studies have investigated the neural basis of personality in healthy adults, but human zzso studies are zzso Personality changes are a common symptom in patients with neurodegenerative diseases like zzso zzso zzso and semantic zzso zzso allowing a unique window into the neural basis of zzso In this study, we used the zzso zzso zzso to investigate the structural basis of eight interpersonal traits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso warmth, and zzso in zzso zzso 214 patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as zzso zzso progressive zzso zzso Alzheimer's disease, zzso mild cognitive zzso zzso zzso and progressive zzso zzso and 43 healthy elderly zzso zzso of interpersonal traits were correlated with regional zzso pattern using zzso zzso zzso analysis of structural MR zzso zzso traits mapped onto distinct brain regions depending on the degree to which they involved agency and zzso zzso traits high in agency related to left zzso prefrontal and left lateral zzso regions, whereas interpersonal traits high in affiliation related to right zzso prefrontal and right zzso zzso zzso zzso with the existing literature on neural networks underlying social zzso these results indicate that brain regions related to zzso focused, executive zzso processes zzso zzso interpersonal traits such as dominance, whereas brain regions related to internally focused, zzso and zzso processes zzso zzso interpersonal traits such as zzso In addition, these findings indicate that interpersonal traits are zzso by complex neural networks rather than discrete zzso zzso
