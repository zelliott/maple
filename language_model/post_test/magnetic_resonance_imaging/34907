The zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso that mediates the effects of zzso in zzso development, growth, and synthetic zzso We report here that a child with features of zzso resistance, including markedly increased serum zzso zzso and low normal zzso hormone levels, is a compound zzso for two novel zzso in the zzso zzso zzso One zzso has a G to A transition corresponding to an zzso to zzso change at zzso 109 zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso The other zzso has a G to A transition corresponding to a premature termination zzso at zzso 546 zzso in the fourth zzso zzso Each parent is zzso for one zzso and both parents have normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso exhibited reduced membrane binding of zzso and impaired signal zzso in response to zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso was zzso with negligible membrane zzso zzso Our findings indicate that a single normal zzso zzso zzso is sufficient for normal zzso function, but that the compound zzso in the zzso leads to zzso zzso
