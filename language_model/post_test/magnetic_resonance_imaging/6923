zzso disease is the principal cause of mortality in patients with zzso zzso Left zzso zzso abnormalities are adverse zzso indicators for cardiovascular zzso The aim of this study was to use cardiac magnetic resonance scanning zzso to define zzso functional abnormalities in zzso zzso patients and clarify the zzso of blood pressure zzso and the effect of zzso in this zzso We studied 44 HD patients and 11 controls with zzso performed following zzso Forty patients and 11 controls completed the zzso zzso mass zzso and estimated systemic vascular resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in the dialysis group compared to zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were lower than zzso In the HD patients, zzso correlated significantly with cardiac output zzso r zzso zzso zzso and end zzso volume zzso r zzso zzso zzso but there was no correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with both CO zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and positively with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso HD patients had a higher zzso mass and lower ejection fraction than zzso The relationship of zzso with zzso but not zzso supports the theory that a major zzso of zzso is zzso volume and CO rather than vascular resistance although there was a fixed increase in zzso in this zzso zzso understanding of the mechanisms underlying increased zzso and improved control of CO and zzso volume may allow better therapeutic zzso zzso provides insights into the zzso of hypertension and zzso dysfunction in HD zzso
