To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging zzso utility in zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Two zzso zzso reviewed images of patients who underwent ultrasound followed by zzso zzso them as zzso or zzso and zzso benign, zzso or inadequate zzso For patients who underwent surgical zzso zzso results were also correlated to the zzso ultrasound and zzso zzso 

Of 69 cases, 38 were zzso zzso and 31 were zzso zzso zzso and ultrasound diagnoses were zzso in 21 zzso zzso and 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnosis was zzso after an indeterminate ultrasound in 0 and 4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnosis was benign after an indeterminate ultrasound in 18 zzso and 14 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso ultrasound diagnosis was reversed to benign zzso diagnosis in one zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso In no case was a benign zzso on ultrasound read as zzso on zzso in either zzso The cohort of patients with zzso zzso received a mean clinical and zzso follow up of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso years, zzso The patients with zzso zzso received a mean clinical and zzso follow up of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso years, zzso In no case did repeat imaging change the diagnosis after initial zzso and ultrasound zzso 

zzso was effective at characterizing both zzso and zzso zzso in the majority of zzso
