zzso zzso constitute a fundamental organizing principle of human zzso However, little is known about the neural systems that process zzso cues that indicate zzso zzso zzso work has suggested a role for the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and the superior zzso zzso zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to delineate the nature of these zzso zzso revealed signal changes in the right zzso in connection with two primary functions attributed to status zzso zzso cues moderate behavior and the right zzso showed increased signal for zzso relative to neutral and zzso zzso The zzso also showed increased signal for zzso cues displayed by individuals of the opposite gender to the zzso this may be relevant to the role status cues play in zzso mate choice zzso zzso results indicated significant positive connectivity between the zzso and both the zzso and the zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso information from these regions when processing hierarchy cues to facilitate socially zzso zzso
