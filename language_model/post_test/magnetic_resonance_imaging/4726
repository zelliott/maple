To determine whether the course of zzso head zzso after core zzso can be predicted from the extent of zzso bone in the zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In 31 zzso head zzso zzso stage I or zzso the percentage volume of zzso bone was calculated by dividing the sum of the zzso areas from all zzso slices by the sum of the zzso head zzso zzso risk factors, pain scores, and the need for further surgery were assessed at a minimum of 12 zzso zzso zzso Clinical outcomes were considered good when zzso zzso pain scores improved and further surgery was not zzso 

Fourteen of the 15 hips with good outcomes after a mean followup of 32 zzso had less than zzso zzso head zzso All 16 hips with poor outcomes after a mean followup of 17 zzso had more than zzso of the zzso head zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso head necrosis was a useful predictor of clinical outcome following core zzso
