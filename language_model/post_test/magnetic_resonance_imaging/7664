The zzso junction zzso has been defined as an anatomical zzso with particular zzso behavior that regulates zzso and zzso zzso Its function in clinical conditions, such as zzso disease has been zzso The aim of our study is to identify the zzso and to compare the zzso and dynamic features of the zzso between patients with zzso disease and healthy subjects using zzso 

Sixteen individuals, eight with uncomplicated zzso disease and eight healthy subjects, were studied using zzso to identify the zzso and to compare the zzso and dynamic features zzso 

In each subject zzso zzso was able to identify the zzso This resulted in the identification of a discrete anatomical entity with a mean length of zzso located in front of the first zzso vertebra zzso and at a mean distance of zzso from the zzso verge, with a mean wall thickness of zzso significantly different from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso wall was significantly thicker in patients with zzso disease than the controls zzso showing a unique shape and behavior in dynamic zzso 

Our findings support the hypothesis that zzso plays a critical role in patients with symptomatic zzso zzso further investigation may clarify whether specific zzso analysis, such as zzso would predict inflammatory complications of this diffuse and zzso zzso
