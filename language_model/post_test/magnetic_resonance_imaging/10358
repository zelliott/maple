zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent three established functional imaging tests that offer unique information toward the zzso of zzso for surgery evaluation and zzso When these tests are combined with high-resolution magnetic zzso imaging zzso zzso related structure and function disturbances may be localized with a degree of confidence and understanding not possible with zzso zzso even zzso recordings with zzso electrodes, the mainstay of tools for seizure zzso Use of these alternative tests allows an increased percentage of patients to be considered for surgical zzso In particular, the additional information provided by these techniques has been demonstrated to help those patients with zzso zzso or zzso lobe zzso Studies that address optimal use of these tests zzso and in zzso will build toward the next major advancement in the surgical treatment of zzso by allowing better patient selection, less risk, and better surgical zzso Ultimately, appropriate use of these tests, combined with more comprehensive functional brain mapping zzso with zzso or functional zzso may lead to completely zzso zzso surgery zzso
