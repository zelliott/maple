zzso featuring rare zzso tissue disease that zzso as skin sclerosis and variable systemic zzso Two categories of zzso are zzso systemic zzso characterized by zzso sclerosis and visceral involvement and localized zzso or zzso which classically presents benign evolution and zzso confined to the skin and/or underlying zzso Recent studies show that the localized form may possibly course with involvement of internal zzso and variable zzso This study aimed to determine the demographic zzso the prevalence of systemic manifestations and laboratory findings, as well as the association with zzso diseases, and the evolution of neurological findings, both clinical as brain zzso in patients with zzso of the face and its relation with the activity zzso 

Patients with localized zzso with facial involvement were evaluated and underwent neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso After zzso the patients were subjected again to zzso 

We studied 12 patients with localized zzso of the zzso Of this total, headache being the most frequent complaint found in zzso of patients, zzso had neurological changes possibly associated with zzso As for zzso zzso zzso of patients showed zzso The most frequent zzso finding was the presence of zzso with zzso or zzso signal in zzso of patients, followed by zzso asymmetry at zzso Of the patients who had neurological deficits, zzso also had a change to zzso In all patients, imaging findings after zzso were zzso During this zzso of zzso zzso of patients showed signs of activity of zzso 

Patients with localized zzso of the face have a high prevalence of neurological and zzso zzso Based on these findings, we suggest that all cases of localized zzso of the face should be thoroughly examined for the presence of systemic zzso
