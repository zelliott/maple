This study compares the use of zzso zzso zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and clinical assessment in the diagnosis and surgical management of patients with zzso with zzso The common CT findings of patients with zzso or zzso infection of zzso are zzso 

We reviewed the charts of 82 adult and pediatric patients with the diagnosis of zzso with zzso or zzso infection who were seen at the University of Mississippi Medical Center from January 1985 through December zzso We assessed the diagnoses and outcomes to determine the most effective use of CT, with or without zzso in the treatment of these zzso 

Clinical presentations were zzso along with the CT and zzso findings, for patients who had zzso with zzso zzso CT, and zzso findings were compared for accuracy in diagnosing 43 patients with zzso infections and 39 patients with zzso zzso 

For patients with zzso zzso most of whom had unilateral zzso the diagnostic accuracy was zzso for clinical assessment compared with zzso for zzso For patients with zzso zzso meningitis was the most common diagnosis, and zzso was more accurate zzso in determining the diagnosis than CT zzso or clinical findings zzso 

CT remains the standard zzso for diagnosing zzso but zzso frequently is necessary, especially for patients with zzso zzso Both diagnostic methods have improved the management and outcomes of patients who have zzso with zzso
