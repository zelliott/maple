To zzso evaluate prevalence of zzso contacts zzso at the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso patients with severe essential hypertension and 45 zzso subjects were matched for age, sex, and body mass zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging included zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso constructive interference in steady state zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All MR images were reviewed by two zzso who were blinded to the zzso status of zzso zzso and degree of zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated together with zzso of zzso structures on MR zzso zzso in prevalence of zzso among zzso and zzso subjects were tested for statistical significance zzso zzso by using zzso zzso 

Among zzso patients, 34 zzso of 43 showed zzso of zzso zzso at any location, and 14 zzso of 43 had zzso at the left zzso In controls zzso zzso 35 zzso of 45 showed zzso of zzso zzso and 17 zzso of 45 had zzso at left zzso zzso of zzso was not significantly different between both groups at any location of zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso offered better contrast resolution of neural and vascular structures and superior zzso of outer vascular zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is a frequent finding in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this study do not support zzso at left zzso as an zzso factor in essential zzso
