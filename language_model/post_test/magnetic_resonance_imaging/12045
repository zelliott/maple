zzso of space and motion zzso make magnetic resonance imaging during dynamic exercise zzso zzso stress with zzso can be used as an alternative to exercise for zzso zzso Forty patients with a history of angina and an abnormal exercise zzso were studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance wall motion imaging with a zzso zzso refocused zzso Images for both scans were obtained in the zzso horizontal and vertical long axis and short axis planes before and after pharmacological stress with zzso The zzso was divided into nine segments for direct comparison of zzso with wall zzso zzso were assessed visually into zzso zzso or reduced zzso and zzso or very reduced zzso After zzso there were zzso wall motion abnormalities in 24 zzso of 39 patients with coronary artery disease and 24 zzso of 36 patients with zzso zzso zzso The site of wall motion deterioration was always the site of a zzso zzso zzso zzso defects affecting more than two segments were always associated with wall motion deterioration but most single segment zzso defects were zzso by magnetic resonance zzso There was a significant correlation between detection of wall motion zzso the zzso severity of coronary artery disease, and the induction of chest pain by zzso There were no significant differences in zzso volume or ejection fraction changes after zzso between the groups with and without zzso zzso wall motion changes but the zzso magnetic resonance signal intensity of the zzso moving segments was significantly less than the signal intensity of the normal zzso In nine patients the change was apparent visually and it was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging of zzso wall motion abnormalities in patients with coronary artery disease is feasible during pharmacological stress with zzso and may be associated with a reduced magnetic resonance zzso The failure to show wall motion abnormalities in all cases of zzso zzso defects may be because the zzso was small or because zzso caused zzso defects in the absence of zzso zzso
