In addition to their deficit in overt face recognition, patients with zzso also have difficulties in matching zzso presented unfamiliar zzso Here we assessed the possibility that covert matching of faces was present in a case with zzso using zzso zzso zzso The participants zzso zzso and normal zzso were challenged with a zzso matching task, in which they decided whether two zzso presented photographs of unfamiliar faces represented the same zzso Only internal face features were used and the two faces in a pair differed in emotional zzso zzso failed to overtly match these zzso In contrast, the zzso revealed evidence of covert zzso If the two faces within a pair of stimuli depicted different zzso then the response to the second face contained an enhanced zzso compared to the situation where the identity of the faces was the zzso The zzso of the zzso was the same as a similar component found in zzso These results suggest that some cases with zzso have a covert ability to match unfamiliar faces, with similar zzso dynamics as controls, which in contrast with the idea that a generalized slowing of face processing occurs in all cases of zzso
