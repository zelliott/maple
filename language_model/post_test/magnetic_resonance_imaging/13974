Acute zzso artery zzso has particularly high mortality and zzso 

To determine the potential utility of advanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso methods, including zzso imaging, for the early management of patients with zzso artery zzso 

Case zzso 

Institute of zzso and Department of zzso Johann Wolfgang zzso University, Frankfurt, zzso 

In 4 patients with zzso of the zzso artery, zzso was performed, including zzso and zzso imaging zzso sequences and magnetic resonance zzso zzso in the short-term phase zzso zzso Three patients underwent zzso zzso Clinical outcome was obtained 10 days after symptom zzso 

The zzso was performed zzso to zzso hours after symptom onset and showed zzso artery zzso in all zzso The zzso revealed different patterns of zzso zzso In 2 patients, no or only small zzso could be zzso the remaining showed multiple and large zzso within the zzso circulation zzso zzso clinical status was severely impaired in all cases zzso scale score, zzso zzso was initiated in 3 patients, leading to successful zzso in zzso Clinical outcome was favorable in the 2 patients with small zzso zzso and successful zzso zzso scale score, zzso whereas it was worse in those with large zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In critically ill patients with acute zzso zzso the extent of zzso zzso involvement can be highly zzso Small zzso zzso seem to be associated with a favorable outcome if zzso is achieved with zzso This could potentially be the case independent of time from symptom zzso
