Reliable zzso of left zzso zzso parameters with the use of zzso zzso zzso has not been verified in patients with low ejection fraction zzso so zzso 

The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the agreement between magnetic resonance imaging zzso and CT in the assessment of the zzso volume and zzso in patients with low zzso scheduled for coronary artery bypass zzso zzso 

In 18 patients (2 women, 16 zzso with the zzso of zzso or lower scheduled for zzso cardiac zzso zzso and zzso CT were performed within 48 hours before zzso All zzso scans were zzso 5 CT exams were excluded due to poor zzso zzso agreement was assessed using the analysis of correlation and the zzso zzso 

The zzso volume zzso zzso volume zzso and stroke volume zzso were higher when measured by zzso compared with CT zzso zzso for zzso The zzso values measured by both methods were zzso We observed a strong positive correlation between zzso and CT in the measurement of zzso (R zzso zzso zzso (R zzso zzso and zzso (R zzso zzso but there was no correlation for zzso (R zzso zzso The zzso analysis confirmed that the zzso volumes assessed by zzso were higher compared with those determined by zzso There was also a trend for larger differences between the 2 methods in the measurement of zzso and zzso The zzso value was higher on zzso compared with CT but the difference was zzso 

In patients with coronary artery disease and low zzso the zzso values measured by zzso and CT are comparable, but the zzso zzso and zzso parameters cannot be used zzso due to their zzso on zzso
