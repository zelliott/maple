In an effort to delineate more homogeneous zzso zzso for genetic study, we evaluated 133 consecutive individuals referred to the University of Missouri zzso zzso Each index case underwent a diagnostic zzso including a clinical zzso examination, laboratory studies, brain zzso zzso and collection of zzso zzso and family zzso The zzso zzso who fulfilled zzso and CARS zzso diagnostic criteria were included in this zzso Six of 94 were diagnosed with a known genetic zzso Of the remaining 88 with apparently zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso normal, zzso zzso were clearly zzso and for zzso zzso the clinical zzso examination was zzso The percentage of zzso abnormal individuals is higher than generally thought and disagrees with the perception that children with zzso are usually normally zzso The zzso abnormal individuals were 10 times more likely to be diagnosed with a known genetic syndrome zzso zzso zzso and were more than twice as likely zzso zzso zzso to have structurally abnormal brain zzso than the zzso normal zzso Moreover, the male to female ratio correlated with the presence of physical zzso The total study group had a male to female ratio of zzso the zzso normal zzso defined on the basis of a normal physical examination, had a sex ratio of zzso and the normal zzso defined on the basis of both a normal physical examination and a structurally normal brain by zzso had a zzso sex zzso For the zzso abnormal zzso the sex ratio was zzso Since differences in sex ratio are presumably a reflection of differences in genetic zzso we zzso that the zzso normal zzso of individuals with zzso zzso is genetically different from the zzso abnormal individuals and that differences in the sex ratio in different zzso populations is one indicator of a population's genetic zzso
