It has been proposed that common codes for vision and action emerge from associations between an zzso production and simultaneous observation of zzso This typically first-person view of one's own action subsequently transfers to the zzso view when observing another zzso We tested zzso associations and the transfer from first-person to zzso perspective by comparing novel zzso sequences that were learned under three conditions: first, by being performed and simultaneously viewed from a first-person zzso second, by being performed but not zzso and third, by being seen from a first-person view without being zzso We then used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to compare the response to these three types of learned action sequences when they were presented from a zzso zzso zzso areas responded most strongly to sequences that were learned by simultaneously producing and observing the action zzso We also note an important asymmetry between vision and zzso Action sequences learned by performance alone, in the absence of vision, facilitated the emergence of zzso responses, whereas action sequences learned by viewing alone had comparably little zzso This dominance of action over vision supports the notion of zzso models of zzso zzso
