zzso zzso is an uncommon zzso tumor originating from zzso zzso Despite the development of electron zzso and zzso testing, the pathological diagnosis of this tumor is still difficult because of the wide range of zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso of this tumor and the pattern of contrast enhancement have not been well zzso The purpose of this report was to analyze the MR characteristics of zzso zzso The MR zzso pattern of contrast enhancement, and correlation with high-resolution zzso zzso zzso imaging were zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso were treated at zzso University Hospital and a related hospital during the past 25 zzso MR images taken in 12 patients and CT images taken in 9 patients with zzso confirmed zzso zzso were zzso zzso Compared with brain gray matter, 11 tumors were zzso on zzso images, 9 zzso and 2 zzso Eight tumors were zzso on zzso images, 3 zzso and 5 zzso although their appearance was less intense than that of zzso zzso enhancement was moderate in one case and marked in 10 of the 11 cases, 9 zzso and 2 zzso Nine of the 11 tumors showed smooth regular shaped zzso 2 of these tumors exhibited irregular zzso margins on zzso images, compared to the zzso zzso zzso Eight of the 11 tumors had clearly demarcated margins, while 3 of the 11 tumors did not exhibit zzso zzso Six of the 12 cases zzso exhibited zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso or zzso images successfully distinguished zzso from tumors in 4 cases whereas the CT images zzso zzso enhancement, particularly in the zzso plane, demonstrated zzso extension not apparent on the CT images in one zzso In most cases, zzso zzso are zzso on zzso images, zzso on zzso images, and show marked homogeneous enhancement with zzso regular margins upon zzso zzso Although the zzso diagnosis is based on zzso findings and MR features are zzso they may suggest an imaging diagnosis of zzso zzso when seen in the superior zzso zzso MR is superior to CT both in zzso the extent of the tumor and in making an imaging zzso
