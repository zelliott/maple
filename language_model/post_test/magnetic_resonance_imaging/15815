The authors analyzed the long-term results and zzso aspects of zzso zzso (with emphasis on zzso in a series of 30 patients who underwent zzso 

Data obtained in all 30 patients who underwent surgery for typical zzso zzso at the zzso institution between June 1994 and September 2005 were analyzed zzso The zzso index zzso was measured on zzso MR images and/or CT scans and compared between the early and last follow-up zzso All patients were women zzso years of age zzso 51 zzso zzso was the presenting symptom in 28 patients zzso and was observed on zzso MR images in all zzso The median duration of symptoms before surgery was 10 months zzso zzso 

Total zzso zzso Grade I) was not achieved in these patients because of the impossibility of zzso the zzso mater in the superior zzso zzso without causing significant zzso zzso zzso zzso Grade zzso was obtained in zzso of patients, and in 3 patients zzso a portion of the tumor was deliberately left in place because of extensive zzso zzso of the cavernous zzso and/or zzso muscles zzso Grade zzso No patient zzso zzso evaluation at a median follow-up of 61 months zzso zzso zzso showed no contrast enhancement in 14 patients zzso residual contrast enhancement without evolution in 13 zzso and recurrence (new contrast zzso in 3 zzso The zzso was improved at the first zzso follow-up zzso 12 zzso in 27 patients zzso and at the last zzso follow-up zzso 61 zzso in 28 patients zzso In the zzso between the first and final imaging zzso the zzso improved in only 8 patients zzso worsened in 15 patients zzso and showed no variation in 7 patients zzso 

zzso zzso are insidious tumors with slow zzso Even when zzso is not clinically zzso it is always present on zzso MR zzso Total zzso is not possible due to superior zzso zzso invasion, but zzso zzso zzso Grade zzso can assure long-term stability due to the zzso nature of most residual zzso zzso improves at early zzso zzso but may zzso again as time zzso
