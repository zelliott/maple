zzso sensory gating appears to be among the core features in zzso The sources of sensory gating however are largely zzso The aim of the current study was to identify these sources, with concurrent zzso and zzso zzso Twenty healthy male volunteers were tested with identical zzso suppression zzso in two separate zzso an zzso setting, and an zzso concurrent with zzso zzso The stimuli in the zzso paradigm consisted of weak electrical stimulation of the left median zzso The stimuli were presented in pairs with either 500 zzso or 1000 zzso zzso intervals zzso No difference was found between the zzso setting and the concurrent zzso and zzso zzso zzso suppression was, in both settings, found only in the 500 zzso trials, not in the 1000 zzso zzso zzso modeling resulted in 4 sources located in the zzso frontal zzso the zzso the zzso and primary zzso zzso These sources corresponded to significant zzso clusters located in the zzso frontal zzso the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso was higher in the trials with suppression, suggesting that these brain areas are involved in the zzso processes of zzso zzso The opposite was found for activity in the zzso frontal zzso and the zzso suggesting that these brain areas are involved in the generation of the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that zzso suppression can be reliably assessed inside an zzso zzso
