zzso measurement of zzso fluid zzso flow rate zzso zzso changes in the zzso environment and is thus clinically zzso We investigated the feasibility of correlation zzso zzso analysis for zzso zzso zzso in the cerebral aqueduct and cervical zzso space zzso to zzso zzso flow rate and net flow from data acquired by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

First, in phantom studies on zzso flow using a zzso MR imaging system, we investigated the accuracy of zzso analysis and used a statistical approach to determine an optimal threshold value for zzso the zzso zzso zzso Second, we performed phantom studies on constant flow with various flow rates to estimate the accuracy of low flow measurement by zzso Finally, in 6 healthy male volunteers aged 24 zzso 2 years, we estimated the zzso zzso areas, net flows, and peak flow rates in the cerebral aqueduct and cervical zzso using zzso analysis with the optimal zzso value determined in phantom zzso Three observers analyzed results to compare zzso of zzso analysis with that of manual zzso 

The optimal zzso value for zzso analysis was zzso for a zzso measuring 256 zzso zzso The zzso zzso area extracted by zzso analysis was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the net flow in the cerebral aqueduct was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cervical zzso zzso area was zzso zzso zzso zzso and net flow, zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso extraction was better by zzso analysis than manual zzso 

zzso analysis offers a quick and zzso method for zzso zzso zzso and calculating zzso flow zzso
