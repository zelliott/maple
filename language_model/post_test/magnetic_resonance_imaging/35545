We describe here the use of zzso zzso based particles as convertible zzso zzso As has been demonstrated with iron oxide zzso zzso oxide and zzso zzso particles can be zzso within zzso cells, being subsequently shuttled to zzso and/or zzso As intact zzso only zzso zzso contrast is zzso most often seen as dark contrast in zzso zzso zzso of zzso contrast is accomplished by the selective degradation of these particles within the zzso and zzso compartments of zzso Upon particle deconstruction in the zzso and zzso the dissolved zzso acts as a zzso agent, zzso bright contrast in zzso zzso This zzso of zzso contrast is demonstrated both in zzso in cells in culture, and also in zzso in rat zzso These particles are the potential building blocks for an entire class of new environmentally responsive zzso contrast zzso
