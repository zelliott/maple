The recently introduced zzso strip array zzso can significantly reduce scan times in parallel zzso by enabling the zzso of a large number of zzso strip detectors that are inherently zzso and are tuned by adjusting the strip length to zzso multiples of a zzso zzso in the presence of a ground plane and zzso zzso In addition, the more explicit spatial information embedded in the phase of the signals from the strip array is advantageous zzso to loop zzso for limiting zzso artifacts in parallel zzso However, losses in the detector as its natural resonance frequency approaches the zzso frequency (where the wavelength is long at zzso zzso may limit the zzso ratio zzso of the zzso Moreover, the zzso inherent zzso structure severely limits our ability to adjust detector geometry to zzso the performance for a specific organ system, as is done with loop zzso In this study we replaced the zzso zzso with discrete zzso which resulted in both zzso improvement and a zzso zzso zzso zzso whose dimensions can be zzso within broad constraints, for a given region of interest zzso and zzso zzso A detailed theoretical analysis of the zzso is zzso including its equivalent circuit, electromagnetic fields, zzso and zzso maps for parallel zzso Two different decoupling schemes for the zzso are zzso A zzso zzso zzso was built to test the theory with quantitative zzso on images obtained with parallel and conventional acquisition zzso
