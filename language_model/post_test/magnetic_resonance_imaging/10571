To zzso compare oral zzso zzso zzso rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging with zzso zzso fast zzso shot zzso MR and standard examinations in the evaluation of zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were zzso zzso patients with zzso disease underwent MR imaging after oral administration of a zzso contrast zzso zzso plain and zzso sequences and zzso sequences were performed before and after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso scoring of disease zzso Two zzso analyzed MR images for presence and extent of zzso disease zzso presence of strictures or other zzso and degree of local zzso MR findings were correlated with zzso zzso and clinical data zzso statistic and zzso rank correlation zzso 

zzso MR was zzso accurate, zzso sensitive, and zzso specific for detection of zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso images ranged from zzso for zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso MR enabled detection of 26 of 29 severe zzso 17 of 24 zzso zzso and all zzso and zzso zzso MR enabled detection of 20 of 29 severe zzso 16 of 24 zzso zzso and all zzso and zzso zzso leading to surgery were found in 12 zzso zzso these were assessed correctly with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso signal zzso of the wall and zzso correlated with zzso activity zzso zzso zzso r of zzso and zzso zzso zzso agreement was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso MR can depict zzso disease zzso and help assess mural and zzso inflammation with the same accuracy as zzso zzso zzso Combination of zzso zzso and zzso sequences is useful in the assessment of zzso zzso
