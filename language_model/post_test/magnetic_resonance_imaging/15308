To evaluate a zzso zzso zzso imaging sequence at zzso covering the zzso brain for the zzso of zzso water fraction zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso zzso 

zzso patients with, or at risk of, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 secondary progressive zzso zzso 13 clinically isolated syndrome zzso and 28 controls were zzso zzso zzso were acquired using a zzso zzso prep spiral imaging sequence and were fitted using a zzso least squares zzso The mean zzso within normal appearing white matter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

Mean zzso in white matter for controls was zzso Mean zzso was significantly reduced in zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso patients with disease duration zzso years zzso had lower zzso compared to zzso with disease duration zzso years zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso was reduced by zzso and zzso within both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso 

Using a zzso zzso sequence at zzso a significant decrease in the zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso and zzso relative to zzso The method was sensitive to detect white matter changes early in the disease zzso
