To determine any sex differences in zzso prevalence or severity of zzso a marker of white matter zzso in zzso and clinic zzso of zzso and in a systematic review of the zzso 

zzso sex differences were calculated for both CT and zzso in the Oxford zzso Study zzso and in an zzso clinic zzso We pooled odds ratios zzso for zzso in women vs men from published studies by zzso zzso zzso by patient characteristics zzso vs zzso and CT vs zzso 

Among 10 stroke studies (all zzso zzso was most frequent in women zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso with little zzso between studies zzso zzso zzso However, no such excess was seen in 10 reports of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Moreover, excess zzso in women on zzso in zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso was explained by their older age zzso OR zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso was more severe in older zzso 75) women zzso zzso p zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in zzso and clinic zzso However, zzso was independently associated with early mortality zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso suggesting that comparisons in older age groups will be biased by prior premature death of men with zzso Sex differences in severity of zzso were not addressed in previous zzso 

Previously reported excess zzso in women with zzso is likely to be zzso by age and apparently greater severity in older women is likely to be biased by premature death in men with zzso
