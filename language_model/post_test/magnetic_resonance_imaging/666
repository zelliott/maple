zzso and in particular functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso function relies on the ability to model the time course of brain responses zzso by odor zzso In this study we compared two templates of zzso brain zzso by comparing levels of correlation in regions critical to zzso processing with either a zzso template or a zzso template, derived from perception profiles acquired zzso during a simulated zzso zzso zzso signal was more correlated with the zzso template than with the zzso template in all zzso This effect was not observed when comparing correlations obtained with the exact same templates shifted in time by 12 zzso zzso the improvement due to the use of the zzso template was not only caused by a difference of shape between the zzso and the zzso template but was specifically related to the zzso stimulation zzso These results suggest that the zzso template better represents brain activity in response to zzso stimulation and might help improve data processing of zzso studies investigating zzso zzso
