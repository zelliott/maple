Brain zzso zzso deposition during normal aging is highlighted as an initial zzso event in the development of Alzheimer's zzso Many recent brain imaging studies have focused on areas zzso during cognitive tasks zzso default mode network zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso where the strength of functional coordination was more or less affected by cerebral zzso zzso In the present zzso zzso zzso study, to investigate whether regional zzso zzso zzso and zzso deposits seen in zzso elderly human subjects zzso zzso zzso are of zzso importance in changes of brain zzso coordination in zzso during normal aging, we measured cerebral zzso metabolism with zzso zzso deposits with zzso and regional cerebral blood flow during control and working memory tasks by zzso on the same zzso Data were analyzed using both region of interest and statistical zzso zzso Our results indicated that the amount of zzso deposits was zzso correlated with zzso similarity between zzso frontal and zzso zzso regions, and the lower similarity was associated with poorer working memory zzso In contrast, brain zzso metabolism was not related to this zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that traceable zzso deposition, but not zzso zzso in the brain plays an important role in occurrence of zzso zzso in zzso along with poor working memory in healthy elderly zzso
