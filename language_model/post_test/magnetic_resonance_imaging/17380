MR diffusion zzso imaging zzso allows the zzso of location and course of brain fiber zzso To obtain these results, however, special evaluation techniques are necessary in addition to image acquisition and zzso These include first the calculation of a preferential zzso direction of water molecules in each zzso and then the tracking of brain fibers or zzso of regions with similar fiber zzso In both cases, the procedures available thus far require the interactive definition of seed zzso In this paper, we propose a method to segment zzso groups of connected data points without the need of setting seed zzso This method is based first on the identification of all zzso of a brain volume with a sufficiently unique preferential zzso direction and with zzso For each selected zzso neighboring zzso are then identified that have a small zzso from the chosen preferential direction and can therefore be grouped with this zzso Finally, the largest partial volumes determined in this way are marked and color-coded to present them as three-dimensional zzso The present method resulting in a largely automatic subdivision of the white matter in the brain in a number of bilateral partial zzso
