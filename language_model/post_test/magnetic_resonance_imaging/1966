The purpose of this paper is to define and evaluate a zzso category for zzso zzso MR imaging of the breast based on the zzso zzso categories of the American College of zzso Using five evaluation criteria for MR findings zzso signal increase, zzso signal behavior, shape, border, and contrast material distribution within enhancing zzso 522 patients zzso zzso were zzso Scores were given from 0 to 8 points and classified into five categories zzso I: 0 points, zzso group II: 1-2 points, zzso group zzso 3 points, probably zzso group zzso 4-5 points, suspicious zzso group V: zzso points, highly suspicious for zzso to 265 focal zzso breast zzso in zzso breasts zzso group zzso These findings were correlated with zzso or zzso Additionally, this zzso was correlated to the contrast medium zzso within the zzso of the remaining 787 breasts without any focal zzso zzso group zzso Two hundred zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso zzso patient group zzso were classified into group I: zzso group II: zzso group zzso zzso group zzso zzso and group V: zzso zzso revealed 115 benign and zzso zzso tumors in these zzso Sixteen benign zzso were controlled by zzso zzso for the detection of zzso using the presented zzso zzso zzso was zzso and specificity was zzso Excluding cases of zzso zzso in zzso specificity increased to zzso Seven hundred zzso breasts without any focal zzso zzso zzso group zzso were classified into groups I or zzso zzso ( zzso or zzso ( zzso confirmed the diagnosis in zzso of these zzso zzso revealed, however, zzso tumors in the remaining two zzso The zzso of zzso based on a zzso analysis is very helpful in the interpretation of zzso zzso of the zzso The evaluation of all diagnostic imaging zzso however, is essential in determining the correct diagnosis and/or in deciding on the appropriate therapeutic zzso
