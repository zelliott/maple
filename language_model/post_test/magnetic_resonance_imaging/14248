We assessed the efficiency of zzso shifts across the horizontal and vertical axes of the visual field in a patient with zzso syndrome caused by bilateral zzso zzso This was performed using an adaptation of Posner's peripheral zzso zzso In contrast to normal controls and patients with unilateral zzso zzso previously reported, this patient did not benefit from cues directing attention to the left or right visual zzso She appeared to benefit only when the cues directed attention to the upper visual zzso This suggests a zzso in shifting attention that may occur following bilateral zzso zzso We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of the zzso zzso in zzso processes and for our understanding of the behavioral abnormalities observed in zzso zzso
