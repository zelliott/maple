To determine whether zzso brain zzso and cognitive profiles differ in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso disease zzso 

Using a zzso retrospective design, we compared zzso volume and cortical gray matter thickness in areas known to be affected by zzso in 105 patients with zzso and 125 healthy control zzso participants divided into zzso and zzso zzso Brain zzso and cognitive scores of the zzso groups were standardized to their respective zzso HC zzso and then zzso 

Several cognitive zzso zzso function, immediate memory, and zzso zzso were less abnormal in the very old with zzso than in the young old with zzso Similarly, the very old with zzso showed less severe cortical thinning than the young old with zzso in the left zzso zzso cortex, right lateral zzso cortex, and bilateral zzso zzso and in overall cortical zzso This effect is partially explained by an age-related decrease in cortical thickness in these brain regions in the HC zzso 

The typical pattern of zzso cognitive and zzso changes seen in the young old appear to be less salient in the very zzso Thus, mild cases of zzso in the very old may go zzso if one expects to see the zzso pattern and severity of cognitive or brain changes that occur in the young old with zzso These results underscore the importance of interpreting zzso test performance and zzso brain measures in reference to the zzso zzso
