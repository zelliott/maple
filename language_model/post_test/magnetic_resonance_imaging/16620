The existence of normal sleep in patients in a zzso state is still a matter of zzso Previous zzso sleep studies in patients with disorders of consciousness did not differentiate patients in a zzso state from patients in a minimally conscious zzso Using zzso zzso sleep recordings, 11 patients with disorders of consciousness (six in a minimally conscious state, five in a zzso zzso were studied to correlate the zzso changes associated with sleep to zzso changes in vigilance zzso eye closure and muscle zzso All minimally conscious patients showed clear zzso changes associated with decreases in zzso zzso In the five minimally conscious patients showing sustained zzso sleep zzso we identified several zzso characteristics typical of normal zzso In particular, all minimally conscious patients showed an alternating zzso eye zzso eye movement sleep pattern and a zzso decline of zzso slow wave activity through the zzso In contrast, for most patients in a zzso state, while preserved zzso sleep was observed, the zzso patterns remained virtually unchanged during periods with the eyes closed compared to periods of zzso zzso zzso open and muscle zzso No slow wave sleep or rapid eye movement sleep stages could be identified and no zzso regulation of zzso slow wave activity was observed over the zzso zzso In conclusion, we observed zzso but no zzso sleep wake patterns in patients in a zzso state, while there were zzso patterns of sleep in patients in a minimally conscious zzso These results shed light on the relationship between sleep zzso and the level of consciousness in severely zzso zzso We suggest that the study of sleep and zzso regulation of slow wave activity may provide a complementary tool for the assessment of brain function in minimally conscious state and zzso state zzso
