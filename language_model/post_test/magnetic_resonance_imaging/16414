Although zzso therapy zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso represents an important step forward in acute zzso stroke zzso management, there is a clear need to identify high-risk zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of quantitative zzso zzso MR imaging in patients with zzso treated with and without zzso We hypothesized that zzso would increase zzso and that zzso MR imaging can be used to predict the risk of zzso transformation zzso 

zzso patients with zzso were examined within a mean of zzso hours of documented symptom zzso zzso MR imaging was performed as part of our zzso zzso zzso zzso in the stroke zzso were estimated for all patients, and the relationship between zzso and both zzso and zzso was investigated by using Student zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso were zzso for predicting zzso from zzso 

The occurrence rate of zzso for patients who received zzso and those who did not was zzso and zzso zzso Assessment of zzso in the zzso revealed significant differences between those who zzso and those who did not zzso zzso zzso as well as between zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated a zzso threshold of zzso zzso zzso with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso 

The results of this study indicate that zzso is able to identify patients at higher risk of zzso and may allow use of zzso imaging rather than time from onset of symptoms to guide treatment zzso
