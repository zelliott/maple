To evaluate the feasibility of molecular cartilage zzso in finger zzso 

Delayed zzso zzso of the cartilage zzso using a variable flip angle approach zzso was performed for the zzso zzso zzso II and III in nine healthy volunteers and zzso patients with zzso arthritis zzso The cartilage thickness was zzso Additionally, zzso was performed on zzso zzso zzso zzso in two patients with finger zzso zzso 

the zzso index of the four evaluated cartilage areas was significantly decreased in zzso patients compared to healthy zzso The zzso index of zzso II zzso cartilage was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in healthy zzso The zzso zzso II cartilage zzso index was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso III were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in healthy subjects and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in healthy zzso Age and cartilage thickness were not significantly zzso In zzso zzso of finger zzso patients, low zzso zzso were noted, compared to the zzso 

The zzso of finger zzso is feasible in patients with zzso and finger zzso zzso normal cartilage shows significantly decreased zzso values in zzso pointing towards cartilage zzso on a molecular zzso Further studies are needed to establish the usefulness of this technique for early diagnosis, prognosis and therapy zzso
