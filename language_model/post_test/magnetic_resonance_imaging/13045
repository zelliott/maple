To determine the neural mechanisms underlying zzso mood change and zzso effects on circuits involved in mood zzso and affective zzso 

In a zzso zzso crossover study, 16 healthy male volunteers received typhoid vaccination or saline zzso injection in two experimental zzso zzso questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 2 and 3 zzso Two hours after injection, participants performed an implicit emotional face perception task during functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso focused on zzso zzso of zzso mood change and affective processing within regions responsive to emotional expressions and implicated in the zzso of zzso 

zzso but not zzso injection produced an inflammatory response zzso by increased circulating zzso and significant mood reduction at 3 zzso zzso mood deterioration correlated with enhanced activity within zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso (a region implicated in the zzso of zzso during emotional face zzso Furthermore, zzso mood change reduced connectivity of zzso to amygdala, zzso prefrontal cortex, nucleus zzso and superior zzso zzso which was modulated by peripheral zzso 

zzso mood deterioration is reflected in changes in zzso activity and functional connectivity during evoked responses to emotional zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso suggesting a common zzso basis for major depressive disorder and zzso mood change and zzso
