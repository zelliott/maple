zzso estimates of cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso using magnetic resonance imaging can have profound implications for the understanding of brain zzso activity as well as the investigation of cerebrovascular zzso In this study, five normal volunteers were zzso All images were acquired on a zzso zzso T scanner zzso Medical Systems zzso zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso was obtained in zzso with a dynamic imaging approach and the acquired images were zzso with the singular value decomposition method zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso echo sequence was employed to provide MR estimates of oxygen extraction fraction zzso in zzso zzso an absolute measure of MR cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso zzso was obtained in all subjects by taking the product of zzso and zzso A mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso g and zzso zzso zzso zzso g was obtained for gray matter and white matter, respectively, suggesting that the gray matter zzso more oxygen than white matter under normal zzso zzso These results yield a gray matter to white matter zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso which is comparable to the reported values in the zzso More studies are needed to further improve on the accuracy as well as zzso the required data acquisition time so that the proposed approaches can be zzso in a routine clinical zzso
