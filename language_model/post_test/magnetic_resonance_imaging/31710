The increased zzso effects and high zzso ratio at zzso T enable imaging of the brain using the phase of the magnetic resonance zzso This study describes and evaluates a robust method for calculating phase images from zzso echo zzso zzso The zzso scans were acquired at zzso T using an zzso receive zzso at spatial resolutions up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The entire zzso T protocol took less than 10 zzso Data were acquired from zzso subjects including clinical patients with multiple sclerosis zzso or brain zzso The phase images were zzso using a fully automated phase zzso zzso that combined the data from the different zzso The technique was used to create the first phase images of zzso patients at any field strength and the first phase images of brain tumor patients above zzso zzso The clinical images showed novel contrast in zzso plaques and depicted zzso and abnormal zzso in brain tumors with zzso resolution and zzso
