Although 8-10 zzso of external radiation therapy for zzso associated zzso zzso has achieved high response rates, the responses were transient with only zzso of patients retaining zzso control at median follow-up procedures of zzso zzso zzso for failures after 8-10 zzso has also been zzso Having shown that 24 zzso of external radiation therapy for benign zzso zzso produced more durable zzso control than 8-10 zzso we now report on longer follow-up periods on a group of patients receiving 24 zzso 

Twenty zzso patients with clinical and zzso evidence of zzso zzso of the zzso were treated with 24 zzso of external radiation therapy using daily zzso zzso zzso parallel opposed technique and 6 zzso photons were used in 19 patients, and unilateral electron treatment was performed for one zzso 

With a mean follow-up period of 24 months, the zzso control appears zzso We have had no late failures past 24 zzso Two patients have complained of modest zzso There was no correlation with size of the zzso and eventual zzso zzso 

zzso zzso produces durable zzso control for zzso associated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso after 2 years are uncommon and the side effects have been zzso
