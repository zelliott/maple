zzso evaluation of zzso zzso may be useful in zzso progressive zzso zzso zzso from Parkinson disease zzso however, this finding is not specific of zzso and quantitative zzso are not always zzso We determined whether an abnormal superior zzso profile zzso or zzso zzso is a more practical diagnostic zzso for zzso 

MR imaging studies of 25 patients with zzso and 27 with zzso were reviewed by means of five zzso zzso superior profile on zzso zzso images, zzso zzso zzso abnormal zzso zzso abnormal zzso zzso zzso or zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso We also measured the zzso diameter of the zzso on zzso zzso sections at the level of the superior zzso 

The finding of an abnormal superior profile of the zzso had zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso specificity but poor sensitivity zzso Only zzso of patients with zzso and zzso of those with zzso had abnormal zzso zzso zzso none had zzso zzso With zzso the average zzso diameter was smaller than that with zzso but an important overlap was zzso Reader zzso was lower for the zzso superior profile sign zzso of 52 zzso this was similar for zzso zzso zzso of 52 zzso and higher for zzso zzso (16 of 52 zzso 

An abnormal superior profile of the zzso zzso the distinction of zzso from zzso and may support the clinical differential diagnosis of zzso
