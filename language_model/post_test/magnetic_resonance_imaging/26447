We investigated which zzso of zzso can be detected by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Five subjects were scanned with a zzso Vision zzso T zzso Motion, zzso and zzso zzso were presented with alternating control conditions containing one of the two features of the zzso We find a zzso zzso in zzso for all subjects and all stimuli and conclude that neural mechanisms exist as early as in the primary visual zzso that are sensitive to zzso zzso
