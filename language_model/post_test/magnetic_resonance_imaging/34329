This experiment examined the participation of the auditory zzso of the zzso lobe in the perception and retention of rhythmic zzso Four patient groups were tested on a paradigm contrasting reproduction of auditory and visual zzso those with right or left anterior zzso lobe zzso which included zzso zzso zzso the region of primary auditory zzso zzso and zzso and patients with right or left anterior zzso lobe zzso which did not include zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso extent in zzso using an zzso zzso map indicated that, in the majority of subjects, the zzso was confined to the anterior secondary auditory zzso located on the zzso extent of zzso On the rhythm reproduction task, zzso patients were impaired in retention of auditory but not visual zzso particularly when accurate reproduction of stimulus zzso was zzso In contrast, zzso patients as well as both zzso and zzso patients were relatively zzso on this zzso None of the patient groups was impaired in the ability to make an adequate motor zzso Further, they were zzso when using a zzso response mode, indicating that they were able to adequately differentiate the stimulus zzso and, when given an alternative method of zzso to retain zzso Taken together, these results point to a specific role for the right anterior secondary auditory zzso in the retention of a precise analogue representation of auditory tonal zzso
