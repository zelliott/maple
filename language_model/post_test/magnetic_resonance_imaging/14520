The comparison of recent and remote autobiographical memories is often zzso by qualitative disparities across memories of different ages, such as zzso In this study, ten individuals zzso collected audio recordings that were used to cue memories of recent zzso month old) and remote zzso year old) everyday zzso Because the retrieval cues were recorded at the time of event, they were highly zzso Although remote events did not differ in novelty, importance, or emotional change at the time at the time of zzso half of the cues for these events induced retrieval comparable in zzso to recent events (all of which were vividly zzso Recent and remote vivid memories were associated with a neural pattern that included right zzso left zzso and zzso regions that were active early in the retrieval zzso zzso remote memories were associated with a later onset of a bilateral distributed pattern that included regions in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso connectivity analysis indicated that the left anterior zzso was zzso with bilateral zzso zzso and zzso regions for vivid memories zzso of memory zzso early in the retrieval period, whereas zzso zzso alongside recent zzso showed later and broader zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The absence of a significant difference between the recent and remote vivid memories may be due to insufficient power to detect potential subtle differences between these zzso Nonetheless, there was evidence for different patterns of zzso connectivity for remote memories and recent zzso irrespective of zzso These findings suggest that while there is a functional shift in zzso connectivity that is associated with memory age when very recent events are used, zzso is strongly associated with both zzso and functional connectivity patterns irrespective of memory zzso
