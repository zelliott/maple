Evaluating zzso function, assessing zzso zzso areas and detecting zzso viability are necessary diagnostic information for guiding further therapy in patients with zzso The aim of this study was to show feasibility and safety of a compiled zzso enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso protocol providing the above mentioned diagnostic possibilities and to demonstrate its zzso in daily zzso 

zzso patients with angina were screened on a zzso zzso zzso zzso images in short and long axis orientation were acquired for each zzso zzso zzso of a zzso contrast agent zzso zzso were measured after three minutes of stress with zzso infusion zzso zzso 10 zzso after a second zzso injection of contrast agent zzso zzso zzso sequences were acquired for the detection of zzso zzso 

We enrolled zzso patients referred for zzso for detection or exclusion of zzso heart zzso One patient experienced a major complication due to hyperventilation followed by grand zzso zzso In zzso zzso patients minor zzso such as mild chest pain or zzso zzso temporarily and zzso zzso block zzso or zzso zzso could be observed under zzso zzso zzso in more than one zzso segment and affecting more than 1/3 of the zzso wall diameter could be detected in 1972 zzso zzso zzso zzso with limited duration could be shown in 897 zzso zzso In zzso zzso patients zzso could be zzso zzso could be seen in zzso zzso zzso 

This compiled zzso protocol is suitable for detection or exclusion of zzso heart disease in an zzso zzso We showed zzso zzso and safety of our zzso zzso may serve as a useful surrogate for zzso zzso prior to invasive coronary zzso in many zzso
