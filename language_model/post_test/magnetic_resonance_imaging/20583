zzso altered zzso cortical activity can be associated with short-term changes in motor learning that take place in the course of hours, but it is unknown whether it can be correlated to long-term recovery from transient peripheral motor diseases, and if so, whether it occurs zzso in related brain zzso Here we show in a zzso zzso study of patients with unilateral Bell's zzso that increases in zzso zzso activity follow the recovery course of facial motor functions over at least one and a half zzso These findings hold true for changes in brain activity related to both oral and zzso zzso even though these processes are zzso zzso by unilateral and bilateral brain zzso zzso zzso of zzso musculature, which was studied for control, does not show any change in zzso activity over zzso The localized changes in zzso activities following zzso of facial functions occur zzso with increases in activity of the facial region in the zzso primary motor zzso suggesting that the zzso acts together with the cerebral zzso in long-term adaptation to transient pathological zzso zzso
