zzso shadows can be salient depth cues in three-dimensional zzso zzso Using a motion illusion in which a ball is perceived to roll in depth on the bottom or to flow in the front plane depending on the slope of the trajectory of its cast shadow, we investigated cortical mechanisms underlying zzso vision based on cast shadows using zzso zzso When modified versions of the original illusion, in which the slope of the shadow trajectory zzso slope) was changed in 5 steps from the same one as the ball trajectory to the zzso were presented to participants, their perceived ball trajectory shifted gradually from rolling on the bottom to floating in the front plane as the change of the shadow zzso This observation suggests that the perception of the ball trajectory in this illusion is strongly affected by the motion of the cast zzso In the zzso study, cortical activity during observation of the movies of the illusion was zzso We found that the bilateral zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso showed zzso related to the perception of the ball trajectory induced by the cast shadows in the zzso Of these areas, it was suggested that the right zzso may be involved in the zzso of the ball trajectory by the given spatial relation between the ball and the zzso Our present results suggest that the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso may be involved in zzso vision by cast zzso
