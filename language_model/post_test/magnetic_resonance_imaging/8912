The ability to quickly decide on the nature of unexpected environmental changes is vital for zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that the zzso zzso plays an important role in the rapid assignment of motivational significance and goal relevance to environmental zzso However, its putative role as a central part of a network involved in the zzso of zzso selection, zzso when significant environmental changes occur unexpectedly or outside of zzso focus, remains to be zzso zzso we used functional magnetic resonance imaging with a subsequent zzso interaction analysis to reveal the functional connectivity of the right zzso zzso zzso zzso in a context, in which subjects had to adjust zzso behavior to zzso relevant events presented outside of the current zzso zzso As expected, an increased functional interaction between zzso and regions involved in the zzso of selective attention zzso nucleus and inferior zzso zzso and processing of zzso zzso zzso zzso could be observed when zzso but significant changes were relevant for zzso Moreover, a positive correlation between level of accuracy and an increased functional connectivity between zzso and zzso zzso suggested that a zzso signal from zzso may have increased visual processing of the relevant but currently unattended stimulus zzso These data provide evidence that the interplay between the zzso and these regions zzso a mechanism by which organisms rapidly achieve voluntary control of zzso resources to deal with zzso significant changes that occur outside of current zzso zzso
