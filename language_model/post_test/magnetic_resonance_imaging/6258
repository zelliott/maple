In a controlled prospective study, 33 rabbits were used to compare the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso to zzso in diagnosing zzso infection of the zzso zzso A suitable zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was injected into a test level while a similar volume of sterile culture medium was injected into a control disc in each zzso Plain zzso zzso and zzso bone images then were performed at regular intervals after zzso The imaging studies were interpreted blind, as was the final zzso zzso Five animals died of respiratory complications following zzso In the remaining 28 animals, 23 developed infection at the test level, and four developed infection at the control zzso zzso resonance imaging was found to be more sensitive than zzso in diagnosing zzso particularly in the early stages of the zzso The overall results showed zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso and accuracy of zzso There were two zzso results and one zzso In contrast, zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso and accuracy of zzso There were two zzso and 16 zzso zzso Plain zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso and accuracy of zzso There were two zzso and five zzso zzso The zzso appearance of zzso was characteristic from an early stage in the disease, and preceded the changes on zzso and plain zzso by several days in the majority of zzso
