zzso the degree of contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance zzso is affected by magnetic field zzso The authors conducted this study to compare the degree of MR contrast enhancement between zzso zzso zzso and zzso T in VX zzso of zzso 

In 12 rabbits with zzso tumors, both zzso T and zzso T MR imaging was performed within 1 day before and after intravenous injection of zzso zzso Each rabbit received an initial standard dose zzso zzso followed by and additional standard dose zzso double zzso during the MR study at each field zzso The degree of contrast enhancement in the zzso tumors was assessed zzso 

With standard and double dose studies, overall mean tumor and muscle zzso ratio was higher at zzso T than zzso T by zzso and zzso zzso The double dose study showed higher zzso ratio than the standard dose study at both field zzso 

zzso indicate that the effect of contrast enhancement increases with field zzso
