A new apparatus has been developed that zzso an animal zzso arrangement for small animals with an actively zzso dual zzso zzso zzso system for in zzso anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging of small animals at zzso zzso The zzso zzso features an zzso zzso line zzso that, in conjunction with a segmented outer copper zzso forms a zzso electromagnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso and active zzso is achieved through zzso zzso and a zzso zzso for each zzso zzso These components along with zzso chokes zzso and blocking zzso are placed on two printed circuit boards zzso whose copper coated ground planes form the front and back of the volume zzso and are therefore an integral part of the zzso zzso The magnetic resonance signal response is received with a zzso zzso surface zzso that can be zzso with respect to the zzso zzso The conscious animal is immobilized through a mechanical arrangement that consists of a zzso body tube and a head zzso This zzso has a zzso holder with a mouthpiece and position screws to receive and restrain the head of the zzso The apparatus is intended to perform anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging in conscious animals such as mice, rats, zzso and zzso zzso images acquired from fully conscious rats in a zzso T zzso 40 zzso bore animal scanner underscore the feasibility of this approach and bode well to extend this system to the imaging of other zzso
