To investigate functional connectivity of the visual zzso network zzso in zzso zzso multiple sclerosis zzso patients with and without previous zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty zzso zzso patients, 16 without zzso and 14 with zzso previous zzso and 15 zzso and zzso healthy controls zzso underwent a zzso zzso including automated zzso and retinal nerve fiber layer zzso zzso as well as an zzso zzso including structural and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso connectivity of the zzso was evaluated by independent component analysis zzso Regional gray matter zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso A correlation analysis was performed between zzso results and clinical, zzso and structural zzso zzso 

Compared to zzso patients with zzso showed a reduced functional connectivity in the zzso visual cortex, zzso Compared to zzso zzso patients revealed a region of stronger functional connectivity in the zzso cortex, at the level of right lateral middle zzso zzso as well as a region of reduced functional connectivity at the level of right inferior zzso zzso These latter changes correlated with the number of previous zzso All detected zzso changes did not zzso with regional gray matter zzso 

zzso zzso patients show a significant functional zzso in the zzso zzso patients recovered from a previous ON show a complex reorganization of the zzso including an increased functional connectivity at the level of zzso visual zzso
