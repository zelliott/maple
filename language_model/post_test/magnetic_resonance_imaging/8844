Signal fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso can result from a number of sources that may have a zzso zzso or instrumental zzso To determine the relative contribution of these sources, we recorded zzso zzso and zzso signals simultaneously with zzso in human volunteers at rest with their eyes zzso zzso technology was used including high magnetic field (7 zzso a zzso detector array and high-resolution (3 zzso zzso zzso We investigated the relative contribution of zzso noise and other sources of zzso to the observed zzso signal fluctuations both in the visual zzso and in the whole brain gray zzso The following sources of zzso were evaluated zzso zzso drifts due to scanner instability, effects correlated with respiratory and cardiac cycles, effects due to zzso in the respiratory flow rate and cardiac rate, and other sources, tentatively attributed to spontaneous zzso zzso We found that zzso drifts are the most significant source of zzso signal fluctuations zzso signal change in the visual cortex, zzso zzso followed by spontaneous zzso activity zzso zzso noise zzso effects due to zzso in zzso rates zzso zzso heartbeat zzso and correlated with zzso cycles zzso We suggest the selection and use of four lagged zzso noise zzso as an effective model to explain the zzso related to fluctuations in the rates of zzso volume change and cardiac zzso Our results also indicate that, compared to the whole brain gray matter, the visual zzso has higher sensitivity to changes in both the rate of zzso and the spontaneous zzso zzso Under the conditions of this study, spontaneous zzso activity is one of the major contributors to the measured zzso signal zzso increasing almost twofold relative to earlier experiments under similar conditions at 3 zzso
