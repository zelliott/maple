zzso To determine whether functional MR can reliably map functional deficits in patients with stroke in the primary visual zzso zzso to determine whether functional MR can reliably map zzso zzso and zzso to determine whether functional MR can give any additional diagnostic information beyond conventional zzso 

Seven patients who had had a stroke in their primary visual system were examined using two functional MR zzso zzso dynamic zzso contrast imaging, and zzso cortical zzso mapping during zzso visual zzso zzso of relative cerebral blood volume and zzso were created and compared with visual field examinations and conventional zzso images on a zzso basis in five of these zzso 

Visual field mapping matched with both zzso conventional images and zzso mapping of 16 of 18 zzso In two zzso the zzso maps detected abnormalities that were present on the visual field examination but not present on the zzso images nor on the relative cerebral blood volume zzso which may indicate abnormal function without frank zzso In addition, the zzso maps demonstrated decreased zzso in zzso zzso and had normal zzso signal and relative cerebral blood volume but was adjacent to zzso primary cortex, mapping in zzso how stroke in one location can affect the function of distant zzso 

zzso MR techniques can accurately map functional and zzso deficits and thereby provide additional clinically useful zzso Additional studies will be needed to determine the zzso utility of functional MR in stroke zzso
