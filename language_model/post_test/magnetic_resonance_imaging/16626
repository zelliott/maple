zzso networks are usually zzso with zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging using zzso zzso zzso zzso however, the selection of the seed locations is zzso Recently, we proposed local functional connectivity density mapping zzso an zzso zzso to locate highly connected brain regions zzso zzso Here, we used the functional hubs obtained from local zzso to determine the functional networks of the resting state in zzso healthy subjects without a zzso hypotheses on seed zzso In addition, we zzso the global functional connectivity zzso Seven networks covering zzso of the gray matter volume were zzso Four major cortical hubs zzso zzso cingulate, inferior zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso were linked to 4 cortical networks zzso mode, zzso attention, zzso and zzso Three zzso networks were associated to the major zzso hubs zzso thalamus, and zzso The networks differed in their resting activity and zzso The higher zzso and overlap of zzso networks was associated to higher contribution of short-range functional connectivity in zzso and zzso Whereas cortical local zzso hubs were also hubs of long-range zzso which corroborates the key role of cortical hubs in network architecture, zzso hubs had minimal long-range zzso The significant zzso among functional networks may zzso their zzso to zzso
