zzso zzso staging is crucial in zzso cancer for deciding patient management because the administration of zzso therapy depends on zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso are used zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

To zzso compare the performance of zzso and zzso in the zzso staging of zzso cancer in a large series of zzso 

Prospective and comparative zzso 

zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso proven zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were performed in all patients by a different operator unaware of the results of the other zzso 

zzso clinical, zzso and zzso variables were zzso zzso examination of the surgical zzso was used as the criterion zzso 

zzso patients (54 men and 36 women with a mean age of 68 zzso 12 years; range zzso zzso constitute the final sample of this zzso Most of the tumors were stages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty of them zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso The accuracy of T staging was very similar for zzso and zzso for stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso not zzso and stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso not zzso zzso was not able to zzso any zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso all T4 zzso The zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso of the tumor zzso correlated with T staging on zzso The accuracy of zzso for N staging was higher than that of zzso although the difference did not reach statistical significance zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When performing the zzso analysis to assess the reasons for this difference, the presence of a zzso tumor was the only zzso significantly related to a poorer performance of zzso in N zzso 

The small number of early and locally advanced zzso 

zzso and zzso have similar accuracy in the T and N staging in zzso zzso The presence of zzso and zzso zzso is zzso associated with accuracy for either zzso or zzso
