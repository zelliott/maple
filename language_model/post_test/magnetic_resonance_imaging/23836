To evaluate the response to zzso zzso of five patients who failed an average three treatments with multiple other therapeutic agents, using serial monthly zzso zzso 

Five patients with zzso multiple sclerosis zzso and documented zzso disease activity were started on monthly pulse intravenous zzso at a dose of 1 zzso zzso was administered without an induction phase according to the protocol similar to the treatment of lupus zzso The five patients were followed with monthly zzso and clinical evaluation for a mean of 28 zzso 

All the patients showed a rapid reduction in the zzso zzso frequency and in three patients there was a decrease in the zzso zzso load within the first 5 months after starting zzso zzso The administration of zzso during overnight hospitalization was safe and well zzso 

These findings suggest that aggressive zzso therapy may be useful in some rapidly deteriorating zzso patients and further controlled study should be considered in order to full evaluate this type of treatment as a potential therapy in zzso
