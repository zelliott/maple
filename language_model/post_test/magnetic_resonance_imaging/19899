Several findings indicate that practice in working memory tasks leads to signal decreases in zzso zzso However, the precise dynamics underlying these signal decreases and how they are correlated with improvements in behavioral performance are still matters of zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess the cerebral zzso of the zzso transition from controlled to automatic processing for the retrieval of information maintained in working memory zzso zzso signal decreases and increases were modeled as zzso of zzso In addition, a zzso zzso analysis on the change in zzso signal for two a zzso hypothesized prefrontal regions zzso zzso and the change in behavioral performance was conducted to examine the relationship between zzso changes in cerebral zzso and zzso We found exponential zzso signal decreases mainly in the right superior frontal zzso zzso zzso the middle frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso the left zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso part of the right anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso An exponential signal increase was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso adjacent to the corpus zzso In addition, there was a correlation between the zzso change in zzso signal in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso change in behavioral zzso These results suggest that the transition from controlled to automatic working memory processing is associated with exponential signal decreases in zzso zzso The zzso changes in brain zzso patterns could be attributed to enhanced efficiency of information processing as a result of cognitive zzso
