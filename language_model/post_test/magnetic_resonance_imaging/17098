Better methods are required to identify patients with zzso carotid zzso zzso at risk of future zzso Two potential markers of high risk are zzso plaque zzso on carotid ultrasound and zzso signals zzso in the zzso middle cerebral artery on zzso zzso ultrasound zzso We explored the zzso value of a score based on these 2 measures in the zzso zzso international zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 435 recruited subjects with zzso zzso had baseline ultrasound images and zzso data zzso zzso were zzso followed up for 2 zzso 

A total of zzso zzso plaques were graded as zzso zzso zzso at baseline was associated with an increased risk of zzso stroke alone zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A combined variable of plaque zzso and zzso zzso at baseline was associated with a markedly increased risk of zzso stroke alone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso This association remained significant after controlling for risk factors, degree of carotid zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso assessed using a simple, and clinically zzso visual rating scale predicts zzso stroke risk in zzso The combination of zzso detection and plaque zzso allows a greater prediction than either measure alone and identifies a high-risk group with an annual stroke risk of zzso and a low-risk group with a risk of zzso per zzso This risk zzso may prove useful in the selection of patients with zzso for zzso
