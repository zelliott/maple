zzso studies have suggested that zzso zzso deposition was only zzso related to the degree of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease zzso The development of zzso zzso for in zzso PET imaging has greatly facilitated the assessment of this zzso 

The objective of the present study was to provide an overview of our current knowledge regarding the relationship between zzso deposition and episodic memory deficits in zzso elderly and in patients with mild cognitive impairment or zzso 

Information was obtained both from studies comparing memory performance in individuals with high Pittsburgh compound B zzso and those with low zzso and from studies performing correlation analyses between memory performance and zzso retention considered as a continuous zzso 

Previous studies assessing the relationship between memory and global zzso zzso reported conflicting findings, and overall suggest that this link is weak, probably zzso and zzso only in early zzso Assessing the relationship with regional instead of global zzso zzso we found a specific relationship between episodic memory deficits and zzso zzso zzso independent from zzso zzso in the zzso stage of the zzso 

There is a relationship between regional zzso deposition and episodic memory deficits in the zzso stage of zzso
