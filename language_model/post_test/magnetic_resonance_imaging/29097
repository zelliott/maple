The zzso zzso design of a spiral zzso trajectory requires the solution of a differential zzso thereby making real-time prescription difficult on scanners with limited zzso zzso This study describes a zzso approximate solution for zzso zzso spiral zzso that closely matches the exact zzso Both slew zzso and zzso regimes are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
