To zzso evaluate whether dynamic zzso zzso zzso can assess zzso within zzso and predicts clinical outcome in combination with the clinical zzso zzso System zzso 

zzso patients with zzso of zzso on CT underwent zzso zzso zzso Signal intensity zzso obtained from a zzso analysis were subdivided into those with more intense contrast agent zzso within the zzso than in adjacent muscle zzso zzso and those with similar or less contrast zzso The zzso parameters of the zzso model K zzso K zzso zzso and V e were correlated with union at CT 1 year later zzso 

Despite inserted zzso material, zzso parameters could be evaluated in 57 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso as an indicator of good outcome was zzso % compared to zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a significant impact of zzso on outcome zzso odds zzso At first examination, median zzso zzso area under the enhancement zzso for the ratio zzso was zzso in patients with good outcome compared with zzso in zzso zzso K zzso K zzso and zzso within the zzso were not significantly different initially zzso or 1 year later zzso 

zzso zzso can assess zzso in fracture zzso A zzso zzso zzso with good zzso 

zzso Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging can assess zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fractures appear better at zzso CT than poorly zzso zzso zzso zzso healing after zzso or zzso drugs fundamentally requires zzso zzso zzso zzso predicts treatment outcome better than the clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is clinically feasible to predict treatment outcome in zzso zzso
