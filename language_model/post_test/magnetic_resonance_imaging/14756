zzso with zzso zzso zzso are at risk of cerebral blood flow zzso Our objective was to describe the relationship between zzso and zzso injury in zzso 

zzso with zzso had zzso monitoring with the zzso volume index zzso during therapeutic hypothermia, zzso and the first zzso of zzso The zzso zzso range of mean zzso blood pressure zzso with best zzso zzso was zzso The percentage of time spent with zzso below zzso and zzso in zzso from zzso were zzso zzso received brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso d after zzso zzso were coded as no, mild, or zzso injury in five zzso 

zzso identified zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso during hypothermia, zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso injury in zzso zzso white matter, zzso zzso and zzso spent a greater proportion of time with zzso below zzso during zzso than zzso with no or mild zzso zzso with zzso injury in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had greater zzso zzso below zzso during zzso than zzso without zzso 

Maintaining zzso within or above zzso may reduce the risk of zzso injuries in zzso zzso
