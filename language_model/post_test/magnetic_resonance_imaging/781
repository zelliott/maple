zzso fusion is a gradual process of graft zzso and tissue formation, zzso resulting in a bone bridge between two adjacent zzso zzso Initially, zzso tissue and cartilage are formed, which subsequently are replaced by bone through the process of zzso zzso When cages and/or their contents are made of zzso zzso like zzso or zzso zzso there is a simultaneous process of implant degradation, which is eventually accompanied by reactions in the surrounding zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the use of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for monitoring tissue zzso spinal fusion, cage degradation, and eventually tissue reactions as a function of zzso 

zzso zzso segments obtained in 14 zzso with 3, 6, and 12 months of follow up zzso four, and seven animals, zzso were available from a study of the feasibility of zzso zzso cages for spinal zzso Plain zzso films, MR images, and zzso sections were used to evaluate spinal fusion and cage zzso The first follow-up tests revealed that MR imaging zzso provided three-dimensional information on cage placement, cage degradation and bone formation, and that it has potential to differentiate between the various soft zzso 

Although the magnetic field strength and thus the resolution used were higher than normal in clinical practice, MR imaging appears to be a promising zzso for the zzso clinical follow up of patients who undergo fusion with zzso zzso zzso reactions were not encountered in this study, and thus could not be zzso
