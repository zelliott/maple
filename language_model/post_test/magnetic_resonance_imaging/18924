zzso are characterized by a combination of high zzso functionality and a zzso precisely defined molecular zzso These characteristics can be used in biomedical applications, for example, for the amplification or zzso of effects on a molecular level, or to create extremely high local zzso of drugs, molecular labels, or probe zzso A brief summary of the current state of the art in the field is given, and focuses on the application of zzso both in zzso as well as in zzso In zzso zzso that bear zzso complexes are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance zzso DNA zzso have potential for routine use in zzso functional zzso analysis, as well as for DNA zzso zzso are also being investigated for zzso for example, as carriers for controlled drug delivery, in gene zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity of zzso has been zzso
