The value of assessment of viability as a predictor of surgical zzso benefit in zzso zzso has recently been questioned in a large zzso We sought to determine whether the contribution of viability as zzso zzso burden zzso to predict zzso outcomes could be modulated by zzso volume index zzso 

Delayed zzso was obtained in 450 patients with zzso zzso in zzso zzso coronary artery zzso zzso median age, zzso zzso zzso years; mean left zzso ejection zzso 23 zzso zzso mean zzso 115 zzso 50 zzso from 2002 to zzso zzso was zzso as zzso percentage zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso surgical zzso was performed in 245 zzso patients and subsequent zzso coronary interventions were performed in 28 zzso zzso A propensity score was developed for zzso Cox zzso hazards models of zzso mortality were used for risk zzso Over a mean follow-up of zzso zzso zzso years, 186 zzso deaths zzso After adjusting for prior zzso sex, diabetes, age, use of cardiac zzso therapy, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso valve zzso an interaction between zzso percentage and zzso zzso and an interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso were independently associated with zzso zzso demonstrated a significant interaction with zzso and female sex, such that enhanced survival was associated with zzso zzso also showed an interaction with zzso better survival was associated with lower volumes and less zzso 

zzso and zzso provide independent, incremental zzso value in patients with severe zzso zzso The risk associated with zzso should not be assessed in zzso
