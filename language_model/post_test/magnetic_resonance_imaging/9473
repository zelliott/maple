To evaluate the magnetic resonance zzso imaging features of zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso 

MR images of seven patients who had surgically proven zzso zzso were zzso reviewed by two zzso in consensus regarding the zzso appearance, including tumor size, location, margin, presence of zzso zzso presence and signal intensity of cavity within zzso and signal intensity and enhancement pattern of solid portion of zzso MR imaging findings were correlated with zzso zzso 

zzso location was zzso in three cases, zzso in two, and mixed zzso in zzso All tumors were well circumscribed on zzso images and zzso zzso zzso zzso In six cases, well defined cavities of high signal intensity, which reflected zzso cavities zzso were demonstrated within the tumors on zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in five zzso Solid portion of all tumors except zzso cavities exhibited zzso intensity on zzso images, various signal intensity on zzso images, and homogeneous enhancement on zzso zzso zzso images in five zzso 

When MR imaging shows a well circumscribed mass with zzso cavities of high signal intensity on zzso images and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso should be considered in the differential zzso
