To evaluate the in zzso interactions between human zzso stem cells zzso and degenerative disc zzso 

To demonstrate the potential of zzso in regulating the zzso zzso synthesis of degenerative disc zzso 

Culture of degenerative disc cells followed by their zzso into a disc can zzso the zzso process in an animal zzso However, harvesting cells without accelerating zzso is zzso zzso zzso can be safely harvested from the bone zzso and transplanted into degenerative zzso 

Human degenerative nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso were cultured as zzso and zzso zzso were formed by addition of zzso to disc cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA content were zzso zzso synthesis was analyzed by zzso and western zzso Type II collagen expression was assessed by zzso 

zzso zzso formed by the addition of zzso to zzso cells were superior in size to all other zzso zzso zzso showed higher experimental zzso content than the predicted values represented by the sum of individual control zzso with zzso versus zzso zzso at week 3, zzso The effect was not observed in the zzso zzso or when zzso medium was zzso Close contact between cells was necessary to obtain this enhancement of zzso zzso zzso and collagen expression in both individual and zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso analysis and western zzso 

zzso of zzso to zzso cells resulted in an zzso of the zzso zzso This study provides the rationale for further investigation of the potential of zzso therapy in treating zzso disc zzso
