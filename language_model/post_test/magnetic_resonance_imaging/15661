To explore effects of zzso preference zzso on cerebral cortical response during zzso task with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Seven patients with left zzso and 7 patients with right zzso were selected to perform the maximum voluntary zzso in zzso position, and block designed blood zzso zzso zzso zzso scan covering the whole brain was carried zzso 

There was zzso in the zzso zzso in the four patients among seven with left zzso But there was no zzso in the zzso zzso among the patients with right zzso 

This research shows that the zzso zzso which is associated with human memory and study, is activated during zzso task in the patients with left zzso
