zzso complications in zzso zzso are frequent and affect patient prognosis zzso Additionally, detection of zzso zzso by MR imaging could help early management of this zzso The objective of our study was to describe MR imaging characteristics of cerebral zzso in a zzso zzso population with zzso zzso 

One hundred nine patients at the acute phase of a zzso or possible zzso zzso according to the Duke modified criteria and without zzso manifestations according to the zzso were zzso zzso Each patient underwent cerebral MR imaging and zzso within 7 days of zzso 

MR imaging showed abnormalities in 78 patients zzso Acute zzso zzso (40 patients, zzso and cerebral zzso (62 patients, zzso were the most frequent zzso Eight patients had an acute zzso 3 patients had brain zzso 3 had a small cortical zzso and 3 had a zzso zzso Acute zzso zzso mostly appeared as multiple small zzso zzso in watershed territories zzso zzso and as zzso of different ages zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso distributed in cortical areas zzso cerebral zzso zzso No significant correlation was found among zzso in particular between acute zzso and cerebral zzso 

zzso cerebral zzso in particular cerebral zzso and acute zzso zzso are frequent in zzso zzso The MR imaging pattern of acute small zzso of different ages zzso in watershed territories and cortical cerebral zzso may represent a surrogate imaging marker of zzso zzso
