We describe the zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of a surgically proven case of diffuse pigmented zzso zzso zzso of the knee in a 34-year-old zzso A complex mass consisting of solid and zzso components was clearly demonstrated by CT and zzso The solid part showed homogeneous zzso zzso relative to adjacent muscles on CT scans, but it showed zzso signal intensity on spin echo zzso and zzso images zzso The solid component enhanced zzso on CT scans but zzso on MR zzso zzso enhancement of the zzso component on both CT and MR images were zzso All of the above features were better demonstrated on zzso Multiple marked zzso round and zzso areas, and also a few areas zzso to subcutaneous fat within the zzso were also found on zzso zzso density zzso and zzso These characteristic zzso features of zzso correlated well with its zzso zzso zzso of zzso and fat in the zzso zzso zzso and bloody zzso zzso These features may help to distinguish zzso from other disease entities arising from the zzso
