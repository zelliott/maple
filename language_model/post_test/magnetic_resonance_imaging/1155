To determine whether zzso zzso fat suppression is necessary for zzso zzso fast zzso zzso imaging in the detection of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso images obtained in 38 patients with surgically confirmed 61 zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso were zzso reviewed by three independent zzso Three sequences of MR images with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences were randomly reviewed on a zzso basis in a blind zzso Observer performance was tested using the zzso test and zzso zzso analysis for the clustered zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso was also zzso 

The mean zzso with the zzso zzso zzso sequence was highest in zzso zzso and tumors zzso zzso was highest with the zzso zzso zzso sequence in zzso was highest with the zzso zzso sequence in zzso and was comparable in tumors zzso zzso was comparable between the zzso The area under zzso curve zzso value was greatest with the zzso zzso zzso sequence in zzso was greatest with the zzso suppressed zzso sequence in zzso and was comparable in tumors zzso The sensitivities and zzso values were lower with the zzso sequence than the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso sequence was superior to the zzso sequence in the detection of zzso but the zzso zzso sequence was comparable to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence was superior to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences in the detection of zzso zzso zzso imaging with zzso fat suppression or without aiming for the detection of zzso or zzso respectively, zzso zzso imaging in zzso zzso
