Two zzso zzso zzso experiments explored the neural basis of selective spatial attention in vision and touch, testing for zzso versus zzso zzso due to attended zzso In the first study, either light flashes or finger zzso were presented zzso Twelve healthy volunteers were scanned while sustaining covert attention on the left or right zzso within each zzso The main effect for attending right minus left, across both zzso revealed zzso spatial attention effects in the left zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso effects zzso for attending right zzso left) were found in the left superior zzso zzso for vision, and left superior zzso zzso for zzso No significant zzso were seen for attending left minus zzso The second study presented only tactile zzso manipulating whether the eyes were open or closed, and including passive stimulation and rest zzso The zzso zzso for tactile spatial attention in the left superior zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso of the left zzso zzso observed in the first study was now found for touch, but only when the eyes were open zzso zzso apparently confirming its zzso zzso These results reveal mechanisms of sustained spatial attention operating at both zzso and zzso zzso
