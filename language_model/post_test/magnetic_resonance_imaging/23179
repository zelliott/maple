The optimal zzso scan planes of collateral ligaments of the ankle have been described zzso with the exception of the zzso zzso We assessed the optimal scan plane for depicting the zzso zzso zzso 

In order to determine the optimal zzso zzso and zzso zzso scan plane, two fresh frozen zzso zzso were zzso The angle of the scan plane that demonstrated the anterior and zzso zzso zzso ligament uninterrupted in their full length was zzso In a prospective study this zzso scan plane was then used in addition to the zzso and zzso planes, for zzso scans of both zzso in 21 healthy zzso Two observers independently evaluated the anterior zzso ligament zzso and zzso zzso ligament zzso regarding the continuity of the individual zzso thickness and zzso zzso of the ligaments in both the zzso and the zzso zzso Kappa was calculated to determine the zzso zzso zzso test was used to statistically zzso the significance of the two scan zzso 

In the zzso plane the zzso was in zzso zzso partly and in zzso zzso completely zzso in the zzso plane the zzso was continuous in zzso zzso and partly zzso in zzso zzso Compared with the zzso plane, the zzso plane demonstrated significantly less zzso zzso but not significantly less zzso zzso or less zzso zzso zzso of the zzso In the zzso scan plane the zzso was continuous in zzso zzso partially zzso in zzso zzso and completely zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso plane the zzso was continuous in zzso zzso Compared with the zzso plane, the zzso plane demonstrated significantly less zzso zzso but not significantly less zzso zzso or less zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso agreement score and zzso zzso regarding the continuity for the zzso in the zzso and zzso planes was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso it was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso not zzso 

The zzso and zzso are zzso scanned in the zzso zzso The advantage of zzso scanning in an zzso image plane of about 45 degrees permits a better evaluation of the ligaments compared with the zzso plane, particularly a better interpretation of ligament zzso zzso and zzso zzso This may lead to a reduction in zzso results, especially regarding partial or complete ligament zzso This can be of considerable aid in therapeutic zzso
