To evaluate the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect bone zzso zzso in a breast and prostate cancer population, using magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso CT as a gold zzso 

We have zzso included 34 patients with breast zzso or prostate cancer zzso at high risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso with single zzso zzso CT were obtained for all 34 patients and the results compared with a zzso gold zzso 

Out of the zzso zzso detected by zzso 219 zzso could be verified by CT or zzso Eighty-six additional zzso were detected by zzso zzso or seen only by CT zzso zzso zzso or both CT and zzso zzso The total number of verified zzso was therefore zzso zzso including 119 zzso benign and 155 zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of zzso zzso were 76, zzso and zzso zzso For zzso they were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased for the zzso zzso The accuracy of zzso was significantly superior to zzso for pelvic and zzso zzso zzso provided a correct diagnosis zzso in 32 of 33 patients (one false zzso compared with 28 of 33 with zzso (four false positive, one false zzso 

zzso zzso is significantly more accurate than zzso for detecting zzso from breast and prostate zzso
