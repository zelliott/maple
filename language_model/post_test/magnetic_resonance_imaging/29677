The structure of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was investigated with circular zzso gel zzso zzso low angle light zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling calculations were performed and predicted zzso secondary structure for charged zzso zzso zzso zzso when the zzso zzso levels reached zzso and zzso This zzso secondary structure was observed with circular zzso The zzso transition from coiled to extended linear was observed also by gel zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso The zzso secondary structure was not observed when the zzso was changed to zzso The zzso charge interactions were eliminated in this case since the zzso complex had no net zzso For this zzso the gel zzso and zzso zzso indicated a coiled zzso An extended linear zzso was regained when the zzso complex was changed to zzso which had a net negative zzso The functional aspects of these structures were investigated by MR imaging of an animal tumor zzso The linear extended zzso zzso gave zzso higher tumor signals then the zzso zzso indicating a much higher degree of zzso transport in the zzso
