zzso account for about zzso of all zzso zzso zzso of their proliferation rate is useful for assessing their biological zzso We evaluated zzso whether zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with cellular zzso activity and with tumor zzso We zzso studied 18 zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was performed within a week prior to surgical zzso In the excised tumor specimens we assessed zzso zzso zzso 14 of 18 patients had benign zzso while the remaining four had zzso zzso A significant correlation was found between both zzso zzso and tumor grade zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between the intensity of zzso zzso and tumor recurrence at 1 year zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This pilot study implies that zzso brain zzso could prove useful in zzso benign from zzso zzso and is a potential indicator of their zzso zzso
