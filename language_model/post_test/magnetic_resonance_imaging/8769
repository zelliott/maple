zzso interference tasks may be useful in probing anterior zzso zzso zzso function to understand abnormal zzso study in individuals with specific zzso 

In a 3 T functional zzso study, individuals with specific phobias of the animal zzso zzso zzso and healthy comparison zzso adults zzso completed an zzso emotional counting zzso zzso zzso were presented zzso negative, and neutral words and were instructed to report via button press the number of words displayed on each zzso

Taken together, these findings zzso a circuit of dysfunction, which is linked to attention abnormalities in individuals with zzso
