Geriatric depression consists of complex and zzso behaviors unlikely to be caused by a single brain zzso However, abnormalities in specific brain structures and their zzso may zzso vulnerability to the development of late-life zzso The objective of this study was to identify subtle white matter abnormalities in late-life zzso 

The authors used zzso transfer ratio zzso imaging, a technique that is thought primarily to reflect zzso integrity, to examine the hypothesis that individuals with late-life depression would exhibit white matter abnormalities in zzso and zzso zzso 

The study was conducted in a zzso geriatric psychiatry zzso 

Fifty-five older patients with major depression and 24 elderly comparison subjects were zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso data were conducted with a general linear model using age as a zzso 

Relative to comparison subjects, patients demonstrated lower zzso in multiple left zzso zzso and zzso regions, including white matter lateral to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso anterior cingulate, zzso zzso insular, and zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had lower zzso in additional left zzso locales including the thalamus, zzso of the corpus zzso inferior zzso zzso and middle zzso white matter zzso 

These findings suggest that geriatric depression may be characterized by reduced zzso integrity in specific aspects of zzso and zzso networks, and complement diffusion zzso studies of geriatric depression that indicate decreased organization of white matter fibers in specific frontal and zzso zzso
