Using an uncertainty paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we studied the effect of zzso selective and divided visual attention on the activity of specific areas of human zzso visual zzso The stimuli were single ovals that differed from an implicit standard oval in either zzso or zzso The subjects' task was to zzso the current stimulus as one of two possible alternatives per stimulus zzso Three different experimental conditions were zzso zzso zzso and zzso In all experimental conditions, the stimulus differed in only one stimulus dimension per zzso In the two certainty conditions, the subjects knew in advance which dimension this would zzso During the uncertainty condition they had no such previous knowledge and had to monitor both dimensions zzso zzso analysis of the zzso data (with zzso revealed a modest effect of the attended stimulus dimension on the neural activity in zzso sensitive area zzso (more activity during attention to zzso and in shape sensitive area zzso (more activity during attention to zzso Furthermore, cortical areas known to be related to attention and working memory processes zzso lateral prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso exhibit higher activity during the condition of divided attention zzso than during that of selective attention zzso
