In this study we use high resolution zzso zzso imaging zzso and apply rigorous manual tracing criteria in order to assess zzso the prefrontal zzso zzso in zzso Previous zzso studies suggested zzso is included in neural systems necessary for emotional processing and zzso and regional zzso abnormalities might, thus, lead to specific negative symptoms, as well as a frequent association of poorer performance in category zzso The aim of this study was to use zzso imaging and reliable manual zzso to determine if, as hypothesized, this higher precision would reveal additional zzso abnormalities in zzso in zzso and an association between zzso abnormalities and specific negative symptoms, as well as in category zzso Using zzso zzso 27 schizophrenia patients and 27 healthy controls were zzso zzso was manually zzso into frontal pole, superior frontal zzso zzso middle frontal zzso zzso and inferior frontal zzso zzso Left zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso right: zzso and bilateral zzso zzso zzso right: zzso showed volume zzso There were symptom associations between smaller left zzso volumes and more affective zzso zzso zzso and smaller left zzso volumes and poorer performance on the alternating semantic category test zzso zzso In zzso zzso imaging revealed widespread zzso volume deficits in zzso zzso and specific associations with selective negative symptoms, such as affective zzso and with deficits in cognitive zzso
