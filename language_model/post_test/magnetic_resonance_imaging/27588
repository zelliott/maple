The zzso system zzso is implicated in the response to zzso and zzso zzso but its role in stress-related psychiatric disorders is poorly zzso We examined if variation in zzso the gene coding for the type 1 zzso II zzso zzso is associated with a diagnosis of depression and differences in white matter zzso and zzso brain zzso Participants comprised zzso depressed and 116 zzso elderly Caucasian subjects who completed clinical assessments and provided blood samples for zzso We used a zzso single zzso zzso zzso analysis to test for variation in zzso For measurement of zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data were available on 33 zzso For zzso of the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso data were available on 70 zzso Two zzso exhibited statistically significant frequency differences between diagnostic zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso volume did not significantly differ by any zzso zzso and zzso volume differed significantly for several zzso zzso for those zzso differing significantly for both zzso and zzso volume, the zzso associated with smaller zzso volume was associated with larger zzso zzso This supports the idea that genetic variation in zzso is associated with depression and differences in zzso zzso
