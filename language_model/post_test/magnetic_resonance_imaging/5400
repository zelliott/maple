Since lung diseases adversely affect zzso during breathing, they must also alter normal lung motion, which can be exploited to detect these zzso However, standard imaging techniques such as CT and zzso imaging during zzso provide little or no information on lung motion and cannot detect diseases that cause subtle changes in lung zzso zzso X-ray imaging provides images of high contrast and spatial resolution with zzso resolutions that allow multiple images to be acquired throughout the respiratory zzso Using X-ray zzso imaging, coupled with zzso we have measured lung tissue movement and determined zzso fields that define speed and direction of regional lung motion throughout a breath in normal zzso nude male mice and mice exposed to zzso Regional maps of lung tissue motion reveal both the zzso of normal lung motion, as well as abnormal motion induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment caused pathological changes in lung structure that were zzso occupying less than zzso of the lung at 6 days after zzso Moreover, zzso failed to detect significant changes in compliance at either 36 h or 6 days after zzso zzso analysis of the zzso fields demonstrated major differences zzso zzso zzso in regional lung motion between control and zzso mice at both 36 h and 6 days after zzso The results of this study demonstrate that X-ray zzso imaging, coupled with zzso can detect early stage, subtle and zzso lung zzso
