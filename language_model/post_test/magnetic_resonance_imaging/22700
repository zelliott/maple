zzso cerebral zzso occurs in approximately zzso of children with diabetic zzso zzso However, zzso or zzso cerebral zzso is thought to occur more zzso Some small studies have found narrowing of the cerebral zzso indicating cerebral zzso in most or all children with zzso but other studies have not detected narrowing in zzso zzso In this study, we measured the zzso zzso of the frontal horns of the lateral zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso in children with zzso during treatment and after recovery from the zzso zzso We determined the frequency of zzso narrowing and compared clinical and zzso data for children with and without zzso zzso zzso children completed the study zzso The lateral zzso were significantly smaller during zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after recovery from zzso p zzso zzso Children with zzso narrowing during zzso treatment zzso children, zzso were more likely to have mental status abnormalities than those without narrowing zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso scores below 15 during therapy, p zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis revealed that a lower initial zzso level was significantly associated with zzso narrowing zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso No other variables analyzed were associated with zzso narrowing in the zzso zzso We conclude that narrowing of the lateral zzso is evident in just over half of children being treated for zzso Although children with zzso narrowing did not exhibit neurological abnormalities sufficient for a diagnosis of zzso cerebral zzso mild mental status abnormalities occurred zzso suggesting that clinical evidence of cerebral zzso in children with zzso may be more common than previously zzso
