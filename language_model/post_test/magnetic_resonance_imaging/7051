The aim of this study was to establish a standardized procedure for the measurement of regional fractional ventilation in a healthy rat model as a baseline for further studies of pulmonary disorder zzso 

The lungs of five healthy male zzso rats were zzso using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso From these images, regional fractional ventilation was calculated and maps generated detailing the distribution of fractional ventilation in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso regions of interest were assigned on 5 zzso zzso 5 zzso field of view lung zzso zzso were also generated showing the frequency distribution of fractional ventilation zzso To compare fractional ventilation values between animals, the ventilation procedure was standardized to results from individual pulmonary function zzso Each zzso spontaneous tidal volume, respiratory rate, and inspiration percentage zzso of total respiratory cycle in zzso were used in their mechanical ventilation zzso 

zzso were similar among all five healthy rats based on examination of ventilation distribution maps and frequency distribution zzso Mean zzso and standard zzso zzso were calculated for fractional ventilation in each zzso However, these values were determined to be influenced by slice selection, and therefore the maps and zzso were favored in analysis of zzso 

This study shows consistent results in healthy rat lungs and will serve as a baseline study for future zzso in zzso rat zzso
