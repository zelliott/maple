To assess diagnostic performance of dedicated breast magnetic resonance zzso imaging at breast imaging centers by using a dedicated zzso breast MR system that used zzso zzso spiral trajectory zzso 

The study was institutional review board approved and zzso zzso with waiver of informed zzso zzso performance was zzso assessed for 934 consecutive screening zzso and diagnostic zzso examinations performed from April 2006 to December 2007 in women aged zzso years old from four sites for which dedicated breast MR imaging reports and ground truth zzso for cancer cases, zzso follow-up with negative results for cases with negative zzso were zzso The sensitivity, zzso and receiver operating characteristic zzso for breast MR imaging were zzso 

The sensitivity and specificity for the dedicated breast MR imaging system were zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso For all cases, the negative zzso value zzso was zzso zzso of zzso The zzso for screening cases was zzso zzso of zzso The area under the zzso curve was zzso Of the 93 cases with zzso findings seen at dedicated breast MR imaging, 25 zzso were high-risk zzso findings for which zzso is often zzso The zzso rate was 93 of zzso zzso for all cases, but only 16 of zzso zzso for the screening zzso 

High accuracy was achieved by using dedicated breast MR zzso
