zzso Transfer zzso zzso is an important MR zzso mechanism to zzso the zzso zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse (or zzso zzso zzso zzso is normally implemented at a fixed magnetic field; however, it may be useful to evaluate changes of the zzso effect as a function of external magnetic field strength zzso In order to conduct zzso zzso experiments with a single MR system, two techniques are zzso zzso zzso should be able to be switched between levels during zzso of the zzso zzso At the same time, the resonance frequency of the zzso zzso zzso should also be able to be shifted to the corresponding zzso Switching zzso is attained by the fast zzso technique, while in order to switch zzso a specially designed zzso zzso zzso is zzso Here, we designed and constructed an actively zzso zzso zzso for zzso at and below zzso zzso The design employed zzso diodes, and enabled switching zzso between five different values, with excellent zzso matching zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of about 100 at each zzso
