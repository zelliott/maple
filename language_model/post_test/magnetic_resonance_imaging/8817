It has been suggested that impaired cerebral zzso and zzso capacity may play in role in the zzso of the zzso seen in small vessel zzso zzso zzso of the deep white matter of the brain depends on the relationships between blood pressure zzso cerebral zzso and zzso 

24 h ambulatory zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso analysis of white matter zzso zzso volume and zzso zzso ultrasound assessments of zzso zzso in response to zzso and dynamic cerebral zzso index zzso were undertaken in 64 patients with cerebral small vessel zzso 

zzso had mean 24 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso median zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso models, after adjusting for age, zzso vascular risk profile and zzso volume, zzso correlated with 24 h mean zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso correlated with duration of hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In individuals with hypertension for more than 10 years, zzso also correlated with nocturnal zzso dipping zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were unaffected by zzso volumes, and zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two distinct processes which are not related to zzso volume but are related to zzso levels and duration of hypertension, zzso Greater nocturnal dipping was associated with higher zzso values, suggesting preservation of zzso in patients with increased vulnerability to reduced cerebral zzso
