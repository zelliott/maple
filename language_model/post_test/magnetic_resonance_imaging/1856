A successfully treated case of intractable zzso of which zzso zzso zzso provided multiple spike zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso zzso A 22-year-old male patient, with a history of zzso zzso at the age of 14 years, had suffered frequent simple zzso and complex partial zzso zzso and falling attacks since the age of 16 zzso Although he underwent corpus zzso at the age of 17 years, additional surgical treatment was considered because of intractable and more frequent zzso and zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging demonstrated diffuse zzso in the right frontal zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso failed to show focal zzso zzso zzso zzso localized several clusters over the multiple anatomical zzso in the right prefrontal and frontal zzso zzso The patient underwent right zzso zzso and anterior frontal zzso followed by zzso of the zzso area based on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso localized frequent spike zzso over the right zzso frontal zzso and zzso zzso which showed good correspondence with the zzso zzso zzso can be a useful zzso method for zzso evaluation of intractable zzso
