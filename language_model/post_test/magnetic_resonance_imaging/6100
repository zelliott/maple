We sought to determine the safety of zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso in patients being treated with standardized zzso zzso 

We zzso evaluated the outcome of primary zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso in zzso zzso procedures in 67 zzso We focused on those cases that led to zzso zzso zzso even though the patients had been treated with standardized zzso therapy before, zzso and after zzso zzso Patient age ranged from 19 to 78 zzso In 33 patients, zzso were placed for treatment of zzso zzso in the remaining 34 patients, zzso were placed to assist zzso of zzso The patients in this study were treated between January 2003 and August zzso 

Of the total 67 patients initially treated successfully by zzso zzso 7 patients developed zzso zzso zzso Of these 7 patients, 3 received zzso placement into the zzso artery because of an underlying zzso in 1 patient, a zzso of the zzso segment of the middle cerebral artery was zzso In 3 patients, zzso of the anterior cerebral artery, the zzso inferior zzso artery, and the zzso artery were treated by zzso zzso zzso In 4 of the 7 patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso by local application of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso can lead to zzso zzso zzso even in patients who are treated with standardized zzso zzso Such complications have been described for patients after coronary artery zzso but to our knowledge, no one has reported on a comparable number of cases of zzso zzso zzso In certain clinical scenarios, local zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important treatment option to deal with zzso zzso zzso
