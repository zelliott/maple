The most common cause of spinal zzso disease among patients with AIDS or those infected with zzso is zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the MR characteristics of the spinal zzso in this patient population and to correlate these findings with the clinical severity of zzso 

MR images of the spinal zzso in 21 patients with documented zzso infection or AIDS and a clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso were assessed zzso for zzso intrinsic signal zzso and abnormal zzso The clinical severity of zzso was graded by a neurologist on the basis of physical examination, and a qualitative correlation was made with the MR zzso 

MR findings were abnormal in 18 of the 21 zzso The most common feature was spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso typically involving the zzso zzso with or without cervical zzso involvement, followed by intrinsic zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three patients had both zzso zzso and intrinsic zzso signal zzso The zzso signal zzso was zzso without zzso for any specific distribution zzso Enhancement was not seen in any of the 10 patients who received intravenous contrast zzso Only one of 16 patients with moderate to severe zzso had normal MR findings, as compared with two of five patients with mild zzso 

MR findings in the spinal zzso are abnormal in the majority of patients with zzso zzso typically showing spinal zzso zzso with or without intrinsic zzso signal zzso Patients with moderate to severe zzso have an increased frequency of spinal zzso zzso but a zzso correlation between clinical severity of zzso and extent of MR abnormalities remains to be zzso
