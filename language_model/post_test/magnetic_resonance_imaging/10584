To examine the neural zzso during deception and truth telling by using a functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging technique and an ecologically valid task and to compare the results with those of a standard zzso zzso 

All subjects gave written informed consent for this zzso study, which was approved by the institutional review board of zzso zzso Eleven healthy subjects (five female and six male zzso mean age, zzso zzso were randomly assigned to the group of guilty subjects or the group of zzso zzso Each group consisted of two separate functional MR imaging conditions: zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso condition was used to compare brain activity during a known lie to control questions and a zzso lie to relevant zzso The zzso condition was used to compare brain activity during a known zzso response to control questions and a zzso zzso response to relevant zzso zzso MR images were acquired with an zzso zzso and statistical analysis was zzso zzso responses were measured with a standard zzso zzso zzso 

During the deception process, specific areas of the frontal lobe zzso zzso and left inferior frontal zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso and right middle zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso anterior cingulate, right zzso zzso and right zzso zzso were significantly zzso During the truth telling process, specific areas of the frontal zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso The zzso examination revealed zzso accuracy in deceptive subjects and zzso accuracy in zzso zzso 

zzso areas of the brain involved in deception or truth telling can be depicted with functional MR zzso
