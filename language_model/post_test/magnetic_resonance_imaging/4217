zzso of the carotid and zzso arteries is most accurately diagnosed with conventional zzso MR techniques are sensitive for detecting the abnormalities associated with dissection but may lack zzso We hypothesized that MR may be useful for serial monitoring of dissection and may therefore guide zzso 

All patients with zzso proven carotid and/or zzso artery dissection from July 1994 to June 1996 were followed for a median duration of zzso zzso Of these 29 patients (44 zzso 18 were zzso evaluated with zzso and a target group of 9 patients (17 zzso was zzso followed with MR at zzso zzso 

In the 18 patients with both imaging studies at zzso zzso revealed 30 dissected vessels while MR detected 27 zzso In the target group of 9 patients, initial MR identified 15 of the 17 zzso diagnosed with zzso zzso MR revealed complete healing in 5 vessels, improvement in 6 vessels, no change in 4 vessels, and worsening in 2 zzso The zzso features most likely to resolve were zzso and mural zzso while zzso and zzso zzso tended to zzso Late zzso events occurred in 2 patients, both with persistent MR evidence of zzso one while zzso on zzso therapy and the other occurring 1 week after zzso was zzso 

MR is a reliable zzso method for following the vascular response to treatment and may guide the course of a clinical trial comparing medical therapies for carotid and zzso artery zzso
