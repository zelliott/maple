The organic zzso zzso is widely used in zzso The threshold limit value for extended occupational exposure to zzso is presently set to 200 zzso in the United zzso We have investigated the effect of an inhalation exposure of 80 zzso for 4 weeks (6 zzso 5 zzso followed by a zzso period of at least 4 weeks, on behavior and brain features in the zzso zzso exposure appeared to affect spatial memory, since zzso rats showed a longer time in the correct zzso in a Morris swim zzso This effect may indicate that the exposed rats used their zzso strategy longer before they started to look for the platform zzso zzso rats showed trends for increases in both locomotion and rearing behaviors and a significantly reduced zzso zzso The area of the cerebral cortex, especially the zzso cortex, was decreased by zzso in zzso rats, as shown by magnetic resonance imaging of living rats and zzso of frozen brain zzso The zzso and zzso values of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not affected by zzso as measured in zzso and zzso zzso area using zzso zzso binding zzso and in zzso and islands of zzso using quantitative zzso zzso zzso previously demonstrated persistent effects by zzso on the binding characteristics of zzso binding to both zzso and zzso receptors seem to indicate a persistent effect of zzso selectively on zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the present results indicate that exposure to low zzso of zzso leads to persistent effects on zzso zzso and zzso properties in the zzso
