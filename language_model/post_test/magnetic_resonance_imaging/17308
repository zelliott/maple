Few magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of bipolar disorder zzso have investigated the entire cerebral zzso zzso gray matter zzso volume deficits have been reported in some studies of adults with zzso this study assessed the presence of such deficits in children with zzso 

zzso youths with zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso and 15 healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had structured and clinical interviews, neurological zzso zzso testing, and zzso scanning on a zzso T GE zzso Image zzso divided the zzso into 48 zzso units per hemisphere, and these units were combined into frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso differences were examined using zzso linear zzso models with alpha zzso zzso 

Relative to controls, the zzso youth had significantly smaller bilateral zzso and left zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso showed significantly smaller volume in bilateral zzso zzso and in left superior zzso and zzso zzso while the zzso zzso were zzso increased in the zzso zzso Although the FL overall did not differ between groups, an exploratory analysis showed that the right middle frontal zzso was also significantly smaller in the zzso zzso 

Children with zzso showed deficits in zzso and zzso cortical zzso Further analyses of the zzso and zzso found differences in areas involved in zzso control, facial recognition, and verbal and zzso zzso These cortical deficits may reflect early age of illness zzso
