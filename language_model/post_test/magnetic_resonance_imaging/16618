zzso small vessel disease is the most common cause of vascular cognitive zzso It typically zzso with zzso zzso and zzso white matter zzso However, little is known about how these zzso relate to the cognitive zzso Previous studies have found a poor correlation between the burden of zzso zzso and cognitive symptoms, thus leaving much of the zzso in cognitive performance zzso The objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship between the location of zzso zzso zzso and cognitive symptoms in small vessel zzso We applied a zzso zzso mapping approach to data from 215 patients with zzso a genetically defined small vessel disease with zzso in the zzso zzso All patients were examined by magnetic resonance imaging and comprehensive zzso zzso zzso zzso and white matter zzso were segmented on three-dimensional zzso and zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso One hundred and zzso subjects had a total of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso The zzso volume of white matter zzso ranged from zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso clusters for cognitive performance were detected for both zzso zzso and white matter zzso The most prominent results were obtained on a compound score for processing speed, the predominantly affected cognitive domain in this group of zzso Strategic locations included the anterior parts of the thalamus, the zzso and anterior limb of the internal zzso the anterior zzso zzso and the zzso of the corpus zzso By combining the zzso mapping data with information from a zzso white matter zzso we found that the majority of the processing speed clusters projected on the anterior zzso radiation and the zzso zzso In zzso models that included demographic zzso brain zzso and the volume of zzso zzso regional volumes of zzso zzso and white matter zzso in the anterior zzso radiation predicted performance in processing speed tasks, whereas there was no independent contribution of the global volume of zzso zzso These observations emphasize the importance of zzso location for both zzso and zzso white matter zzso Our findings further highlight the anterior zzso radiation as a major anatomical structure zzso on processing zzso Together these findings provide strong support for a central role of zzso circuits in cerebral small vessel disease and vascular cognitive zzso
