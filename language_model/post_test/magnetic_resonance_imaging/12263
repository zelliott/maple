An efficient zzso zzso contrast agent incorporating a potential liver targeting functionality was zzso via the combination of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso with zzso carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was coated on the surface of acid treated zzso via zzso interactions and zzso zzso modified with a potential targeting agent, zzso zzso zzso were subsequently immobilized on the surface of the zzso A narrow magnetic zzso loop indicated that the product displayed zzso at room temperature which was further confirmed by zzso zzso field zzso zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso The zzso zzso magnetic zzso showed low zzso in zzso to zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed for the hybrid material zzso zzso zzso in comparison with the pure magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso due to the capacity of the zzso to zzso more zzso as zzso More importantly, after administration of the composite material to an in zzso liver cancer model in mice, a significant increase in tumor to liver contrast ratio zzso was observed in zzso weighted magnetic resonance zzso
