To zzso assess the association between zzso zzso exposure at magnetic resonance imaging and the development of zzso systemic zzso zzso 

This zzso study had institutional review board zzso zzso consent was zzso A search of medical and zzso records was performed to identify patients with zzso that was diagnosed between January 1998 and December zzso Patients with known exposure to zzso contrast agents other than zzso zzso were zzso Medical records were then reviewed for zzso zzso exposure, zzso status, zzso diseases, timing of zzso symptom zzso date of zzso diagnosis, and clinical zzso zzso zzso deposition was assessed for those patients with adequate available zzso zzso rank correlations were estimated to assess the relationship between the dose of zzso zzso and the time to onset of zzso 

zzso patients zzso age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso had been exposed to zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso All had stage 5 chronic kidney disease and all but one were undergoing dialysis at the time of zzso zzso developed within 3 months after the last zzso zzso exposure zzso zzso zzso in 21 zzso of 32 zzso The patients had been exposed to median cumulative zzso zzso volumes of 35, 40, 85, and zzso zzso over the 3, 12, and 24 months and up to 11 years preceding the onset of zzso zzso Patients who received higher cumulative and total zzso zzso doses had a higher risk of developing zzso than did those who received lower doses zzso ratio zzso zzso Twenty zzso of 36 patients died, with a median zzso of 18 months between zzso symptom onset and zzso 

zzso develops in patients with zzso impairment after exposure to zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso
