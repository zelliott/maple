In the present study, we characterized the zzso aging of deep zzso matter zzso by simultaneously measuring quantitative magnetic resonance parameters sensitive to complementary tissue characteristics zzso zzso iron deposition, zzso zzso in seven different structures in 100 healthy zzso Large age-related variations were observed in the thalamus, zzso and zzso No significant correlations with age were observed in the zzso amygdala, zzso or zzso Multiple zzso analyses of advanced imaging data revealed that the best zzso of zzso aging were the mean relaxation time zzso of the zzso and the volume and mean zzso of the zzso These three parameters accounted for over zzso of the age zzso in a linear model zzso 100 healthy subjects, aged from 20 to 70 zzso zzso the statistical analyses highlighted characteristic patterns of variation for the zzso in the various structures evaluated in this zzso These findings contribute in establishing a baseline for comparison with pathological changes in the zzso zzso and zzso
