zzso in the central zzso network are hypothesized to play a role in the zzso mechanism underlying zzso zzso however, few data are available regarding the structural changes of the brain in this zzso We used zzso zzso and regional zzso to identify possible zzso zzso 

We zzso studied 32 patients with zzso zzso with a positive response to the zzso tilt test and 32 controls who had no history of zzso We used zzso zzso to compare zzso volumes between patients and zzso In addition, regional volumes of structures known to be included in the central zzso network were measured and compared between the zzso zzso analyses were also performed between clinical variables and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed a significant zzso volume reduction in the right insular zzso in patients with zzso zzso compared with controls zzso P zzso zzso Regional zzso showed a significant reduction of right insular volumes in patients compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso Smaller right insular volumes in patients with zzso zzso were related to larger drops in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressures during the zzso tilt zzso 

We observed a novel finding of right insular zzso in patients with zzso zzso with a positive response to the zzso tilt test, implicating the role of right insular dysfunction in the zzso mechanism underlying zzso zzso Our findings further support the hypothesis that right insular dysfunction may cause a decrease in sympathetic activity and a zzso increase in zzso activity, leading to zzso
