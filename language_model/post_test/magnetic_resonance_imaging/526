zzso zzso zzso have high zzso resolution, but insufficient spatial zzso the converse is true for the functional imaging zzso The purpose of the study was to test the utility of a zzso zzso technique which combines zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso for a simultaneously high zzso and spatial zzso The sample consisted of 32 healthy young adults of both zzso zzso stimuli were delivered according to the active and passive oddball zzso in the zzso environment zzso and in the standard conditions of the zzso laboratory environment zzso zzso were presented in a fixed zzso Participants were exposed to the recording environments in a zzso zzso zzso data were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was made using a current density reconstruction zzso The zzso zzso for the zzso were zzso similar to those for the zzso The effect of the recording environment, experimental paradigm and zzso location were analyzed using a zzso analysis of zzso for repeated zzso The zzso components in the two environments showed zzso variations and characteristic topographical zzso The calculated sources were in line with the related zzso The findings indicated zzso cognitive processing in zzso The study provided preliminary data on the feasibility of the zzso zzso zzso It also indicated lines of research that are to be pursued for a decisive testing of this technique and its zzso to clinical zzso
