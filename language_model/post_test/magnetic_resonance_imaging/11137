An artificial neural network zzso zzso method was developed for dynamic zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the breast and compared with quantitative and zzso zzso mapping zzso 

The study population was composed of 10 patients with seven zzso and three benign zzso undergoing dynamic MR imaging of the zzso All zzso were zzso or surgically zzso and examined by means of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso low angle shot zzso was acquired before and seven times after the intravenous administration of zzso zzso at a dose of zzso zzso body zzso Motion artifacts on MR images were eliminated by zzso zzso and zzso registration zzso A zzso zzso zzso network was created for zzso zzso of signal zzso zzso into zzso tissue zzso ANN output was statistically compared with zzso zzso signal enhancement ratio zzso zzso zzso signal intensity zzso zzso zzso rate constant zzso and correlation zzso to a zzso reference zzso zzso 

ANN was successfully applied to the zzso of breast MR images identifying structures with benign or zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso zzso regression, odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were independently associated to ANN output zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso 

ANN is capable of zzso breast zzso on MR zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso showed the highest association with the ANN zzso
