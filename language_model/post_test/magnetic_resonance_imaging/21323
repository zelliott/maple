Previous studies have demonstrated that the perceived direction of motion of a visual stimulus can be zzso from the pattern of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso responses in zzso zzso using zzso analysis methods zzso and zzso zzso One possible mechanism for this is a difference in the sampling of direction selective cortical columns between zzso zzso that information at a level smaller than the zzso size might be accessible with zzso zzso zzso analysis methods might be driven by the organization of zzso into clusters or even orderly maps at a much larger zzso To assess the possible sources of the direction selectivity observed in zzso data, we tested how zzso accuracy varied across different visual areas and zzso of zzso for zzso of zzso To enable high spatial resolution functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data were collected at zzso To test whether information about the direction of motion is represented at the scale of zzso zzso we looked at zzso performance after combining data across different zzso within visual areas zzso and zzso before training the zzso zzso A recent study has shown that orientation biases in zzso are both necessary and sufficient to explain zzso of stimulus orientation zzso et zzso zzso Here, we combined zzso with similar visual field preference as determined in separate zzso zzso and observed that zzso accuracy was preserved when averaging in this zzso zzso way, compared to random averaging of zzso This zzso to averaging of zzso (with similar visual angle zzso across substantial distances in cortical space suggests that there are large-scale biases at the level of zzso maps underlying our ability to zzso direction of zzso
