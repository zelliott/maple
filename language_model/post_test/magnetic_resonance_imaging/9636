zzso major zzso patients need regular blood zzso that lead to zzso of iron and death from heart zzso zzso has been reported to be superior to zzso for the removal of cardiac iron and improvement in left zzso zzso function but little is known of their relative effects on the right zzso zzso which is being increasingly zzso as an important zzso factor in zzso Therefore data from a prospective zzso controlled trial zzso comparing these zzso was zzso zzso to assess the RV responses to these zzso 

In the zzso 61 TM patients were zzso to receive either zzso or zzso zzso and zzso scans for zzso and cardiac function were zzso Data were zzso for RV volumes and function at zzso and after 6 and 12 months of zzso 

From baseline to 12 months, zzso reduced RV end zzso volume zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso whilst RV ejection fraction zzso increased from zzso to zzso zzso This was associated with a zzso increase in zzso zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso By contrast, zzso showed no change in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso to zzso zzso whereas the zzso increased by zzso zzso but with no change in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of between drugs treatment effects, showed significant improvements zzso zzso with a mean effect on zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Using zzso analysis the improvement in zzso at 12 months was shown to be greater in patients with lower baseline zzso values zzso with a significant difference in zzso of zzso zzso zzso over zzso zzso 

In this retrospective analysis of a prospective zzso zzso zzso was superior to zzso for improvement in zzso and zzso zzso This improvement in the RV volumes and function may contribute to the improved cardiac outcomes seen with zzso
