We present a novel system for detecting zzso transient events in zzso and older zzso The detection system consists of three major zzso zzso a zzso stage for filtering zzso and detecting artifacts, zzso a zzso zzso zzso event detection stage and zzso a zzso zzso spatial event selection stage to incorporate spatial contextual information for rejection of zzso zzso The output consists of homogeneous zzso events and their corresponding zzso zzso The system was evaluated on zzso signals recorded in four zzso and six older zzso There was a high degree of correlation between zzso and zzso events for all zzso Mean sensitivities of zzso and zzso and mean zzso of zzso and zzso were obtained for the zzso and the older children, zzso This tool is appropriate for the detection and selection of homogeneous zzso events prior to source zzso zzso spatial analysis of zzso may facilitate the zzso assessment of patients' brain zzso
