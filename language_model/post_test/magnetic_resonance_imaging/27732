To assess a recently developed magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique called magnetic field correlation zzso imaging along with a conventional imaging method, the zzso relaxation rate zzso for zzso age-related brain iron concentration in adolescents and zzso Brain region measures were compared with zzso iron zzso zzso ) based on a prior zzso zzso 

zzso spin echo zzso images were acquired at zzso from 26 healthy individuals (16 zzso 10 zzso zzso of interest zzso were placed in areas in which age-related iron content was estimated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso and frontal white matter zzso zzso and group analyses were conducted on zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso displayed significant linear relationships to zzso when all regions were zzso Whereas zzso was significantly correlated with zzso for every individual region except zzso and detected significantly lower means in adolescents than adults for each region, zzso detected significant correlation and lower means for only zzso and zzso 

Our results support the hypothesis that zzso is sensitive to brain iron in zzso regions and detects age-related iron increases known to occur from adolescence to zzso zzso may be more sensitive than zzso to zzso changes occurring within specific brain zzso
