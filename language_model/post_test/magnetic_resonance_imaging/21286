The right zzso role in language comprehension is supported by results from several neuropsychology and zzso zzso Special interest surrounds right zzso structures, which are thought to be involved in processing novel zzso expressions, primarily due to the coarse semantic coding of zzso In this event related zzso experiment we aimed at assessing the extent of semantic distance processing in the comprehension of figurative meaning to clarify the role of the right zzso Four categories of German noun noun compound words were presented in a semantic decision zzso a) conventional zzso b) novel zzso c) conventional literal, zzso zzso novel literal expressions, controlled for zzso frequency, zzso zzso and emotional zzso Conventional literal and zzso compounds increased zzso signal change in right zzso regions, suggesting zzso semantic processing, in line with the coarse semantic coding theory, but at odds with the graded zzso zzso Both novel literal and novel zzso expressions increased activity in left inferior frontal areas, presumably as a result of zzso zzso and semantic unification zzso challenging predictions regarding right zzso involvement in processing unusual zzso Meanwhile, both conventional and novel zzso expressions induced zzso signal change in left zzso regions, suggesting that even novel metaphor processing involves more than linking zzso distant zzso
