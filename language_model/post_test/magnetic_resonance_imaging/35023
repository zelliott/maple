The purpose of this study was to assess whether prone or zzso imaging provides superior zzso loop zzso during zzso zzso zzso examinations and whether either position is better with regard to zzso detection and zzso 

Forty zzso enrolled clinically referred patients with known or suspected zzso abnormalities zzso underwent 62 zzso zzso zzso examinations in both the prone and the zzso zzso Images were blindly and independently reviewed by two zzso Each zzso segment was assessed with a 3-point scoring system, and differences in zzso zzso in the prone and zzso positions were evaluated with a paired zzso zzso zzso between rates of zzso detection and characterization zzso zzso zzso were analyzed with a paired zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement was estimated with the zzso zzso 

In both normal and diseased small zzso the prone position had statistically significantly higher zzso scores than did the zzso position zzso zzso zzso with a high level of zzso zzso This finding, however, did not translate into improved zzso detection or characterization zzso zzso zzso 

Although use of the prone position results in superior zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso both the prone and zzso positions are equal in terms of zzso detection and feature zzso
