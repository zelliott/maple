The zzso deletion syndrome zzso zzso zzso in Man zzso zzso is a zzso disorder that includes zzso severely impaired development of speech and language, zzso behavior, and minor zzso zzso Although the number of reported cases is zzso the zzso deletion remains zzso because of failure in recognizing the clinical zzso and detecting the zzso deletion by routine zzso zzso Our goal is to contribute to the description of the zzso zzso and brain abnormalities of this zzso zzso 

We assessed zzso zzso language, communication, and social development and performed cerebral zzso and study of regional cerebral blood flow measured by zzso zzso zzso in 8 children carrying the zzso zzso 

Despite zzso in expression and severity, the children shared a common zzso profile characterized by zzso sleep disorders, and poor response to their environment in early zzso expressive language deficit contrasting with emergence of social zzso from ages approximately 3 to 5 years; sensory processing zzso and zzso zzso Brain zzso findings were normal or showed a thin or zzso zzso corpus zzso zzso zzso zzso study detected a localized dysfunction of the left zzso polar lobe and zzso zzso 

The zzso course of the zzso deletion syndrome belongs to pervasive zzso disorders but is distinct from zzso An improved description of the natural history of this syndrome should help in recognizing this largely zzso zzso
