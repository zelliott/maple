The purpose of this study was to correlate the abnormal signal area on various magnetic resonance zzso images to the zzso area on zzso examination and to assess the zzso viability on the basis of MR zzso zzso zzso zzso and delayed zzso zzso images were used as zzso zzso in a pig model of zzso zzso zzso The results of each MR image were compared with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The abnormal signal areas on zzso and zzso zzso images were larger than the zzso areas on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso areas on zzso images were correlated zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso microscopic examination showed severely distorted zzso in the zzso areas and mildly damaged zzso in the zzso zzso zzso images probably reflected the zzso areas, whereas zzso and zzso zzso images seemed to include zzso as well as zzso zzso
