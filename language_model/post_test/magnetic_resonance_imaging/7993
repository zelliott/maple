To evaluate zzso zzso of the zzso segment of the zzso zzso in zzso horn zzso 

This study enrolled 72 patients without zzso zzso tears zzso zzso 72 patients with zzso zzso tears without zzso horn tears zzso zzso 44 patients with zzso horn tears of the zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso tears were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso of the middle segment and the zzso segment was measured on zzso zzso 

zzso of both middle and zzso segments in groups zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for group zzso and zzso zzso for group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for group zzso and zzso zzso for group zzso were significantly larger than those in group N zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both indicators of zzso in group zzso were larger than those in group zzso In the early zzso category, neither middle nor zzso segment in group zzso zzso more than in group zzso However, only the zzso segment in group zzso zzso significantly more than in group zzso Multiple zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso segment zzso was strongly correlated with the zzso horn tears zzso among groups zzso and zzso 

The newly presented indicator for zzso of the zzso segment of the zzso zzso is associated with zzso horn tears in comparison with the zzso of the middle segment, especially in the early stages of zzso
