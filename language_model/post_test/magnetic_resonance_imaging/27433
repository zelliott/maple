Object recognition in the peripheral visual field is limited by zzso the disruptive influence of nearby zzso Despite its severity, little is known about the cortical locus of zzso Here, we examined the neural zzso of crowding by combining zzso zzso adaptation with a zzso zzso zzso can change the appearance of objects, such that items become zzso matched to surrounding objects; we used this change in appearance as a signature of crowding and measured brain activity that correlated with the crowded zzso zzso adapted to a peripheral patch of noise surrounded by four zzso zzso When crowded, the noise appears oriented and zzso indistinguishable from the zzso zzso substitution of the noise for a zzso identical to the zzso zzso is rarely zzso whereas substitution for an zzso zzso zzso is rarely zzso We predicted that brain areas representing the crowded zzso would show repetition suppression in zzso trials but release from adaptation in zzso zzso This predicted pattern was observed throughout cortical visual areas zzso increasing in strength from early to late visual zzso These results depict crowding as a zzso process, involving even the earliest cortical visual areas, with zzso consequences that are increasingly influenced by later visual zzso
