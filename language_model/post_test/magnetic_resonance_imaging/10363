The zzso zzso ring plane zzso separates the zzso from the zzso zzso internal carotid zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate its position with MR zzso The protocol used a zzso sequence in two zzso zzso zzso zzso and carotid zzso The zzso passes through four zzso reference points zzso We developed on a zzso model a correlation method supported by correlation lines and angles zzso projecting the zzso toward the zzso zzso were correlated to the zzso in zzso of cases in the zzso and zzso of cases in the zzso CA were identified and correlated to the zzso respectively, in zzso and zzso of cases in the zzso and zzso and 51% of cases in the zzso zzso often related to a lack of visibility of just one zzso A higher zzso contrast in living subjects allowed the identification of CA in zzso and zzso of cases, respectively, in the zzso and the zzso We propose that CA, when identified, should be considered as an approximation of the inferior zzso limit of the zzso zzso In difficult zzso cases, this zzso protocol could help to locate zzso zzso on both sides of the cavernous zzso zzso
