zzso contrast zzso dynamic magnetic resonance zzso imaging is an important technique for evaluating liver zzso However, several potential diagnostic pitfalls may be encountered, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso particularly in the zzso segment of the left zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormalities throughout the zzso and zzso zzso due to vascular artifacts, zzso zzso vessels, partial volume artifacts, magnetic zzso artifacts, and zzso zzso in zzso These abnormalities sometimes have appearances similar to those of true zzso or tumor spread to the surrounding liver zzso on zzso phase dynamic MR zzso In most cases, however, no corresponding abnormalities are seen with other pulse sequences or on zzso MR zzso In addition, zzso abnormalities due to readily recognizable causes are often found in characteristic locations and thus can be differentiated from true zzso An understanding of the causes of these potential pitfalls and how to avoid them will help zzso understand and correctly interpret zzso
