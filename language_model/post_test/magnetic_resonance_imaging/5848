zzso tend to modify their attitudes to align with past zzso For example, after choosing between similarly valued alternatives, people rate the selected option as better than they originally did, and the rejected option as zzso However, it is unknown whether these modifications in evaluation reflect an underlying change in the zzso representation of a zzso expected hedonic value and our emotional response to zzso Here, we addressed this question by combining zzso zzso of the pleasure they will derive from future events, with brain imaging data recorded while they imagined those events, both before, and after, choosing between zzso Participants rated the selected alternatives as better after the decision stage relative to before, whereas discarded alternatives were valued zzso Our functional magnetic resonance imaging findings reveal that zzso changes in preference are tracked in zzso nucleus zzso Specifically, the difference in blood zzso zzso zzso signal associated with the selected and rejected stimuli was enhanced after a decision was taken, reflecting the choice that had just been zzso This finding suggests that the zzso representation of a zzso expected hedonic value is altered by a commitment to zzso Furthermore, before any zzso induced by the decision process, our data show that zzso signal in this same region reflects the choices we are likely to make at a later zzso
