To study zzso bone zzso by means of MR imaging before and after bone-marrow transplantation in zzso zzso zzso emphasis was paid to zzso and to focal manifestations, zzso appearances that could simulate zzso 

Twenty-two patients who were zzso for a minimum of 30 months after transplantation were studied in 107 MR zzso Two zzso visually evaluated zzso zzso and short inversion time zzso zzso zzso 

zzso images demonstrated a more zzso zzso after transplantation than before zzso zzso defined focal low signal intensity areas appeared on this sequence in 5 zzso of the 22 patients at between 21 and 60 weeks after zzso The mean age of these 5 patients was zzso years zzso zzso zzso The difference in age between these 5 patients and the remaining 17 patients, who had a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso zzso was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso defined focal low signal intensity areas may be seen on zzso images of bone zzso in patients who are in complete zzso after zzso particularly in those aged over zzso zzso
