zzso impairment is very common in patients with Parkinson's disease zzso Brain changes accompanying cognitive decline in zzso are still not fully zzso 

We applied cortical pattern matching and cortical thickness analyses to the three-dimensional zzso brain zzso scans of 14 zzso cognitively normal elderly zzso 12 cognitively normal zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso We used linear zzso models to investigate the effect of diagnosis on cortical zzso All maps were adjusted for multiple comparisons using zzso testing with a threshold p zzso zzso 

zzso showed significantly thinner bilateral zzso zzso lateral zzso as well as right zzso cingulate, zzso inferior zzso and lateral frontal zzso relative to NC zzso zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significantly thinner bilateral zzso right frontal and right zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The absolute difference in cortical thickness between zzso and the other diagnostic groups ranged from zzso to zzso 

Our data shows that cognitive decline in zzso is associated with cortical zzso zzso subjects have the most widespread gray matter zzso suggesting more cortical involvement as zzso patients progress to zzso
