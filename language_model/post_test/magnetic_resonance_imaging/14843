The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation of rotator cuff zzso junction zzso zzso with healing after rotator cuff repair and with zzso zzso tear zzso 

We reviewed zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of 51 patients undergoing zzso zzso rotator cuff repair between March 1, 2005, and February 20, zzso zzso zzso studies were evaluated for zzso tear size, zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle quality, and zzso position with respect to the zzso The position of the zzso was referenced off the zzso face as either lateral or zzso zzso zzso studies obtained at a minimum of 1 year zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for healing, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We found that 39 of 51 tears zzso healed, with 26 of 30 zzso tears zzso and 13 of 21 zzso tears zzso zzso Greater zzso zzso worse zzso muscle quality, and a more zzso zzso were all associated with worse zzso healing zzso zzso zzso Of tears that had a zzso zzso lateral to the face of the zzso zzso healed, whereas only zzso of tears that had a zzso zzso zzso to the face of the zzso healed zzso zzso repairs that had limited zzso lengthening zzso zzso and limited zzso position change zzso zzso from zzso were found to be smaller, had less zzso zzso zzso had less zzso zzso zzso and had less zzso rotator cuff fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and muscle quality are all zzso of zzso healing zzso when using a zzso rotator cuff repair zzso The position of the zzso with respect to the zzso face can be zzso of healing, with over zzso healing if lateral and 50% if zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso accounts for a significant percentage of the zzso unit lengthening that occurs in healed tears as opposed to muscle zzso 

Level IV, therapeutic case zzso
