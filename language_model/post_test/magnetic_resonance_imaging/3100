Bone mineral density zzso using dual X-ray zzso zzso are commonly expressed as zzso density zzso However, zzso zzso zzso is dependent on bone size and this can lead to erroneous interpretations of zzso zzso We have previously presented a simple method for calculating apparent zzso bone mineral density zzso using ancillary zzso zzso In the present study we tested the zzso of our model using in zzso zzso data obtained from magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were measured from zzso pairs of identical twins (24 men, 8 zzso aged zzso zzso The dimensions of the zzso vertebra zzso were measured from MR images and zzso values were corrected for these zzso The zzso apparent zzso bone mineral density zzso correlated moderately with zzso zzso zzso values from zzso to zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not related to body size zzso All these zzso zzso diminished the erroneous effect of zzso size on zzso zzso We conclude that the simple zzso zzso can be used for zzso of bone mineral density values in subjects of different body sizes, and especially in growing zzso
