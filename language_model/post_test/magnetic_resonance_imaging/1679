We studied the in zzso cerebral zzso and documented the presence of zzso gene zzso in six Chinese females with zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso from the frontal lobe zzso and white zzso and deep gray zzso zzso zzso and zzso of either side were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratios were analyzed and compared with six healthy zzso female control zzso zzso gene zzso was identified in four zzso one patient had zzso and one patient did not have gene zzso zzso zzso of the frontal lobe of all patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased compared with zzso control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the difference was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso with a mean difference of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference in all other zzso ratios in the frontal lobe and deep gray zzso were not statistically significant compared with zzso control zzso zzso frontal lobe and anterior zzso lobe zzso was present in three zzso zzso resonance zzso is a sensitive method capable of detecting the zzso changes in zzso syndrome and is able to detect changes before conventional magnetic resonance zzso Our preliminary results suggest that reduction in zzso zzso ratio may not be related to the zzso zzso
