Recent studies have shown that the zzso signal zzso in human brain is zzso and may be described in terms of zzso water zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso which provides information about tissue structure and orientation, typically uses b values up to 1000 s zzso zzso so that the signal is dominated by the fast zzso zzso In this study b factors up to zzso s zzso zzso are zzso allowing the diffusion zzso properties of the more slowly zzso fraction to be mapped for the first zzso The mean zzso zzso of the slow diffusion zzso was found to exhibit strong zzso matter zzso zzso zzso depicting the principal direction of the slow zzso indicated alignment with the fast zzso and the known orientation of the zzso zzso
