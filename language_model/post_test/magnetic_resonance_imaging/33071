The purpose of this study was to evaluate skeletal muscle composition of lower zzso muscles in a zzso female carrier of zzso muscular zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso was performed on the lower zzso and heart of a zzso zzso years, 51 zzso on four occasions within 21 months and in a control zzso zzso and asymmetry among muscles in the zzso was observed in zzso fraction and mean zzso relaxation time zzso of lower zzso muscles with some muscles presenting as unaffected zzso zzso zzso and others showing substantial deterioration and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was an association of abnormal zzso findings and strength and motor zzso Over the 21 months a small decrease in zzso and increase in zzso fraction and zzso was observed in the zzso in some zzso In zzso this zzso revealed significant imaging evidence of zzso zzso among zzso Furthermore, this study shows the feasibility of combining various quantitative zzso and MRS approaches to monitor skeletal muscle zzso
