During migraine attacks, zzso in sensation accompanying headache may manifest as zzso and enhanced sensitivity to light, sound, and zzso Our objective was to identify zzso changes in cortical regions in migraine patients using painful heat and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and the structural basis for such changes using diffusion zzso imaging zzso In 11 zzso patients, painful heat threshold + zzso was applied unilaterally to the forehead during zzso zzso zzso greater zzso was identified in the zzso zzso lobe in patients relative to healthy subjects, specifically in the anterior zzso pole zzso In patients, zzso showed significantly increased functional connectivity in several brain regions relative to controls, suggesting that zzso zzso may contribute to functional abnormalities in zzso In 9 healthy subjects, zzso identified white matter connectivity between zzso and zzso nucleus, which has been related to zzso In 8 patients, zzso zzso in zzso with painful heat was exacerbated during zzso suggesting that repeated migraines may sensitize zzso This article investigates a zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso lobe abnormalities may provide a basis for many of the zzso changes in zzso and may serve as a potential zzso zzso for drug zzso
