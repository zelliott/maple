To correlate the signal intensity of zzso zzso with its zzso zzso with particular emphasis on the zzso zzso 33 magnetic resonance zzso examinations that revealed 93 zzso were zzso zzso All patients were zzso in zzso and zzso planes with different zzso pulse sequences to obtain zzso zzso and zzso density zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showing a homogeneous signal of low intensity, and degenerative zzso zzso zzso 31) with a zzso signal of variable intensity on zzso images could be zzso zzso assessment of fiber constitution and zzso and MR intensity were interpreted by independent zzso There was excellent zzso between the averages for MR intensity, zzso relaxation time and fiber content, although the intensity values in each fiber grade showed a wide zzso The greater the fiber content the lower the MR intensity on zzso images, and the shorter the zzso relaxation time zzso zzso zzso In addition, the manner in which fiber distribution affected MR appearance was also zzso These data contribute guidelines for precise tissue differentiation of zzso tumors on MR images, and for MR imaging tissue diagnosis of any zzso with a considerable zzso zzso
