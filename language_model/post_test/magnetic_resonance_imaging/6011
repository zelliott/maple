The anterior limb of the internal capsule zzso is the major white matter tract providing zzso connections between the frontal cortex, zzso and zzso zzso evidence suggests that this tract may be affected in zzso with brain imaging studies reporting reductions in white matter volume and density, changes in fractional zzso and reduced zzso However, the molecular zzso of these deficits are currently zzso The aim of this study was to identify zzso in protein and zzso levels in the zzso in zzso zzso were obtained zzso from individuals with schizophrenia zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso for the zzso protein zzso basic protein zzso and the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso proteins did not differ between zzso zzso differences in zzso zzso were observed between the two groups zzso zzso zzso with zzso tests revealing lower zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in the schizophrenia group relative to zzso zzso changes in zzso and zzso levels indicate zzso abnormalities within the zzso in zzso
