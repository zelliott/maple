To improve the zzso ratio zzso of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data, an approach is developed that combines zzso methods with the general linear zzso 

zzso et zzso zzso developed a zzso statistical procedure to test zzso partitions for significant zzso zzso Their method is zzso for the detection of differences between images acquired under two experimental conditions using long blocks of zzso However, many zzso questions require more complicated zzso zzso and more experimental zzso zzso in order to apply zzso methods to a wide range of experiments, we present a new approach that is based on the general linear model and zzso zzso 

In contrast to a zzso zzso the application of the zzso method increased the zzso and showed a set of clearly zzso zzso Furthermore, no relevant decrease of the local zzso was zzso 

zzso methods can increase the zzso without diminishing the signal zzso while preserving the spatial resolution of the zzso The anatomical zzso is strongly zzso
