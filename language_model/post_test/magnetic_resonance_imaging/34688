We observed simultaneous changes in zzso level and regional blood flow zzso in the brain of the zzso rabbit by using localized zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso and laser zzso zzso The volume of interest of zzso zzso for zzso MRS contained mostly zzso zzso During zzso peak area for zzso increased up to 57% of that from zzso While the zzso increased during zzso up to zzso of the control, oxygen delivery zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso In the zzso recovery period following zzso the zzso recovered slowly and a zzso zzso of oxygen delivery was zzso The multiple and zzso linear zzso analyses revealed that the averaged decrease in oxygen delivery during zzso was the most significant independent variable for the increase in zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also that the increase in zzso during zzso was the most significant independent variable for the time for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the increase in zzso during zzso is due to the zzso of oxygen delivery and that the increase in zzso during zzso zzso the period of enhancement of zzso during recovery from zzso
