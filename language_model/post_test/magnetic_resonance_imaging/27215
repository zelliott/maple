zzso associates with insulin resistance and may even predict type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular zzso Because muscular insulin resistance relates to zzso fat deposition and disturbed energy zzso we hypothesized that reduced zzso zzso turnover zzso zzso insulin resistance and elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We measured zzso zzso using zzso magnetic resonance zzso in patients with type 2 diabetes and zzso and body zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso insulin sensitivity were assessed with zzso zzso 

zzso individuals had zzso and zzso lower peripheral and zzso insulin sensitivity as well as zzso reduced zzso than zzso After adjusting for zzso zzso correlated positively with peripheral and zzso insulin sensitivity but zzso with waist zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso Multiple zzso analysis identified waist circumference as an independent predictor of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso explaining zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso primarily determined the zzso in zzso 

In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance relates to zzso zzso energy zzso which is at least partly accounted for by fat zzso
