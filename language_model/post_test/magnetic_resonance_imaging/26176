The most frequent and serious complications of zzso treatment of zzso zzso with zzso detachable coils zzso are zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso MR imaging appears to be the most sensitive technique for detecting early zzso zzso We evaluated this technique for the detection of brain changes in patients who underwent zzso treatment of zzso 

Twenty patients with a cerebral aneurysm were studied with zzso imaging before and after zzso treatment with zzso zzso were located in the anterior zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso had occurred in 11 zzso MR studies, including fast zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso zzso were scheduled before, 2 to 4 hours after, and 48 hours after zzso MR images, including apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso were assessed for the presence of acute zzso stroke zzso 

In all patients, the aneurysm was excluded without zzso zzso In 18 patients, zzso and zzso images showed no evidence of recent zzso zzso after zzso In one patient, an zzso zzso zzso signal on zzso images with a drop of zzso values corresponding to an acute zzso zzso was zzso In another patient, multiple silent zzso were seen on zzso images after zzso These silent zzso were not all located in the vascular territory of the zzso parent zzso 

This preliminary study suggests that zzso MR imaging is a potentially useful tool for monitoring patients after zzso treatment of a cerebral zzso While small zzso zzso can be observed on these images after zzso their exact prevalence should be evaluated in a larger zzso
