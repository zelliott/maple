zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso causes repeated zzso attacks leading to zzso vascular zzso The aim of this study was to characterize cognitive function in subjects with a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso leading to zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso carriers and zzso carriers with zzso zzso were compared with healthy zzso from the same families using a comprehensive set of zzso zzso 

Changes in working memory and executive function were observed in the very early phase of the disease before transient zzso attack zzso or zzso Later, in the zzso phase, the cognitive impairment concerned also mental speed and zzso zzso Finally, the subjects with zzso had multiple cognitive deficits, which engaged even verbal functions, verbal episodic memory, and motor zzso The 2 zzso carrier groups without zzso and the controls could be reliably distinguished using 3 tests that assessed working zzso executive function, and mental zzso zzso memory was relatively zzso late in the zzso 

A deterioration of working memory and executive function was already observed in the zzso phase, which means that cognitive decline may start insidiously before the first onset of symptomatic zzso zzso
