Twenty patients with suspected internal zzso of the knee were examined with fast, three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso with a zzso zzso system designed for use by both the zzso and zzso MR volume acquisitions allowed zzso of all zzso diagnosed zzso tears and high-grade zzso zzso All zzso visible zzso injuries, including partial cruciate tears, were detected with MR zzso There was excellent correlation for high-grade zzso zzso although MR imaging appeared insensitive to small cartilage zzso Additionally, MR imaging allowed diagnosis of ten bone abnormalities not accessible to zzso zzso The high accuracy of MR imaging that was found in this study was in large part due to the thin, zzso sections generated in volume zzso With the added advantage of high patient zzso fast volume MR imaging is an accurate and efficient method for evaluation of knee zzso
