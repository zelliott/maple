Using group functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso and group zzso zzso we studied two cognitive zzso A language task involving covert letter zzso and a visual task involving biological motion direction zzso The zzso data were analyzed using an zzso zzso technique known as zzso zzso zzso zzso which provides continuous 3-D images of cortical power zzso These images were zzso zzso and averaged across subjects to provide a group SAM image in the same template space as the group zzso zzso The results show that zzso zzso changes in cortical zzso detected using zzso match those areas of the brain showing an evoked cortical zzso response with zzso The majority of these changes were zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso frequency zzso Our study demonstrates how zzso spatial zzso and zzso averaging enable group zzso studies to be zzso SAM analysis also allows the zzso experiment to have exactly the same task design as the corresponding zzso zzso This new analysis framework represents an important advance in the use of zzso as a cognitive zzso technique and also allows mutual zzso with zzso
