We investigated the association between brain zzso distribution and the presence of zzso zzso bands zzso in Italian multiple sclerosis zzso zzso 

We zzso selected brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso performed in 56 zzso patients (41 patients zzso zzso 

Brain zzso in zzso areas occurred in zzso of the patients zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but we did not find a significant difference for their median volume zzso zzso zzso and median number zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso of the patients with a similar distribution zzso zzso zzso and no significant difference in the median volume zzso zzso zzso and number zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso 

The present study on cohort of Italian zzso patients demonstrated a lack of correlation between zzso distribution and zzso suggesting that B cells producing them could be localized both in zzso niches and cerebral zzso
