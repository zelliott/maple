A group of 39 patients with zzso disorders from the Hospital del Mar was zzso They were submitted to PET zzso brain metabolism tests and in some cases hybrid PET MR images were also zzso findings were then correlated against the clinical progression of the zzso 

The zzso that were observed showed predominantly bilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso frontal zzso This zzso of the zzso system, which has no correlation with anatomical damage, can be a predictor of the clinical progression and of the confirmation of the presence of zzso in the brain functions in this type of zzso
