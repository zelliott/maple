The focus of this project is to improve our understanding of the relationships between brain structure and function in patients presenting with anterior visual zzso zzso using functional zzso zzso visual zzso maps and diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso visual loss can occur when large zzso zzso compress the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso the zzso and can lead to visual zzso In this preliminary study, we selected patients presenting with slowly progressive visual loss secondary to a zzso zzso region zzso Using zzso zzso data, we reconstructed white matter projections of the zzso zzso and demonstrated a structural correlation with functional vision as zzso by formal visual field mapping and zzso The structural data generated through a fiber tracking zzso may represent a potentially powerful tool to better understand functional visual deficits in patients with anterior visual zzso zzso Furthermore, we believe that specific patterns in zzso zzso data may predict the likelihood of zzso visual recovery in a select group of zzso
