Comparative effectiveness research has become an integral part of health care planning in most developed zzso In a simulated cohort of women, aged zzso who tested positive for zzso or zzso zzso we compared outcomes of zzso with and without zzso zzso zzso with and without mastectomy, mastectomy alone, and zzso 

Using zzso zzso software, we developed zzso models with 25,000 zzso Carlo simulations and conducted zzso sensitivity zzso We based zzso zzso rates, breast and zzso cancer zzso and mortality rates, and costs in terms of 2009 dollars, on published studies and data from the zzso zzso and End zzso zzso Program and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid zzso We used preference ratings obtained from zzso carriers and controls to adjust survival for quality of life zzso 

For zzso zzso carriers, zzso zzso at zzso per zzso was more cost effective than both surgeries and dominated all other zzso For zzso carriers, zzso zzso at zzso per zzso was more cost effective than both zzso Without quality adjustment, both mastectomy and zzso surgeries dominated all other zzso In all simulations, preventive surgeries or zzso dominated or were more cost effective than screening because screening zzso were zzso 

Our analysis suggested that among zzso zzso carriers, zzso surgery would dominate or be cost effective compared to zzso and zzso Annual screening with zzso and zzso was the most effective strategy because it was associated with the longest zzso survival, but it was also very zzso
