Different approaches to the zzso region are described in the literature with high mortality and zzso We report our experience with two different approaches zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

Between 1986 and 1997, 25 operations were performed in 22 zzso zzso zzso included a zzso with conventional zzso (for older zzso magnetic resonance imaging with zzso study zzso for the zzso Two different approaches, the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso ones, were zzso Three patients had a zzso zzso followed by a total zzso for one of zzso 

The mortality and morbidity induced by the approaches were low compared to the series of the zzso Only 2 patients were worsened by the zzso Patient 4 developed zzso after an zzso approach and patient 21 temporary zzso syndrome after zzso of a zzso by zzso zzso zzso One patient improved his neurological status but died on the 10th zzso day from pulmonary zzso 

Total or partial zzso of zzso zzso region zzso by direct zzso approaches can be achieved in most cases with low zzso The choice among the two surgical zzso or zzso zzso approaches depends on the size and the location of the zzso in the zzso area, its relation to the zzso system, the median line and the zzso zzso sequences in magnetic resonance with study of the deep veins are helpful in this zzso
