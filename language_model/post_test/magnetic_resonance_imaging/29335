Secondary zzso of the spinal zzso in people with zzso zzso is almost universal but there is a relatively low zzso of the secondary zzso zzso syndrome zzso In view of this, we wish to explore the notion that zzso zzso as demonstrated by ultrasound of the spinal cord, can become an independent measure for increased tension of the spinal zzso in patients with zzso zzso and six patients with zzso underwent zzso examination of their back, a thorough physical examination, and a careful review of their clinical zzso Of these patients, 53 had zzso of their zzso zzso zzso was graded and the statistical relation between zzso and various clinical and zzso findings was zzso Age and arm span were not correlated with grades of zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso correlated with the presence of symptoms but this relation may be explained by zzso findings of certain structural zzso zzso and not by zzso per zzso Assuming that zzso zzso is a reliable marker for the tension within the spinal cord, the results of our study suggest that zzso of the zzso is not the main cause for the development of the zzso
