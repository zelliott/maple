zzso to compress thigh veins effectively after zzso surgery or zzso procedures are still zzso The aim of this paper was to compare the clinical outcomes with three different zzso devices as a function of the pressures zzso 

zzso patients undergoing zzso stripping of the great zzso vein and side branch zzso under local zzso were treated zzso in sequential order by 1) thigh length zzso zzso 2) adhesive zzso and 3) newly developed eccentric zzso pads fixed with tapes and a thigh length stocking on zzso zzso pressures were measured at zzso level under these devices after application and one week later before zzso was zzso zzso zzso bleeding through the zzso discomfort and skin zzso were recorded and rated as major or minor adverse zzso 

The lowest zzso pressure of around 15 zzso at thigh level in the lying position were found in group A under the zzso zzso which zzso provide zzso zzso at ankle zzso Group B and group C showed significantly higher values zzso values of 47 and 68 zzso respectively in lying position, zzso The median pressure values in the three groups upon standing were 16 zzso 63 zzso and 98 zzso One week later there was a zzso in the lying position in the three groups of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Major adverse events were seen in a total of 10 of 18 patients in group A, in zzso in group B, and in zzso in group zzso Minor adverse events in the three groups consisting mainly of light discomfort for zzso devices and local skin zzso were observed in 6, 6 and 15 cases zzso 

The best results with respect to the reduction of pain and zzso were obtained when eccentric zzso pads were taped to the skin of the thigh and a zzso stocking was worn on zzso A possible explanation for these observations is the very high local pressures under the eccentric zzso
