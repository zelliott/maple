zzso of the influence of age on zzso dimensions is essential for all practitioners whose interest is the pediatric zzso Early zzso studies documented that the zzso is zzso zzso with the zzso of the cone zzso positioned at the zzso zzso zzso These dimensions change during childhood, as the zzso assumes a more zzso zzso The authors analyzed zzso dimensions during development to determine if this relationship continues in zzso children in whom zzso muscles are zzso zzso The authors determined the relationships between the vocal cord, zzso cord, and zzso ring dimensions and the influence of age on these zzso 

zzso and children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging with zzso sedation had zzso of the zzso and zzso (AP) dimensions of the zzso at the most zzso level of the zzso zzso zzso and the most zzso level zzso Most patients had an additional measurement zzso zzso at a level between the vocal cords and the zzso zzso zzso were obtained by plotting age against zzso dimensions and the ratio of zzso dimensions at different levels within the zzso 

The authors measured zzso and zzso zzso dimensions in 99 children, aged 2 zzso zzso The relationship between the zzso and zzso dimensions at all levels of the zzso did not change during zzso zzso and zzso dimensions increased zzso with age at all levels of the zzso In all children zzso the zzso portion of the zzso was the zzso dimension at the level of the vocal zzso zzso dimensions increased zzso in a zzso direction through the zzso ( zzso zzso while zzso dimensions did not change relative to zzso zzso The shape of the zzso ring did not change throughout zzso 

In sedated, zzso children, the zzso portions of the zzso are the zzso opening zzso zzso zzso and the immediate zzso zzso level, and there is no change in the relationships of these dimensions relative to zzso dimensions throughout zzso
