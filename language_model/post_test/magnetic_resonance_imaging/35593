To compare the diagnostic efficacy of computerized zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso in clinically zzso patients zzso with zzso of the zzso 

Twenty adult patients zzso zzso zzso with zzso proven zzso of the tongue and clinically zzso zzso status were included in this zzso Before the wide local zzso of the primary tumor followed by modified functional neck zzso all the patients underwent zzso CT and zzso and zzso The zzso data acquisition zzso arc, 128 zzso 128 zzso 64 projections, 20 zzso was performed 15 zzso after an intravenous injection of zzso zzso of zzso under the dual head zzso zzso zzso Siemens, zzso zzso using the zzso zzso parallel hole zzso zzso data reconstruction was achieved by filtered back projection using the zzso filter with a critical frequency of zzso and power zzso Only visual assessment was used for defining a positive zzso zzso zzso on reconstructed zzso images and maximum intensity projection zzso zzso examination of zzso was performed using zzso and zzso zzso 

A total of zzso zzso were excised surgically zzso neck zzso from 20 tongue cancer patients having zzso neck zzso Only nine of zzso zzso were documented as being positive for zzso on zzso zzso These nine zzso were distributed in eight of 20 zzso CT, zzso and zzso could accurately identify one, three, and five zzso zzso In one of the eight patients, zzso could not distinguish between two zzso present at the same level, having size of zzso and zzso zzso In this study, zzso was shown to have better zzso zzso values zzso than either CT zzso or zzso zzso The zzso documented zzso zzso picked up by CT or zzso were also identified by zzso 

In this preliminary prospective study, we observed that zzso zzso of the clinically zzso zzso tongue patients zzso zzso zzso zzso is a more effective imaging zzso in the staging of clinically zzso zzso zzso in zzso tongue as compared with CT or zzso
