zzso of zzso size can be important in monitoring the course of zzso therapy, as zzso resolution is proposed as one measure of success of zzso This zzso study assessed the zzso and zzso zzso of quantitative zzso volume zzso from magnetic resonance images zzso in subjects with palpable zzso zzso zzso first underwent zzso imaging of a selected zzso followed by zzso before and at zzso 10 and zzso after zzso zzso After choosing optimal zzso subjects underwent zzso and zzso zzso of a selected zzso on two occasions separated by zzso zzso zzso zzso images provided satisfactory zzso images and were less subject to interfering zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was excellent, with no statistically significant difference in mean zzso volume between visits zzso difference - zzso zzso zzso zzso A small but statistically significant difference in zzso mean zzso volume was detected zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso size in zzso and deserves further comparison with other techniques for zzso size monitoring in assessing effects of zzso zzso
