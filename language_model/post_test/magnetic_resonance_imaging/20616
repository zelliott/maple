Conflict detection and subsequent behavioral adjustment are critical to daily life, and how this process is controlled has been increasingly of zzso A zzso cortical region which includes the anterior zzso zzso zzso has been theorized to act as a conflict detector that can direct prefrontal activity for behavioral zzso This conflict monitoring hypothesis was supported by many imaging studies of the zzso task, with a focus on zzso zzso Here we sought to examine whether this circuit could be generalized to the stop signal task zzso another behavioral paradigm widely used to study cognitive zzso In particular, with a procedure to elicit errors in the zzso we examined whether error and zzso control were zzso by the same zzso 

In functional magnetic resonance imaging of 60 healthy adults, we demonstrated that the zzso cortical activity during stop success zzso as compared to go success zzso trials is correlated with increased prefrontal activity in zzso SS as compared to zzso SS trials, though this correlation was not specific to the zzso cortical zzso Furthermore, zzso and insular rather than zzso cortical zzso during stop error zzso as compared to G trials correlated with increased prefrontal activity in zzso SS as compared to zzso SS zzso 

Taken together, these new findings challenge a specific role of the zzso and support distinct pathways for error and zzso conflict processing in cognitive zzso
