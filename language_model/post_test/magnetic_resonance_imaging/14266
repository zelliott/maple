Internal architecture of an zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied with magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso The capsule of zzso showed low intensity relative to liver on both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso images were superior to the zzso images in zzso the capsule of zzso The tumor showed a mosaic pattern, which was a zzso composed of multiple compartments of different zzso reflecting viable tumor zzso and a zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso composed of zzso of zzso cells resembling the normal liver cell with zzso zzso showed low intensity relative to liver on zzso images and high intensity on zzso zzso The zzso portion, composed of zzso of zzso thick zzso material without zzso or inflammatory reaction, showed low intensity relative to liver on both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso images were superior to the zzso images in demonstrating the mosaic pattern of zzso
