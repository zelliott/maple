The zzso zzso zzso zzso Disorder - Not otherwise zzso zzso is based on the symptoms for zzso and includes a wide variety of zzso that do not meet full criteria for zzso As such, zzso is a broad and poorly defined residual category of the zzso spectrum zzso In order to address the zzso in this residual category it may be helpful to define clinical and zzso zzso Multiple complex zzso disorder zzso may constitute such a zzso In order to study the zzso specificity of zzso in comparison with other zzso spectrum disorders, we investigated brain zzso in children (age zzso zzso with zzso compared to children with zzso and typically developing zzso 

zzso zzso measures were compared between 22 zzso subjects with zzso and 21 zzso subjects with zzso and 21 matched zzso 

zzso with zzso showed an enlarged zzso and a trend towards larger zzso volume compared to control zzso Compared to subjects with zzso subjects with zzso had smaller zzso zzso 

We report a pattern of zzso changes in the brains of subjects with zzso similar to that seen in zzso However, no enlargement in head size was zzso This suggests that although some of the zzso changes associated with zzso overlap with those in zzso others do zzso These zzso changes may reflect differences in the zzso zzso associated with these two zzso of zzso spectrum zzso
