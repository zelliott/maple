zzso zzso zzso is an independent risk factor for premature zzso We investigated the accuracy in the detection of early zzso zzso in such zzso The left and right wall of the abdominal zzso the zzso zzso and both common zzso arteries were evaluated with gated zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and gated two-dimensional zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso and were compared with zzso digital zzso zzso zzso in 11 patients with zzso and zzso Six patients showed zzso in one or more of the total number of 55 studied zzso segments with zzso zzso of 37 normal and 12 of 18 zzso segments with zzso zzso and 29 normal and 6 zzso segments with zzso zzso were correctly zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso was 67 and 33 zzso the specificity was 86 and 78 % and the accuracy was 80 and 64 zzso zzso We conclude that zzso in patients with zzso is a regular finding, and zzso zzso in such patients is an acceptable zzso
