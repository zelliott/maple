zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with reduced musculoskeletal growth in the upper zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether reduced growth of upper arm zzso and zzso muscles is related to active elbow function and zzso zzso 

In this study, 31 infants age less than 6 months zzso age zzso range zzso 17 zzso 14 zzso with unilateral zzso zzso class I, zzso II, 3; III, 2; and IV, 7) treated at the zzso medical zzso in whom zzso reconstruction was considered were zzso studied using magnetic resonance imaging of both arms at a mean age of zzso zzso zzso length and the zzso area zzso of elbow zzso and zzso muscles were measured in both upper zzso zzso of elbow function was estimated when the infants were a mean age of zzso months using the Gilbert zzso 

Both zzso and zzso zzso were significantly smaller on the affected side than on the unaffected side zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), as was zzso length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso side zzso in all zzso There was no relation between the reduction in zzso and zzso zzso and residual muscle zzso In 17 out of 31 patients, zzso of zzso and/or zzso muscles was zzso zzso length was not related to muscle zzso 

zzso has different effects on muscle growth and function as well as bone zzso In young infants with an zzso muscle size is not a predictor of muscle zzso zzso zzso of the elbow later in childhood may not be explained by a dominance of zzso muscle mass in zzso
