To investigate using magnetic resonance imaging zzso the part played by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in producing the zzso aspect of zzso zzso toe zzso 

Twelve zzso toes and corresponding zzso toes of 7 consecutive patients meeting Amor criteria for zzso were studied by zzso 

All zzso toes showed fluid collections in the zzso zzso zzso on zzso Due to the sheath zzso the zzso bone to skin distance was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso in the zzso toes compared to normal zzso zzso zzso soft zzso were not involved since these were significantly thicker zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso were involved in only 4 zzso zzso Of the 36 zzso of the 12 zzso toes only 2 zzso zzso showed capsule zzso Considering zzso as the zzso zzso examination showed zzso sensitivity and specificity for zzso sheath involvement but lacked sensitivity for zzso zzso zzso and showed a low specificity for joint capsule zzso 

Like finger zzso toe zzso may also be due to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso may not be a required condition for zzso zzso zzso zzso may be present in addition to zzso zzso Physical examination is a sufficient method for diagnosing toe zzso
