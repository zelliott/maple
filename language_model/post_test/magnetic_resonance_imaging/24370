To identify and validate the optimal thresholds for zzso functional MR imaging response criteria to predict overall survival after zzso treatment zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval and waiver of informed consent were zzso A total of 143 patients who had undergone MR imaging before and zzso weeks after the first cycle of zzso were zzso MR imaging analysis of one representative zzso index zzso was performed with proprietary software after initial zzso zzso were randomly divided into training zzso zzso 114 zzso and validation zzso zzso 29 zzso data zzso zzso and zzso Cox models were used to determine the best zzso as well as survival differences, between response groups in the validation data zzso 

zzso zzso in the training data set were zzso increase in apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso decrease in zzso enhancement in the portal zzso phase zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso and zzso decrease in zzso were used to zzso patients in the validation data zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso with zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso showed significant differences in survival zzso zzso survival, zzso vs zzso months, zzso P zzso zzso as did zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso 25th zzso survival, zzso vs zzso months, zzso P zzso zzso zzso of patients with a combination of the criteria resulted in significant differences in survival between patients with zzso that fulfilled both criteria zzso zzso 6 zzso too few cases to determine 25th zzso one criterion zzso zzso 9 zzso 25th zzso survival, zzso zzso and neither criterion zzso zzso 14 zzso 25th zzso survival, zzso zzso P zzso zzso The association between the two criteria and overall survival remained significant in a zzso analysis that included age, sex, Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer stage, and number of follow-up zzso 

After zzso for zzso zzso patients can be zzso into significantly different survival categories based on zzso versus zzso status according to MR imaging zzso and zzso zzso
