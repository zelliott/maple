The neural basis of human attachment security remains zzso Using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and simultaneous recordings of skin zzso levels, we measured neural and zzso responses in healthy adult individuals during a semantic conceptual zzso task measuring human attachment security zzso zzso Performance during a stress but not a neutral prime condition was associated with response in bilateral zzso Furthermore, levels of activity within bilateral zzso were highly positively correlated with attachment insecurity and zzso response during the stress prime zzso We thereby demonstrate a key role of the zzso in zzso zzso activity associated with human attachment zzso
