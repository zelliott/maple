zzso within the brain are commonly sampled using zzso zzso The advent of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso now allows zzso to zzso investigate specific regions, with exquisite zzso zzso We evaluated the safety and efficacy of this new surgical zzso 

Between January 1997 and June 1998, 35 brain zzso were performed in a zzso strength zzso zzso zzso All zzso were performed using zzso zzso zzso scanning was used to confirm accurate positioning of the biopsy needle within the region of zzso zzso pathological examination of the biopsy specimens was performed to verify the presence of diagnostic zzso and zzso and zzso imaging was performed to exclude the presence of zzso zzso Recently, magnetic resonance zzso targeting was used for six zzso 

zzso tissue was obtained in all 35 brain zzso and was used in therapeutic zzso zzso diagnoses included 28 primary brain tumors (12 zzso zzso 9 zzso 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso 1 lymphoma, and 1 zzso zzso 1 melanoma brain zzso 1 cavernous zzso zzso 1 cerebral zzso 1 zzso process, and 3 cases of radiation zzso In all cases, magnetic resonance zzso was accurate in distinguishing zzso tumors (five zzso from radiation necrosis (one zzso No patient sustained clinically or zzso significant zzso as determined by zzso imaging performed immediately after the zzso One patient zzso suffered transient zzso after a zzso biopsy for investigation of a brain stem zzso Another patient developed scalp zzso with possible zzso extension, 3 weeks after the zzso this condition was effectively treated with zzso zzso Three patients were discharged on the day of the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a safe and effective method for evaluating zzso of the zzso zzso resonance zzso targeting is likely to augment the diagnostic yield of brain zzso
