zzso resonance zzso zzso is an emerging imaging technique for direct zzso of zzso and pancreatic ducts without the need for an invasive zzso zzso radiation, or zzso contrast media zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of zzso zzso in depicting normal and diseased zzso and pancreatic zzso A retrospective analysis of 162 patients who underwent zzso was performed, and a comparison between zzso and direct zzso was zzso The overall accuracy of zzso in diagnosing zzso and benign zzso diseases was also zzso zzso depicted more than three zzso segments in zzso of patients with zzso zzso ducts and in zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the main zzso zzso zzso and zzso duct in zzso zzso and zzso of patients, zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso pancreatic duct were zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of patients, zzso The accuracy of zzso in diagnosing zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The obstruction levels and characteristics determined by zzso were in agreement with those determined from direct zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of benign zzso The overall accuracy of a combination of zzso and conventional magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing zzso diseases was zzso for zzso diseases, zzso for benign diseases, and zzso for stone zzso We conclude that zzso zzso can reliably depict normal and diseased zzso ducts except for zzso ducts and zzso pancreatic zzso
