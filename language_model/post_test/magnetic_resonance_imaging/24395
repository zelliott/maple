In the setting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso findings can potentially be mistaken as the cause rather than a secondary zzso zzso of the zzso zzso drainage can lead to zzso of fluid into the zzso air zzso We zzso that a zzso of the zzso manifestations secondary to zzso zzso zzso zzso can be seen on zzso and that the difference in zzso drainage between the zzso and middle ears can assist with this important imaging zzso 

A retrospective review of acute zzso zzso zzso zzso cases and their follow-up imaging were graded as zzso no zzso grade 1 zzso zzso grade 2, film of zzso or grade 3, complete zzso zzso of middle ear fluid was also zzso 

Of 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cases without clinical infectious zzso 19 had zzso findings: eight with grade 1, eight with grade 2, and three with grade zzso Middle ear fluid was seen in only one zzso There was a statistically significant association between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso findings zzso test zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Fifteen of 18 cases with follow-up zzso examinations showed zzso of the zzso findings with resolving zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may present with a spectrum of zzso findings that should not be zzso as the cause of the zzso This study illustrates that in the absence of clinical findings of zzso zzso fluid with a clear middle ear argues that the zzso changes are the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than the zzso
