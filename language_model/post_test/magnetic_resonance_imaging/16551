zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments are more complex compared with standard zzso imaging, involving additional data zzso and hardware along with complex analysis zzso Here, we propose guidelines based around zzso risks associated with the complexities of the technique at the level of the individual imaging zzso including zzso and effective quality zzso control procedures and rigorous, zzso analysis zzso Our aim is to provide a framework for zzso imaging zzso zzso enabling these requirements to be addressed at an appropriate level of zzso The development of a procedural framework for zzso in pharmaceutical zzso studies could lead to greater acceptance of the method within industry and facilitate validation and, eventually, zzso of the technique as an imaging zzso
