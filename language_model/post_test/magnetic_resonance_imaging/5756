A zzso fluid zzso zzso is a unique condition with which all spine surgeons need to be familiar, particularly those who use zzso approaches to the zzso zzso When direct zzso of the zzso zzso is not possible, techniques for indirect repair must be zzso 

To report a novel technique for repair of a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso graft after failure of initial treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Case zzso of zzso Memorial Medical zzso 

The case of a 65-year-old female is zzso 

The patient represented 5 weeks after the initial operation zzso zzso partial zzso zzso and removal of an zzso zzso zzso with zzso and severe zzso zzso Imaging of the brain revealed a zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso region demonstrated a zzso surrounding the zzso zzso She underwent a revision zzso and zzso zzso zzso We addressed the zzso opening indirectly by zzso a piece of zzso zzso zzso to the thickened zzso after zzso and zzso glue were placed over the zzso zzso A zzso drain and a chest tube were also zzso At 12 weeks zzso the zzso zzso had completely resolved and her chest zzso demonstrated a significant decrease in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso disc surgery poses a great challenge to the spine surgeon but can provide the most direct way of zzso the spinal zzso as a result of zzso zzso Some of the most difficult aspects of dealing with a zzso leak in this area relates to 1) the relative complexity of zzso the zzso directly as it is at a considerable distance from the operating zzso 2) the manner in which the zzso zzso slopes away and is hidden from zzso and 3) the relatively negative zzso pressure, which encourages the persistent flow of zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso We speculate that with open zzso surgery and the creation of a large potential space with an open zzso zzso this technique provided an additional barrier against the formation of a zzso zzso Using this technique, we intentionally create a zzso into the zzso zzso that is contained within the confines of our zzso zzso
