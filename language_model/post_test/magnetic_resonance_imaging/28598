To compare the diagnostic results following injection of zzso a high dose zzso zzso zzso of zzso injection and zzso the standard dose zzso zzso zzso of zzso in patients with zzso symptoms after surgery for zzso disc zzso 

Twenty patients with zzso or sustained symptoms after surgery for zzso disc zzso were zzso MR imaging zzso zzso was first performed before and after zzso at zzso zzso zzso and then within one month (17 zzso or within 3 months (3 zzso before and after zzso injection at zzso zzso zzso The examinations were first evaluated by 2 zzso blinded to dose but not to patient as the images were presented in zzso Six months later the same investigators evaluated the examinations again, this time blinded to both dose and zzso 

At the evaluation in pairs (with the investigators blinded to dose only) the high-dose examinations were considered the most zzso zzso However, at the later evaluation (with the investigators blinded both to dose and zzso no significant difference between high and standard dose was found regarding diagnosis or diagnostic zzso 

In this study the high-dose contrast enhancement of MR imaging at zzso T did not increase the diagnostic information for zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The high-dose images were considered more zzso when evaluated in pairs, but gave no additional or different information when evaluated zzso The study also indicated that comparisons in pairs should be interpreted with zzso
