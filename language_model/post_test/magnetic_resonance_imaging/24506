Free zzso associated with zzso stress play a major role in zzso lateral sclerosis zzso By combining zzso zzso and molecular magnetic resonance imaging, in zzso trapped radical zzso were detected in the spinal cords of zzso zzso mice, a model for zzso For this study, the zzso spin trap zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso over 5 days before administration zzso of an zzso probe zzso zzso zzso bound to an zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso to trap free zzso zzso was used to detect the presence of the zzso radical zzso by a significant sustained increase in MR signal zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso probe zzso measured from zzso relaxations zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso probe was targeted with zzso zzso to locate the probe in excised zzso zzso controls included either zzso ALS mice initially administered saline rather than zzso followed by the zzso probe or zzso mice initially administered zzso and then the zzso zzso The zzso probe was found to bind to zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also confirmed in zzso zzso from animals administered zzso zzso diffusion zzso from zzso images of spinal cords from zzso mice were significantly elevated zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso This is the first report regarding the detection of in zzso trapped radical zzso in an ALS zzso This novel, zzso in zzso diagnostic method can be applied to investigate the involvement of free radical mechanisms in ALS zzso zzso
