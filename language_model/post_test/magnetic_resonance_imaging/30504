zzso zzso have been studied widely as zzso contrast agents to increase the sensitivity of this zzso This work describes the synthesis and characterization of magnetic zzso zzso as a novel zzso contrast zzso 

zzso with high zzso zzso were zzso by the synthesis of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso directly in the pores of zzso zzso zzso The zzso were characterized by electron zzso zzso quantum interference device and zzso zzso studies on in zzso zzso and cell labeling were carried zzso 

The zzso retained the zzso characteristics in bulk solutions with a considerably high zzso zzso of 95 zzso The nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso for zzso of 500 zzso in length and of 60 zzso in diameter were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 264 zzso 56 zzso and, for the zzso of 2 zzso in length and 70 zzso in diameter, the zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 65 zzso zzso In zzso cell labeling showed promising results with excellent labeling zzso No cellular toxicity was observed in zzso 

The integration of zzso with zzso zzso the zzso characteristics of zzso onto the zzso creating unique magnetic zzso with zzso The zzso showed promising results as a zzso contrast agent with high zzso zzso little zzso and high zzso zzso
