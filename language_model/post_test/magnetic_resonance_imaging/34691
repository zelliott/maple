In this retrospective study, a zzso series of a pediatric population undergoing zzso zzso is zzso 

To review the experience with children treated with zzso zzso and zzso or zzso cervical zzso for zzso zzso to determine the zzso of zzso and to identify factors zzso of cervical zzso 

Upper cervical zzso in the pediatric population has a significant risk of zzso zzso To decrease the zzso of this complication, a concerted effort was made to avoid violation of the facet joint during cervical zzso 

zzso patients zzso age zzso years, range 1 day to 18 zzso had surgical zzso of zzso I or II zzso throughout a zzso period zzso zzso and operative records were analyzed to determine the number of cervical levels zzso and extent of zzso 

Mean follow-up was zzso years zzso 9 months to 7 zzso Only one patient had clinical and zzso evidence of zzso and required zzso zzso Two others had zzso signs of mild cervical zzso but remained zzso These three patients had zzso complete zzso zzso patients had no clinical or zzso evidence of cervical zzso A mean of three cervical levels were zzso zzso zzso including partial zzso complete zzso and one zzso zzso to drain a lower cervical zzso The overall frequency of zzso in this series zzso was substantially lower than in previous zzso Although the number of cervical levels zzso did not correlate with cervical instability, the one patient with clinical instability had zzso violation of the facet joint, suggesting that zzso zzso may be a critical factor that zzso patients to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso after zzso zzso is a recognized complication of cervical zzso in children, the frequency of which may be decreased by careful attention to operative zzso
