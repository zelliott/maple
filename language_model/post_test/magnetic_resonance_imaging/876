zzso zzso disorders zzso refer to a group of disorders of zzso zzso causing zzso migration disorder, delayed zzso and zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of zzso imaging zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso compared with that of conventional zzso imaging in assessing the extent of white matter damage in patients with zzso 

Three patients zzso 12, 16, and 80 zzso with zzso zzso 1 protein targeting sequence zzso and three zzso control subjects underwent MR imaging on a zzso zzso The protocol included zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso changes were calculated using regions of interest at several zzso white matter areas and compared with those of zzso control zzso zzso maps were obtained to zzso the range of zzso zzso 

On the zzso images, one patient revealed severe zzso throughout the zzso the two other patients showed focal abnormal zzso zzso All patients had significantly decreased zzso values in white matter areas that appeared abnormal on the zzso zzso In two of the three patients, significant zzso reduction was also found in zzso white zzso The zzso values of the patients were significantly increased compared with those of the zzso zzso 

Although based on a small number of patients, our data suggest that zzso and zzso can be used to characterize and zzso white matter tract injury in patients with zzso Furthermore, our data suggest that these techniques have the potential to identify neurodegenerative changes not yet visible on zzso zzso
