In zzso imaging of zzso zzso load as a zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso would be of considerable clinical relevance for the early diagnosis and monitoring of treatment zzso Here, we investigated automated zzso of in zzso zzso relaxation time as a surrogate measure of plaque load in the brains of ten zzso transgenic mice (age 20 weeks) using in zzso zzso acquisitions on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice present with zzso cerebral zzso and were compared with eight zzso zzso control mice zzso that do not develop zzso in zzso Data were analyzed with a novel automated zzso analysis that allowed mapping the entire brain for significant signal zzso In zzso mice, we found a significant decrease in zzso relaxation times in the deeper zzso zzso zzso thalamus, zzso and zzso compared to zzso zzso These changes were in line with the zzso distribution of cerebral zzso plaques and activated zzso Grey matter density did not differ between zzso mice and zzso mice, consistent with a lack of zzso loss in zzso zzso zzso zzso with automated mapping of zzso time changes may be a useful tool for the detection of plaque load in living transgenic animals, which may become relevant for the evaluation of zzso lowering intervention effects in future zzso
