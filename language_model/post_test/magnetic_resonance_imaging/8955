The purpose of our study was to test the hypothesis that real-time zzso selective injection procedures of the zzso zzso are zzso accurate, and safe when performed on a clinical zzso zzso MR zzso 

A retrospective analysis of 67 injection procedures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were therapeutic injections, zzso zzso were diagnostic injections, and zzso zzso were zzso zzso performed in 31 patients zzso zzso female, zzso zzso zzso mean age, 14 years; age range, zzso zzso was zzso Seven of 38 zzso subjects had two temporally separate zzso zzso of skin entry points, zzso and injection were performed under real-time zzso Data were assessed for rate of successful injections, quantitative and qualitative image quality, time requirements, and occurrence of zzso 

Drug delivery was successful in all zzso The quality of real-time zzso zzso MR images was sufficient in all zzso zzso zzso proved to be helpful to achieve high rates of zzso zzso zzso ratios were sufficiently high for good zzso of relevant zzso Average length of time was 25 minutes zzso zzso zzso No major complications zzso 

We accept the hypothesis that real-time zzso selective injection procedures of the zzso zzso are zzso accurate, and safe when performed on a clinical zzso zzso MR zzso
