The internal flow dynamics were assessed in 16 cerebral zzso by zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso Six of the zzso were associated with zzso zzso and 10 were zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated a 51% zzso zzso increase in volume between zzso and zzso while the increase in volume of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated an approximate zzso to zzso increase in diameter in at least one dimension during zzso There was no relationship between aneurysm size and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso MR zzso can detect structural weakness in the zzso zzso Imaging techniques that can evaluate zzso wall dynamics may be useful in therapeutic zzso
