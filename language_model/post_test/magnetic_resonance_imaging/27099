There is emerging evidence for a connection between the surface zzso of the brain and its underlying zzso The foundation for this relationship is thought to be established during brain development through the shaping influences of tension exerted by zzso nerve zzso The zzso zzso results in compact wiring that enhances efficient neural zzso zzso with schizophrenia present with multiple symptoms that can include impaired thought, action, perception, and zzso The global nature of these symptoms has led researchers to explore a more global disruption of zzso connectivity as a theory to explain the vast array of clinical and cognitive symptoms in zzso If cerebral function and form are linked through the organization of neural zzso then a disruption in neural connectivity may also alter the surface zzso of the zzso This paper reviews zzso theories of zzso and the potential interaction between zzso and zzso zzso Studies of zzso abnormalities in children, zzso and adults with schizophrenia demonstrate a relationship between disrupted function and altered zzso in the surface patterns of the cerebral zzso This altered form may provide helpful clues in understanding the zzso abnormalities associated with zzso
