In zzso areas of normal zzso magnetic resonance zzso signal intensity indicate the presence of zzso which are strongly suspected of being zzso The goal of the study was to define the prevalence and the nature of these zzso MR zzso at the time of diagnosis in 116 patients included in a prospective study assessing the accuracy of MR imaging zzso in the zzso of liver iron zzso 

zzso of the 116 patients had zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso slices were performed using zzso and zzso zzso echo sequences with a zzso zzso zzso 

Six of 79 zzso zzso patients had one or more MR zzso zzso Five of the six patients proved to have zzso zzso Four of six zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso in zzso patients with severe zzso 

The present data confirm the high prevalence of liver cancer at the time of diagnosis, mainly in zzso patients greater than 45 years of age, and indicate that, when performing zzso for liver iron zzso a complete zzso zzso examination is preferable to a simple signal measurement in patients at risk for zzso zzso
