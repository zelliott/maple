Currently, the surgical approach to zzso zzso can vary depending on the size and expansion of the zzso although surgical treatment still relies on the anterior bilateral zzso Since 1989, we have use the zzso approach as a standard procedure in the treatment of 37 consecutive zzso We present our results in an attempt to contribute an alternative and valid surgical strategy for the treatment of these zzso 

Between 1989 and 1996, a series of 37 consecutive patients underwent zzso tumor zzso using the unilateral zzso zzso all patients except one underwent operations on the right zzso In 23 patients zzso the tumor diameter measured approximately 6 zzso and the size was less than 4 zzso in only 5 zzso The clinical presentation included mental dysfunction in 27 patients and visual impairment in 16 zzso The advantages of this approach are the early recognition of the zzso cerebrovascular complex, followed by a safe, zzso and complete zzso of the tumor and later by a favorable dissection of the zzso area from the frontal vascular branches and zzso 

Total removal was achieved in all zzso There was one death unrelated to zzso All patients presenting with mental dysfunction or with zzso visual deficits recovered or zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging confirmed complete tumor removal and demonstrated the brain zzso to be preserved and intact, primarily on the side opposite from the zzso 

Our experience with the zzso approach suggests a greater role for this procedure in the treatment of zzso groove zzso
