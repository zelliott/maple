Complete zzso zzso is important for improving the prognosis of brain zzso zzso However, extensive zzso remains controversial because the zzso margin is difficult to be distinguished from surrounding brain zzso It has been established that zzso acid zzso acid, zzso can be used as a zzso diagnostic marker and a zzso for zzso therapy in surgical treatment of brain zzso We investigated the efficacy of zzso zzso guided zzso and zzso therapy on zzso brain zzso implanted in a rabbit zzso 

Eighty New Zealand rabbits implanted with zzso brain zzso were randomly assigned to five groups: control, conventional white light zzso a zzso therapy group, a zzso guided zzso group and a group in which guided zzso was followed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso under a surgical zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed with zzso zzso All animals were examined with zzso for presence of any residual zzso zzso The survival time of each rabbit was zzso 

All treatment groups showed a significantly extended survival time compared with the control zzso zzso guided zzso combined with zzso therapy significantly prolonged survival time, compared with guided zzso zzso zzso and the autopsy results confirmed removal of most of the zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso guided surgery and zzso therapy significantly reduce or delay local zzso increase the effectiveness of radical zzso and prolong the survival time of zzso bearing zzso Their combination has the potential to be used as a rapid and highly effective treatment of zzso brain zzso
