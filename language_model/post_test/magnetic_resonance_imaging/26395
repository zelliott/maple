After obtaining familial informed zzso between January 1996 and July 1997, 173 children (5 to 15 years old) with zzso cell disease were enrolled in a prospective zzso study using blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cerebral magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso and zzso performance evaluation zzso zzso zzso zzso Intelligence tests zzso zzso which were also performed in 76 sibling controls (5 to 15 years zzso Among the 173 patients with zzso cell disease zzso zzso for zzso zzso 8 zzso cell zzso zzso 3 zzso cell zzso zzso 7 zzso cell zzso C disease zzso 12 zzso had a history of overt stroke, and the zzso of abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso as mean middle cerebral artery zzso zzso 200 zzso or zzso was zzso in the overall study population and zzso in patients with zzso zzso cell anemia The silent stroke rate was zzso zzso impaired cognitive functioning was observed in zzso cell disease patients with a history of stroke zzso zzso and Full zzso zzso but also in patients with silent strokes zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso on magnetic resonance imaging were not the only factors of cognitive zzso zzso zzso Performance zzso and Full zzso zzso were strongly impaired in patients with severe chronic anemia zzso zzso or zzso zzso and in those with zzso zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that abnormal magnetic resonance imaging zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were independent factors of cognitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 75) in zzso cell disease zzso The zzso effect of low zzso has already been suggested, but this is the first report concerning an effect of zzso and showing that silent stroke alone is not a factor of cognitive deficit when not associated with low zzso or zzso The effect of zzso which is known to increase zzso and decrease zzso count, on cognitive functioning of zzso cell patients should be evaluated zzso
