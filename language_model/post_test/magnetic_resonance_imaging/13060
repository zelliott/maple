The purpose is to evaluate delayed enhancement zzso of the zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso compared with control zzso We also evaluated the zzso of DE and zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and 14 control subjects were evaluated by DE MR imaging, acquired using a two-dimensional segmented zzso prepared zzso sequence zzso zzso 250 zzso 15 zzso after intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso For the zzso of left zzso zzso we traced zzso and zzso borders, and regions of interest zzso were placed in each zzso For analysis of DE images, the zzso ratio zzso and the zzso ratio zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso The averaged zzso zzso and averaged zzso zzso per slice of the zzso zzso were zzso In the zzso group, we also evaluated the zzso of DE and the zzso function of the zzso Mean zzso was not significantly different between the studied zzso however, mean zzso was significantly higher in the zzso group zzso than in control subjects zzso In the zzso group, zzso was moderately related to zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso was significantly higher in the zzso group with low zzso zzso zzso than in the zzso group with high zzso zzso zzso In DE MR imaging, the zzso zzso of zzso usually has high zzso which may suggest zzso zzso of zzso may contribute to the diagnosis of zzso The level of zzso seems to correlate with zzso Using this technique, zzso of zzso is objective and very useful for the diagnosis of zzso and zzso function of zzso
