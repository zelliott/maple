The purpose of this paper is to clarify whether copper zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a cause of high intensity signal pattern on zzso images zzso by comparing the zzso proven copper zzso with MR zzso zzso surgically zzso zzso were zzso Distribution patterns of zzso copper by a modified zzso method on their maximum cut surfaces were compared with signal patterns on corresponding zzso The degree of copper zzso in tumor compared with surrounding liver tissue was higher in 6 zzso equal in 17 zzso and lower in 22 zzso High intensity pattern on zzso were observed in 3 of 6 zzso zzso 10 of 17 zzso zzso and 10 of 22 zzso zzso Distribution patterns of copper were not correlated with intensity patterns on zzso We conclude that the zzso effect of zzso copper zzso in zzso is insufficient to influence the zzso
