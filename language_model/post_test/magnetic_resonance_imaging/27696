zzso spots on zzso inversion recovery zzso images can be frequently detected in patients with zzso However, the origins of the cerebral zzso (including zzso spots on zzso zzso found in the previous studies are not zzso We sought to investigate the association between zzso spots on zzso images and zzso shunt zzso in migraine zzso 

zzso spots on zzso images were arbitrarily defined as small areas of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso was examined by a zzso zzso zzso with the agitated saline zzso The degree of zzso was zzso into four grades according to the number of zzso no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso single spots pattern, and zzso zzso zzso zzso We compared the results for migraine patients zzso zzso 49) with those for healthy controls zzso zzso zzso 

zzso spots on zzso images occurred in zzso zzso of them, zzso zzso had migraines and zzso zzso were healthy controls zzso zzso zzso The independent factors associated with zzso spots on zzso images were female, migraine patients, and zzso by zzso zzso In migraine patients, zzso was independently associated with zzso spots on zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso spots on zzso images were frequently found in migraine patients and might be associated with the presence of zzso in those zzso Further studies are needed to assess whether zzso spots have clinical implications in patients with zzso
