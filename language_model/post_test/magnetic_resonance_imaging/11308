We present an improvement to the traditional one-dimensional partial zzso method by extending the method to zzso The modified method allowed a full factor of two savings in time with much better coverage of the central zzso information and, because of this, smaller reconstruction zzso The residual magnitude error was found to correlate strongly with the residual phase zzso zzso simulation also indicated that with a zzso perfect phase information, the original magnitude image could be perfectly reconstructed with half of the zzso data points in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and human data sets were tested with edge differences ranging from zzso zzso with variable Gibbs zzso to zzso zzso with a blurred version of the zzso The method was found to be a valuable adjunct to human imaging for short zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso imaging and magnetic resonance zzso zzso methods, especially when short echo times were zzso
