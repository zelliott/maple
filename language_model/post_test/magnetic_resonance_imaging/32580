zzso models persist over the nature of long-term zzso zzso issues are whether episodic memory and recognition memory reflect the same underlying zzso and the extent to which various brain structures work as a single unit to support these zzso New findings that have resulted from improved resolution of functional brain imaging, together with recent studies of zzso and developments in animal testing, reinforce the view that recognition memory comprises at least two independent zzso one zzso and the other using familiarity zzso Only zzso recognition appears to depend on episodic zzso Attempts to map brain areas supporting these two putative components of recognition memory indicate that they depend on separate, but zzso zzso
