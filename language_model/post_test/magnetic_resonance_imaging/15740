zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are common features of both Alzheimer's disease zzso and zzso with zzso bodies zzso These regions show correlated activity at rest as part of the zzso zzso and they are connected by the zzso a white matter zzso zzso We zzso that zzso zzso would be associated with disruption of the zzso as determined by diffusion zzso zzso We recruited 15 people with zzso 16 with zzso and 15 healthy control subjects of similar zzso They were scanned on a zzso T zzso system with a zzso weighted zzso sequence and diffusion zzso zzso zzso The zzso images were segmented into zzso and white matter and zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso was estimated by calculating the mean zzso matter zzso volume from a region of interest in standard space and global zzso from the total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were calculated and also zzso zzso Using zzso a zzso correlation of zzso against zzso zzso global zzso and disease group was zzso We found a bilateral region adjacent to the zzso zzso and encompassing a branch of the zzso where global zzso correlated with fractional zzso after controlling for diagnosis and zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso disease progression as measured by global zzso is associated with disruption of the white matter which connects zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso in addition to the zzso in these regions in zzso and zzso there is also disruption to the white matter connecting zzso Future studies are needed to determine whether the disruption precedes or is zzso on zzso or zzso
