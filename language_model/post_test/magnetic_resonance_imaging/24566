zzso recognize faces exceptionally zzso However, the neural zzso of face recognition are still zzso zzso evidence in recent years suggests that the anterior zzso lobe zzso in particular zzso region in the ATL, is a probable locus of face zzso Unfortunately, functional zzso zzso studies encounter severe signal zzso in the zzso ATL, where that ATL face area zzso zzso all previous studies localized this region in no more than half of the subjects and its volume was relatively zzso Thus, a systematic exploration of the properties of the ATL face area is zzso In the current high-resolution zzso study we used zzso slice orientation, which permitted us to zzso the ATL face area in all the zzso Furthermore, the volume of the area was much larger than was reported in previous zzso zzso within subjects comparison with data collected with the commonly used zzso slice orientation confirmed that the advantage of the zzso slice orientation in revealing a reliable and larger zzso area in the zzso Finally, by displaying the zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso scanning together, we demonstrate an organization principle of a chain of zzso regions along the zzso axis in the zzso zzso lobe that is highly zzso across all zzso By using the procedure proposed here, a significant progress can be made in studying the neural zzso of face zzso
