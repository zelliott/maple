The objective of this study was to examine the functional connectivity of brain regions active during cued and zzso recognition memory to test the idea that distinct networks would zzso these memory zzso as predicted by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso hypothesis suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attention to memory retrieval during cued zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates spontaneous bottom-up capture of attention by memory during zzso zzso To identify networks associated with these two zzso we conducted a functional connectivity analysis of a left zzso and a left zzso region, both identified by a previous analysis of zzso regional zzso We hypothesized that the two zzso regions would be functionally connected with distinct neural networks, reflecting their engagement in the differential zzso zzso We found two zzso zzso networks that overlapped only in the zzso During cued trials, zzso was functionally connected with zzso attention areas, including the superior zzso zzso right zzso and zzso cortex, as well as relevant memory areas, such as the left zzso and the middle frontal zzso During zzso trials, zzso was functionally connected with zzso attention areas, including the zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso In addition, activity in the zzso network was associated with faster response times for cued zzso This is the first study to show a zzso of the functional connectivity of zzso zzso regions during episodic memory zzso characterized by a zzso zzso network involving zzso and a bottom-up zzso network involving zzso
