We describe an automated 3-D zzso system for in zzso brain magnetic resonance images zzso Our zzso method combines a variety of zzso zzso and registration techniques and makes maximum use of the available a zzso biomedical expertise, both in an implicit and an explicit zzso We approach the issue of boundary finding as a process of fitting a group of zzso templates zzso mesh zzso to the contours of the target zzso These templates evolve in zzso supervised by a series of rules derived from analyzing the zzso dynamics and from medical zzso The templates are also constrained by knowledge on the expected textural and shape properties of the target zzso We apply our system to segment four brain structures zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and discuss its zzso to imaging characteristics and acquisition zzso
