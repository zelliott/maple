This paper presents our experience in using zzso modeling of clinically relevant cases specifically in zzso zzso A zzso procedure integrated with a group of zzso zzso codes has been developed to clean the geometric zzso zzso the time required for generate the zzso zzso mesh of zzso from zzso CT data has been reduced to less than 40 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are shown to be consistent and can be used for further modeling and zzso
