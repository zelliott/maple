Because few have reported the zzso significance of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso for idiopathic pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso in this study we evaluated the value of zzso zzso as a zzso predictor of zzso before starting intravenous zzso zzso 

A total of 121 consecutive zzso studies for evaluating right zzso zzso function were zzso zzso patients were diagnosed with zzso and served as the study zzso zzso such as age, sex, New York Heart Association functional class zzso zzso walk test, plasma brain zzso zzso level, serum zzso acid level and zzso zzso were analyzed as zzso of first hospitalization and zzso The mean follow-up period was zzso zzso Nine patients were hospitalized because of heart failure, and 4 patients died from zzso zzso The zzso analyses suggested that the left zzso zzso mass index, the left and right zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso the zzso and RV zzso volume zzso zzso zzso and zzso predicted the risk for hospitalization and that zzso zzso and zzso predicted zzso The zzso analyses suggested that zzso and zzso are independent zzso of both hospitalization and zzso The effects of zzso and zzso on hospitalization were not substantially affected by the zzso zzso 

In zzso patients, the zzso predicts both hospitalization for right heart failure and mortality before initiating intravenous zzso zzso
