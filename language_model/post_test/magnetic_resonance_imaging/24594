The aim of this study was to investigate zzso whether zzso plaque imaging can identify patients with zzso carotid artery zzso who have an increased risk for future cerebral zzso zzso plaque imaging allows categorization of carotid zzso into different zzso types zzso Within these zzso types, zzso types zzso and VI are regarded as zzso zzso whereas the other zzso types represent stable zzso 

zzso consecutive patients zzso male zzso age zzso years zzso zzso zzso presenting with an zzso carotid zzso of zzso according to zzso were zzso Patients were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso weighted studies were zzso The carotid plaques were classified as zzso type zzso Clinical zzso were zzso stroke, zzso or zzso zzso Survival analysis and log rank test were used to ascertain statistical zzso 

Six out of 83 patients zzso were zzso 4 patients had insufficient MR image zzso 1 patient was zzso 1 patient died shortly after the baseline zzso plaque zzso The following results were obtained by analyzing the remaining 77 zzso The mean time of follow-up was zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cerebrovascular events zzso Only patients presenting with the high-risk zzso types zzso and VI developed an zzso cerebrovascular event versus none of the patients presenting with the stable zzso types III, zzso and VIII zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso survival was higher among patients with the zzso stable zzso types zzso zzso and zzso than in patients with the high-risk zzso types zzso and zzso zzso rank test zzso 

zzso plaque imaging has the potential to identify patients with zzso carotid zzso who are particularly at risk of developing future cerebral zzso zzso could improve selection criteria for invasive therapy in the zzso
