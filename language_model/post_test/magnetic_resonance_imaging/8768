We examined the cognitive function of 32 zzso patients and 16 healthy volunteers by zzso tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed the zzso and zzso tasks to assess attention and zzso zzso The patients were divided into two groups by illness zzso a short-term group zzso zzso zzso and a long-term group zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to determine the differences between these two groups and the normal control group zzso 

The long-term group showed attention deficit and zzso memory dysfunction on the zzso zzso In contrast, on functional magnetic resonance imaging, the short-term group showed weaker zzso of the right zzso during the zzso task and stronger zzso of the right zzso prefrontal zzso during the zzso task than the long-term and normal control zzso 

The results suggested that abnormal brain zzso occurs in the early phase of zzso and that the long-term persistence of zzso might involve a decline in cognitive zzso
