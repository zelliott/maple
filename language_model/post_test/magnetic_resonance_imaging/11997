We have examined 46 patients with zzso confirmed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso In each patient, zzso and zzso zzso sequences were obtained in a plane angled in the zzso and zzso direction in the long axis of the zzso left and right zzso volumes, ejection zzso and zzso zzso were zzso In addition, a zzso sensitive zzso echo sequence was obtained in order to determine the direction and extent of the zzso zzso The data was compared with the results of zzso and zzso By means of the zzso echo technique, zzso was able to show the zzso jet in every zzso There was a linear correlation between volumes determined by zzso and zzso The best agreement was found for left zzso contraction volume (R zzso zzso p is less than zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso method showed a linear correlation for zzso patients of R zzso zzso zzso is less than zzso which is somewhat better than for patients with zzso (R zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso grading of zzso with a zzso echo technique showed a linear correlation with zzso of R zzso zzso zzso less than zzso for zzso there was agreement between both methods in zzso of zzso A comparison between zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed only moderately good correlation R zzso zzso zzso less than zzso
