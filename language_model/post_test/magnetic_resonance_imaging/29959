To evaluate the effects of zzso administration of an zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso to treat zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso tumor was implanted beneath the liver capsule in 26 zzso zzso Animal subjects were assigned to groups based on which treatment was injected into the zzso zzso group A, zzso + zzso group B, zzso alone; and group C, normal zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso tumor pathology, and zzso were performed to assess each zzso 

The ratios of the zzso to zzso tumor volumes zzso in groups A, B, and C were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso potential of the tumors was assessed by tumor cell nest counts, which were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in groups A, B, and C, zzso zzso density zzso was zzso by measuring von zzso factor density values, which were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in groups A, B, and C, zzso 

zzso infusion of zzso combined with zzso noticeably inhibited the growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
