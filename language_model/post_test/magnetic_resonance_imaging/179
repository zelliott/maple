A link between negative emotional state and abnormal visceral sensation has been frequently zzso However, the influence of negative emotion on brain processing of painful visceral sensations has not been zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and negative emotional stimuli to investigate the effects of negative emotion on brain processing of zzso zzso 

Twelve healthy male volunteers (age range, zzso zzso participated in the zzso zzso emotion was induced using emotionally zzso zzso zzso images were acquired during 2 experimental zzso throughout these, volunteers received zzso zzso and painful zzso to the esophagus during neutral and negative zzso zzso perception of each stimulus was acquired, as were mood zzso 

zzso ratings increased significantly following negative mood induction zzso zzso zzso There was no significant effect of emotion on zzso perception of painful and zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso Following painful zzso brain activity increased in the right zzso during negative emotion and was localized to the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso and inferior frontal zzso Following zzso stimulation during negative emotion, brain activity increased in the right anterior zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 

This study provides new information about the influence of negative affect on central processing of visceral zzso Evidence of right zzso dominance during negative emotion indicates this zzso is predominately associated with sympathetic activity zzso negative zzso and that the right zzso and right zzso are integral to zzso awareness of emotion through zzso
