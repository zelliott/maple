To address prior reports that schizophrenia is associated with loss of normal brain asymmetry and that it might be linked to a zzso of a gene controlling cerebral zzso we measured on three-dimensional cortical renderings from magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans the lengths and angles of the zzso fissures in 10 normal zzso zzso twin pairs zzso zzso 10 zzso and in 10 zzso pairs zzso for schizophrenia zzso zzso 10 zzso We confirmed in both sets of twins the expected normal zzso of length and angle of the zzso zzso We also confirmed that the length asymmetry occurs solely in the region of the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso affected and unaffected twins did not differ in asymmetry measures, thus failing to support an association between illness per zzso and diminished zzso Moreover, the zzso twins as a group did not differ from the normal twins as a group, thus failing to confirm the hypothesis of a genetic association with abnormal zzso The implications of variations in methodology and patient samples are zzso
