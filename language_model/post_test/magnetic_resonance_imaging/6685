zzso theories of implicit or unaware learning propose a zzso zzso model, with implicit function maturing early in infancy or childhood despite prolonged improvements in explicit or intentional learning and memory systems across zzso zzso studies of adult zzso sequence learning have associated zzso brain regions with implicit learning of spatial zzso Given evidence of continued development in these brain regions during childhood, we compare implicit sequence learning in adults and 7- to 11-year-old children to examine potential zzso differences in the recruitment of zzso zzso during implicit zzso Participants performed a standard serial reaction time zzso zzso alternately followed a fixed zzso sequence of locations or were presented in a zzso order of zzso Adults outperformed children, achieving a significantly larger sequence learning effect and showing learning more quickly than zzso zzso differences in activity were observed in the zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso We observed differential recruitment of cortical and zzso motor systems between groups, presumably reflecting age differences in motor response zzso Adults showed greater zzso activity for sequence trials, whereas children demonstrated greater signal during random zzso zzso in the right zzso correlated significantly with behavioral measures of implicit learning for both age groups, although adults showed greater signal change than children overall, as would be expected given zzso differences in sequence learning zzso These results challenge the idea of zzso zzso in implicit learning and instead support a view of parallel developments in implicit and explicit learning zzso
