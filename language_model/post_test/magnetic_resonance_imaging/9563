It has been demonstrated that an extensive zzso zzso or zzso may significantly increase the overall survival in patients with WHO Grade II zzso zzso zzso zzso Yet, recent data have shown that conventional MR imaging zzso the spatial extent of zzso since tumor cells were found up to 20 zzso around MR imaging zzso Thus, it was hypothesized that an extended zzso with a margin beyond MR zzso zzso zzso zzso improve the outcome of zzso However, because of the frequent location of zzso within zzso brain areas, it is often difficult to achieve such a zzso zzso This could nevertheless be possible when zzso involve zzso areas, even in the left dominant zzso The authors report on their use of awake electrical mapping to tailor the zzso according to functional zzso that is, to pursue the zzso beyond MR zzso zzso until zzso eloquent structures are zzso Their aim was to apply this reliable surgical technique to zzso located not within eloquent areas but distant from eloquent areas, to take a margin around the zzso visible on MR imaging while preserving brain zzso 

Fifteen right-handed patients with a total of 17 tumors underwent zzso of WHO Grade II zzso involving zzso areas within the left dominant zzso In all patients, zzso were the initial manifestation of the zzso zzso surgery with zzso zzso was performed in all zzso The zzso was continued until the surgeon reached cortical and zzso areas crucial for brain function, especially language, as defined by the zzso electrical zzso The extent of zzso was evaluated on zzso zzso MR zzso 

Despite transient neurological worsening in zzso of cases, all patients recovered and returned to a normal zzso zzso control was obtained in all patients with a decrease of zzso drug zzso zzso MR imaging showed that total zzso was achieved in all 17 tumors and zzso zzso in zzso The average volume of the zzso cavity zzso zzso was significantly larger than the mean zzso tumor volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso examination confirmed the diagnosis of WHO Grade II zzso in all zzso The mean duration of zzso follow-up was zzso months zzso zzso zzso Only 4 of 15 patients experienced recurrence (without zzso zzso the average time to recurrence in these cases was 38 zzso zzso was performed 6 years after the zzso in 1 zzso no other patients received any zzso zzso This series was compared with a control group of 29 patients who had zzso complete zzso zzso transformation was observed in 7 cases in the control group but not in any case in the series of patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment was administered in 10 patients in the control group compared with 1 patient who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These findings support the usefulness of awake surgery with zzso functional zzso mapping with the attempt to perform zzso zzso of zzso involving zzso areas in the left zzso Indeed, the extent of zzso was significantly increased in all cases but 2, with no additional permanent deficit and with control of zzso in all zzso The goal of zzso zzso is currently to delay the zzso zzso even if it does not zzso enable a zzso
