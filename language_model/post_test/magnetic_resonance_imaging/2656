We recently developed zzso zzso a zzso zzso with the very high affinity of 20 zzso for zzso receptors in zzso The aim of the present exploratory study was to examine the anatomical distribution of zzso zzso binding in the human brain and to determine zzso zzso occupancy in antipsychotic zzso zzso zzso was used to obtain reference values for zzso zzso occupancy in the zzso After IV injection of zzso zzso there was a high concentration of zzso not only in the zzso zzso but also in the zzso and the zzso zzso The concentration of zzso in the frontal cortex, the zzso zzso and the zzso was slightly higher than in the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso indicated that zzso zzso binding in zzso regions to a high degree represent specific binding to zzso zzso The zzso in antipsychotic zzso patients was on the same level in the zzso and the zzso zzso as that determined with zzso in the zzso The study shows that zzso zzso has potential for quantitative zzso of zzso receptors in zzso
