In zzso lung zzso difference maps of acquisitions during inhalation of room air and pure oxygen are calculated to assess lung zzso The purpose of this study was to analyze how the calculation of these difference maps depends on the delayed signal change after switching the gas zzso 

Ten healthy volunteers were examined with an zzso and zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso sequence with parallel zzso Four blocks with 20 repetitions of up to 6 zzso slices were continuously zzso in blocks 1 and 3 room air was zzso in blocks 2 and 4 zzso Data were zzso discarding between 0 and 19 repetitions after each change of gas supply before calculating the relative signal zzso 

The averaged relative signal difference increases from zzso to zzso when the number of discarded acquisitions increases; the ratio of signal difference and spatial standard zzso reaches a maximum at 5-8 discarded zzso 

An zzso ratio of signal difference and statistical error is found if about 5-8 of 20 zzso repetitions are discarded after each change of gas supply for the calculation of difference zzso
