Using functional imaging, we recently investigated how repeated painful stimulation over several days is zzso perceived and modulated in the healthy human zzso Considering that zzso brain plasticity in humans on a structural level has already been demonstrated in adults, we were interested in whether repeated painful stimulation may lead to structural changes of the zzso 14 healthy subjects were zzso daily with a 20 zzso pain paradigm for 8 consecutive days, using structural zzso performed on days 1, 8, 22 and again after 1 zzso Using zzso based zzso we are able to show that repeated painful stimulation resulted in a substantial increase of gray matter in pain zzso areas, including zzso and zzso zzso These changes are stimulation dependent, zzso they recede after the regular zzso input is zzso This data raises some interesting questions regarding structural plasticity of the brain concerning the experience of both acute and chronic zzso
