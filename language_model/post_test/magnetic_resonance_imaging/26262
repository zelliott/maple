Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso allows zzso of the zzso membrane and measurement of zzso within the zzso A cohort of patients with early zzso arthritis zzso were studied using zzso of the dominant wrist and clinical zzso zzso between zzso and the shared zzso zzso zzso were looked for and zzso as a predictor of joint erosion was zzso 

zzso zzso scans of the dominant wrist were performed in 42 early zzso patients at baseline zzso disease duration zzso 4 zzso and after 1 zzso Images were obtained at zzso intervals over the first 6 zzso after zzso zzso acid injection using six cuts in the zzso plane, 2 zzso zzso The site of zzso zzso enhancement was selected as the region of interest zzso The rate of enhancement zzso was calculated and compared with zzso scores from zzso zzso scans, clinical disease activity scores and zzso zzso zzso primer zzso chain reaction zzso and DNA zzso 

zzso of the zzso measurement was assessed by re-evaluating 10 randomly selected scans in a blinded zzso zzso reliability was high with an zzso correlation zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The zzso correlated strongly at baseline with the maximum level of zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was also a weaker but significant correlation between zzso and the pain score zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso fell from baseline to 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with clinical improvement after treatment with standard zzso zzso scores were higher in zzso than zzso - patients zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and were zzso of zzso zzso at 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso P zzso zzso The baseline zzso protein zzso was also zzso of zzso zzso at 1 zzso to a similar degree zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso ), P zzso zzso but the mean zzso zzso score at baseline was the strongest predictor zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso P zzso zzso 

These results show that dynamic zzso can be used to score zzso zzso in early zzso zzso zzso was greater in zzso patients, suggesting an early genetic influence on joint zzso and was zzso for the development of zzso at 1 zzso
