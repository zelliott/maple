zzso and central white matter zzso volumes were measured to assess zzso and long-range connectivity in zzso zzso zzso included 23 boys with zzso and 23 matched controls, all without intellectual zzso zzso resonance imaging data obtained at zzso T were analyzed using zzso software (University of Iowa, Iowa City, zzso zzso Central zzso volume was zzso by zzso cortical from zzso zzso zzso zzso central zzso volume was observed in the zzso zzso zzso was higher in controls with no observed correlations between zzso volumes and zzso This preliminary evidence of reduced central zzso volume in zzso suggests abnormal long-range zzso
