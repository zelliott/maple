The role of zzso iron oxide as a zzso contrast medium has been established in humans, especially for zzso zzso zzso iron oxide particles exhibit a zzso zzso to the zzso system, where they predominantly shorten zzso zzso relaxation zzso Most zzso tumors lack zzso zzso therefore, the zzso of tumors remains virtually unchanged after administration of zzso iron zzso The resulting loss of signal intensity from the liver, with unchanged tumor signal intensity, increases zzso zzso In this study, MR images were acquired with fast zzso echo recalled at steady state zzso in five zzso dogs before and after injection of zzso iron zzso The effect of zzso iron oxide on signal intensity of the liver with time was zzso A signal intensity decrease of zzso was detected at 20 minutes, and it continued to decrease until the last time point of MR scanning zzso zzso The liver intensity of all dogs dropped to half its value after 20 zzso The effect of motion was minimized by breath zzso zzso iron oxide did not have any adverse effects on the zzso
