This study was performed to predict the factors that can zzso zzso staging for clinically localized prostate cancer zzso 

zzso and Cox zzso multivariable analyses were performed on zzso zzso prostate cancer patients to evaluate the ability of clinical stage, prostate specific zzso zzso biopsy zzso sum, percent positive zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso results to predict for zzso established zzso extension zzso seminal zzso invasion zzso and time to zzso zzso zzso 

The characteristics of clinically zzso prostate cancer patients at high risk zzso zzso for zzso zzso failure within 3 years include: zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso sum zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso positive for zzso disease and intermediate risk zzso For patients at intermediate risk zzso either a zzso zzso 4 and biopsy zzso sum of 7; zzso zzso 4 to 10 zzso and biopsy zzso sum 5 to 7; or a zzso zzso 10 to 20 zzso and biopsy zzso sum 2 to zzso despite zzso positive zzso 50% of patients had zzso zzso zzso However, in the subset of zzso patients with a positive zzso for either zzso or zzso and at least 50% positive zzso all had zzso disease and failed zzso by 47 months zzso zzso patients with zzso 50% positive zzso had zzso zzso disease in at least zzso of the zzso 

Combined zzso staging using the zzso biopsy zzso sum, percent positive zzso and zzso zzso zzso findings in select patients can predict zzso stage and zzso zzso zzso zzso this combined zzso staging may zzso patient selection for phase 3 trials examining the role of zzso zzso zzso therapy for patients with clinically localized zzso
