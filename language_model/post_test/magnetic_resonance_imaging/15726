A review of the theory, technology, and use of radio frequency zzso coils for zzso zzso is zzso It includes a brief overview of MR zzso zzso analysis and discussions of the various coils commonly used in zzso zzso surface zzso linear volume zzso zzso and their zzso The scope is limited to zzso zzso zzso coils where the product zzso of the frequency f and the zzso diameter d is in the range zzso zzso Common applications include mouse brain and body coils from 125 to 750 zzso rat body coils up to 500 zzso and small surface coils at all zzso In this regime, all the sources of loss zzso zzso sample, zzso and transmission zzso are zzso All such losses may be accurately captured in some modern zzso zzso zzso software, and new simulation results are presented for a selection of surface coils using zzso Studio 2006 by Computer zzso Technology, showing the dramatic importance of the zzso zzso Standard linear circuit zzso have been shown to be useful in zzso of complex zzso tuning and matching zzso There appears to be considerable potential for trading zzso for speed using phased zzso especially for a larger field of zzso Circuit zzso are shown to be useful for optimal zzso of zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso transistor for optimal zzso decoupling in phased zzso zzso cooled zzso coils are shown to offer considerable opportunity for future gains in zzso in smaller zzso
