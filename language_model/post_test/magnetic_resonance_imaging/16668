zzso zzso varies among brain structures and provides insights into the chemical and molecular composition of brain zzso However, the determination of an arbitrary zzso distribution from the measured MR signal phase is a challenging, zzso inverse zzso Although a previous method named calculation of zzso through multiple orientation sampling zzso has solved this inverse problem both theoretically and zzso using multiple angle acquisitions, it is often zzso to carry out on human zzso Recently, the feasibility of calculating the brain zzso distribution from a zzso acquisition was demonstrated using zzso enabled zzso inversion zzso In this study, we further improved the original zzso method by zzso the edges in the quantitative zzso map that do not have a corresponding edge in the magnitude zzso zzso zzso maps generated by the improved zzso were compared zzso and zzso with those generated by calculation of zzso through multiple orientation zzso The results show a high degree of agreement between zzso and calculation of zzso through multiple orientation zzso and the practicality of zzso allows many potential clinical zzso
