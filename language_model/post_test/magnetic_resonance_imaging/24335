zzso zzso has the potential to become a zzso contrast agent for lung zzso In addition to its utility for imaging of zzso zzso the property of xenon to zzso in lung tissue and blood upon inhalation provides the opportunity to study gas zzso zzso of imaging protocols for obtaining regional parameters that exploit the dissolved phase are limited by the available zzso ratio, zzso zzso and length of acquisition zzso To address these challenges, a zzso zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso transmit zzso tuned to the zzso zzso resonance at 3 T was zzso First results of zzso imaging in healthy subjects and subjects with zzso lung disease demonstrated the improvements in image quality by high-resolution ventilation images with high zzso zzso Parallel imaging performance of the zzso zzso was demonstrated by acceleration factors up to three in zzso acquisitions and up to six in zzso zzso zzso maps showed a regional variation of only zzso across the whole zzso The newly developed zzso receive zzso with the zzso transmit zzso will lead to an improvement in existing imaging zzso but zzso enable the development of new, functional lung imaging protocols based on the improvements in zzso zzso zzso ratio, and acquisition zzso
