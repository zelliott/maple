The cerebral blood volume zzso is a crucial zzso indicator of tissue viability and vascular zzso Thus, zzso zzso mapping has been of great zzso For this, zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso including zzso iron oxide zzso can be used as zzso zzso zzso agents of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso functional zzso zzso with zzso zzso provides enhanced sensitivity, reduced large vessel contribution and improved spatial specificity relative to conventional blood zzso zzso zzso and measures a single zzso zzso that is easily zzso We review the zzso and magnetic properties, and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso We then extensively discuss zzso of baseline zzso vessel size index and functional zzso zzso We also provide reviews of zzso sensitivity, vascular filter function, zzso characteristics and impulse response function of zzso zzso Examples of zzso zzso specificity at the zzso and zzso resolution are zzso Finally, we briefly review the application of zzso zzso to functional and pharmacological studies in zzso Overall, the use of zzso zzso can determine baseline zzso and its changes induced by functional activity and pharmacological zzso
