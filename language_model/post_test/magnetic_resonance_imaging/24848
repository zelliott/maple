zzso to treating zzso zzso disc zzso can be challenging due to the unique anatomy and the need to prevent spinal zzso Numerous approaches, including conventional zzso zzso minimally zzso and full zzso approaches, have been zzso The purposes of this study were to point out the outcome and clinical advantages of a zzso zzso approach and to describe and illustrate this zzso 

Between 2009 and 2012, a series of 51 patients underwent a minimally invasive zzso zzso zzso approach for the treatment of zzso zzso disc zzso All patients were clinically evaluated using the visual analog scale zzso and zzso zzso Index preoperatively and 6 months zzso 

Both pain scores and functional status showed significant improvement after surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso pain decreased from zzso score of zzso to one of zzso lower back pain from zzso score of zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso Index from zzso to zzso zzso analyses revealed no differences in outcome regarding obesity or timing of surgery zzso vs late zzso zzso significant was the correlation between zzso zzso pain activity and timing of surgical intervention zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso approach combines the advantages of the conventional open zzso approach and the zzso zzso The technique is easy to use with a steep learning zzso Less muscle trauma and the absence of zzso zzso prevent facet pain and instability, thereby contributing to a rapid zzso Patients in this series improved zzso in the short-term zzso
