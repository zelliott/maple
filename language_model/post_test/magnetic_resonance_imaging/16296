Every social group needs to decide when to provide public goods and how to allocate the costs among its zzso zzso this decision would maximize the group's net benefits while also ensuring that every zzso benefit is greater than the cost he or she has to zzso Unfortunately, the economic theory of mechanism design has shown that this ideal solution is not feasible when the group leadership does not know the values of the individual group members for the public zzso We show that this impossibility result can be overcome in laboratory settings by combining technologies for obtaining neural measures of value zzso magnetic resonance zzso pattern zzso with carefully designed institutions that allocate costs based on both reported and zzso measured zzso
