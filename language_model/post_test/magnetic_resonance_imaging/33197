Clinical applications of the zzso green zzso zzso the only near infrared zzso imaging dye approved by the Food and Drug Administration zzso in the USA, are limited due to rapid protein zzso fast zzso and instability in zzso relevant zzso zzso zzso in zzso particles can enhance its zzso minimize zzso increase the zzso zzso ratio and enable in zzso zzso Furthermore, a combined magnetic resonance zzso and zzso imaging particulate can integrate the advantage of high-resolution zzso anatomical imaging with zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso In this report, a novel synthesis technique that can achieve these goals is zzso A zzso synthesis protocol is employed to produce 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is achieved by manipulating zzso attractions with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and carrying out zzso synthesis in zzso mildly basic pH conditions using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso properties are imparted by zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show increased zzso (over a week) and minimal zzso as compared to the dye zzso The MR and optical imaging capabilities of these particles are demonstrated through zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso The described particles have the potential to act as zzso agents by combining zzso therapy through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
