A consecutive series of zzso treated small zzso zzso zzso up to 3 zzso in diameter, which are theoretically ideal candidates for zzso or zzso is zzso We intended to zzso the safety and efficacy of the zzso removal of zzso as compared with the results for zzso and zzso reported in the zzso 

zzso patients (32 female and 30 male zzso ranging in age from 7 to 72 years zzso age, zzso zzso were included in the zzso Of these, zzso presented with zzso zzso and zzso presented with zzso The 62 patients underwent zzso removal of their small zzso zzso cerebral zzso by the same zzso Twenty-six zzso zzso were assigned zzso Grade I, 24 zzso were assigned Grade II, and 12 zzso were assigned Grade zzso zzso zzso zzso were located in eloquent brain zzso All patients underwent zzso control zzso and clinical follow-up after 3 and 6 zzso 

The zzso were zzso as confirmed by zzso in all except one patient, thereby accounting for a zzso success rate per zzso zzso The rate of immediate new zzso neurological deficits or worsening of zzso neurological deficits was zzso and the rate of permanent significant neurological deficits was zzso at late zzso The rate of permanent significant deficits occurring after the zzso removal of small zzso in eloquent regions was zzso The mortality rate in the reported series was zzso The surgical morbidity rate was zzso 

zzso for small zzso is superior to zzso or zzso zzso because of its high rate of efficacy and low rate of permanent morbidity and because immediate cure of the zzso can be achieved in the vast majority of zzso The place for zzso in the treatment of small zzso needs to be more sharply defined after careful assessment of relevant cases by an experienced vascular zzso
