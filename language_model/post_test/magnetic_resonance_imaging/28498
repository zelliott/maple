Despite the increasing number of patients affected by zzso migration disorders zzso recently diagnosed in zzso by means of magnetic resonance imaging zzso few detailed data on the correlation between the zzso and the anatomical features in the single zzso case are zzso The present paper reports a combined zzso and zzso analysis, by means of zzso recognizing specific zzso and zzso zzso of three zzso diagnosed zzso patients surgically treated for the relief of intractable zzso The first case was a giant zzso zzso zzso of zzso normal zzso lacking any type of cortical zzso The second case was a layered zzso with an abnormal amount of zzso zzso in the underlying white zzso The third case was a focal cortical zzso characterized by a dramatic disruption of the normal cortical layering associated with marked zzso zzso The present data demonstrate that the zzso and zzso brain abnormalities can be markedly different in different zzso zzso and suggest that different anatomical zzso can zzso the intrinsic zzso of these brain zzso The relevance of further prospective zzso studies for a better understanding of the mechanisms determining the development of these brain zzso is zzso
