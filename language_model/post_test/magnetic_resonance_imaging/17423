A new methodology has been developed for the evaluation and zzso of brain tumors using information obtained by different magnetic resonance techniques such as in zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso may be used as a zzso technique that allows zzso monitoring of zzso to identify the different tissue types present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal or zzso zzso zzso resolution for treatment consideration may be improved by using zzso combined or fused with images obtained by zzso which exhibit excellent spatial zzso Some zzso schemes are presented and zzso The results show that zzso performed in this way efficiently determines the spatial zzso of the tumor both zzso and zzso It provides appropriate information for therapy planning and application of therapies such as zzso or zzso and future control of patient zzso
