Dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso and zzso models have been used to measure zzso zzso zzso and leakage volume zzso in numerous zzso The construction of zzso models describing such tissue properties relies on defining the blood plasma concentration of contrast agent with respect to time zzso When direct measurement is not possible a zzso zzso has been applied using data from healthy zzso This work zzso by zzso the magnitude of errors resulting from this definition with respect to normal variation in zzso function and for cases with zzso zzso Errors up to zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso were found for the normal simulations, and zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso for the impaired zzso If this zzso curve is used as an input function to the generalized kinetic model and used in zzso estimates of tissue zzso and leakage volume will possess large errors due to variation in zzso zzso between zzso
