To specifically investigate the effect that zzso disease may have on cortical zzso we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study patients with unilateral zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso from critical internal carotid or middle cerebral artery disease but without zzso We hypothesized that when these patients used the hand zzso to the zzso zzso they would show unique zzso in zzso areas of the normally zzso hemisphere, that is, zzso zzso We found that normal performance of two motor tasks was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso in the patients compared with zzso zzso In addition, although task difficulty had an effect on zzso zzso the increased zzso zzso seen in patients was not dependent on task zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso compromise alone is sufficient to cause zzso zzso zzso This zzso may serve to maintain normal motor zzso
