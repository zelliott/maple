Alzheimer's disease has become a major public health issue for zzso zzso Since animal models of Alzheimer's disease currently fail to perfectly mimic zzso mechanisms or the manifestations of the disease, in zzso zzso has a key role in better understanding the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso The diversity of anatomical and functional zzso techniques - anatomical zzso functional zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso via magnetic resonance imaging zzso as well as position zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso - offers a large possibility of investigation of brain zzso in Alzheimer's zzso These techniques have thus provided zzso and functional brain zzso mapping of Alzheimer's disease: on one hand zzso matter zzso first concerns the zzso zzso lobe before extending to the zzso zzso and then other zzso zzso on the other hand, zzso zzso are first located within the zzso zzso zzso and then reach the zzso area as well as the prefrontal cortex, especially in its zzso zzso zzso of white matter zzso with zzso have highlighted a variety of tract zzso including the zzso zzso a white matter tract connecting the zzso zzso lobe to the zzso zzso zzso Finally zzso zzso studies have evidenced zzso mechanisms through zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso these results have led to the hypothesis of two major zzso mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease: on one hand zzso mechanisms in regions where zzso exceeds zzso zzso on the other zzso between zzso zzso lobe and zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso accounting for higher zzso than structural zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Our work has extensively contributed to this zzso hypothesis thanks to the use of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It has zzso the relevance of distant over local mechanisms in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease and offers new perspectives to the exploration of the neural bases of cognitive zzso in this zzso
