The concept of cell therapy as an zzso therapy to zzso surgical zzso for patients with severe coronary artery disease is illustrated by two case reports of zzso cardiac disease that were zzso for zzso by coronary zzso The potential interaction of cell therapy, magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso and left zzso zzso restoration is zzso 

Each patient had an ejection fraction below zzso a relatively zzso heart, and zzso zzso scan showing predominantly viable zzso 

zzso injections of zzso bone zzso cells zzso were performed along with either incomplete coronary artery bypass zzso zzso (to mother zzso or with zzso laser zzso zzso An improvement in zzso function was seen at zzso intervals after the zzso 

The implications of possible underlying mechanisms of improvement in both zzso zzso and zzso suggest the striking importance of both zzso and zzso for any zzso therapeutic zzso These observations imply that the interaction of cell biology, viability by zzso and geometry may be important in the future, as geometry can be restored zzso and the new architectural form may develop enhanced function if it contains viable tissue and zzso treatment can be zzso
