A clinical case report is presented on a 76-year-old man who volunteered for a zzso T magnetic resonance zzso carotid zzso The subject was referred for carotid zzso and zzso was performed on the ex zzso zzso and compared with the in zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso T zzso for zzso MR protocol consisted of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bright and black blood imaging for detecting the zzso and vessel zzso 

The combination of zzso black blood zzso images and the zzso time of flight zzso images provided zzso of a narrowed internal carotid artery zzso 4 zzso above of the zzso and the presence of a complex zzso plaque containing a large zzso pool, zzso and intact zzso zzso zzso comparisons including vessel zzso and plaque area, zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratios were obtained for zzso and zzso T image zzso zzso composition was verified with zzso zzso were also detected in the shoulders of the plaque as demonstrated by zzso zzso and corresponded with a small zzso area in the zzso images at zzso zzso but not observed in comparable zzso T zzso 

High field zzso T zzso zzso of zzso plaque has been validated with zzso comparison and provides improved detection of complex zzso plaque with increased zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso Further studies zzso contrast mechanisms of plaque at zzso T are required, but zzso plaque imaging has clear benefit from application at the higher magnetic field zzso
