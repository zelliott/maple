zzso zzso in adults is an accepted form of treatment for patients with intractable complex partial zzso There have been few long-term studies of children undergoing zzso zzso for zzso 

We reviewed the pediatric cases of zzso zzso for intractable zzso performed by the Comprehensive zzso Program at the University of zzso zzso between 1988 and zzso All patients had zzso and zzso clinical evaluations, seizure charts, drug levels, zzso zzso long-term video zzso monitoring and zzso zzso The patients were zzso at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year zzso then zzso The duration of follow up was zzso years zzso 5 zzso 

zzso patients were studied zzso males and 17 zzso Age at surgery ranged from 18 months to 16 zzso The zzso zzso was abnormal in 38 of the 42 zzso Twenty-two patients had focal zzso discharge and 1 had generalized zzso zzso zzso slowing was seen in 9 patients and diffuse slowing in 5 zzso CT scan was abnormal in 17 of 39 patients and normal in 22 of zzso zzso was abnormal in 34 of 42 patients and normal in 8 of zzso zzso included brain tumors in 14 patients, zzso zzso sclerosis in 8, focal cortical zzso in 4, zzso sclerosis in 4, dual pathology in 4, zzso zzso in 1 and normal pathology or zzso in zzso zzso of 42 patients zzso were zzso following surgery and an additional 5 zzso had a decrease in seizure zzso Three patients had zzso but there were no zzso 

zzso zzso is a safe and effective treatment for children with intractable complex partial zzso zzso percent of patients are zzso following the surgery and there are few zzso zzso is superior to CT scan for detection of zzso lobe pathology yet failed to detect abnormalities in some zzso The most common zzso found were brain tumors, zzso zzso sclerosis and zzso zzso In addition to seizure control, many patients experienced improvement in cognitive and zzso function following zzso
