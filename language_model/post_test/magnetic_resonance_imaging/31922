We report a 7-year-old child who underwent brain zzso for a known seizure zzso The technique used for general zzso included inhalation induction followed by placement of a zzso mask airway zzso for airway zzso Because the reviewing zzso was unfamiliar with the use of an zzso during zzso and because the attending zzso did not communicate his technique to the zzso an zzso zzso was reported because of zzso created by the in zzso zzso As a result of this zzso the child was subjected to unnecessary subsequent testing to rule out a reported zzso zzso induced by the zzso Our case illustrates the need for coordination of patient care among hospital zzso
