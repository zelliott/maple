zzso zzso zzso processing of stimuli from inside the body, has been considered an important component of drug-taking zzso However, approaches to examine zzso sensitivity in humans have been zzso This study examined the hypothesis that adolescents with substance use disorder show altered zzso processing, measured by stimulating zzso zzso zzso via soft zzso 

zzso with substance use disorders zzso zzso and comparison youth zzso zzso underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during anticipation or reception of a positively zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso stimulation to the palm or zzso Visual analog scales zzso zzso zzso zzso experience zzso zzso zzso 

Across all conditions, zzso displayed attenuated left zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso Greater left anterior zzso and right zzso nucleus zzso was evident during the application of soft touch for zzso but not for zzso Whereas for zzso greater left anterior zzso zzso was associated with higher zzso ratings, zzso was linked to less anterior zzso zzso in zzso Finally, within zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso was related to more recent zzso zzso 

zzso adolescents exhibit blunted zzso processing of pleasant zzso heightened sensitivity in regions responsible for processing reward value, and altered relationships between zzso processing and zzso zzso
