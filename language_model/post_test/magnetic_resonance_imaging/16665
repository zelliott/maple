zzso magnetic resonance imaging of knee cartilage is a possible diagnostic method for zzso but low zzso ratio yields low spatial resolution images and long scan zzso For a given scan time, a zzso approach with reduced repetition time and increased averaging may improve zzso ratio and hence zzso zzso However, repetition time reduction results in increased power deposition, which must be offset with increased zzso pulse length and/or reduced flip angle to maintain an acceptable specific zzso zzso zzso varying flip angle, repetition time, and zzso pulse length were performed for constant power deposition corresponding to zzso zzso over the human knee at zzso zzso For zzso zzso simulation closely matched zzso For healthy human knee cartilage, a 37% increase in zzso ratio was predicted for zzso over zzso zzso parameters while a zzso zzso zzso increase was determined zzso zzso zzso volume of cartilage with zzso fluid, inaccurate relaxation parameters used in zzso and/or zzso splitting may be responsible for this zzso Excellent quality sodium images of the human knee were produced in 9 zzso at zzso T using the zzso ratio enhancing zzso zzso
