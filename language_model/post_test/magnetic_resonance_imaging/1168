Increased zzso fluid pressure zzso is a common finding in zzso tumors as a result of the abnormal tumor zzso and a lack of functional zzso A recent clinical study by Milosevic et zzso zzso zzso 61 (2001) zzso reported a link between elevated zzso and survival in patients with cancer of the zzso Patients with high zzso were more likely to have recurrence of tumors even after zzso and were also more likely to die of progressive disease, independent of other zzso zzso In this complementary study, using human data, we analyze 152 cervical tumor pressure zzso zzso from 42 patients with clinically diagnosed cancer of the zzso randomly selected from the sample of 102 patients involved in the original zzso We propose a simple zzso model, based on flow through porous media, to explain the time response of the measured pressure zzso in human cervical zzso The response of zzso was governed by a zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso 1 s averaged over multiple tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to be approximately equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
