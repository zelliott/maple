zzso zzso zzso zzso are of current interest because of their promise for improving zzso imaging and for zzso parallel transmission zzso One major drawback is that the zzso time of zzso designed zzso zzso zzso increases rapidly with their resolution and number of zzso This is critical because the construction of zzso zzso zzso often needs to be in real zzso The use of graphics processing units for zzso is a recent approach for accelerating image reconstruction zzso We propose the use of graphics processing units for the design of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso of parallel zzso Using a zzso computer with four zzso zzso zzso computing processors, we found acceleration factors on the order of 20 for standard zzso two-dimensional spiral zzso zzso with a 64 zzso 64 zzso resolution and a zzso dwell zzso We also show that even greater acceleration factors can be achieved for more complex zzso zzso
