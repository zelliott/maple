A common but potentially severe zzso afflicting permanent wheelchair users is pressure sores caused by elevated soft tissue strains and stresses over a critical prolonged period of zzso zzso there is paucity of information regarding deep soft tissue strains and stresses in the zzso of humans during zzso zzso and stress zzso in deep muscle and fat zzso were therefore calculated in six healthy subjects during sitting, in a zzso zzso system, using a zzso zzso zzso Specifically, finite element zzso models of the zzso zzso were built for each subject using MR images taken at the zzso plane in a zzso sitting zzso Using a second MR image taken from each subject during zzso sitting we characterized the zzso zzso sagging toward the sitting surface in zzso and used these data as displacement boundary conditions for the zzso zzso These zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso tissue strains and stresses occur in the zzso muscles, not in fat or at the skin near the zzso zzso Peak principal zzso strain and stress in the zzso muscle were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Peak principal zzso strain and stress in enveloping fat tissue were zzso and zzso zzso zzso Models were validated by comparing measured peak interface pressures under the zzso zzso zzso zzso with those calculated by means of zzso zzso zzso for each zzso This is the first study to zzso zzso tissue strain and stress zzso in sitting humans, in zzso These data are essential for understanding the zzso of pressure sores, particularly those that were recently termed zzso tissue zzso at the US National zzso zzso Advisory Panel zzso 2005 Consensus zzso
