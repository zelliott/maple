Dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso methods rely on zzso of the contrast agent such that a zzso zzso can be induced between the zzso compartment and adjacent spaces, such as between zzso and zzso zzso When there is a disruption of the zzso barrier, as is frequently the case with brain tumors, a contrast agent leaks out of the zzso resulting in additional zzso zzso and zzso relaxation effects in the zzso space, thereby affecting the signal intensity time course and reducing the reliability of the zzso zzso zzso In this study, a theoretical model describing these dynamic zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso relaxation interactions is zzso The zzso of using the proposed model to investigate the influence of relevant zzso pulse sequences zzso echo time, flip zzso and physical zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso relaxation zzso and zzso parameters zzso zzso blood flow, zzso volume zzso on zzso signal time zzso is zzso Such a model could yield important insights into the zzso basis of zzso effects on measured zzso signals and provide a means to investigate pulse sequence zzso and appropriate data analysis methods for the extraction of zzso relevant imaging zzso
