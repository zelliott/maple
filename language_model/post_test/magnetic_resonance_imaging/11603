zzso of cognitive impairment in zzso zzso vascular disease zzso are less well understood than in zzso but have been thought to result from direct effects of zzso zzso and white matter zzso perhaps related to disruption of important zzso zzso 

To examine the relation between cognitive abilities and quantitative zzso measures of zzso cerebrovascular disease and cortical and zzso zzso 

zzso were 157 participants in a zzso study of zzso and zzso who included cognitively normal, cognitively impaired, and zzso individuals with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso variables were zzso tests of global cognitive function, memory, language, and executive zzso Independent variables were quantitative zzso measures of volume of zzso zzso in specific zzso structures, volume of white matter zzso zzso volume of cortical gray matter zzso and total zzso volume zzso Multiple zzso analyses were used to identify zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso were not related to cognitive measures independent of effects of other zzso zzso zzso was independently related to selected, timed zzso zzso and zzso were strong and independent zzso of cognitive zzso with effects that did not differ in subjects with and without zzso zzso 

zzso suggest that cognitive impairment associated with zzso zzso vascular disease is primarily a result of associated zzso and cortical zzso
