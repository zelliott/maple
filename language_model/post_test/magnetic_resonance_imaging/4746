The zzso regions were classified into two groups on the basis of zzso zzso images zzso regions with lower intensity than that of muscle zzso and regions with intensity equal to or higher than that of muscle zzso We zzso evaluated the differences in signal intensity between zzso and zzso in order to examine this zzso zzso zzso areas in zzso anemia were classified into two groups of 23 zzso and 19 zzso The signal ratios of zzso areas to muscle on zzso and STIR were zzso and the differences between zzso and zzso were statistically zzso The signal ratios of zzso were significantly higher on zzso and lower on STIR than those of zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso This result indicated that zzso consisted of more zzso zzso than zzso zzso were useful in zzso between zzso and zzso and defining the degree of zzso in zzso zzso
