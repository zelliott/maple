The present functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiment aims at clarifying the role of the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso in the evaluation of feedback in a deterministic zzso We tested, in particular, the response of the zzso to the detection of different types of feedback, and to varying levels of outcome zzso We used a problem-solving task in which subjects had to discover, in successive trials, which one of the four presented stimuli was associated with a positive feedback, the other ones being associated with error zzso In this task, two periods zzso zzso an exploratory period in which error feedback indicated to adapt the following response appropriately (and continue to zzso and first positive feedback indicated to change strategy zzso to shift from zzso to exploitative zzso and zzso an exploitative period in which subjects had to repeat the correct zzso The zzso is recruited in the exploratory period during the analysis of both error and first correct positive zzso In addition, the zzso activity was modulated by positive reward prediction error values zzso the difference between obtained and expected zzso Altogether, these results reveal the critical role of the zzso in the evaluation of salient feedback for learning optimal zzso
