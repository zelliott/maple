We present a new technique of image fusion zzso of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We performed zzso and zzso within 8 hours on the same zzso zzso zzso was used to reduce zzso due to zzso zzso Before image fusion we zzso the zzso and zzso images independently of each zzso The zzso and zzso were connected by a local area network zzso to a Gateway computer, which is also used as a picture zzso There a program automatically starts, translates the zzso data from the zzso format to the zzso one and these data are sent for image fusion to the nuclear medicine computer zzso zzso By means of a clinical example we present zzso zzso zzso and explain the findings and the clinical value of our zzso This system and technique are equally zzso to other digital imaging zzso By zzso on the basis of the certain evidence of the zzso depot of a pathological zzso diagnosed by zzso and the reliability of the anatomical assignment of a focal zzso diagnosed by zzso early detection of local recurrence after surgical treatment of zzso cancer, the correct zzso of zzso disease and its distinction from zzso tissue becomes zzso This enables planning of further zzso zzso
