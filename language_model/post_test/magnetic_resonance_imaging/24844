To compare zzso ultrasound zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso findings of zzso inflammation in the zzso and zzso in an early zzso cohort zzso who presented zzso 1 year after arthritis zzso using a bilateral hand and wrist zzso Also, to evaluate the diagnostic performance of US and zzso findings for zzso arthritis zzso their ability to predict zzso as a diagnostic outcome, and their capacity to improve the accuracy of the 2010 American College of zzso League Against zzso zzso zzso zzso criteria in early zzso 

zzso patients (40 women, 5 zzso mean age zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso participated in this prospective study and were examined using an US and zzso approach including both zzso and zzso After a followup of 12 months, patients were classified as having zzso if they fulfilled the criteria for zzso The proportion of zzso identified by US and zzso for each joint and zzso region was compared by zzso zzso The diagnostic performance of US and zzso for zzso identification was evaluated using zzso curve zzso zzso zzso associations between zzso for each joint and zzso region as identified by US or zzso and zzso diagnosis at 12 months were tested by zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic performance of the zzso zzso zzso criteria corrected by US and zzso joint and zzso counts was evaluated using zzso zzso 

Thirty patients fulfilled the zzso criteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and the remaining 15 failed to meet these criteria zzso zzso joint zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso was found in zzso and zzso of patients with zzso on zzso compared with zzso and 50% on zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso The global zzso and US counts revealed a good diagnostic performance for zzso diagnosis of both techniques, although zzso was statistically significantly better zzso under the curve zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso statistic zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso identification of zzso joint zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and global joint and zzso count zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were in the zzso zzso zzso model the most powerful zzso of progression toward zzso In the group of zzso patients with US joint and zzso counts zzso 10, a statistically significant difference was found between the diagnostic performance for zzso of the zzso criteria as previously described and the diagnostic performance of the zzso zzso criteria zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso statistic zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso zzso identified a higher prevalence of zzso in comparison to US in an early zzso zzso Both techniques have good diagnostic performance for zzso although zzso reveals a significantly higher diagnostic zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso as identified by zzso were the most powerful zzso of progression toward zzso In patients with US joint and zzso counts zzso 10, zzso can significantly improve the diagnostic performance of the 2010 zzso zzso zzso
