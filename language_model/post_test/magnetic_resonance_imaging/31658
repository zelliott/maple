The identification and assessment of zzso zzso zzso are important for therapeutic and zzso purposes, yet current recommended diagnostic strategies have significant zzso We zzso tested the performance of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso contrast for the detection of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with their first zzso were enrolled in an acute zzso or zzso 16 days after zzso zzso or chronic (17 days to 6 zzso zzso arm and then zzso to 1 of 4 doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Standard zzso zzso was performed before contrast zzso and 10 and 30 minutes after zzso For blinded analysis, zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and then scored for enhanced regions by 3 independent readers not associated with the zzso The zzso artery zzso territory was scored from zzso zzso zzso In total, zzso scans were performed in 26 centers using commercially available scanners from all major zzso zzso All scans were included in the zzso The sensitivity of zzso for detecting zzso increased with rising dose of zzso zzso reaching zzso zzso and zzso zzso after contrast compared with zzso before zzso Likewise, the accuracy of zzso for identifying zzso location zzso with zzso artery zzso zzso increased with rising dose of zzso zzso reaching zzso zzso and zzso zzso after contrast compared with zzso before zzso For zzso doses zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and 30-minute images provided equal performance, and peak zzso zzso levels correlated with zzso zzso size zzso 

zzso zzso using doses of zzso or zzso zzso zzso is effective in the detection and assessment of both acute and chronic zzso This study represents the first zzso trial designed to evaluate an imaging approach for detecting zzso
