Small animal magnetic resonance imaging zzso was developed to detect structural tissue changes associated with disease states in animal zzso The disease state of particular interest here is that associated with long-term alcohol zzso The small animal model used for this study was the zzso zzso zzso a model that provides a relatively rapid means of mimicking the zzso frequently found in human chronic alcohol zzso A zzso zzso tuned to the magnetic field of a zzso zzso clinical magnetic resonance zzso provided the technology necessary to delineate discreet regions of the rat brain with zzso zzso male rats were zzso placed on a zzso zzso diet for approximately 6 weeks, and then zzso Treatment associated enlargement of the lateral zzso identified in the images was verified by zzso zzso analysis of the brains of these zzso The results demonstrated that zzso is capable of providing dramatic and reliable visual evidence of pathological structural changes in small tissue volumes with high resolution and zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso allowed for imaging of the same animals over time, thereby reducing the numbers of animals needed for convincing documentation of the changes in zzso zzso
