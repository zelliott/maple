The study object was to zzso compare the detection rate of zzso zzso zzso by CT during zzso zzso zzso in borderline zzso which was observed upon zzso zzso on dynamic zzso dynamic zzso MR zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso zzso zzso in 49 patients with zzso were zzso When a part of the zzso showed zzso relative to the surrounding areas of the zzso on zzso it was defined as zzso zzso The relationships between the dynamic zzso and dynamic MR and zzso MR imaging findings of these zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in 17 zzso of 32 on the zzso dominant phase of dynamic zzso in 19 zzso of 51 on the zzso dominant phase of dynamic MR and in 6 zzso of 23 on zzso MR zzso zzso dominant phase of dynamic zzso demonstrated a significantly higher detection rate of zzso zzso less than 5 zzso in diameter than did dynamic and zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso in borderline zzso could be better zzso by dynamic zzso than by zzso and zzso MR zzso Dynamic zzso is recommended for the follow-up examination of zzso borderline zzso
