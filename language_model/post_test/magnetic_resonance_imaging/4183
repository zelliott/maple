A three-dimensional zzso zzso sequence was used to acquire high spatial resolution whole brain images in rats before and after the injection of an zzso contrast zzso These zzso images were used to estimate regional cerebral blood volume zzso as a percentage of blood volume in each zzso zzso was manipulated to investigate the effects of altered zzso carbon dioxide tension zzso on zzso In addition, different doses of a zzso zzso solution were used to investigate the sensitivity of the proposed method in a serial monitoring zzso An zzso of zzso zzso zzso was obtained before any zzso zzso in good agreement with literature values using alternative zzso Using this method, it was found that there exists a linear relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso increased in a dose and time dependent fashion in zzso zzso High zzso was available due to the substantial increase in blood signal from the zzso contrast zzso
