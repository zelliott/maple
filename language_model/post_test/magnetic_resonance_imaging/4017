This study evaluated and compared zzso zzso zzso zzso and breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso results in patients with indeterminate zzso to determine whether either technique can improve the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of breast zzso From 123 consecutive patients who underwent physical examination, zzso zzso and zzso confirmation, a zzso of 82 patients presenting with indeterminate zzso was zzso zzso patients underwent zzso zzso zzso results were scored on the basis of the intensity and pattern of zzso zzso zzso images were scored on the basis of signal intensity increase after administration of contrast material as well as the enhancement pattern and speed of zzso zzso The results obtained with the two techniques were compared and related to the final zzso zzso Considering indeterminate findings as positive, the sensitivity of zzso was zzso and the zzso zzso zzso displayed a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso When indeterminate results were considered negative, the sensitivity and specificity of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso zzso The calculated sensitivities and zzso demonstrate the diagnostic limitations of both zzso and zzso in the evaluation of patients with indeterminate zzso zzso Due to the higher zzso zzso may be the preferred zzso in the evaluation of selected patients with breast zzso
