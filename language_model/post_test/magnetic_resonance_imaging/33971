zzso zzso such as zzso and the growth and zzso of cerebral zzso result from a zzso in tissue metabolism and injury that are, in part, regulated by zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to establish the feasibility and accuracy of determining wall zzso rate in the internal carotid artery from zzso MR zzso 

Three zzso were used to generate zzso rate estimates from both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso were linear zzso zzso linear zzso with correction for wall position zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments were conducted by using a phantom under conditions of both zzso and zzso zzso The findings from five healthy volunteers were also zzso MR zzso zzso rates were compared with values calculated by solving the fluid flow zzso 

zzso of in zzso zzso experiments indicated that at one or two zzso zzso has the advantage of good accuracy and low zzso zzso of in zzso zzso flow experiments showed that neither zzso nor zzso differed significantly from the predicted value of wall zzso stress, despite errors of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso data showed that zzso did not differ significantly from the predicted value, whereas zzso and zzso zzso The percentages of errors for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The average residual of zzso was low because the zzso were both above and below baseline zzso on average, zzso tended to be a more biased zzso of the zzso rate in zzso The average and peak wall zzso force in five volunteers was approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings show that zzso consistently zzso the zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso may be used to estimate zzso rate, errors of up to zzso should be expected because of zzso above and below the true value for individual zzso
