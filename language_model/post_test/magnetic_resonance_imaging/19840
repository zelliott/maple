To discuss whether recent functional zzso results can account for clinical zzso in visual zzso zzso 

zzso zzso studies in healthy human subjects have identified only two regions of zzso zzso zzso that zzso respond to individual faces and visual words, zzso The signature of face identity coding in the zzso neural response was shown to be missing in a patient with zzso Another case study established that a surgical zzso close to the region sensitive to visual words can result in pure zzso 

Evidence is increasing that functional specialization for processing face identity and visual word forms is restricted to two specialized sensory zzso in the zzso zzso A structural or functional zzso to zzso and zzso regions in the zzso zzso zzso can provide the most zzso account for the clinical syndromes of zzso and zzso zzso This review suggests that functional specialization should be considered in terms of whether exclusively one brain region (instead of zzso zzso a defined function and not as whether this brain region zzso exclusively one cognitive zzso Such functional specialization seems to exist for at least two zzso visual zzso functions, face and word zzso
