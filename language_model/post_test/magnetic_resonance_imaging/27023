zzso instability occurs in zzso infection, but quantitative balance tests in conjunction with zzso are zzso We examined whether zzso brain tissue volume would be deficient in zzso zzso individuals and whether selective tissue deficits would be related to zzso stability and zzso speed zzso The 123 participants included 28 men and 12 women with zzso infection without zzso or alcohol use disorders, and 40 men and 43 women without medical or psychiatric zzso Participants completed quantitative balance testing, zzso zzso test, and a test of finger movement speed and zzso An zzso brain region, zzso zzso system, and corpus zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso and together with archival zzso fiber tracking of zzso and internal and external capsule fiber systems, brain measures were correlated with test zzso The tissue ratio of the zzso was zzso smaller in the zzso than control zzso The zzso group exhibited performance deficits in balancing on one foot, walking zzso zzso zzso substitution task, and time to complete all zzso zzso grid zzso Total zzso tissue ratio was a significant predictor of balance and zzso zzso zzso zzso scores did not correlate significantly with zzso volumes, zzso size, or internal or external capsule fiber integrity but did so with zzso of zzso tract zzso zzso individuals specifically recruited to be without complications from alcohol use disorders had zzso tissue volume deficits with functional zzso zzso stability and zzso speed were impaired and zzso at least in part, to compromised zzso brain zzso
