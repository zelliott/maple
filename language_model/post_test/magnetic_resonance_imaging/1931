The purpose of this study was to present a new visualizing method for zzso joint zzso pathology in zzso at several zzso positions and to apply the method to a case of juvenile chronic arthritis zzso with previously diagnosed bilateral zzso disorder and to a subject without signs and symptoms from the zzso 

The 20-year-old female patient had suffered from zzso zzso from the age of 6 years 8 zzso The present study is based on a follow-up examination after the completion of zzso treatment with the zzso zzso Both zzso were examined using magnetic resonance imaging zzso at closed and open mouth zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso disc were segmented and zzso reconstruction of these structures was carried zzso 

The zzso was characterized by an increased zzso diameter with zzso formation at the anterior aspect of the zzso head and zzso of the superior zzso The depth of the zzso zzso was reduced and the zzso zzso was remarkably zzso The zzso disc was markedly diminished and zzso placed on the zzso zzso The distance of the zzso path during mouth opening was reduced and the zzso of the zzso path was quite zzso The disc moved slightly zzso on the zzso head and remained in the zzso zzso during mouth zzso 

The imaging zzso described improves zzso of zzso zzso and gains insight into the zzso pathology of the zzso patient, adding to understanding of the clinical zzso
