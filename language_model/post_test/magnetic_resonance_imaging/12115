zzso findings of pelvic radiation changes in 42 patients were correlated with the tumor and critical tissue dose, time post treatment, and clinical zzso The severity of tissue changes was zzso The ability of zzso to differentiate post radiation tissue changes from residual or zzso tumor was also zzso zzso tissue toxicity increased significantly when the dose exceeded 4,500 zzso with the zzso of marked zzso changes rising from zzso to zzso with a dose greater than 4,500 zzso All grades of tissue change were seen in the zzso of time from start of zzso All patients who exhibited clinical grade 2 or 3 zzso changes showed moderate or severe changes on zzso Grade 1 zzso changes indicative of zzso zzso were present in zzso of patients with no clinical zzso In conclusion, the zzso and sequence of zzso changes following radiation therapy to the pelvis have been documented and correlated with clinical zzso With its potential for distinguishing radiation change from zzso zzso zzso should prove to be of value in the assessment of the zzso zzso
