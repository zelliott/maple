The feasibility of diagnosing the zzso and viability of zzso brain zzso using zzso enhanced and zzso zzso zzso was zzso The relationship between the zzso enhancement pattern, the growth fraction zzso determined by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso the clinical condition, the zzso potential and the change of zzso enhancement over time was zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso were studied with the zzso method of zzso zzso The enhanced effect in zzso zzso was dependent on zzso density, zzso zzso and zzso of vascular zzso zzso were observed in zzso of zzso specimens taken from areas with zzso enhanced zzso zzso percent of these specimens zzso of zzso showed a zzso of more than zzso growth zzso On the other hand, zzso cells were observed in zzso of zzso specimens taken from areas with zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of these specimens zzso of zzso showed a zzso value of less than zzso zzso However, zzso percent of these zzso showed values between 5 and zzso zzso In the kinetic study of zzso five patients who were in a clinically stable condition and one patient who had zzso showed a constant pattern of enhancement or slightly increased enhancement 30 zzso after injection compared to 4 zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used effectively in the diagnosis of zzso viability and zzso after zzso
