Patients with profound semantic deterioration resulting from zzso lobe zzso have been reported to use many real objects zzso Does this preserved ability reflect zzso a separate component of the conceptual knowledge system zzso zzso or zzso the operation of a system that is independent of conceptual knowledge of specific objects, and rather is responsible for general mechanical problem-solving skills, triggered by object zzso We contrast the performance of three zzso with semantic zzso and focal zzso lobe zzso and the third with zzso zzso and zzso zzso tests of real object identification and zzso zzso tests of functional semantic knowledge, and a task requiring selection and use of novel zzso The patient with zzso zzso showed poor novel tool selection and impaired use of real objects, despite near normal semantic knowledge of the same zzso zzso The patients with semantic zzso had the expected deficit in object identification and functional zzso but achieved flawless and effortless performance on the novel tool zzso Their attempts to use this same mechanical problem-solving ability to deduce (sometimes successfully but often zzso the use of the real objects provide no support for the hypothesis of a separate zzso zzso Although the zzso lobe system clearly is necessary to identify zzso an object is, we suggest that sensory zzso to a zzso zzso system can trigger the use of objects without reference to zzso conceptual zzso
