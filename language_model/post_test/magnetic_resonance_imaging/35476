Female pelvic floor dysfunction zzso is a complex group of conditions that include urinary zzso and pelvic organ zzso zzso In humans, zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 knockout zzso mice demonstrate abnormal elastic fiber zzso and develop zzso after zzso We compared the lower zzso tract zzso anatomy and function in zzso mice with and without zzso zzso anatomy was assessed in zzso mice over 28 zzso zzso visceral anatomy in zzso was evaluated with a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso function was assessed using conscious zzso and leak point pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of elastic fibers was performed on external zzso zzso zzso cross zzso By 25 zzso of age, 50% of zzso zzso mice developed zzso zzso mice with POP had greater zzso in the size and location of the zzso on zzso compared with mice without zzso Parity and POP were associated with lower zzso zzso clusters were significantly increased in the zzso of zzso mice with zzso Because parity triggers POP in zzso mice, zzso mice with POP have variable internal pelvic zzso and both parity and POP are associated with a decrease in zzso we conclude that zzso zzso anatomical and functional zzso resembles zzso in zzso The increase in zzso clusters in the zzso of zzso mice with POP suggests that zzso disorganization may lead to functional zzso We conclude that zzso warrants further investigation in the zzso of zzso
