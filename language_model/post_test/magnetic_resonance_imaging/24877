zzso zzso aspiration zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso are the two most widely accepted diagnostic techniques used for the assessment of zzso zzso zzso We zzso evaluated the ability of zzso and zzso to predict zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Over a period of 10 years zzso zzso for primary zzso zzso zzso was performed in a consecutive series of 178 zzso zzso zzso was performed in zzso zzso of cases, and zzso zzso was performed in zzso of cases zzso Both zzso were applied in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and accuracy were analyzed zzso for each zzso of zzso 

The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for predicting zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso (including only diagnostic zzso and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso In the zzso of patients who underwent both zzso and zzso sensitivity, zzso and accuracy were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso values improved significantly after introduction of zzso zzso acquisition in 2007 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Compared to previously published results, the high number of zzso zzso and the low sensitivity rates in our series were disappointing, In part, this can be explained by the low percentage of zzso zzso and the high number of zzso zzso among zzso We discuss possibilities for improving zzso performance, such as zzso zzso
