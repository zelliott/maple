How does the brain integrate multiple sources of information to support normal zzso and cognitive zzso To investigate this question we present an overall brain architecture (called zzso dual intertwined rings zzso that relates the functional specialization of cortical networks to their spatial distribution over the cerebral zzso (or zzso Recent results suggest that the resting state networks zzso are organized into two large families: 1) a zzso family that includes zzso zzso and auditory areas and 2) a large association family that comprises zzso zzso and frontal regions and also includes the default mode zzso We used two large databases of resting state zzso data, from which we extracted 32 robust zzso We zzso zzso the zzso functional roles by using a projection of the results on task based networks zzso as referenced in large databases of zzso zzso zzso and zzso relationship of the zzso with the zzso zzso In both zzso the 32 zzso are organized into a remarkable architecture of two intertwined rings per zzso and so four rings linked by zzso zzso The first ring forms a continuous ensemble and includes zzso zzso and auditory zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso The second ring zzso distant zzso zzso and frontal regions zzso zzso through a network of association fiber tracts which closes the ring zzso and ensures a functional continuity within the zzso The zzso ring relates association zzso specialized in attention, language and working memory, to the networks involved in motivation and biological regulation and zzso This zzso intertwined zzso suggests a dual zzso process: the zzso ring performs fast real-time zzso integration of zzso information whereas the zzso ring performs zzso integration zzso relates past, present, and future representations at different zzso zzso
