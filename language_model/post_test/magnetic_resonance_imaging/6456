The processing of facial emotion involves a distributed network of zzso and zzso brain zzso Many of these regions are also implicated in the zzso of mood zzso zzso data indicate that depressed subjects show a zzso positive recognition bias for faces displaying negative zzso There are sparse data to suggest there may be an zzso zzso negative recognition bias for negative emotions in zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the zzso and zzso zzso of happy and sad facial affect recognition in patients with zzso 

zzso zzso and an explicit facial affect recognition task were used in a zzso design to measure brain zzso and associated zzso response to variable intensity of sad and happy facial expressions in 10 patients with bipolar I mania and 12 healthy comparison zzso 

The patients with mania had attenuated zzso rating of the intensity of sad facial expressions, and associated zzso of zzso in the zzso anterior zzso and bilateral amygdala, with increased zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso No zzso or zzso abnormalities were found in response to presentation of happy facial zzso 

Patients with mania showed a specific, zzso negative bias in sad facial affect recognition, which was associated with an abnormal profile of brain zzso in zzso regions implicated in affect recognition and mood zzso zzso imaging of facial emotion recognition may be a useful probe of cortical and zzso abnormalities in mood zzso
