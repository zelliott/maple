A fall in skin temperature zzso a repertoire of zzso responses that reduce the likelihood of a decrease in core zzso Studies in animals suggest that zzso zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso both the zzso zzso and zzso responses to ambient zzso however, the involvement of zzso zzso in human zzso has not been zzso This study used functional zzso with an zzso guided region of interest zzso approach to characterize changes in the blood oxygen zzso zzso signal within the human zzso of nine normal subjects during zzso cooling and zzso of the skin by a zzso body zzso An zzso covering zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso immediately zzso to the zzso (the zzso zzso zzso showed an increase in zzso signal of zzso zzso zzso zzso during periods of skin zzso compared with other zzso Overall, that signal showed a strong inverse correlation (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso with skin zzso A larger zzso covering the internal zzso cross section at the same level zzso 126 zzso 15 zzso showed no significant change in mean zzso signal with cooling zzso P zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that human zzso zzso zzso zzso are selectively activated in response to a zzso challenge and point to the location of zzso zzso zzso to those of the zzso zzso nucleus in zzso
