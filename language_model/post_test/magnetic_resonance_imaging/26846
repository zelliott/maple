The rationale for zzso imaging is to integrate the strengths of different imaging technologies while reducing the shortcomings of an individual zzso The work presented here proposes a zzso zzso zzso reconstruction technique that can be implemented on a zzso zzso system that can be used to obtain simultaneous zzso and zzso images for small animal zzso The reason for using a combined zzso system in this work is to eliminate any possible zzso between the two sets of images when MR images are used as a zzso information for zzso In nuclear imaging the target area is usually smaller than the entire object; thus, focusing the detector on the zzso results in various advantages including the use of a smaller nuclear detector (less zzso smaller reconstruction region zzso zzso and higher spatial resolution when used in conjunction with pinhole zzso with zzso The zzso system can be used to choose a region of interest zzso for zzso A zzso information obtained by the full zzso zzso zzso combined with the preliminary zzso image can be used to reduce the dimensions of the zzso reconstruction by limiting the zzso to the smaller zzso while reducing artifacts resulting from the truncated zzso Since the technique is based on zzso imaging within the zzso it will be called the zzso zzso zzso zzso At first zzso images of the entire object using a larger zzso are obtained to determine the location of the zzso covering the target zzso Once the zzso is determined, the animal is moved inside the zzso zzso zzso to bring the target area inside the zzso and then simultaneous zzso and zzso are zzso The spatial resolution of the zzso image is improved by employing a pinhole zzso with zzso zzso by having carefully calculated acceptance angles for each pinhole to avoid zzso In our design all the zzso are focused to the center of the zzso zzso reconstruction is accomplished by generating an zzso weighting zzso using a zzso information obtained by simultaneously acquired MR images and the zzso distribution obtained from the zzso region of the zzso image that is reconstructed without any a zzso zzso zzso results using simulations with zzso zzso show that the image resolution of the zzso image within the zzso is improved while minimizing artifacts arising from parts of the object outside the zzso due to the chosen zzso and the new reconstruction zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso artifacts was reduced by zzso for zzso zzso using the zzso reconstruction technique and by zzso for the heart in the case with the zzso zzso The zzso reconstruction technique significantly improved the spatial resolution and zzso while reducing artifacts from the contributions outside the zzso as well as reducing the dimension of the reconstruction zzso
