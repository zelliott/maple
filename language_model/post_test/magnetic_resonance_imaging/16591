The zzso facial nerve is difficult to delineate using conventional MR zzso Our aim was to assess the value of zzso zzso MR imaging in depicting the normal anatomy of the zzso facial zzso 

A zzso sequence was performed with optimum parameters in 18 healthy volunteers on a zzso MR imaging zzso The data obtained were reconstructed in relation to the course of the facial nerve by using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Images acquired were analyzed by 2 zzso They made the initial evaluations independently but resolved inconsistencies by collaborative review and consensus zzso The certainty of identifying the zzso facial nerve was scored and recorded on an arbitrary scale of zzso The lengths of the facial nerves were zzso zzso of the facial nerves and zzso ducts were zzso zzso evaluation of the results was achieved by the zzso zzso test, zzso and a paired zzso zzso 

In all subjects, zzso zzso images provided a reliable definition of the normal facial nerve anatomy zzso There were no significant differences between scores, zzso and zzso of bilateral facial nerves zzso zzso zzso The zzso facial zzso zzso zzso and zzso vein showed high signal intensity while the surrounding soft tissue showed relatively low signal zzso The signal intensity between the facial nerves and zzso ducts was significantly different zzso zzso zzso but no differences could be obtained for the zzso between the 2 structures zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso sequence can display the zzso course of the normal facial zzso including the relationship between the facial nerve and the zzso zzso
