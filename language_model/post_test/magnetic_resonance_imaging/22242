A magnetic resonance imaging method for measuring the zzso relaxation time constant is zzso It is based on the assumption that, under very general conditions, the MR signal near a spin echo has a special symmetry arising from the zzso nature of the 180 degrees zzso zzso A zzso echo sampling of the spin echo zzso sequence is implemented to evaluate zzso by collecting multiple zzso echoes before and after the spin zzso This approach is a modification of the zzso sequence proposed by Ma and zzso However, our approach compares images that are not separated by any zzso zzso and, as a result, is insensitive to slice profile zzso In addition, the calculated zzso value does not rely on any special assumptions about the zzso signal behavior in the presence of an zzso zzso magnetic field and, zzso is insensitive to the presence of zzso magnetic field zzso
