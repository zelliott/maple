We have developed a zzso PET detector which is compatible with a clinical zzso system to provide simultaneous PET and MR zzso This zzso PET system consists of 48 2 zzso 2 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso in a 38 zzso diameter ring zzso that can be placed inside the receiver zzso of the zzso system, coupled to three zzso zzso housed outside the main magnetic field via 4 m long and 2 zzso diameter optical zzso The PET system exhibits 2 zzso spatial resolution, zzso energy resolution at zzso zzso and 20 zzso timing zzso zzso PET and MR phantom images were successfully zzso
