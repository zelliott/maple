The distribution and quantity of zzso tissue are markers of morbidity risk in children and zzso Poor zzso growth and accelerated zzso growth are believed to add to these zzso The aim of this study was to assess zzso tissue content and distribution at birth and 6 zzso in relation to zzso growth zzso zzso growth, and infant zzso We measured weight, zzso and head circumference and zzso content and distribution using magnetic resonance imaging at 6 zzso of age in appropriately grown for zzso age zzso and zzso zzso infants and compared this with birth zzso By 6 zzso zzso infants showed complete catch-up in comparison to zzso infants in relation to head growth and zzso zzso in length and weight was not zzso zzso linear growth, but not accelerated weight gain, was associated with a highly significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso regardless of zzso zzso The highest zzso at 6 zzso allowing for baseline variables and linear growth, was seen in exclusively zzso zzso infants zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue distribution remained constant and was unrelated to growth and zzso zzso birth zzso (B zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not low birth head size (B zzso zzso p zzso zzso was a significant predictor of accelerated zzso head growth zzso zzso zzso adjusted zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be an inevitable accompaniment of accelerated linear zzso Low total zzso tissue quantity at birth appears to direct nutrition toward head zzso zzso tissue may be involved in the signaling of catch-up zzso
