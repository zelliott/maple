Since the first published report of spinal functional zzso zzso in humans in 1996, this body of literature has grown zzso In the present article, the authors systematically review all spinal zzso studies conducted in healthy individuals with a focus on the different motor and sensory zzso used and the results zzso 

The authors conducted a systematic search of zzso for literature published from 1990 through November 2011 reporting on stimulation zzso used to assess spinal zzso scans in healthy zzso 

They identified 19 zzso studies from 1996 to the present in which a combination of different spinal zzso methods were used to investigate the spinal zzso in healthy zzso Eight of the studies used a motor stimulation zzso 10 used a sensory stimulation zzso and 1 compared motor and sensory stimulation zzso 

Despite differences in the results of various studies, even when similar stimulation zzso were used, this body of literature underscores that spinal zzso signals can be obtained from the human spinal zzso The authors intend this review to serve as an introduction to spinal zzso research and what it may offer the field of spinal zzso injury zzso
