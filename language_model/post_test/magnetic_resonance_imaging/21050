zzso of periodic or zzso motion zzso plays a crucial role in our ability to learn and perform many common skilled zzso For example, periodic zzso are a key component of many types of biological movements when viewed relative to body zzso In the current zzso study, we used a novel visual stimulus consisting of a target moving along a closed trajectory defined by a zzso frequency zzso pattern zzso a zzso variation of trajectory radius relative to a circular zzso to determine which brain regions zzso these periodic movement zzso zzso pattern analyses permitted prediction of the shapes of different periodic zzso within regions V2 and zzso indicating that these regions play a role in the processing of periodic visual zzso In addition, blood oxygen level dependent zzso responses associated with the presentation of targets moving along zzso zzso compared with zzso motion and zzso zzso shapes revealed significantly greater activity in visual areas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To our knowledge, the results of this study represent the first examination of the functional brain activity underlying periodic motion processing and should inform further zzso
