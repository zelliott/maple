The cause of the reduced regional cerebral blood flow zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease has not been zzso In Alzheimer's disease, the zzso zzso zzso itself shows little zzso zzso and a hypothesis explaining such a zzso is that the functional impairment in the zzso zzso zzso reflects remote effects caused by zzso in distant but connected areas, such as the zzso zzso To test the hypothesis, we investigated the functional connectivity between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with probable Alzheimer's disease at a very early stage and 61 zzso healthy controls underwent both brain structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on zzso data to identify clusters of significantly reduced zzso matter concentration in patients with Alzheimer's disease relative to controls, which were set as volumes of interest zzso for correlation analyses of zzso zzso We then used adjusted zzso values in the zzso as zzso of interest in statistical zzso zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrated a significant reduction in zzso matter concentration in the bilateral zzso zzso in Alzheimer's zzso A positive correlation between zzso in the zzso zzso as zzso and that in the zzso and zzso systems, including the zzso zzso cortex, anterior zzso cortex, zzso zzso and left middle zzso zzso zzso was observed in Alzheimer's zzso Control subjects also showed a similar correlation in the zzso and zzso systems, but not in the zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso may be closely related to those in the zzso zzso in patients with Alzheimer's disease, thereby supporting the zzso zzso zzso
