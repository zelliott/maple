Prospective comparison study of zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso field zzso with regard to their role in planning surgical therapy in a zzso homogeneous patient collective with tumors of the pancreatic zzso 

zzso patients with zzso evidence of tumor were examined by zzso and zzso zzso were compared with surgical anatomy and zzso using a data documentation zzso zzso evaluated included the zzso of the tumors and the probability of correct diagnosis in relation to tumor size, as well as the occurrence of zzso zzso and distant zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso determination of zzso and tumor staging zzso zzso These factors were compared on the basis of their respective sensitivity, zzso negative and positive zzso value and zzso 

zzso was correctly diagnosed by zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso respectively, with a corresponding sensitivity for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with diameters zzso 2 zzso were detected in zzso of cases by zzso and in zzso by zzso while tumors with diameters zzso 2 zzso were correctly diagnosed by zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso rates of correct diagnosis by zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso for pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso The diagnostic accuracy for vascular zzso by zzso and zzso stood at 59% and zzso with sensitivities of zzso and zzso zzso Local zzso was correctly determined by zzso in zzso by zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were correctly identified by zzso and zzso with an accuracy of zzso and zzso while distant zzso were correctly diagnosed by zzso and zzso with an accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso T stage was identified by zzso in zzso by zzso in zzso zzso tended to assign patients to a higher T stage than later determined by surgery and/or zzso 

Our data do not indicate a clear superiority for either zzso or zzso in the diagnosis of pancreatic zzso
