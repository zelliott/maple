Recent studies have suggested that attention deficit zzso disorder zzso is associated with abnormalities in zzso zzso and prefrontal cortical zzso However, these studies have primarily relied upon cognitive tasks that reflect impulse control rather than zzso zzso 

The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural zzso of selective and divided attention in a randomized, zzso zzso pharmacological challenge with zzso in 15 adolescents with zzso zzso zzso eight adolescents with reading disorder zzso zzso and four adolescents with both reading disorder and zzso zzso zzso who were scanned during both a zzso and a zzso zzso Fourteen healthy comparison subjects zzso zzso who were not given zzso served as the primary comparison zzso 

During the divided attention task, zzso subjects with zzso or reading disorder recruited the left zzso zzso zzso significantly less than the healthy comparison zzso zzso led to an increase in zzso in this region but had no effect on task zzso zzso with zzso also recruited the middle zzso zzso significantly less than the comparison subjects, but zzso did not have a direct effect on zzso in this zzso 

These results suggest that zzso is associated with abnormal processing in zzso networks, with specific dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso may act to zzso activity within this zzso
