zzso zzso zzso found in about zzso of zzso is a clinically zzso zzso remnant appearing at the zzso wall of the zzso To our knowledge, a systematic review of its MR features does not zzso The aim of this study was to describe the MR imaging findings of zzso found zzso zzso with special respect to its differentiation from zzso zzso 

We reviewed 300 consecutive zzso MR imaging studies that included zzso zzso zzso images of the skull base for the presence of a zzso zzso In cases in which an zzso was identified, two zzso observed MR signal intensity zzso contrast enhancement, size, form, stalk of zzso and signal intensity changes of the adjacent zzso 

Five cases with zzso zzso were found zzso zzso In all cases, the zzso was zzso on zzso images and zzso on zzso zzso zzso to the reported findings in zzso none of the zzso showed contrast zzso In four cases, there were signal intensity changes in the adjacent zzso A zzso connection between zzso and zzso was seen in three zzso 

Because of the benign character of zzso and the difficulties in its zzso differentiation from zzso precise knowledge of the zzso characteristics of zzso is zzso On the basis of these five cases and a review of literature, contrast enhancement and the presence of clinical symptoms seem to be highly reliable parameters in the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso and zzso
