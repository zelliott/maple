We investigated the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso administration on parameters assessing attention and short-term recognition memory in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso 2 zzso but not zzso zzso disrupted memory accuracy in delayed matching to sample test zzso in nine out of 28 zzso The volumes of the zzso and the zzso zzso of those Alzheimer's disease patients who were sensitive to zzso administration were larger than those whose performance was unaffected by zzso These two groups of Alzheimer's disease patients performed equally in measures of attention after zzso or zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso disrupted attention only at levels of testing that were demanding for the individual zzso Our results suggest that the disruptive effect of zzso on short-term memory in Alzheimer's disease patients may be zzso via the zzso and the zzso zzso Furthermore, the deleterious effect of zzso on zzso attention is zzso via different brain systems from those involved in the zzso of memory zzso
