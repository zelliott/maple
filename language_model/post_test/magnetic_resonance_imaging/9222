zzso consumption beyond the zzso zzso is mainly determined by active zzso zzso especially in the thick ascending limb of the zzso of zzso zzso suppression of oxygen consumption zzso involves zzso of sodium transport in this segment, which is normally accompanied by a marked decrease in the zzso zzso zzso by blood oxygen zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso This study tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of zzso signal change after zzso is related to impaired zzso function in zzso zzso In 16 pigs with unilateral zzso artery zzso zzso zzso function, and zzso function zzso and fluid concentration zzso were evaluated in both zzso using MR and zzso computerized zzso zzso zzso Animals with adequate zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a mean zzso pressure zzso of 113 zzso 7 zzso and relatively preserved zzso zzso rate zzso of 60 zzso zzso zzso comparable to their zzso kidney zzso zzso 4 zzso P zzso zzso In contrast, animals with low zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso of 124 zzso 9 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso significantly lower than the zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso P zzso zzso The group with preserved zzso and zzso showed an increase in zzso fluid concentration as assessed by zzso that was greater than that observed in the low zzso group, suggesting better preservation of zzso function in the former zzso These results suggest that changes in zzso after zzso can differentiate between zzso zzso with preserved zzso function and those with zzso zzso This approach may allow more detailed zzso evaluation of zzso zzso in zzso hypertension than previously zzso
