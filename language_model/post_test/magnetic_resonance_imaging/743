zzso of specific components in zzso plaque may provide information on plaque stability and its potential to zzso We evaluated zzso in zzso rabbits using a new MR sequence that allows plaque detection within 1 hour after injection and assessed enhancement in zzso and zzso zzso 

Twelve rabbits with zzso plaque and 6 controls underwent zzso before and up to 24 hours after zzso injection zzso zzso Two zzso segmented zzso sequences zzso were compared to enhance vessel wall zzso after zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso or zzso a combination of zzso and zzso flow suppression zzso zzso With the use of zzso at 1 hour after injection, the vessel wall was not delineated because of poor flow zzso at 24 hours after injection, the enhancement was 37% zzso zzso showed significant enhancement after versus before contrast (1 zzso zzso zzso 24 hours: zzso zzso At 1 hour and 24 hours after injection, the zzso ratio was higher with the use of zzso than with zzso (1 zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 24 hours: zzso versus zzso respectively zzso There was no enhancement in the vessel wall after zzso injection in the control zzso A strong correlation was found zzso zzso between the zzso areas in zzso sections and signal intensity in corresponding MR zzso This suggests a high affinity of zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso improves zzso plaque zzso The zzso method allows early detection of zzso plaque within 1 hour after zzso zzso
