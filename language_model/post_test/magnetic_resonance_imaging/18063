The relation between pathological findings and clinical and cognitive decline in Multiple zzso remains zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that altered functional connectivity could provide a missing link between structural findings, such as zzso zzso and white matter zzso load, and clinical and cognitive zzso zzso zzso recordings from 21 zzso patients and 17 zzso and age matched controls were projected onto zzso zzso using zzso Average functional connectivity was zzso for each zzso and zzso zzso networks using the zzso zzso zzso measures of whole brain and zzso zzso and zzso load were estimated from zzso zzso Global analyses showed lower functional connectivity in the zzso band and higher functional connectivity in the beta band in patients with Multiple zzso Additionally, zzso band functional connectivity was lower for the patients in two zzso networks, namely the default mode network and the visual zzso Higher beta band functional connectivity was found in the default mode network and in the zzso zzso Lower zzso band functional connectivity in the visual network was related to lower zzso zzso zzso band functional connectivity correlated positively with disability scores, most prominently in the default mode network, and correlated zzso with cognitive performance in this zzso These findings illustrate the relationship between zzso zzso altered functional connectivity and clinical and cognitive dysfunction in zzso which could serve as a bridge to understand how zzso is associated with altered functional connectivity and subsequently clinical and cognitive zzso
