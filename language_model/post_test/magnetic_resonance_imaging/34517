To show the magnetic resonance zzso imaging patterns of zzso and to correlate them with symptoms in patients with zzso or zzso zzso 

Thirty women underwent MR imaging with fast zzso zzso acquisition in the steady zzso The women were divided into three groups: 10 were zzso volunteers, 10 had zzso and 10 had zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the pelvic floor muscles were identified at rest and during zzso zzso descent was compared between the three zzso 

zzso zzso was seen at multiple sites, most frequently in zzso zzso There was significantly greater zzso base descent zzso zzso zzso zzso descent zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso in the group of zzso patients when compared with the group with zzso zzso or the zzso zzso The degree of zzso junction descent was significantly greater zzso zzso zzso in the group of zzso patients when compared with the zzso zzso 

MR imaging clearly shows pelvic visceral zzso and pelvic floor zzso on zzso zzso frequently involves multiple sites in zzso patients, which is suggestive of global pelvic floor zzso In contrast, the weakness is frequently zzso in zzso zzso zzso
