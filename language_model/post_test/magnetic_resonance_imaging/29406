To date functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has not been extensively used in zzso evaluation of patients with intractable zzso Patient zzso presented with left frontal originating seizures, secondary to a large zzso zzso that zzso much of his zzso and zzso zzso and a substantial portion of zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso did not demonstrate any gross zzso of zzso or zzso zzso electroencephalogram zzso zzso revealed reduced background activity in the left hemisphere, an absence of identifiable normal sleep states, and confirmed the left frontal origin of his zzso with a prolonged zzso state, suggesting that the remaining zzso in zzso left zzso did not function normally despite his apparently normal zzso zzso listening results also suggested that zzso had an zzso language representation suggestive of either bilateral or right zzso speech zzso zzso intervention to remove the remaining left zzso zzso was a serious consideration for treatment of zzso zzso We used zzso to evaluate whether or not the remaining zzso in zzso left zzso supported any cognitive or motor zzso Even though the volume of cerebral zzso was severely reduced and displaced in the left hemisphere, zzso revealed significant zzso in this remaining tissue in response to zzso zzso and word generation zzso In other words, we were able to demonstrate using zzso that the remaining tissue in zzso left zzso continued to support some motor and cognitive zzso The possible implications of these findings in terms of functional zzso are discussed zzso
