To analyze peripheral nerves with zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso and assess the role of imaging in zzso zzso 

zzso nerves with abnormal clinical features or zzso were examined in 23 zzso patients by means of zzso zzso zzso US and MR zzso Image analysis zzso measurement of nerve zzso area; assessment of nerve structure and MR signal zzso identification of nerve zzso within zzso zzso detection of zzso color flow signals and zzso zzso zzso were made with clinical findings and a control group of 20 zzso Fourteen nerves in active reversal reaction were followed up after zzso 

zzso nerves were classified into three groups based on imaging zzso group I consisted of 17 zzso zzso group II, of 30 enlarged nerves with zzso zzso group III, of 11 nerves with absent zzso zzso Group II nerves were from patients subjected to reversal zzso zzso of patients with group III nerves had a history of zzso zzso zzso Nerve zzso in zzso tunnels was identified in zzso of group II and zzso of group III zzso zzso US and MR imaging were zzso and zzso sensitive in identifying active zzso based on detection of zzso color flow signals, long zzso and zzso zzso In zzso of cases, follow-up studies showed decreased color flow and zzso zzso after steroids and zzso zzso 

US and MR imaging are able to detect nerves abnormalities in zzso Active reversal reactions are indicated by zzso color flow signals as well as by an increased zzso signal and zzso zzso These signs would suggest rapid progression of nerve damage and a poor prognosis unless zzso treatment is zzso
