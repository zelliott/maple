To evaluate zzso zzso of zzso zzso in primary zzso syndrome zzso and to compare US with zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and MR zzso 

US examination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed on 27 patients with primary zzso 27 healthy controls and 27 symptomatic controls without zzso The results were compared with zzso MR imaging and MR zzso and the clinical features of the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso in 21 zzso SS patients, in one healthy control and in two symptomatic controls by zzso zzso zzso patients had changes in the zzso and zzso zzso and 8 zzso changes in the zzso zzso In the comparison, MR zzso was found to be the most sensitive method zzso followed by MR imaging zzso and US zzso in detecting zzso zzso The specificity of US was zzso The US and MR results were related to zzso zzso but not to saliva zzso The focus scores were related only to zzso MR imaging zzso 

zzso MR imaging and MR zzso with modern technology have reached such a good accuracy in visualizing zzso structural changes that they are promising alternatives to the conventional invasive examinations in the zzso of zzso
