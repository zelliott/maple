In this study we compared Pittsburgh zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, zzso PET for zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso for structure to predict conversion from zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso to Alzheimer's zzso using data from the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso zzso zzso variables generated by the Alzheimer's Disease zzso zzso laboratories for each zzso zzso along with zzso zzso zzso zzso 29) were zzso Performance of these zzso for predicting conversion from zzso to Alzheimer's zzso at 2 years was evaluated in 50 late zzso zzso subjects, 20 of whom zzso zzso modeling found that among individual zzso zzso had the highest zzso accuracy zzso which increased by zzso to zzso when combined with zzso producing the highest accuracy among any zzso zzso zzso zzso generated the best sensitivity, and zzso PET had the zzso Among individual brain regions, the zzso zzso was found to be most zzso for zzso and zzso
