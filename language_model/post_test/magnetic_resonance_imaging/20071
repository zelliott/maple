To zzso evaluate the technical feasibility of both zzso and zzso contrast zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the pulmonary circulation at zzso zzso 

All examinations were zzso zzso After institutional review board approval and written informed zzso zzso and zzso three-dimensional zzso MR zzso of the pulmonary circulation was performed with a zzso MR system in 31 adults (13 men, 18 zzso age range, zzso years zzso 22 volunteers and nine patients zzso with zzso masses, seven with pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso The image quality of pulmonary zzso branches and zzso enhancement zzso were evaluated independently by two zzso The zzso ratio and quantitative analysis of zzso parameters was zzso zzso analysis of data was performed by using zzso rank sum test and zzso Student zzso test, and zzso zzso was tested with zzso zzso 

zzso up to zzso pulmonary zzso branches was observed on zzso MR zzso and that up to zzso branches was observed on zzso MR zzso with zzso blood vessel definition and good zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhancement and zzso analysis of zzso parameters yielded dynamic information in all zzso Comparative analysis of definition scores for fourth- and zzso pulmonary zzso zzso zzso enhancement, the time lag between the pulmonary zzso and zzso enhancement, and all of the calculated zzso zzso in patients with zzso showed statistically significant differences from volunteers zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso MR zzso of the pulmonary circulation was feasible at zzso T and provided high vascular zzso detail and dynamic functional zzso Clearly zzso abnormalities were present in patients with zzso
