Recent functional zzso studies have provided evidence that human verbal working memory is represented by two complementary neural systems, a left zzso zzso network implementing zzso rehearsal and a presumably zzso older bilateral zzso network zzso zzso maintenance of zzso zzso In order to corroborate these findings from functional zzso we performed a targeted zzso study in patients with very selective and circumscribed brain zzso to key regions suggested to support these different zzso of human verbal working zzso 

Within a sample of over 500 neurological patients assessed with high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging, we identified 2 patients with corresponding brain zzso one with an isolated zzso to zzso area and the other with a selective zzso zzso to the anterior middle frontal zzso These 2 patients as well as groups of zzso healthy controls performed two zzso verbal working memory zzso In this way, we systematically assessed the hypothesized selective zzso effects of these brain zzso on the different zzso of verbal working memory in terms of a double zzso 

zzso prior findings, the zzso to zzso area led to reduced performance under zzso rehearsal, whereas the zzso maintenance of zzso information was zzso zzso the zzso brain zzso was associated with impaired zzso zzso working memory, whereas performance under zzso rehearsal was zzso 

The present experimental zzso study in patients with specific and circumscribed brain zzso confirms the hypothesized double zzso of two complementary brain systems underlying verbal working memory in zzso In particular, the results demonstrate the functional relevance of the anterior prefrontal zzso for zzso maintenance of zzso information and, in this way, provide further support for the zzso zzso model of human working zzso
