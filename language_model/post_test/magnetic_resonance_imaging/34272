zzso acquisition of zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso images using an zzso PET system will zzso the need for image registration and will allow unique studies of structure and function of living organisms in one zzso Here we report on simultaneous acquisition of PET and MR images on a clinical zzso T system using a 54 zzso diameter zzso zzso PET system zzso Phantom experiments were performed in order to determine the effect of the zzso system on MR zzso The results demonstrated the system to be fully MR zzso in both its detector head construction and zzso The zzso construction offers a promising method for design of a large-scale zzso PET system that will be useful in functional studies of the zzso
