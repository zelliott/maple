Balanced zzso achieves high zzso efficiency, but suffers from bright fat zzso In this work, a zzso zzso separation technique using alternating repetition time zzso balanced zzso is zzso The zzso profile can be modified using alternating repetition times and appropriate phase cycling to yield two zzso where fat and water are zzso and zzso zzso The signal zzso and the broad zzso of the created zzso and zzso profiles lead to signal cancellation over a broad zzso The zzso suppression is achieved for a wide range of flip angles and tissue zzso This property, coupled with the inherent flexibility of zzso zzso in repetition time selection, makes the method a good candidate for zzso zzso zzso The proposed method can be tailored to achieve a smaller residual zzso signal or a decreased sensitivity to field zzso depending on zzso zzso
