zzso cardiac mechanics in children with zzso left heart syndrome zzso when compared with other zzso defects may affect long-term morbidity and zzso Using zzso phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso we examined cardiac mechanics in children with zzso and compared the results to other zzso zzso 

zzso children with zzso and 18 children with other zzso defects were studied after the zzso zzso Phase contrast zzso scans were obtained perpendicular to the ascending zzso and flow was zzso using an in-house zzso and reconstruction zzso The total power output was determined using the modified zzso equation along with cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso heart zzso children with zzso had significantly lower power output zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and cardiac index zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso with a zzso higher systemic vascular resistance index zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso despite generating similar zzso blood pressures zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 23 zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso invasive zzso with PC zzso in children with zzso showed significantly lower power output and cardiac index when compared with other zzso zzso zzso zzso flow patterns may contribute to power loss and may have long-term survival and morbidity implications associated with the zzso zzso zzso systemic vascular resistance index despite similar blood pressure opens avenues for therapeutic intervention for zzso zzso
