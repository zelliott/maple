Compared with complex coordinated zzso actions, few zzso studies have attempted to determine the shared and distinct neural zzso of zzso and zzso zzso movements when performed zzso To determine cortical and zzso regions associated with zzso motor control, participants produced lip, tongue and jaw movements while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso For zzso motor activity, participants produced the zzso A sparse zzso sampling acquisition method was used to minimize zzso zzso Three main findings were zzso First, the four tasks activated a set of largely zzso common brain zzso the zzso and zzso zzso the right inferior frontal zzso the supplementary motor area, the left zzso zzso and the adjacent inferior zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso Second, differences between tasks were restricted to the bilateral auditory zzso and to the left zzso zzso cortex, with greater signal intensity for vowel zzso Finally, a zzso zzso organization of lip, zzso zzso and tongue movements was observed within the primary motor and zzso zzso using individual zzso zzso zzso These results provide evidence for a core neural network involved in zzso and zzso motor control and further refine the zzso zzso organization of zzso zzso
