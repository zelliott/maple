zzso neural protein zzso concentration is considered as a marker of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso disorder characterized by high zzso zzso levels in blood and zzso of zzso absence in the zzso of zzso zzso 

To evaluate zzso blood levels in zzso zzso 

Twenty-five (N zzso 25) zzso patients of comparable age, who were diagnosed by zzso screening and zzso zzso in our zzso zzso of zzso Department, were divided into two groups: group A (N zzso zzso with almost normal zzso levels and group B (N zzso zzso zzso zzso with high zzso zzso Their zzso examinations were normal zzso months before the beginning of the zzso zzso (N zzso zzso healthy children were the zzso zzso zzso levels, measured with an zzso zzso were greatly elevated in the group B zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to those of group A zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Positive correlation was found between zzso and zzso blood concentration zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso absence in zzso were observed in zzso of group A and in zzso of group B at the end of this zzso 

zzso zzso zzso protein level, for the first time evaluated in zzso was positively correlated with zzso blood level in zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso could be a useful peripheral marker of zzso zzso in patients with zzso disease such as zzso
