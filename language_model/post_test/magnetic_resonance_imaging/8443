The purpose of this review is to zzso the neural zzso zzso and disrupted zzso affective and experiential processes observed in methamphetamine and zzso zzso 

We reviewed all publications in zzso that conducted comparison studies between healthy volunteers and zzso zzso or zzso individuals using functional magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso dependence is characterized by a distributed zzso of functional zzso to a number of experimental zzso zzso anterior and zzso zzso zzso reduced inferior frontal and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and altered zzso zzso zzso point towards an inadequate zzso processing of zzso zzso reported most consistently to be deficient in these functional zzso studies include zzso control, executive functioning and zzso 

One emerging theme is that zzso individuals show specific, rather than zzso brain zzso differences, zzso instead of showing more or less brain zzso regardless of task, they exhibit zzso brain zzso differences that are consistent with a shift from zzso zzso processing to more zzso habitual response zzso
