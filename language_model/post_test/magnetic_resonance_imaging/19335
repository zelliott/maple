The possibility of using MR imaging as a sensitive marker of the structural changes in Parkinson's disease has been a zzso zzso We describe a new method for imaging and zzso the zzso changes of the zzso zzso in Parkinson's disease and compare zzso findings with clinical zzso 

Using a combination of two MR imaging zzso pulse zzso the zzso zzso was zzso in six patients with Parkinson's disease and six age-related control zzso A zzso index was defined and used to zzso the signal changes that were observed in the zzso The zzso index was compared with clinical scores obtained from the zzso Parkinson's Disease zzso zzso 

The images showed loss of signal in a zzso zzso in cases of Parkinson's disease, corresponding to the known zzso pattern of zzso The zzso index was highly correlated with the zzso Parkinson's Disease zzso zzso score, and there was no overlap in zzso zzso between the patient and the control groups zzso zzso zzso 

This study suggests that MR imaging is sensitive to structural changes in even the earliest cases of Parkinson's disease, thereby indicating the potential for detecting zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso measure has been defined that zzso with the conventional clinical measure of disease zzso zzso MR imaging could prove to be a sensitive biological marker for objective staging of the zzso
