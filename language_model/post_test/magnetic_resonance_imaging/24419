zzso zzso of cognitive scores for patients can help track the progress of neurological zzso In this paper, we present a novel zzso zzso relevance zzso zzso zzso method for predicting clinical scores of neurological diseases from zzso imaging and biological zzso to help evaluate pathological stage and predict progression of diseases, zzso Alzheimer's diseases zzso Unlike most existing methods, we predict clinical scores from zzso zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso Considering that the clinical scores of mild cognitive impairment zzso subjects are often less stable compared to those of zzso and normal control zzso subjects due to the zzso of zzso we use only the zzso data of zzso subjects, but no corresponding clinical scores, to train a zzso model for enhancing the zzso of clinical scores for zzso and NC zzso We also develop a new strategy for selecting the most zzso zzso zzso We evaluate the performance of our approach on 202 subjects with all three zzso of data zzso zzso and zzso from the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso zzso The experimental results show that our zzso method achieves a zzso error zzso of zzso and a correlation zzso zzso of zzso for zzso the zzso scores, and also a zzso of zzso and a zzso of zzso for zzso the zzso scores, demonstrating very promising performances in zzso zzso
