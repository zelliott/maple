We studied 70 zzso patients by using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso formation zzso Fifty patients presented with intractable zzso lobe zzso zzso 10 patients had focal zzso lobe zzso and 10 had generalized zzso In zzso of the 45 zzso patients without foreign tissue zzso there was significant zzso of the AM and/or zzso coinciding with the side of zzso seizure zzso No significant zzso or asymmetry was demonstrated in patients with focal zzso or generalized zzso We performed a linear zzso analysis, plotting the number of years of zzso zzso and the estimated seizure frequency against the volumes of the AM and zzso There was no correlation between either of these two parameters and AM or zzso volume zzso zzso zzso There was also no correlation between the patient's age and zzso zzso of AM or zzso nor did these zzso correlate with the occurrence of generalized zzso On the other hand, patients with zzso prolonged zzso convulsions in early childhood had significantly smaller AM and zzso compared with those without such a history zzso zzso zzso The findings indicate that repeated zzso or longer duration of zzso do not cause increased zzso of AM or zzso that is measurable by zzso magnetic resonance zzso
