The zzso zzso zzso was investigated for its ability to increase selectively the transport of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso into zzso zzso zzso in nine zzso For each patient, two position zzso zzso zzso studies (one with and one without zzso were zzso For studies with zzso 10 to 300 zzso of the compound was infused into the zzso carotid artery over 15 zzso In each PET study, a sequence of PET scans was initiated simultaneously with an intravenous zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso samples were taken to provide the input zzso All PET scans were zzso to the magnetic resonance zzso images of the zzso zzso of interest were defined for tumor and normal tissue regions on MR images and were copied to the zzso PET dynamic images to provide brain zzso activity zzso The constant zzso for the transport of zzso from plasma to brain tissue was determined using a simple zzso zzso zzso infusion of zzso significantly increased transport into tumor regions with an average increase of 46 zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso p zzso zzso zzso in normal tissue regions was not significantly zzso zzso in three of six patients treated with 300 zzso zzso and zzso had at least a 50% reduction in tumor volume as measured by MR zzso zzso infusion of zzso is a novel technique for selective delivery of zzso compounds into brain zzso
