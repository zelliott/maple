The goal of the study is to evaluate the spatial zzso of zzso zzso technique as a means of assessing cardiac wall motion of the left zzso which has been shown by clinical trials to be a better tool for depicting regional zzso motion than the traditional zzso and invasive zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging, using zzso was performed for nine normal zzso The regional zzso strains observed in the long axis views of left zzso zzso were zzso and zzso analyzed in two different zzso 

The results indicate that the zzso strains observed in the lateral free wall zzso zzso free wall zzso and zzso free wall zzso are significantly greater than those in the zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and anterior free wall zzso zzso It was also found that the greatest strains occurred in the zzso halves of LW and in the zzso halves of zzso and zzso in each of the long axis views, zzso In general, the zzso strain was found to be greater in the zzso halves than in the zzso halves of the zzso 

The zzso cardiac imaging of the zzso section of zzso is a useful tool for assessment of regional zzso function and is invaluable for probing deeper into the intricacies of the heart wall motion in zzso zzso
