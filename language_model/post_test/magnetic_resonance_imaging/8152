A novel method for automated curved zzso zzso zzso of magnetic resonance zzso images of the spine is zzso The zzso images, generated by a transformation from zzso to zzso coordinate system, follow the structural shape of the spine and allow the whole course of the curved anatomy to be viewed in individual zzso The three-dimensional zzso spine curve and the zzso zzso zzso which determine the zzso are described by zzso zzso The zzso spine curve passes through the zzso of zzso bodies, while the zzso zzso rotation determines the rotation of zzso around the axis of the spinal zzso The optimal zzso parameters are obtained by a robust refinement of the initial estimates of the zzso of zzso bodies and zzso zzso zzso The zzso framework is based on the automatic image analysis of MR spine images that exploits some basic anatomical properties of the zzso The method was evaluated on 21 MR images from 12 patients and the results provided a good description of spine zzso with mean errors of zzso zzso and zzso degrees for the position of the zzso spine curve and zzso rotation of zzso zzso The generated zzso images are independent of the position of the patient in the scanner while zzso both anatomical and geometrical properties of the zzso
