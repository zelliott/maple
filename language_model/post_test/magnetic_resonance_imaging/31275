Looking at still images of body parts in situations that are likely to cause pain has been shown to be associated with zzso in some brain areas involved in pain zzso Because pain involves both sensory components and negative zzso it is of interest to explore whether the visually evoked representations of pain and of other negative emotions zzso By means of zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, here we compare the brain areas zzso in female volunteers, by the observation of painful, zzso or neutral stimuli delivered to one hand or zzso Several cortical zzso were activated by the observation of both painful and disgusting video clips, including portions of the zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso cortex, left zzso zzso and right zzso zzso Signal changes in zzso zzso and left anterior zzso were zzso related to the perceived unpleasantness, when the individual differences in zzso to aversive stimuli were taken into zzso zzso scenes selectively induced zzso of left zzso zzso including the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and adjacent portions of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, brain zzso specific for disgusting scenes were found in the zzso zzso zzso These data show both similarities and differences between the brain patterns of activity related to the observation of noxious or disgusting zzso zzso the zzso zzso appears to be particularly involved in the recognition of noxious environmental zzso suggesting that areas involved in sensory aspects of pain are specifically triggered by observing noxious zzso
