To determine the relationship between age and gray matter structure and how interactions between gender and zzso impact this relationship, we examined correlations between global or regional gray matter volume and age, including interactions of gender and hemisphere, using a general linear model with zzso and zzso zzso Brain magnetic resonance images were collected from zzso healthy individuals aged zzso years; the images were zzso zzso and segmented and restored to native space for analysis of global gray matter zzso zzso zzso images were then zzso zzso and smoothed for analysis of regional gray matter zzso Analysis of global gray matter volume revealed a significant negative correlation between gray matter ratio zzso matter volume divided by zzso zzso and age in both zzso and a significant interaction effect of age zzso gender on the gray matter zzso In analyzing regional gray matter volume, the gray matter volume of all regions showed significant main effects of age, and most regions, with the exception of several including the inferior zzso zzso showed a significant age zzso gender zzso Additionally, the inferior zzso zzso showed a significant age zzso gender zzso zzso zzso No regional volumes showed significant age zzso zzso zzso Our study may contribute to clarifying the zzso of normal brain aging in each brain zzso
