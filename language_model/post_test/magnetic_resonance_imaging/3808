A major challenge in central nervous system zzso drug research is to develop a generally zzso methodology for repeated zzso of drug effects on the entire zzso without zzso interactions and a zzso zzso For this reason, zzso zzso zzso methods are promising for pharmacological zzso This study aimed to investigate whether different psychoactive substances cause zzso effects in functional brain connectivity during zzso In this double blind zzso zzso zzso crossover study, seven zzso zzso scans were obtained in 12 healthy young men in three different drug sessions zzso zzso and zzso zzso Drugs were administered zzso based on validated zzso protocols to minimize the zzso and zzso zzso in plasma drug zzso zzso was used to estimate zzso zzso connectivity in relation to eight zzso zzso networks, for each data zzso A mixed effects analysis of drug by time interactions revealed zzso changes in both zzso and functional connectivity resulting from alcohol and zzso Post hoc analysis of regions of interest revealed zzso network interactions in relation to zzso and zzso zzso Our results illustrate the zzso of zzso functional brain connectivity in zzso drug zzso
