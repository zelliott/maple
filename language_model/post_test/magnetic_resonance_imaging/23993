To confirm that routine thin slice zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso spine effectively demonstrates the zzso zzso zzso 

A retrospective review of 100 zzso examinations was carried out and the appearance of the zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso was assessed and classified as Type 1 - normal, Type 2 - sclerotic zzso Type 3 - not zzso and Type 4 - zzso zzso A total of 400 zzso were zzso Those with known or obvious zzso zzso were excluded from the zzso All zzso examinations had both zzso zzso and zzso weighted sequences and both were zzso zzso zzso sequences were carried out with a 3 zzso slice thickness and zzso image sequences with a 4 zzso slice zzso 

The total number of zzso assessed as normal zzso 1) was 299 zzso of the zzso zzso 80 zzso were classified Type zzso On zzso imaging 290 zzso were Type 1 and 66 zzso were Type zzso Both of these types of appearances correlate well with the finding of a normal zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of the zzso appeared normal on zzso and zzso zzso on zzso 

zzso to previous findings with 5 zzso thick zzso routine thin slice zzso zzso and zzso images effectively demonstrate the zzso zzso with acceptable data acquisition times and image zzso We believe this is mainly due to the thinner slices obtained in our zzso
