zzso evidence suggests that the mere zzso feeling of memory impairment in the absence of objective cognitive deficits may zzso mild cognitive impairment in the zzso of zzso disease zzso Brain imaging studies have provided insights into structural and functional zzso at the clinical stages of zzso and mild cognitive zzso but the functional characteristics of zzso memory impairment zzso are largely zzso 

To investigate brain zzso during memory tasks in individuals without cognitive impairment who report zzso compared with control subjects without cognitive impairment and without zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging study of episodic memory and working zzso 

Memory zzso zzso 

zzso participants reporting zzso without cognitive impairment and 20 control individuals without cognitive impairment and zzso 

Brain zzso patterns and performance during an zzso zzso episodic memory task, including zzso recall, and recognition, and a working memory zzso 

Compared with the control group, zzso was associated with a reduction in right zzso zzso during episodic memory recall in the absence of performance zzso This was accompanied by increased zzso of the right zzso prefrontal zzso No differences in performance and no difference in brain zzso during working memory were observed in the zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso is accompanied by functional zzso in zzso integrity that reflect early zzso dysfunction and by zzso mechanisms that preserve memory zzso
