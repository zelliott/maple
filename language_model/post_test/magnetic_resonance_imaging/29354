The aim was to determine if zzso zzso tips could produce larger and safer zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso tips at zzso zzso zzso zzso were induced in beef zzso in zzso with and without water cooling using a zzso zzso zzso laser at various power zzso Seven zzso treatments were performed in six zzso using zzso zzso tips with four animals having zzso zzso zzso zzso grown from zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging zzso feedback software using a fast, radio zzso zzso echo acquisition with two zzso image planes was used for zzso monitoring and control of treatment and for the evaluation of in zzso laser zzso zzso In cases where zzso zzso was zzso the maximum calculated temperature was compared in each zzso Using zzso tips and 400 zzso m core diameter laser zzso zzso in in zzso beef zzso power of up to zzso W was applied for 8 zzso without tip zzso Without zzso tip failure occurred in under 4 zzso at 6 W, in under 2 zzso at 7 W and zzso at 8 zzso Additionally, zzso accompanied zzso made with zzso tips while cooled application resulted in only minimal zzso at only the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diameters in in zzso samples were up to zzso zzso zzso zzso when water cooling was zzso In canine brain and zzso zzso zzso up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso It is concluded that water cooling allows safe application of higher power to small core diameter zzso tip zzso which results in larger zzso zzso than can be achieved without zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso monitoring and feedback of zzso zzso
