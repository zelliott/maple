zzso navigation systems using an optical position sensor have the zzso problem due to a person or instrument in the line of sight of the zzso In this study, zzso real-time magnetic resonance zzso scanning with a passive electromagnetic zzso is zzso 

A newly developed zzso zzso the data of an electromagnetic zzso into that of an optical zzso Registration between the two different coordinate systems is performed for the electromagnetic zzso to substitute the optical sensor without zzso the zzso zzso 

An oil marker attached to the electromagnetic zzso was identified in real-time MR zzso zzso results demonstrated the high zzso of the electromagnetic zzso as an alternative position tracking method in the MR zzso 

The zzso problem of optical sensors is resolved by the proposed zzso
