zzso concepts of zzso techniques are zzso and the theoretical basis of measuring regional blood flow via transit time zzso of a blood pool marker is zzso Using very fast imaging of the effects of an appropriate and efficient relaxation agent, the zzso curve of the agent can be zzso zzso zzso of the transit of zzso iron oxide through a rat brain at zzso T have been zzso There are problems, however, in relating the zzso signal change to the tissue concentration of an zzso relaxation agent when there is not fast exchange of the tissue water with the water in the zzso or when the precise efficacy of the agent varies with the geometrical arrangement of the zzso Studies of the effects of zzso iron oxide particles in different media confirm that the in zzso efficacy varies among different zzso which zzso their use as blood flow zzso
