The present study used functional zzso to clarify the brain regions activated during a series of motor sequencing tasks in healthy zzso Ten subjects were scanned while performing three soft signs tasks ranging from simple zzso palm zzso moderate zzso zzso to complex movements zzso zzso The zzso task induced significant zzso within the cortical networks including bilateral zzso zzso left zzso and right zzso but no zzso in the prefrontal zzso Moreover, the percentage signal changes within the left zzso left zzso and right zzso showed an increase in zzso with task zzso The present findings challenge the traditional belief that zzso was a task for frontal lobe function but suggest that successful performance of more complex neurological soft sign tasks like zzso requires the participation of more brain areas than simple motor sequencing and coordination task like zzso and zzso These also provide the empirical data on the neural basis of neurological soft signs for further study in other clinical group like schizophrenia in the near zzso
