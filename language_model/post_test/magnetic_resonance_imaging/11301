Steady fluid flow was studied in a simple zzso model and in a zzso realistic model of the human carotid zzso Wall zzso stress zzso zzso were calculated from zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the inflow regions were also used as boundary conditions for zzso fluid dynamics zzso calculations of zzso which were compared with those derived from zzso zzso In regions of zzso flow, zzso and zzso estimates of zzso were in good general zzso In regions of disturbed flow, for example near the zzso the quality of the zzso zzso was sufficient for reliable calculation of zzso zzso when a sensitive surface zzso was zzso The combination of zzso and zzso would seem to be a powerful technique for the investigation of flow zzso
