zzso of zzso zzso discs from a rabbit zzso puncture model by using specialized magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques, including displacement zzso with zzso echoes and a zzso echo zzso acquisition and delayed zzso zzso of cartilage zzso 

To evaluate a rabbit disc zzso model by using various zzso zzso To determine the zzso and zzso zzso relaxation time zzso and zzso zzso distribution of zzso discs as compared to normal and adjacent level zzso 

zzso puncture of the zzso disc produces disc zzso in zzso zzso has been previously demonstrated in zzso cartilage for the measurement of soft tissue zzso and zzso zzso also can measure the zzso of zzso and zzso can zzso zzso concentration in zzso zzso In eight New Zealand white zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso disc was zzso After 4 weeks, the zzso and zzso adjacent motion segments were isolated for zzso and zzso zzso was used to estimate the disc volume and map zzso zzso was used to determine zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso was then used to determine zzso zzso 

zzso and standard zzso indicated zzso in zzso zzso zzso volume increased significantly at 4 weeks after the zzso zzso of the nucleus zzso was distinct from that of the zzso zzso in most zzso discs but not in zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher and zzso concentration significantly lower in zzso discs compared with zzso adjacent level zzso 

zzso and quantitative zzso techniques can be used to evaluate the mechanical and zzso changes that occur with animal models of disc zzso zzso zzso and similar techniques have potential for evaluating the progression of disc zzso and the efficacy of zzso
