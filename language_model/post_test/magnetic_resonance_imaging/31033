Reports of MR imaging in zzso zzso associated with zzso are few, and the number of patients studied is zzso We aimed to detail the relationship of zzso zzso to surrounding structures, to determine the frequency and nature of associated zzso and to gain insight into mechanisms of zzso 

We systematically examined MR imaging studies of 72 patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso age, 22 months to 31 zzso A dedicated imaging protocol was used in 38 zzso zzso MR zzso of the zzso zzso was performed for 19 patients and compared with the zzso profile of the zzso in 10 normal children and the frontal lobe in 10 normal zzso 

Compared with normal gray matter, zzso zzso were zzso on zzso images zzso zzso on zzso images zzso and had reduced zzso and increased zzso content shown by MR zzso zzso zzso always involved the zzso region of the zzso with attachment to one or both zzso zzso zzso extension zzso in zzso tended to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso gray matter zzso such that the zzso zzso nestled between the zzso the zzso body, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso size was associated with central precocious zzso Associated findings of questionable zzso significance included anterior zzso white matter signal intensity abnormalities zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of cortical development were observed in only two patients, and zzso sclerosis was not zzso 

zzso zzso can be readily distinguished from normal zzso gray and adjacent zzso fiber zzso best appreciated on thin zzso zzso MR imaging and zzso suggest reduced zzso density and relative zzso compared with normal gray zzso Associated zzso zzso are rare, supporting the view that the zzso zzso alone is responsible for the typical clinical features of the zzso The intimate relationship to the zzso body, zzso and zzso tract suggests a role for these structures in zzso associated with zzso zzso
