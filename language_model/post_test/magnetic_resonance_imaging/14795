The zzso zzso protein 2 zzso gene has been recently identified as a zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso reported as the most common zzso However, the zzso mechanism of the zzso of zzso remains largely zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging is a promising approach to assess cerebral function and reveals underlying functional zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 4 Chinese zzso patients with zzso zzso 6 Chinese zzso patients without the zzso and 10 healthy control zzso zzso analysis was used to characterize zzso in the zzso of zzso fluctuation zzso When compared with the healthy control subjects, both groups of zzso patients showed zzso in spontaneous brain activities within zzso zzso zzso Besides, the group of patients with zzso zzso also exhibited increased zzso in the right zzso zzso and right zzso zzso area, while the zzso of zzso in group of patients without the zzso additionally involved the middle zzso zzso zzso comparative analysis between these two patient groups revealed significantly increased zzso in the right zzso zzso in the group with zzso zzso Increased spontaneous brain activity in the zzso zzso circuitry, especially in the motor preparation areas, is a common zzso in zzso zzso in the spatial patterns of increased zzso between patients with and those without the zzso might reflect the distinct pathological mechanism resulting from zzso zzso
