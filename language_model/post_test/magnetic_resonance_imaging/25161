The purpose of this study was to estimate the development of the zzso and zzso formation in normal fetuses on the basis of the zzso findings using MR images in relation to zzso zzso 

The MR images were obtained from 109 normal fetuses from 18 to 39 weeks of gestation with no neurological zzso The MR images were classified into 8 stages of development for the zzso and zzso formation in the frontal and zzso zzso on the basis of the zzso findings reported by Chi et zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso We examined zzso the relationship between our zzso and zzso age in comparison with the zzso zzso proposed by McArdle et zzso zzso 

There were significant differences in the zzso age among the 8 groups zzso zzso zzso Multiple comparison of individual groups revealed significant differences in the zzso age among the groups zzso zzso zzso Images from 28 to 34 weeks of gestation were classified into 4 stages in our zzso while being covered by one stage in McArdle's zzso 

Our zzso is useful for the assessment of fetal cerebral maturation during the third zzso of pregnancy and may contribute to the prenatal diagnosis of zzso delay of the zzso and zzso zzso
