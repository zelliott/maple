zzso measured during a short arc zzso knee extension exercise were compared in the knees of functionally unstable zzso patients, these patients' zzso knees, and zzso control subjects' zzso zzso phase contrast dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, in combination with a zzso tracking zzso developed by the authors, was used to measure zzso zzso as the subjects performed the active, zzso posture knee extension exercise in the terminal 30 degrees of zzso Two zzso of zzso motion were zzso zzso location of the zzso relative to the zzso and zzso rotation of the zzso relative to the zzso We hypothesized that more anterior zzso zzso as well as differences in zzso zzso rotation patterns, would be observed in zzso zzso knees when compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were used to determine the dependence of the zzso variables on zzso side zzso zzso zzso matched by subject in the control group), zzso zzso angle measured at zzso zzso and zzso subject group zzso zzso zzso zzso significant anterior translation and external zzso rotation zzso home zzso accompanying knee extension were zzso The zzso knees of the injured group exhibited significantly more anterior zzso positioning than the zzso knees of these subjects zzso difference over extension zzso zzso zzso at all angles zzso as well as the matched knees of the control zzso There was a significant effect of interaction between side and subject group on zzso zzso zzso We did not find significant differences in external zzso rotation associated with zzso zzso The changes to active joint zzso documented in this entirely zzso study may contribute to cartilage degradation in zzso knees, and encourage more extensive investigations using similar methodology in the zzso
