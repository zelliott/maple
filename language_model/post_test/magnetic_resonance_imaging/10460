The aim of the study was to assess the clinical value of zzso zzso ultrasound zzso as a novel tool in the zzso staging of patients undergoing liver zzso 

Sixty patients scheduled to undergo liver zzso for zzso disease were zzso zzso staging with zzso CT and/or MR scans was performed within 2 to 6 weeks of zzso Following zzso zzso ultrasound zzso was performed using an zzso scanner zzso and a zzso with pulse inversion harmonic zzso zzso zzso in the zzso mode was performed in a standardized protocol zzso zzso zzso after intravenous injection of zzso zzso of zzso zzso spa, zzso all detected zzso on zzso and zzso scans were counted and zzso Any zzso in surgical management was documented following zzso compared with zzso 

Three patients were excluded due to zzso disease on zzso zzso was significantly more sensitive than zzso and zzso in detecting liver zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso zzso zzso it altered surgical management in zzso (17 of zzso of cases, due to 1) additional zzso in zzso (11 of zzso 2) less zzso in zzso (2 of zzso 3) benign zzso wrongly diagnosed as zzso on zzso in zzso (3 of zzso and 4) vascular proximity in zzso (1 of zzso Management was unchanged in zzso (40 of zzso despite additional zzso detected in zzso (2 of zzso and benign zzso wrongly diagnosed on zzso and CT as zzso in zzso (1 of zzso zzso altered combined zzso staging in zzso 

These preliminary results suggest zzso is an essential tool prior to liver zzso for zzso
