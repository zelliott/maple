zzso studies in healthy participants have implicated anterior zzso lobe regions and the zzso zzso in repetition zzso and semantic zzso Only the investigation of patients with selective zzso however, can establish the necessity of these particular zzso To this end, we administered three tests of repetition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a test of semantic zzso to a patient zzso with a zzso deficit stemming from bilateral damage to the anterior zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso On all of the repetition zzso tasks, zzso showed zzso effects within 1 zzso of 10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated no interaction between group and prime zzso These findings suggest that the anterior zzso and anterior zzso lobe are not required for these zzso zzso zzso also showed normal repetition zzso even for items that he had never been able to name or to provide semantic information zzso On the semantic zzso task, zzso showed normal levels of zzso across zzso When we separately analyzed his zzso for items he could never name or access information about versus items that he had been able to name on at least two testing sessions, we found zzso for the latter items, but not for the zzso This result suggests that zzso deficits resulting from damage to the anterior zzso zzso may disrupt the zzso rapid access of semantic information of some zzso
