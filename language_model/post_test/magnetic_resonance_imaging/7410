zzso emotional zzso is a defining feature of borderline personality disorder, yet the zzso mechanisms underlying this affective instability are poorly zzso One possible contributor is diminished ability to engage the mechanism of emotional zzso The authors tested this hypothesis by examining behavioral and neural zzso of zzso in borderline patients, healthy comparison subjects, and a zzso comparison group of patients with zzso personality zzso 

During zzso zzso borderline patients, healthy subjects, and zzso personality disorder patients viewed novel and repeated pictures, providing zzso ratings at each zzso zzso zzso maps of the contrasts of zzso during repeated versus novel negative picture viewing were compared between zzso zzso interaction analysis was employed to examine functional connectivity differences between zzso 

Unlike healthy subjects, neither borderline nor zzso personality disorder patients exhibited increased activity in the zzso anterior zzso zzso when viewing repeated versus novel zzso This lack of an increase in zzso anterior zzso activity was associated with greater affective instability in borderline zzso In addition, borderline and zzso patients exhibited smaller increases in zzso functional connectivity than healthy subjects and, unlike healthy subjects, did not show zzso in ratings of the emotional intensity of the zzso zzso patients differed from zzso patients in zzso anterior zzso functional connectivity during zzso 

Unlike healthy subjects, borderline patients fail to zzso to negative pictures, and they differ from both healthy subjects and zzso patients in neural activity during zzso A failure to effectively engage emotional zzso processes may contribute to affective instability in borderline zzso
