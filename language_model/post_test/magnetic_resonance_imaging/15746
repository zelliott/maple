zzso zzso of the zzso zzso be useful as a zzso for Alzheimer's disease zzso or the risk for zzso The extent to which the zzso zzso can be distinguished in zzso from changes due to normal aging or other processes that affect the zzso is of clinical importance and is an area of active zzso In this study, we use structural imaging techniques to model zzso size and regional shape differences between elderly men with incident zzso and a zzso comparison group of elderly zzso 

Participants are zzso men from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study zzso The zzso cohort has been followed since zzso The following analysis is based on a zzso of men who underwent zzso examination in zzso Participants were diagnosed with incident zzso zzso zzso or were not zzso zzso zzso One reader, blinded to zzso diagnosis, manually outlined the left and right zzso formation using published zzso We used zzso structural shape analysis methods developed at the Laboratory of zzso Imaging zzso to compare regional variation in zzso diameter between the zzso cases and the zzso comparison zzso 

Mean total zzso volume was zzso smaller in the zzso cases than the zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a similar size difference for the median left zzso and median right zzso zzso Shape analysis showed a regional pattern of shape difference between the zzso and zzso zzso more evident for the zzso body than the head, and the appearance of more consistent differences in the left zzso than the zzso While assignment to a specific zzso is not possible with this method, the surface changes primarily intersect the area of the zzso body containing the zzso region (and adjacent zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso
