A new method for the selective spin labeling of zzso or zzso zzso arteries of the brain without the need for additional zzso coils is zzso A clinical zzso T scanner was zzso The spatial selectivity of the labeling process is based on the limited coverage of the zzso field of a standard zzso head zzso together with an zzso positioning of the labeling zzso A computer simulation was used to zzso key labeling parameters under the condition of zzso zzso The zzso of the computer model results was confirmed by zzso zzso with a flow zzso For human studies, a zzso continuous zzso spin labeling zzso sequence was modified to allow for arbitrary positioning of the labeling zzso The obtained zzso images showed a clear zzso of the zzso territories of the selected arteries in the anterior circulation of the brain and good zzso matter zzso
