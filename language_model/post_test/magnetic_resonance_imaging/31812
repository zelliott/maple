To assess the effect on target zzso of using magnetic resonance simulation for planning of zzso zzso zzso zzso calculations derived from zzso zzso and magnetic zzso plans were zzso The accuracy of zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso digital reconstructed zzso zzso was zzso 

Ten patients with zzso were simulated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso was acquired with a zzso zzso zzso zzso unit zzso Gross zzso volumes zzso were delineated by two radiation zzso on zzso zzso and zzso In total, 30 plans were generated using both the zzso zzso with zzso and without zzso zzso zzso and zzso data sets zzso The minimum dose delivered zzso to the zzso between zzso zzso and zzso plans was zzso The accuracy of zzso positioning using zzso zzso was assessed by four radiation zzso 

The mean zzso delineated on zzso zzso were significantly zzso larger than those contoured on zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso difference percentage was zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso plans, zzso The zzso differences observed with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso 

zzso defined on zzso zzso were significantly larger than those delineated on zzso Compared with zzso zzso plans, zzso dose calculations were zzso The precision of zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso seemed zzso The use of zzso only for the planning of zzso should be further zzso
