The classical approach to zzso nerve block in the zzso zzso zzso zzso often requires multiple attempts to zzso the zzso zzso Recently, it has been suggested that an zzso approach to zzso block may result in a more consistent zzso of the zzso zzso In the current study, we compared anatomical landmarks for the zzso and classical approaches to zzso block with respect to the accuracy in zzso the zzso nerve using magnetic resonance imaging zzso Two zzso experienced in zzso block drew landmarks for the zzso and classical approaches on 10 zzso a zzso zzso zzso magnet was used to obtain simultaneous, zzso thick, zzso echo zzso density zzso zzso sequences of the lower zzso Using these acquired images, the two approaches were simulated zzso using previously identified zzso The spatial relationships of the simulated needle paths to the nerves and vessels in the zzso zzso as well as other relevant structures, were measured and zzso zzso of the zzso approach to zzso block resulted in zzso nerve contact in 14 legs zzso versus 5 legs zzso when the classical approach was used zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso approach might result in a more consistent zzso of the zzso nerve and may decrease the risk of zzso vessel zzso 

A simulation of zzso block using magnetic resonance imaging in volunteers suggests that using zzso of the hamstring muscles as the anatomical landmarks yields a more consistent zzso of the zzso zzso
