The size and contents of the pelvis differ between the zzso and this may affect zzso size and zzso The aim of this prospective pilot study was to examine zzso the applied anatomy of the zzso 

zzso patients (35 male, 23 zzso with primary zzso cancer who had suitable high-resolution staging pelvic magnetic resonance images between November 2002 and July 2004 were zzso Ten variables of zzso zzso were measured on zzso images at the zzso zzso The associations between zzso variables and gender and body mass index were zzso 

Compared with female patients, male patients had a larger area of overall zzso package zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso larger area of zzso fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and higher ratio of zzso to zzso diameter of the zzso package zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The anterior zzso fat buffer was significantly thinner in females than in males zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso fat area was greater in males with a body mass index zzso than with a body mass index zzso 

Males have a larger overall zzso package compared with zzso mainly caused by zzso zzso The anterior zzso fat is significantly thinner in females than in zzso Such zzso differences may affect zzso margin zzso
