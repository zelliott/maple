Investigation of zzso data from a pivotal zzso trial has demonstrated an increased rate of volume loss, compared to zzso after the first year of zzso It was considered to be probably due to a zzso zzso 

To assess zzso and white matter volume changes and their relation to global brain volume changes and to baseline zzso for patients under zzso zzso 

We selected 45 patients on zzso therapy for at least 24 months, with magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans at zzso 12 and 24 zzso We calculated the percentage brain volume change zzso for the first and second year, using zzso zzso Grey and white matter zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the first year were calculated with zzso using zzso zzso After quality checks, six patients were zzso We studied the zzso variables of change in brain zzso 

The zzso decrease was faster during the first year zzso zzso zzso as compared to the second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These differences were more marked in patients with baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso and zzso changes during the first year of treatment were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of active zzso at baseline zzso predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso change zzso zzso zzso during the first year of treatment, after adjusting for age and zzso zzso No zzso were found for zzso volume zzso 

Early brain volume loss during zzso therapy is mainly due to zzso volume loss and it is related to the inflammatory activity present at the onset of zzso We found that the zzso effect is mostly due to white matter volume zzso
