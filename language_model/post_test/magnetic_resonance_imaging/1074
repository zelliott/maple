zzso resonance imaging was recently reported to detect zzso plaques in zzso and abdominal zzso 

Using magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated associations of risk factors and plasma inflammatory markers with plaques in both zzso and abdominal zzso in 102 patients undergoing coronary zzso zzso between coronary artery disease zzso and zzso plaques were also zzso 

zzso in zzso and abdominal zzso were detected in zzso and zzso of patients, zzso Age and zzso blood pressure correlated with plaque zzso in both the zzso zzso LDL cholesterol level correlated with plaque extent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The degree of smoking correlated with plaque extent in the abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, age and zzso blood pressure were associated with plaques in both the zzso The LDL cholesterol and smoking were characteristically associated with plaques in the zzso and abdominal zzso zzso Regarding inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso protein levels correlated with total plaque extent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared with 24 patients without zzso 78 with zzso more often had plaques in the zzso zzso vs zzso and abdominal zzso vs zzso zzso Although plaque zzso in both the zzso correlated with the severity of zzso only zzso plaques were independently associated with zzso 

The zzso and abdominal zzso may have different zzso to risk zzso However, plasma inflammatory markers appear to reflect total extent of zzso zzso Although zzso plaques are common in patients with zzso only zzso plaques are an independent factor for zzso
