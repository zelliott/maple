How are word recognition circuits organized in the left zzso zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to dissect cortical word-processing circuits using three diagnostic criteria: the capacity of an area zzso to respond to words in a single zzso zzso or zzso or in both zzso zzso to zzso its response in a zzso manner as a function of the zzso or zzso emphasis of the task, and zzso to show repetition suppression in response to the conscious repetition of the target word within the same sensory zzso or across different zzso The results clarify the organization of visual and auditory word-processing zzso In particular, the visual word form area zzso in the left zzso zzso appears strictly as a visual zzso zzso It is, however, bordered by a second lateral zzso area which is zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso Both areas might have been zzso in past zzso Our results also suggest a possible zzso of the zzso in the auditory zzso the auditory word form area, located in the left anterior superior zzso zzso
