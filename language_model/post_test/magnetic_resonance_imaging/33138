The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of zzso echo time zzso imaging in the zzso of middle ear zzso in normal zzso 

12 young adult volunteers zzso zzso zzso age zzso years, mean zzso zzso with normal hearing levels underwent zzso studies using a zzso T clinical unit with an zzso zzso head zzso For each subject, the whole head was zzso using a three-dimensional zzso zzso imaging sequence with zzso trajectory and the following zzso field of view, 240 zzso 240 zzso 240 zzso zzso 320 zzso zzso flip angle, zzso repetition zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso size, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso number of signals zzso 1; imaging time, 27 zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso images were obtained by zzso long TE zzso zzso images from short TE zzso zzso zzso By using these three images, the visibility of the bilateral middle ear zzso was zzso Moreover, as a reference for the zzso findings, CT images of the zzso bone were obtained in one zzso 

In all subjects, the middle ear zzso were clearly zzso as a high signal intensity spot surrounded by a signal void of air on short TE images zzso while they were not visible in long TE images in any of the zzso The zzso images provided better contrast of the zzso 

We demonstrated the feasibility of zzso imaging of the middle ear zzso in normal zzso
