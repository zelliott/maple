In zzso disease zzso mounting evidence points to a greater role for synaptic loss than zzso zzso Supporting this notion, multiple zzso studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the earliest sites of pathology, exhibiting zzso zzso and then zzso before there is substantial loss of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this zzso study, we tested whether tissue loss in the zzso zzso zzso layer can be observed in zzso in patients with mild zzso 

We performed zzso zzso zzso on subjects with mild zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso normal controls zzso zzso zzso With a zzso zzso zzso echo sequence that was easily tolerated by subjects, we obtained zzso slices of the zzso at an zzso resolution of 195 zzso 

On images revealing the zzso landmarks of zzso zzso and zzso we observed thinning of the zzso zzso zzso in subjects with mild zzso compared to zzso By contrast, the 2 groups exhibited no difference in the thickness of the zzso cell body layer or of the entire zzso zzso zzso volume, measured on a conventional zzso sequence obtained at zzso also did not differentiate these patients with mild zzso from zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso is apparent in patients with mild zzso With its superior spatial resolution, zzso zzso permits in zzso analysis of a very zzso early site of zzso zzso
