zzso pressure wound therapy zzso is believed to initiate zzso tissue formation via zzso of the wound zzso However, only few studies have been performed to evaluate this zzso The present study was performed to investigate the effects of zzso on wound contraction and wound edge tissue zzso 

Six pigs underwent median zzso followed by magnetic resonance imaging in the zzso plane through the zzso and zzso wound during zzso at 0, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The lateral zzso of the wound and zzso thickness of the wound edge was measured in the zzso 

The zzso wound decreased in size following zzso The lateral zzso of the zzso at the level of the zzso bone, decreased from 39 zzso 7 zzso to 30 zzso 6 zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The greatest decrease in wound zzso occurred when switching from 0 to zzso zzso The level of negative pressure did not affect wound contraction zzso zzso 32 zzso 6 zzso at zzso zzso and 29 zzso 6 zzso at zzso zzso p zzso zzso The decrease in lateral wound zzso during zzso was greater in subcutaneous tissue zzso zzso 2 zzso than in zzso bone (9 zzso 2 zzso resulting in a ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso of the zzso The zzso thicknesses of the soft zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the wound edge, were not affected by negative zzso 

zzso contracts the wound and causes zzso of the wound edge zzso This zzso force in the tissue and at the zzso interface may be one of the mechanisms by which negative pressure delivery promotes zzso tissue formation and wound zzso
