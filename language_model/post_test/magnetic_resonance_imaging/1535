zzso zzso zzso on zzso images is an uncommon manifestation of zzso multiple zzso and zzso zzso This study was performed to determine whether zzso low signal intensity is an MR feature of meningitis, viral encephalitis, or zzso zzso and to investigate a cause of zzso low zzso 

We zzso reviewed MR images of 117 patients with meningitis, encephalitis zzso or zzso or zzso zzso for the presence of zzso low intensity, zzso enhancement, signal intensity change of cortex, and change in zzso low intensity on follow-up zzso zzso zzso images and apparent diffusion zzso zzso maps were obtained in 55 zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso analyzed on zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso low intensity was found in nine zzso of 38 patients with encephalitis zzso zzso unknown origin, zzso five zzso of 21 with zzso zzso and five zzso of 58 with zzso zzso enhancement was observed in zzso and cortical zzso in 14 zzso of 19 patients with zzso low zzso zzso enhancement was seen in 46 zzso and cortical zzso in 33 zzso of 98 patients without zzso low zzso zzso low intensity disappeared or decreased in extent on follow-up MR images in all seven patients who underwent zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was lower than that of the zzso area and decreased by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso low intensity was uncommonly found in meningitis, viral encephalitis, and zzso zzso It is a zzso MR sign of various zzso and cortical zzso Although the cause of zzso low intensity remains uncertain, free radical formation may play a role as a zzso zzso
