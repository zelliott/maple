To determine the contrast agent behavior of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso contrast media for zzso imaging of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in 30 rats, and they were serially zzso with segmented zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso time zzso time zzso time zzso zzso zzso flip angle, 15 degrees ) during 1 hour after administration of contrast media by using a zzso MR zzso zzso zzso of the zzso relaxation were performed by using the zzso approach zzso time zzso time zzso zzso flip angle, 10 degrees zzso zzso and size of zzso were evaluated at each time point and compared with zzso zzso zzso 

For all zzso media, the contrast agent cleared from the blood pool zzso zzso contrast media allowed precise labeling of viable zzso within 30 minutes, and the labeling persisted for at least 1 zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso area was apparent after 5 minutes, and the peak zzso ratio zzso between zzso and zzso was comparable to the peak zzso of zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso provided excellent zzso detection but a small imaging window for precise zzso of the zzso if a fixed inversion time of 430 zzso was zzso zzso zzso contrast media provided a longer imaging window, but zzso size was overestimated because of the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso zzso 

When zzso zzso agents are used for zzso size zzso imaging parameters and timing are important because the zzso of both normal and zzso injured zzso must be zzso zzso agents are highly specific and less sensitive to timing for zzso size determination, but further studies are required to determine if they are feasible for human zzso
