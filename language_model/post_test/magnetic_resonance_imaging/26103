zzso and imaging studies to date have not clarified which zzso of the zzso lobe are specialized for zzso processing, and which perform supporting zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate zzso lobe function during zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined by analyzing regional differences in brain zzso between perfect zzso zzso and imperfect zzso Perfect performers had significantly less zzso only in the left angular zzso a finding that may be associated with skill zzso and long-term practice zzso The present results provide the first direct evidence of localized functional zzso for zzso processing in the human zzso
