zzso with type 1 diabetes have mild performance deficits on a range of zzso tests compared with zzso control zzso The mechanisms underlying this cognitive deterioration are still poorly zzso but chronic zzso is now emerging as a potential zzso possibly through zzso changes in the zzso In 24 type 1 diabetic patients, we tested at zzso and at acute zzso whether the presence of zzso diabetic zzso as a marker of zzso disease, adversely affects the ability of the brain to respond to standardized zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging with a cognitive zzso Patients with zzso compared with patients without, showed less zzso zzso an increased zzso in the anterior zzso and the zzso frontal zzso during zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso Task performance and reaction time were not significantly different for either zzso We conclude that zzso damage in the brain of patients with zzso caused this increased brain response to compensate for functional zzso
