To evaluate the common characteristics and differences in contrast behavior of zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso zzso 

zzso doped with increasing doses of zzso and a zzso phantom were used to evaluate the dependence of the STIR and zzso signals on the zzso relaxation zzso Clinical zzso images were obtained from 30 patients with musculoskeletal abnormalities and compared to conventional STIR images in 15 cases and to zzso zzso images in another 15 zzso 

In the phantom zzso a significantly shorter inversion time zzso was needed to achieve fat suppression on zzso images, and, with an identical number of signal averages, zzso ratios were lower on zzso zzso These differences between STIR and zzso can be attributed to the contribution of zzso echoes to overall zzso signal and can be compensated by a shorter zzso and a higher number of signal averages for zzso zzso With these zzso clinical zzso and STIR images showed an identical contrast behavior with fat suppression and a high sensitivity to pathological zzso but zzso saved a significant amount of scan time and reduced some types of zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso sequences should replace conventional STIR sequences and should be performed before contrast zzso
