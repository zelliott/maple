To investigate the role of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the examination of patients after zzso biopsy of breast zzso before zzso 

zzso patients underwent contrast zzso MR imaging after initial zzso biopsy of breast zzso before further zzso 

The positive zzso value of MR imaging for predicting residual disease was zzso the negative zzso value was zzso Fourteen patients had zzso zzso zzso 6) or diffuse zzso zzso 8) zzso The extent of tumor was correctly identified with MR imaging alone in nine of the 14 patients, with both zzso and MR imaging in three patients, with zzso alone in one patient, and with no imaging zzso in one zzso In four of the 14 patients, management was altered from zzso to mastectomy zzso zzso 3) or from zzso therapy to mastectomy zzso zzso zzso 

MR imaging has a high positive zzso value for predicting residual tumor after zzso zzso The identification of zzso and clinically zzso zzso or extensive residual tumor may lend support for mastectomy rather than zzso However, zzso findings due to zzso changes and zzso findings due to enhancement of zzso tissue and benign breast tissue remain zzso
