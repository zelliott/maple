To zzso the sites involved in zzso dysfunction during bacterial meningitis in adults and to relate these findings to the extent of hearing impairment and zzso zzso 

Hearing impairment is among the most frequent complications of bacterial zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of the inner ear was performed in seven adult patients with hearing loss as a complication of bacterial zzso 

Five patients had unilateral zzso zzso 1) or bilateral zzso zzso 4) contrast enhancement of zzso zzso The structures most frequently involved were the cochlear nerve zzso zzso zzso the first cochlear turn zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the semicircular canals zzso zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between clinical and zzso findings: all nine ears with cochlear enhancement were deaf (hearing loss zzso zzso whereas none of the five ears with normal zzso findings had hearing losses of more than 90 zzso zzso 30 to 70 zzso p zzso zzso zzso dysfunction as revealed clinically and by quantitative zzso function testing was found in six of seven patients (11 of 14 zzso Five of these patients zzso zzso also demonstrated enhancement of the zzso organ on high-resolution zzso of the inner zzso 

zzso zzso can zzso the involvement of zzso structures in bacterial meningitis in both cooperative and consciously impaired zzso These findings suggest a correlation between abnormalities on zzso and the extent of cochlear zzso
