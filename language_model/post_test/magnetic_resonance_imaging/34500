This study evaluates the magnetic resonance characteristics of spinal zzso zzso and their associated disc space zzso 

The results were correlated with history, clinical, and laboratory findings to provide guidelines for early and appropriate diagnosis of zzso spinal zzso 

Imaging signs of spinal infections have been reported before, but not with special attention to early clinical and imaging zzso 

Thirteen patients (10 men, 3 zzso age range, zzso zzso with progressive zzso deficit were zzso All patients had a zzso examination after admission and a magnetic resonance imaging scan done within the first 48 zzso In all cases, zzso images before and after administration of zzso were zzso zzso images were acquired in eight cases as zzso Ten patients subsequently underwent open zzso in three cases, a zzso biopsy and drainage was zzso 

zzso zzso was found in five patients, and zzso zzso was seen in another five zzso Three patients had an zzso infection without a zzso zzso zzso and clinical findings varied zzso Despite clinical signs of spinal zzso involvement, a spinal zzso zzso was demonstrated only zzso Signal change in zzso images may be the first sign of disc space zzso Because a zzso deficit may occur before any change is visible, follow-up examinations may be required if zzso infection is suspected on clinical zzso 

zzso resonance imaging is the appropriate method for diagnostic zzso of progressive zzso deficit resulting from zzso zzso
