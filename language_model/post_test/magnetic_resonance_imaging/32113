The zzso and zzso pathways zzso and P zzso are the major pathways of the visual system, with distinct zzso and zzso properties that may also have different zzso zzso We zzso that the differences of the 2 visual pathways would also manifest as differences in the signal time course of blood oxygen zzso functional MR imaging zzso zzso The differences in zzso signal time course may provide insight into the zzso requirements of the 2 zzso 

Eleven zzso sessions on 6 subjects were performed using stimuli that zzso activated the 2 zzso zzso commonly activated by both the M and P stimuli in the primary visual zzso zzso were determined, and the contrast zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and the full zzso at half maximum zzso of the zzso signal time course were zzso 

The functional stimuli activated cortical regions described previously in the literature, such as zzso zzso and zzso Within zzso the zzso of the signal time course of the 2 stimuli were statistically different, with the P stimulus generating zzso that were on average zzso faster than the M stimulus zzso zzso zzso 

We have demonstrated the ability to functionally differentiate the M and P stimuli in a commonly activated zzso zzso Because the zzso response is dependent on the ratio of zzso and zzso in the blood, the difference in the zzso time course between the 2 stimuli suggests that the oxygen demand of the 2 pathways may be zzso
