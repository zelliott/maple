The microscopic study of the various components of zzso provide a proper basis for understanding the nature of zzso zzso to which they are subject and their imaging zzso This study was designed to correlate MR imaging with a systematic zzso study of the normal zzso joint zzso which to our knowledge is not available in the zzso 

Five male zzso aged 20 to 45 years, and seven male and seven female volunteers, aged 23 to 44 years, were investigated with zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging of the zzso A variety of sequences including zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies in the volunteers were zzso zzso was performed in six zzso of the five zzso and compared with the MR images for the microscopic joint anatomy and assessed for the presence of abnormalities resembling those associated with zzso 

Throughout the zzso the zzso cartilage of the zzso bone and the zzso third of the zzso zzso cartilage was strongly attached to the surrounding stabilizing ligaments, forming wide margins of zzso In the zzso one-third of the joint only, the margins of the zzso joint facet resemble that of a zzso joint, which include an inner capsule with zzso zzso The MR anatomy of the zzso and zzso aspects of the zzso was only adequately zzso at zzso zzso MR zzso No contrast enhancement occurred in the zzso tissue or in the zzso joint zzso The zzso transition between the zzso 2/3 and zzso 1/3 of the zzso joint was at zzso rich in anatomical and zzso zzso including zzso zzso cartilage and zzso zzso and vascular zzso tissue in the bone zzso These were all recognized at zzso zzso MR imaging and in zzso MR zzso may resemble zzso Otherwise, no zzso bone zzso zzso bone sclerosis or abnormal contrast enhancement occurred in the normal zzso 

The zzso should be classified zzso as a zzso with some characteristics of a zzso joint being confined to the zzso zzso portion at the zzso zzso zzso MR imaging does not allow assessment of normal zzso zzso or abnormalities of the zzso and zzso margins of the zzso zzso
