The aim of this work was to identify zzso zzso zzso in MR images to discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso and healthy zzso Clinical MR images were collected for 58 patients and 28 zzso healthy zzso After zzso all the images the zzso zzso fluid was zzso extracted for each subject and an innovative technique for fully automatic shape modeling was applied to generate comparable zzso of all zzso The search for potential zzso was carried out with repeated zzso zzso results highlighted zzso areas of the zzso surface being discriminating features for zzso the left inferior zzso zzso horn, the right zzso zzso horn zzso and zzso and the areas close to the left anterior part of the corpus zzso and the head of the right zzso zzso The zzso were then used as features to build an intelligent machine for zzso zzso a Support zzso zzso was trained on zzso and healthy subjects and subsequently tested with zzso experiments and validation tests on previously unseen zzso The results showed a sensitivity of zzso for zzso with an overall accuracy of zzso proving that suitable zzso for zzso can be detected in clinical MR zzso
