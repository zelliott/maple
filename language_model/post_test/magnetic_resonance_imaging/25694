The value of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the examination of the function of transplanted zzso was zzso Dynamic zzso was performed on 14 zzso transplant zzso After the injection of zzso zzso zzso we used small tip angle zzso echo zzso technique with a flip angle of 20 zzso The zzso was higher in signal intensity of well functioning zzso than the zzso before the injection in zzso Signal intensity of the zzso decreased after 30 zzso After 1 minute the signal intensity of the zzso recovered and low intensity band meaning passage of zzso at zzso differentiation was zzso Signal intensity of the zzso decreased after 3 zzso Signal intensity of the zzso of transplanted kidney after 5 minutes was much the same as that before zzso Image of poor functioning zzso displayed unclear zzso zzso values of both zzso and zzso in well functioning zzso decreased rapidly after about 2 minutes, and rose zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso were almost flat on and after 5 zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso in poor functioning zzso were almost flat through out the zzso We concluded that effective parameters of the graft function for the zzso curve were delta zzso and delta zzso Dynamic zzso was suggested to be useful in the evaluation of kidney graft zzso
