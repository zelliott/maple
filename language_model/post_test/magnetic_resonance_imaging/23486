The goal of the present study was to investigate the zzso basis of zzso fact zzso The rationale was that areas playing a crucial role in zzso fact retrieval should show a systematic increase of zzso with increasing retrieval zzso To achieve this goal, we zzso the zzso effect as this is known to be systematically related to retrieval zzso In contrast to many previous studies, we here took a zzso approach to account for the continuous increase of retrieval effort with problem zzso zzso signals were modeled with problem size as zzso zzso and negative slow waves of the zzso were zzso into six levels of problem zzso The zzso data showed that zzso in the angular zzso and zzso increased zzso with problem zzso The zzso data showed a systematic zzso increase with increasing problem size, especially at zzso zzso zzso with the zzso data, source modeling localized this effect to the zzso While these findings support previous notions about the crucial role of the angular zzso during fact zzso they also provide evidence that the zzso frontal zzso is involved when single-digit zzso are zzso Thus, both zzso and frontal structures seem to be integral parts of a system that enables and controls zzso fact zzso
