To compare zzso transit time estimates from two efficient transit time mapping techniques using zzso spin labeling zzso zzso zzso spin tagging zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effects of bipolar zzso and label location were zzso 

Six healthy subjects were scanned with zzso zzso zzso FEAST and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso at different labeling locations with and without bipolar zzso Application of transit time mapping was demonstrated in a clinical zzso 

Mean zzso zzso transit times were zzso zzso 39, zzso zzso 73 and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso with labeling zzso of 60 and zzso respectively, showing linear dependence on labeling zzso Mean zzso transit time for zzso was zzso zzso in good agreement with the FEAST estimate of zzso zzso 128 zzso Data acquired from a patient with stroke demonstrate how transit time and zzso maps provide complementary information for clinical zzso 

Both FEAST and zzso provide transit time information in clinically acceptable scan zzso zzso zzso can be used to tailor transit time estimates for different experimental and clinical zzso
