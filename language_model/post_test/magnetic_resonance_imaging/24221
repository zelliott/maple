To determine how cerebral blood flow zzso total and zzso cerebral blood volume zzso and blood zzso zzso zzso contrast change during zzso and zzso using zzso zzso 

Using zzso spin labeling and zzso zzso contrast, we measured zzso and changes in both total and zzso zzso during zzso zzso in the rat zzso 

We observed zzso zzso for mean zzso blood pressure zzso between 50 and 140 zzso zzso at which average zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso total and zzso zzso changes were small and not significantly different from zzso zzso zzso with this, no significant zzso changes were zzso For zzso between 10 and 40 zzso zzso total zzso in the zzso increased slightly zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso on the cortical surface, total zzso increases were larger zzso zzso and zzso zzso was unchanged zzso zzso With severe zzso both total and zzso zzso decreased zzso Over the entire range of graded global zzso there were increases in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso changes are smaller than those of previous reports but are consistent with the small zzso fraction of total blood zzso Such zzso allow a framework for understanding effective zzso zzso during zzso and zzso relationships during zzso
