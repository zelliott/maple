We present the case for a role of biologically plausible neural network modeling in bridging the gap between physiology and zzso We argue that zzso networks can allow zzso translation between zzso properties of neural systems and emergent zzso zzso psychological results to be simulated from implemented networks and also zzso to be made from simulations concerning processing at a neural zzso These models also emphasize particular factors zzso the dynamics of performance in relation to real-time zzso zzso that are not highlighted in other approaches and that can be tested zzso We illustrate our argument from zzso models that select stimuli by biased zzso We show that a model with biased competition dynamics can simulate data ranging from zzso studies of zzso activity zzso 1) to zzso behavior in human visual search zzso zzso while also capturing effects at an intermediate level, including performance breakdown after neural zzso zzso 3) and data from brain imaging zzso zzso We also show that, at each level of analysis, novel predictions can be derived from the biologically plausible parameters adopted, which we proceed to test zzso zzso We argue that, at least for studying the dynamics of visual attention, the approach zzso links zzso to psychological zzso
