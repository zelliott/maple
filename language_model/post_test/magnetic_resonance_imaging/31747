To correlate high resolution dynamic MR features with zzso factors in breast zzso 

One hundred and zzso women with invasive zzso zzso underwent dynamic MR imaging using zzso three-dimensional fast zzso shot zzso sequence within two weeks prior to zzso zzso and kinetic MR features were determined based on the breast imaging and reporting data system zzso MR imaging zzso zzso specimens were analyzed for tumor size, zzso zzso zzso status, zzso grade, expression of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso between the MR features and zzso factors were determined using the zzso zzso test, zzso association, and zzso zzso zzso 

By zzso analysis, a zzso margin was a zzso independent predictor of a lower zzso grade zzso zzso zzso and lower expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement was zzso independent predictor of a higher zzso grade zzso zzso zzso negative expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso negative expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a larger tumor size zzso zzso zzso A zzso curve may predict a higher level of zzso zzso zzso zzso Most of the parameters of the initial enhancement phase cannot predict the status of the zzso zzso Only the enhancement ratio may predict a larger tumor size zzso zzso zzso 

Of the zzso features, a zzso margin may predict favorable zzso whereas rim enhancement or zzso may predict zzso prognosis of breast zzso
