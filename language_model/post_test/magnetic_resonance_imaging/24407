zzso gesture zzso learning to a greater degree in children than in adults, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying the processing of zzso gesture differ as a function of zzso We suggest that this may be partially due to children's lack of experience producing zzso leading to differences in the recruitment of zzso networks when comparing adults to zzso Here, we investigated the neural zzso of gesture processing in a zzso sample of zzso zzso and 10-year-old children and adults and focused on relative recruitment of a zzso system that included the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso middle zzso zzso zzso Children and adults were presented with videos in which communication occurred through different combinations of speech and gesture during a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso and zzso were recruited to different zzso in the two zzso We interpret these novel findings as supporting the idea that gesture perception zzso is affected by a history of gesture production zzso revealing the importance of considering gesture processing as a zzso zzso
