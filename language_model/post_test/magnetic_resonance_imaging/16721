zzso white matter zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso is associated with brain zzso Some previous studies examined the relation between the zzso and cortical zzso however, little is known about how the zzso affect the pattern of cortical zzso Recent studies have revealed that zzso role of zzso in affecting cortical zzso may be different between zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and those in other zzso Based on a zzso study up to 5 years, we attempt to examine the zzso relation between the zzso and cortical zzso with special attention to the zzso in the zzso 

We evaluated the zzso pattern of cortical zzso in 74 cognitively normal subjects lacking zzso in zzso zzso zzso and 13 cognitively normal subjects with zzso in zzso zzso zzso The relationship between the baseline zzso severity and the cortical volume change during the observation period zzso zzso zzso was zzso basically evaluated on the zzso 

The first analysis showed fairly zzso zzso pattern in zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the findings gained from the second appear to lack such systematic orderliness of the zzso 

This result shows that zzso may affect zzso in multiple cerebral zzso even in cognitively normal zzso zzso the impact of zzso on the shrinkage shown in the brains of cognitively healthy older individuals is an important base for assessing the zzso pattern of zzso of the individual with neurodegenerative disorder like zzso
