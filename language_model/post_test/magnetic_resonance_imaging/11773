Multiple myeloma zzso is a zzso disease of the zzso system characterized by the formation of zzso zzso of the skeleton with zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso The submitted investigation evaluates the importance of examination of the spine by magnetic resonance zzso as compared with results of conventional zzso zzso The analyzed group of 75 patients with multiple myeloma was assembled in the course of the previous four zzso All patients were examined by conventional zzso and magnetic resonance and the assembled results were mutually zzso On examination by MR a pathological finding was recorded in zzso zzso patients, when using zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso bodies was assessed by means of magnetic resonance in zzso zzso patients, when using zzso in zzso zzso zzso Secondary zzso of the spinal canal was detected by MR in zzso zzso zzso spread of zzso masses was found in zzso zzso patients zzso zzso examination was negative in these zzso zzso zzso in the area of the spine were recorded in zzso zzso patients examined by zzso while by using zzso only in zzso zzso From the presented results ensues that nuclear magnetic resonance is for evaluation of spinal zzso in zzso much more sensitive than conventional zzso mainly due to the possibility of direct zzso of soft tissue zzso masses and evaluation of their relationship to the spinal zzso The contribution of MR examination is invaluable in particular in patients with obscure back pain and a negative finding on zzso examination of the skeleton where X-ray examination does not explain adequately the patient's complaints, as well as in patients with suspected zzso of the spinal zzso In some zzso situations it contributes to more accurate assessment of the clinical stage and thus to selection of adequate zzso
