We compared zzso activity recorded with zzso and zzso zzso in 19 patients with zzso sclerosis complex zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso scans were zzso zzso spikes were identified in zzso and zzso recordings zzso by three zzso zzso for which the zzso agreement zzso zzso was zzso were used for source zzso with zzso zzso zzso MUSIC analysis was zzso The distance between the source determined from zzso and zzso recordings and the border of the closest zzso was calculated and zzso 

Consensus spikes zzso zzso were identified in 12 patients in the zzso recording and in 14 patients in the zzso zzso zzso sources were closer to zzso in all but one zzso Three patients underwent zzso surgery, two of whom are seizure free after complete zzso of the zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso sources identified on zzso are closer to the presumed zzso zzso than are similar sources identified on zzso Moreover, spike consensus is greater with zzso Clear identification of the zzso zone may offer opportunities for surgery in patients with zzso with intractable zzso
