To increase the spatial coverage and to reduce slice zzso combined with an optimal zzso ratio zzso in zzso dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso sampling schemes and a new reconstruction strategy based on virtual coils are presented for zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, for MR zzso an alternating zzso zzso sampling along the zzso direction shifts the zzso artifacts out of the signal reception zzso zzso coils for effective zzso zzso imaging suppresses the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were compared to the conventional Cartesian imaging in phantom and in zzso MR zzso zzso 

The slice zzso was significantly reduced by zzso and compared to Cartesian imaging the zzso increased by zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso provided a substantially increased field of view zzso in the slice direction and allowed the spatial resolution to be improved (up to zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso without lengthening the scan zzso 

zzso and zzso improve the image quality in zzso zzso MR zzso by enhancing the spatial resolution, reducing the slice zzso at nearly optimal zzso and increasing the zzso in the slice zzso For zzso no lengthening of the scan time or usage of zzso receiver coils is zzso
