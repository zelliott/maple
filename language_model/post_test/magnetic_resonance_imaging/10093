Gene therapy for zzso was evaluated in two mouse models of zzso type 2 zzso zzso a transgenic model in which mice express a dominant zzso form of zzso and spontaneously develop zzso and zzso a zzso model in which human zzso tissue is implanted zzso into zzso compromised zzso In both models, zzso volumes were monitored by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and showed strong zzso enhancement typical of these tumors in zzso Both types of tumor were positive for the zzso cell marker zzso and highly zzso with zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso were injected with an zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso which has deletions in genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso transgenic model, zzso were reduced by more than half their original size by 10 days after zzso In the case of subcutaneous zzso zzso reduction in size after infection occurred more slowly, with a mean reduction of zzso by 42 days after zzso zzso injected with control vehicles continued to grow slowly over time in both zzso zzso These studies demonstrate the ability of an zzso zzso zzso zzso to reduce the volume of zzso tumors in zzso tumor models in mice and extend the possible therapeutic applications of zzso zzso for benign tumors to reduce mass while minimizing nerve zzso
