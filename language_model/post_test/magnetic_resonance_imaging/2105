zzso in connectivity between the frontal and zzso zzso may explain some of the symptoms observed in zzso Conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies, however, have not shown compelling evidence for white matter zzso because white matter fiber tracts cannot be zzso by conventional zzso zzso zzso imaging is a relatively new technique that can detect subtle white matter abnormalities in zzso by assessing the degree to which zzso organized fibers have lost their normal zzso The first three diffusion zzso imaging studies in schizophrenia showed lower zzso zzso relative to comparison subjects, in zzso white matter, prefrontal and zzso white matter, and the corpus zzso zzso Here the authors focus on fiber tracts forming zzso zzso 

zzso diffusion was assessed in the zzso zzso the most prominent white matter tract connecting zzso and frontal brain regions, in 15 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 18 normal comparison zzso A zzso GE zzso system was used to acquire zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso of the fractional zzso were generated to zzso the water diffusion within the zzso zzso 

zzso revealed a zzso interaction for fractional zzso and for zzso zzso area, derived from automatic zzso The patients with schizophrenia showed a lack of normal zzso asymmetry seen in the comparison zzso 

These findings demonstrate the importance of investigating white matter tracts in zzso in schizophrenia and support the hypothesis of a disruption in the normal pattern of connectivity between zzso and frontal brain regions in zzso
