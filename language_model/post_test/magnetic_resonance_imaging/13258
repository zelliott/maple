The zzso network is an ensemble of cortical regions that are typically zzso during demanding cognitive tasks in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Using functional connectivity analysis, this network can be studied as a zzso brain system whose functional role is supposed to consist in the dynamic control of intrinsic processing activities like attention focusing and zzso thought generation and zzso Independent component analysis zzso is the method of choice for generating a statistical image of the zzso network zzso using a zzso and zzso distributed model of zzso functional connectivity without prior zzso of zzso region extent and timing of neural zzso We used a standard graded zzso task zzso to induce zzso changes in the zzso regions and zzso to evaluate to zzso functional connectivity in zzso healthy zzso Based on the known spatial zzso of the zzso maps with the task difficulty levels, we hypothesized the zzso may also correlate with the subject zzso We confirmed that the relative extent of the anterior and zzso zzso spots within the zzso were zzso zzso positively in the anterior and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso correlated with the level of task difficulty and found out that the spatial distribution of zzso also zzso with the individual task zzso We conclude that the zzso function is related to a spatial zzso of the zzso functional zzso and that the relative involvement of the zzso regions within the zzso might function as a novel predictor of the zzso zzso
