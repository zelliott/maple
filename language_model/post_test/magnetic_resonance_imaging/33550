zzso rat zzso have been labeled zzso using zzso zzso of two zzso contrast agents, zzso and zzso which are both zzso particles coated with zzso No deterioration of cell proliferation response to zzso stimulation was observed after labeling with either zzso contrast zzso zzso particles show zzso and zzso in culture media for zzso zzso particles not only produce no zzso zzso or zzso but also have a higher efficiency for labeling zzso than zzso The efficiency of cell labeling was determined by measuring the decrease in the zzso relaxation time of the water zzso in cell samples containing 1 zzso zzso labeled zzso of zzso zzso zzso After zzso of the labeling procedures, a zzso of the zzso relaxation time by a factor of approximately 7 to 10 has been zzso Under the present experimental conditions, the zzso of low density zzso zzso does not increase the labeling efficiency by zzso Our results suggest that zzso labeling of specific cell types can be achieved with good efficiency and the labeled cells can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging in rat zzso in zzso
