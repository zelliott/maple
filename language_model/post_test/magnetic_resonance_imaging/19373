The authors investigated whether absence of the zzso zzso in patients with schizophrenia constitutes a marker of early zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty male patients with schizophrenia and 30 healthy male subjects were recruited for zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed, and the presence or absence of the zzso zzso was determined for each zzso The length and volume of the third zzso were also zzso 

No differences in the presence or absence of the zzso zzso were found between patients with schizophrenia and normal comparison zzso Patients without the zzso zzso had significantly higher scores for negative symptoms than patients with the zzso zzso There was no correlation between absence of the zzso zzso and length and volume of the third zzso in either patients or comparison zzso 

The findings suggest that patients with schizophrenia who do not have the zzso zzso are characterized by more severe negative zzso
