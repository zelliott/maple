A 44-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a zzso stab wound to the left zzso zzso His initial zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso of his brain revealed a left zzso lobe zzso and zzso zzso resonance images of his brain revealed a linear zzso extending from his left zzso lobe into the left middle zzso zzso consistent with a penetrating zzso He was managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and made an excellent zzso Three weeks after injury, he had mild residual problems with recall and zzso 

Several leaning points exist in this zzso zzso as stab wounds to the brain frequently present as apparently innocuous facial or scalp zzso a high index of suspicion is needed to prevent these injuries presenting with serious late zzso zzso zzso reports of similar cases in the literature suggest that stab wounds to the zzso region are associated with a high morbidity and zzso This case demonstrates that a patient with an injury such as this can occasionally make a good functional zzso Finally, this case highlights the advantage of magnetic resonance imaging over computerized zzso in patients with these injuries once it has been established that there is no residual zzso metal zzso prior to magnetic resonance zzso In this case, the entire wound tract was only evident on magnetic resonance imaging and not on the initial computerized zzso zzso
