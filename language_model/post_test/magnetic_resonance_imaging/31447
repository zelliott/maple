The zzso of the zzso vocal tract depends on the zzso growth of the oral and zzso zzso The human zzso develops to form a unique zzso with the zzso losing contact with the zzso This zzso develops from the great descent of the zzso relative to the zzso which is accomplished through both the descent of the zzso skeleton relative to the zzso and the descent of the zzso relative to the zzso zzso show both processes of zzso zzso as in humans, but the evolutionary path before the divergence of the human and zzso lineages is zzso The development of zzso descent in six living Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined monthly during the first three years of life using magnetic resonance imaging, to delineate the present or absence of these two processes and their contributions to the development of the zzso zzso The zzso shows descent of the zzso relative to the zzso but lacks the descent of the zzso skeleton relative to the zzso and that of the zzso from the zzso We argue that the former descent is simply a zzso consequence of zzso growth and that the latter pair of zzso arose in a common zzso of extant zzso Thus, the evolutionary path of the great descent of the zzso is likely to be explained by a model zzso multiple and mosaic evolutionary zzso wherein these zzso phenomena may have contributed zzso to the faculty of speech in the human zzso
