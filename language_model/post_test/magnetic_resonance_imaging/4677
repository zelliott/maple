To determine whether magnetic zzso functional MR imaging of cerebral blood volumes provides information similar to zzso F 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso brain images in patients undergoing evaluation for zzso 

Ten subjects were studied with both PET and functional zzso Clinical diagnoses included probable zzso disease zzso zzso zzso possible zzso disease zzso zzso 1), Pick disease zzso zzso zzso and primary progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso The studies were zzso evaluated by zzso of PET and functional MR images followed by zzso analyses of corresponding regions of zzso zzso each brain was zzso into eight regions, and each was classified as normal or abnormal by visual zzso 

zzso zzso between registered functional MR and PET images were excellent zzso r zzso zzso in most of the zzso zzso correlations were observed in 72 of 74 brain zzso zzso 16 brain regions were judged to be abnormal by both MR imaging and zzso 46 regions were normal by zzso 10 regions were abnormal by PET only; and 8 regions were abnormal only by functional zzso The zzso between functional MR and PET was zzso which was highly zzso 

zzso blood volumes images derived from magnetic zzso zzso zzso provide information similar to zzso F 18 PET images in zzso patients undergoing evaluation for zzso
