We compared zzso transfer contrast zzso with zzso recalled echo zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and fast zzso zzso zzso of the degenerative cervical spine at zzso zzso Fifty patients with suspected degenerative disease of the cervical spine were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images of the cervical spine were obtained using zzso zzso sequence zzso time zzso time zzso angle zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence with peripheral gating zzso TE zzso zzso zzso zzso showed higher zzso ratio and superior disk contrast between normal and degenerative zzso while zzso images showed superior zzso ratio for the zzso fluid zzso versus zzso and superior zzso zzso In qualitative analysis, similar results were zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso zzso sequences are zzso techniques of imaging the cervical spine that have different characteristics and supplement each other in the diagnostic imaging of degenerative disease of the cervical zzso
