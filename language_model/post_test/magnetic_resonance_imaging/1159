To investigate the performance of high-resolution zzso zzso zzso field echo zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the identification of the high-risk component zzso zzso which is described in the literature as a troublesome component to zzso 

An zzso scan was performed preoperatively on 11 patients who underwent carotid zzso because of symptomatic carotid disease with a zzso larger than zzso A commonly used double inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso served as the zzso control for the zzso zzso pulse zzso The MR images were matched slice by slice with zzso and the zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso of the MR images were zzso Additionally, two readers, who were blinded for the zzso results, independently assessed the MR slices concerning the presence of zzso zzso 

More than zzso of the zzso proven zzso zzso could be detected using the zzso sequence with a high zzso agreement zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence proved to be superior to the zzso sequence concerning zzso and zzso but also in the qualitative detection of zzso zzso The false positive zzso results contained zzso tissue and were all located outside the main plaque zzso 

The present study shows that in zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso can identify the high-risk component zzso zzso with a high detection rate in patients with symptomatic carotid zzso zzso clinical trials are warranted to investigate whether this technique can identify patients at risk for an zzso zzso
