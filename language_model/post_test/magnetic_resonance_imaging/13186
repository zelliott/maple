zzso resonance imaging zzso is increasingly used to measure zzso inflammation and damage in patients with zzso arthritis zzso We evaluated the reliability of a new zzso zzso zzso scoring system, zzso in zzso zzso 

In 2 separate studies, zzso scans were obtained from patients with clinical evidence of zzso or zzso of the zzso For the first zzso study, images were obtained at one zzso For the second zzso study, images were obtained at 2 zzso 6 weeks zzso zzso were scored using zzso in an international zzso setting, for zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso bone zzso and bone zzso 

Global status scores from both zzso revealed moderate to high reliability for scoring most features, although reliability was poor for zzso inflammation in the zzso zzso Change scores that reflected inflammatory activity also exhibited moderate to good reliability in the zzso exercise, despite there being very little absolute change in zzso zzso or zzso observed in this zzso At the zzso zzso zzso reliability for change scores was acceptable only for zzso and zzso 

Further development and testing of the zzso is planned to improve its performance as a clinical and research tool to identify and measure pathology in peripheral joint zzso
