The present study investigated zzso zzso zzso in zzso major zzso patients by cardiac magnetic resonance zzso to determine whether is related to zzso iron overload zzso A total of 230 TM patients zzso referred to our laboratory were studied zzso Three zzso views zzso medium and zzso of the left zzso zzso were obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution was mapped on a zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso of the zzso zzso distribution, evaluated by the zzso of variation zzso was compared with that of a surrogate data set, to determine whether the zzso zzso distribution of zzso could be generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso offer an explanation for the zzso zzso observed in patients without iron zzso In subjects with global zzso below the lower limit of the normal, zzso zzso increased abruptly which could not be explained by zzso zzso Some zzso zzso values were below and others above the limit of normal threshold (20 zzso in 104 zzso TM zzso Among these patients, zzso showed a normal zzso global zzso In conclusion, a true zzso in the iron overload distribution may be present in TM zzso zzso seemingly appears in the borderline zzso iron and zzso at moderate to severe iron zzso
