No animal model currently exists for the examination of zzso zzso changes occurring in zzso vessels after zzso zzso zzso The zzso goal was to develop a zzso in zzso model of zzso zzso in zzso vessels in dogs that was capable of demonstrating zzso vascular changes after the zzso of coated and zzso zzso 

The authors implanted zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso arteries zzso of 11 zzso zzso In a 12th animal, one coated zzso was implanted in the BA and a second zzso one was implanted in the zzso spinal zzso All the devices were zzso to induce zzso zzso Surviving animals were observed for 12 weeks, after which they underwent repeated zzso before planned death and removal of the zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso analyses were conducted on zzso and zzso sections of the zzso to assess the percentage of zzso zzso zzso vessel injury, and zzso zzso vessels partially covered by zzso zzso zzso were studied for evidence of zzso or zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were blinded to the zzso zzso Seven zzso (three zzso and four zzso were removed from the six animals that were observed during the follow-up zzso The mean zzso proliferation was zzso zzso in the group treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the group treated with zzso devices zzso zzso zzso zzso thickness was significantly increased in the group with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean percentage of zzso was less zzso in the group with zzso zzso compared with zzso in the group with zzso devices zzso zzso zzso When comparing results between the zzso and zzso devices implanted in the five animals that received a single zzso only, greater differences zzso a benefit from zzso zzso were observed in zzso area zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso and percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso vessels covered by zzso zzso remained zzso 

This in zzso zzso zzso model was developed to assess zzso and inflammatory responses to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The results indicate that a lower percentage of zzso occurs 12 weeks after zzso of zzso compared with zzso zzso
