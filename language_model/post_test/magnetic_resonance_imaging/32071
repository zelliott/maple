We aimed to find structural brain abnormalities in juvenile zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The volumes of the zzso zzso and frontal lobe and the area of the corpus zzso subdivisions were all zzso measured, and then zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in 19 zzso patients and 19 zzso matched normal zzso 

The rostrum and zzso body of the corpus zzso and the left zzso were significantly smaller than those of the normal controls, whereas the volume of the zzso left frontal lobe was significantly larger than that of the zzso The area of the zzso body had a significant positive correlation with the age of seizure onset zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the volume of the right frontal lobe had a significant negative correlation with the duration of disease zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso On the zzso the gray matter concentration of the prefrontal lobe zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso left anterior middle frontal zzso and right anterior superior frontal zzso was decreased in the zzso group zzso p zzso zzso 

The zzso patients showed complex structural abnormalities in the corpus zzso frontal lobe and zzso and also a decreased gray matter concentration of the prefrontal region, which all suggests there is an abnormal neural network in the zzso zzso
