The human brain demonstrates complex yet systematic patterns of neural activity at zzso We examined whether functional connectivity among those brain regions typically active during rest depends on ongoing and recent task demands and individual zzso We zzso the zzso coordination among these regions during periods of language comprehension and during the rest periods that followed zzso Our findings show that the topography of this zzso zzso varies with zzso processing zzso The network zzso more highly interconnected regions during rest than during zzso but also when listening to zzso zzso surprising zzso Furthermore, connectivity patterns during rest varied as a function of recent listening zzso Individual zzso in connectivity strength was associated with cognitive zzso more attentive zzso demonstrated weaker connectivity during language zzso and a greater differentiation between connectivity during comprehension and zzso The regions we examined have generally been thought to form an zzso zzso and functional network whose activity reflects spontaneous cognitive zzso Our findings suggest that their function extends beyond the mediation of zzso thought, and that they play an important role in zzso cognitive zzso
