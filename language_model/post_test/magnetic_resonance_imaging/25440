zzso brain stem zzso zzso in children are thought to be a rare zzso This prospective study analyzed the frequency and significance of such zzso on early magnetic resonance imaging zzso after severe head injury, since CT fails to demonstrate these zzso 

In 30 consecutive children comatose after head injuries, zzso was performed within 8 days of the zzso 

The zzso of zzso was zzso When the zzso affected the zzso or zzso portions of zzso zzso zzso mortality was zzso The presence of zzso significantly correlated with the duration of coma and the categories of outcome, as indicated by the zzso zzso zzso The frequency and the distribution of zzso in children were similar to zzso 

zzso resonance imaging appears to be of high zzso value after severe pediatric head zzso
