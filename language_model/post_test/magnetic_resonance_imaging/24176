The various stages of multiple sclerosis zzso are characterized by zzso and zzso as well as by zzso zzso MR imaging is sensitive to tissue water motion, which might zzso to these zzso zzso Our purpose was to demonstrate differences in apparent diffusion zzso zzso and diffusion zzso zzso in acute and chronic zzso plaques and in zzso zzso 

Twelve zzso patients underwent conventional and zzso diffusion MR imaging with B zzso zzso zzso zzso of trace zzso and calculation of zzso zzso including zzso relative zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso was performed on a zzso zzso zzso of interest of plaques and normal structures were determined on zzso zzso zzso zzso were classified as zzso zzso or chronic on the basis of their appearance on conventional images and in relation to clinical zzso 

Seven patients had acute plaques with a concentric arrangement of alternating high and low signal intensity on zzso zzso In nine acute zzso plaque centers had high zzso with reduced zzso compared with zzso zzso white matter zzso and chronic zzso The thin rim of zzso zzso surrounding the center showed variable zzso and zzso values, which were not statistically different from zzso zzso and chronic zzso zzso had intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were superior to zzso or zzso zzso however, quality was limited by zzso zzso 

zzso and diffusion zzso zzso reflect zzso changes in the underlying pathology of the zzso zzso
