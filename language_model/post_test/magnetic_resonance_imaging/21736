zzso cases of cerebral zzso were studied using zzso T magnetic resonance imaging zzso In addition to showing the generalized decrease in volume of the cerebral hemisphere, three patterns of cerebral zzso were noted: pattern I, diffuse cortical and zzso zzso (six zzso II, diffuse cortical zzso associated with expanded zzso zzso (10 zzso pattern III, old zzso with necrosis in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (five zzso zzso I and pattern II were believed to have resulted from zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso In all 21 cases, zzso also showed zzso zzso zzso signals in the zzso limb of the internal capsule on the zzso images, and unilateral zzso of the cerebral zzso as far as the pyramid of the zzso zzso zzso changes such as thickness of the zzso zzso of the zzso side of the frontal and zzso zzso and reduced size of the middle zzso zzso were found in 13 zzso Thus, zzso is a useful method of examination in the diagnosis of cerebral zzso as it has the ability to highlight changes in the cerebral hemisphere, zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as highlighting zzso structural zzso
