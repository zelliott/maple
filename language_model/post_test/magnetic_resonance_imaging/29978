To compare the cardiovascular effects of zzso and zzso at minimum zzso concentration zzso zzso 1 in children with zzso heart disease using cardiac magnetic resonance zzso

10 pediatric patients with zzso heart diseases scheduled to undergo cardiac magnetic resonance zzso 

Patients were zzso to receive either zzso or zzso as the zzso inhalation zzso After a period or more than 20 minutes, they were crossed over to receive the zzso inhalation zzso 

Heart rate, mean zzso pressure zzso cardiac index, stroke volume index, and ejection fraction zzso at one MAC for both agents were all zzso 

Both zzso and zzso caused a significant decrease in zzso from the baseline zzso zzso zzso The mean values zzso of stroke volume zzso cardiac index zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso versus zzso were zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso were found to be comparable in terms of cardiovascular zzso
