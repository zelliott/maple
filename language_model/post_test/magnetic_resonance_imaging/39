zzso zzso relaxation imaging can be used to measure signal from water trapped between zzso zzso the ratio of zzso water signal to total water is termed the zzso water fraction zzso The goal of this study was to implement and develop the zzso zzso technique proposed by zzso and zzso For zzso scan parameters zzso zzso height and slew rate, zzso echo zzso zzso size, repetition time, and phase zzso were varied in zzso zzso and in fixed and in zzso zzso Changes in the standard zzso of the zzso of the zzso fit, zzso zzso and peak zzso of the zzso water were monitored to determine which scan parameters minimized zzso zzso we compared zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso for 10 healthy volunteers, and investigated the differences in zzso fit zzso zzso and zzso and peak zzso of the zzso water, at higher magnetic zzso zzso maps were found to be zzso similar between field zzso zzso were found to be significantly higher at zzso than at zzso but with a strongly significant correlation between zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso was nearly double at zzso but the standard zzso of zzso was increased in most zzso
