In this zzso study, zzso three-dimensional ultrasound images were reconstructed from zzso views obtained by scanning seven zzso fetal hearts with various zzso heart zzso Comparisons were made with zzso three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso zzso zzso images were obtained in all but one of the fetal zzso zzso as well as three-dimensional reconstructions were possible and allowed accurate assessment of complex cardiac zzso Overall, the zzso projections had better image quality and revealed more structural details than the zzso views, although both imaging modes showed the same cardiac anatomical zzso Our initial results demonstrate that simultaneous zzso display of zzso zzso views can be performed to provide three-dimensional images of the fetal heart, demonstrating structural cardiac zzso However, the clinical application of three-dimensional fetal zzso is at present limited by the time required for image data acquisition and the need for accurate zzso and zzso gating in the living zzso
