A large solitary zzso in the cervical zzso space without zzso connection and with minimal spinal zzso zzso and no zzso as a first manifestation of zzso zzso in a multiple myeloma patient, has not been reported zzso this case is thereby distinct from the seven prior reports in the world literature, of a solitary zzso of the cervical zzso 

A zzso male, recently diagnosed with multiple zzso presented with a zzso that prompted a screening zzso of the cervical zzso This disclosed a large mass in the upper cervical zzso area felt to pose a high zzso risk, leading to successful surgical removal of the zzso zzso This then led to further testing that showed previously zzso widespread zzso which was zzso up to that zzso 

In patients with a newly discovered zzso whether or not in the setting of known multiple zzso further evaluation should be done to detect the presence of zzso If the mass is discovered de zzso then an investigation should be carried out to determine if multiple zzso as well as zzso is zzso
