Two patients zzso zzso with chronic zzso zzso and sentence production deficits received zzso mapping treatment to improve sentence zzso The patients had dramatically different outcomes in that improved syntax production generalized to zzso tasks for zzso but not for zzso To learn how treatment influenced the neural zzso for syntax production, both patients underwent zzso and zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of sentence zzso zzso showed more robust activity zzso than zzso in zzso area; zzso zzso activity decreased slightly from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso images revealed little change, although activity was more diffuse zzso than zzso zzso suggest that for zzso rehabilitation led to engagement of an area zzso zzso used minimally during the zzso zzso whereas for zzso rehabilitation may have led to more efficient use of areas already involved in sentence generation during the zzso zzso zzso findings are discussed in the context of zzso outcome and zzso
