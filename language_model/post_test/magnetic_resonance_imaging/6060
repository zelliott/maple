The desire to monitor the zzso characteristics of zzso in the spinal zzso zzso in the context of pathological change in zzso diseases or proposed zzso zzso has led to an interest in zzso zzso zzso measurement zzso We present one zzso a magnetic zzso measure that zzso on the characteristics of zzso relaxation of water zzso within zzso In this study, zzso relaxation studies for measuring the zzso water fraction zzso were applied in healthy control SC in zzso using a zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso and findings were supported with supplemental studies in bovine SC samples in zzso Mean human zzso varied according the level of the SC zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reductions were observed in areas consistent with the expected locations of the cervical and zzso zzso Average bovine zzso was zzso zzso in white matter and zzso zzso in gray zzso The potential applications of zzso measurement in zzso both in characterizing disease processes like multiple sclerosis and in monitoring zzso therapies, should encourage future research in this zzso
