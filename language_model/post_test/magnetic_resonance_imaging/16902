Studies of semantic zzso and repetitive zzso have suggested that the bilateral anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso hub within the semantic zzso However, it is not clear whether all ATL zzso contribute in the same zzso We zzso zzso zzso to investigate the pattern of zzso in the left and right ATL when participants performed a semantic decision task on auditory words, environmental sounds, or zzso This showed that the ATL is not functionally homogeneous but is more zzso Both left and right zzso ATL zzso responded to all zzso in keeping with the notion that this region zzso zzso semantic zzso In addition, there were graded differences across the zzso zzso processing of both picture and environmental sound stimuli was associated with equivalent bilateral zzso zzso whereas auditory words generated greater zzso in left than right zzso This graded specialization for auditory stimuli would appear to reflect the input from the left superior ATL, which responded solely to semantic decisions on the basis of spoken words and environmental sounds, suggesting that this region is specialized to auditory zzso A final noteworthy result was that these regions were activated for domain level decisions to zzso presented zzso which appears to be incompatible with the hypotheses that the ATL is dedicated zzso to the representation of specific entities or zzso for zzso semantic zzso
