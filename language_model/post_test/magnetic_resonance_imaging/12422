Imaging zzso aims to discover how zzso in the human zzso influence brain measures derived from zzso zzso association scans zzso can screen the zzso for common differences in our DNA that relate to brain zzso In small samples, zzso has low power as individual gene effects are weak and one must also correct for multiple comparisons across the zzso and the zzso Here we extend recent work on genetic zzso of images, to analyze zzso models of anatomy using zzso We performed zzso harmonic analysis of zzso surfaces, automatically extracted from brain zzso scans of zzso zzso We clustered zzso surface regions with common genetic influences by examining genetic correlations zzso between the zzso deformation values at all pairs of surface zzso Using genetic correlations to cluster surface measures, we were able to boost effect sizes for genetic associations, compared to zzso with traditional zzso correlations using zzso zzso
