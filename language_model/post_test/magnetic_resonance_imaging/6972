The brain, despite the zzso barrier, does not escape to the highly variable host rejection response zzso by a very strong and complex immune reaction when rat zzso cells are transplanted into the adult zzso 

zzso were performed among parents that are able or enable to reject a well-known brain tumor cell line zzso zzso animals were also challenged with rat zzso cells both in the brain and the side zzso 

The percentage of zzso or resistance to develop a lethal zzso can be estimated knowing the parental zzso When both parents had rejected an induced zzso zzso of the progeny will also reject zzso Similarly, if both parents died as a consequence of the zzso zzso of the progeny would also be unable to reject the challenge of zzso zzso zzso zzso animals do not have a mature immune system and they tolerate transplanted cells much better than zzso We found no rejection to zzso zzso at both brain and side flank sites, in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were beginning to be eliminated if the cells are zzso at day 3 from birth on the zzso and at 1 week from birth on the zzso 

There is a genetic component zzso zzso or resistance to the lethal effect of tumor development and progression depending on the parental zzso of the adult zzso Neonatal rats represent a much more reliable model than adults to study experimental therapies against zzso
