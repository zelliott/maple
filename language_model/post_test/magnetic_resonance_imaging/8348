zzso of this study was to directly detect increased zzso of vascular zzso by magnetic resonance zzso 

A novel contrast medium with a mean zzso diameter of 100 zzso was prepared from zzso iron zzso incorporated into zzso of block zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mapping was applied to differentiate the minimal zzso of zzso relaxation time in zzso rat carotid zzso 

The novel contrast medium accumulated in zzso zzso zzso relaxation times of injured and zzso arteries were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively (the mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel contrast zzso but not commercially available contrast media, shortened the zzso relaxation time of the injured artery to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A novel iron contrast medium enhanced the zzso with increased zzso The contrast medium in combination with zzso mapping may be useful to detect unstable zzso zzso
