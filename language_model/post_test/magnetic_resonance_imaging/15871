Most adult patients with zzso zzso or zzso zzso are treated with an external zzso and zzso therapy for several weeks to zzso If surgical intervention is required, a combined anterior and zzso approach for zzso and fusion with zzso bone graft or titanium mesh cage is usually zzso 

We here report on our experience with the use of a minimally invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in adult patients with zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Eight patients with zzso one with zzso and three with zzso zzso zzso with a mean back pain of zzso on the visual analog scale zzso and without corresponding neurological deficits were zzso Immediately after the operation, we calculated a significant reduction of the back pain on the zzso to zzso of zzso counts and zzso protein zzso After a mean of 61 days of continuous zzso therapy during full zzso all patients were pain free, and zzso counts as well as zzso protein levels were zzso 

We conclude that minimally invasive zzso fixation is a feasible and effective technique to achieve immediate pain release, avoid long-term zzso and overcome the disadvantages of a zzso zzso However, surgical complications and possible follow-up procedures supplement the patients' risks of adverse reactions of the zzso
