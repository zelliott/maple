It is hypothesized that zzso central zzso zzso is related to functional zzso yet, there is no literature comparing the normal and pathological zzso and central zzso angles using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso the aim of this study was to zzso the anterior and zzso muscle zzso angles, central zzso angle, and zzso of the zzso using zzso 

zzso zzso angle zzso zzso zzso angle zzso and central zzso angle zzso were measured from 2 groups: no tear zzso zzso zzso zzso full thickness tears zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

No tear zzso average zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All differences were statistically significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso averages were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The size of a zzso tear is directly correlated with muscle zzso and zzso zzso and provides a direct measurement from zzso that can now be employed in further studies of functional deficit and zzso tear zzso
