To evaluate zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso iron oxide zzso particles by zzso 40 normal rats (20 Dark zzso zzso rats and 20 Brown Norway zzso zzso and 16 transplanted rats (12 zzso and four zzso were studied on day 4 zzso with different zzso doses zzso zzso zzso zzso All animals underwent 128 consecutive snapshot fast zzso shot zzso zzso dynamic studies in 43 zzso In the normal rats, a larger maximum signal decrease zzso in the zzso and the outer zzso is observed with an increasing dose of zzso particles zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were observed between the right and left zzso at all doses zzso Higher zzso time of occurrence of zzso zzso and zzso slope appear with higher doses of zzso zzso The dynamic zzso for zzso rats show similar shapes when compared to those for zzso zzso In the transplanted rats, zzso zzso show lower zzso longer zzso and lower zzso slope compared to those in the normal zzso zzso zzso show zzso patterns similar to those of normal zzso in the zzso and the outer zzso zzso indicates acute vascular rejection in all zzso and normal kidney architecture in all zzso The results clearly show good agreement between the zzso graft zzso zzso and zzso changes associated with zzso This work also introduces a new signal analysis methodology for the automatic detection of transplanted organ zzso This method compares the dynamics of the zzso signal zzso for native and transplanted zzso A quantitative measurement to detect significant differences between these signals was developed, and showed that this technique exhibits good performance in identifying zzso zzso
