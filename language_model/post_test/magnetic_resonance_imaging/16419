zzso zzso zzso is a devastating zzso disease for which novel therapies are being zzso We hypothesized that MR imaging of brain zzso involvement in zzso could be zzso along a zzso 

Thirty-four brain MR images in 28 patients with proved zzso and genetic defects for zzso were zzso 10 patients with late zzso 16 patients with zzso and 2 patients with adult zzso All MR images were reviewed by experienced zzso and zzso (2 readers in Germany, 2 readers in the United States) for global disease burden, as seen on the zzso and zzso inversion recovery zzso A visual scoring method was based on a point system zzso zzso derived from the location of white matter involvement and the presence of global zzso analogous to the scoring system developed for zzso The readers were blinded to the zzso zzso 

zzso of 34 MR images showed zzso zzso zzso of white zzso The zzso reliability zzso was zzso Scores between readers were within 2 points of each zzso zzso MR imaging studies in 6 patients showed significant progressive disease in 3 patients zzso score average, 4; mean zzso zzso and no change or 1 point progression in 3 patients zzso score average, 12; mean zzso zzso zzso fibers and the zzso tended to be involved only in advanced stages of zzso 

The zzso MR severity scoring method can be used to provide a measure of brain MR imaging involvement in zzso zzso
