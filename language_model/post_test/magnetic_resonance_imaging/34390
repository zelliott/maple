To study zzso zzso zzso density and functional deficits in zzso lobe zzso 

A 39-year-old man who had simple partial visual zzso after zzso zzso zzso of a zzso was studied by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at rest and during visual zzso task zzso zzso 

zzso recordings were zzso and zzso did not reveal any zzso anomaly in the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a small zzso region in the right visual association zzso and zzso showed zzso in a corresponding location and zzso zzso zzso of zzso metabolism by a continuous visual recognition task improved significantly the contrast between the dysfunctional zone and its zzso 

As zzso deficits are restricted to a small region, widespread zzso in networks involved in visual information processing indicates an extensive functional zzso by the zzso zzso
