In the last decade, research on error and conflict processing has become one of the most influential research areas in the domain of cognitive zzso There is now zzso evidence that a specific part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zone zzso is zzso involved in the processing of errors and zzso However, zzso research has focused primarily on a specific error type, zzso response zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate whether errors on the task level rely on the same neural and functional zzso Here we report a zzso of both error types in the zzso whereas response errors activate the zzso task errors activate the zzso zzso zzso Although this last region shows an overlap in zzso for task and response errors on the group level, a closer inspection of the zzso data is more in accordance with a functional anatomical zzso When investigating brain areas related to conflict on the task and response levels, a clear zzso was perceived between areas associated with response conflict and with task zzso Overall, our data support a zzso between response and task levels of processing in the zzso In addition, we provide additional evidence for a zzso between conflict and errors both at the response level and at the task zzso
