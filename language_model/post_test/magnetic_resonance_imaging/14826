The zzso distance zzso between cavernous carotid arteries zzso is an important factor for avoiding injury of the internal carotid artery during zzso zzso The zzso between zzso in zzso zzso patients is generally larger than in normal zzso However, the movement of the zzso during zzso surgery is not zzso The aim of this study is to measure the zzso between zzso in zzso zzso patients before and after zzso We reviewed 138 zzso zzso patients who were treated with zzso via the zzso zzso The zzso diameter and the zzso between zzso were measured from zzso and zzso MR zzso The zzso diameter was similar at the zzso and zzso time zzso On the other hand, the zzso between zzso was shorter at zzso time point zzso zzso zzso zzso than at the zzso time point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Above all, invasion type zzso had more significant zzso change at the zzso time point zzso zzso zzso zzso than at the zzso time point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Also in zzso analysis, cavernous zzso invasion of zzso was independently associated with zzso contraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is important to know the change in zzso between zzso after zzso surgery, particularly for zzso zzso with cavernous zzso zzso The position of the zzso should be known before and during zzso surgery, as well before and during the second operation to avoid vascular zzso
