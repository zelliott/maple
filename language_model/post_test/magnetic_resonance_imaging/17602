zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Imaging zzso are powerful tools to obtain detailed information on the pore space structure that one is unlikely to obtain in other zzso These techniques are particularly suitable for Cultural Heritage materials, because they use water zzso zzso as a zzso zzso with water is one of the main causes of deterioration of zzso zzso structure in wood, for example, zzso the penetration of water, which can carry polluting substances and promote zzso zzso A particular case is zzso wood from underwater discoveries and moist zzso in fact, these finds are very fragile because of chemical, physical and biological zzso from the long contact with the zzso When wood zzso are brought to the surface and directly dried in air, there is the collapse of the cellular structures, and wood loses its original form and dimensions and cannot be used for study and museum zzso In this work we have undertaken the study of some wood finds coming from zzso zzso by zzso and zzso under different conditions, and we have obtained a characterization of pore space in wood and images of the spatial distribution of the confined water in the zzso
