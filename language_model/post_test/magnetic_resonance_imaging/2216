zzso zzso function or inappropriate zzso are considered risk factors for outcome following the zzso zzso These parameters are difficult to assess in zzso hearts that do not conform to the uniform shapes prescribed by conventional zzso imaging volume zzso zzso zzso requires no geometric assumptions and has been validated in both normal and distorted left zzso To assess the feasibility and accuracy of this technique in patients with zzso hearts, we compared zzso and zzso zzso estimates of zzso volume, ejection zzso and mass in patients with functionally single left zzso with results obtained by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Twelve patients with functionally single left zzso (6 months to 22 zzso underwent examination by all 3 zzso zzso and agreement with zzso were calculated for volumes, ejection zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparison with zzso yielded a bias of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso volumes, zzso zzso analysis for mass showed a bias of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed less agreement for both volumes and mass zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso g for volume and mass, respectively, p zzso zzso fraction by zzso zzso showed significantly closer agreement with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso provides estimates of zzso volumes, ejection zzso and mass that are comparable to zzso in this select group of patients with single zzso of left zzso zzso
