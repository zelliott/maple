zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare cortical organization of the first zzso zzso and second zzso zzso zzso Six fluent Russian-English zzso who acquired their second language zzso were tested with words and zzso presented either zzso or zzso zzso showed that both languages activated similar cortical networks, including the inferior zzso middle zzso superior zzso middle zzso zzso and zzso zzso Within the inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso activated a larger cortical volume than zzso during zzso and zzso zzso For both languages, the left zzso was more active than the right zzso during zzso zzso Within the left zzso the distance between centers of zzso associated with zzso processing of translation zzso across languages was larger than the distance between centers of zzso associated with zzso processing of different words in the same zzso zzso of zzso processing analyses revealed different centers of zzso associated with the first versus the second language in the zzso but not in the superior zzso zzso zzso These findings are discussed within the context of the current literature on cortical organization in zzso and suggest variation in zzso cortical zzso associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso
