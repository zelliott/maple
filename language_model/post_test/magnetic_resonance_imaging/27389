Though routine zzso is usually normal in essential zzso zzso there is clinical evidence of widespread involvement of central nervous zzso This study aimed at determining zzso changes in brain of patients with zzso using zzso zzso zzso analysis and also compare the zzso of zzso 

Clinical and imaging data of 20 patients (5 women, 15 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were collected zzso To determine areas of gray matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data of patients were compared with 17 matched control subjects using zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Compared to controls, patients showed scattered areas of cerebral and zzso zzso zzso analysis of patients with and without head zzso showed widespread areas of zzso zzso in cerebral zzso of patients with head zzso No difference was observed between the familial and zzso zzso of zzso Multiple zzso analysis revealed relationship between zzso zzso and zzso severity zzso 

Patients with zzso showed widespread areas of zzso in both zzso and cerebral zzso which supports the current concept of the progressive and diffuse nature of zzso Patients with additional head zzso may represent a distinct zzso of zzso
