zzso zzso training has been shown to improve both cognitive and social cognitive deficits in people with zzso but the mechanisms that support this behavioral improvement are largely zzso One hypothesis is that intensive behavioral training in zzso and/or social zzso restores the underlying neural mechanisms that support targeted zzso However, there is little research on the neural effects of cognitive zzso zzso This study investigated whether a 50 h zzso zzso intervention which included both cognitive and social cognitive training would influence neural function in regions that support social zzso Twenty-two stable, zzso schizophrenia participants were zzso to a treatment condition consisting of zzso cognitive training zzso zzso Fitness zzso module zzso zzso plus social zzso training zzso which was focused on emotion recognition zzso zzso per zzso or a zzso condition of zzso computer games zzso for an equal amount of zzso Pre and post intervention assessments included an zzso task of positive and negative facial emotion recognition, and standard behavioral assessments of zzso emotion processing, and functional zzso There were no significant zzso improvements in general zzso or functional zzso zzso results showed the predicted zzso zzso Specifically, in comparison to zzso zzso participants had a greater zzso intervention increase in zzso zzso activity during emotion recognition of both positive and negative zzso Furthermore, among all participants, the increase in zzso zzso activity predicted behavioral improvement on a standardized test of emotion processing zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that combined zzso and social zzso training impacts neural mechanisms that support social zzso zzso
