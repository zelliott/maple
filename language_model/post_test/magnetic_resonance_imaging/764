zzso white matter disease zzso is associated with abnormalities on tests that involve complex cognitive zzso along with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events which are associated with significant morbidity in older zzso This study investigates whether the neurological examination can predict the presence of zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso No prior studies have assessed whether the neurological examination can predict the presence of zzso on zzso 

A focused neurological examination was performed on a random selection of patients referred for a zzso of the zzso Staff zzso who were blinded to the results of the physical examination independently read the zzso zzso The zzso interpretations were divided into four categories based on the degree of zzso none, mild, moderate, zzso 

zzso subjects had some degree of zzso while 25 subjects had zzso The total number of zzso signs correlated significantly with the severity of zzso even when adjusting for the effect of age zzso zzso zzso percent of subjects with zzso had three or more abnormal signs, while zzso of subjects without zzso had fewer than zzso zzso with the three step motor sequencing and horizontal visual tracking tests were zzso zzso of zzso One or both of these tests were abnormal in zzso of subjects with zzso while zzso of subjects without zzso had no problems with either zzso
