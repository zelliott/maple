zzso of cortical zzso can be zzso achieved by the application of zzso random noise stimulation zzso zzso is a novel method of zzso electrical brain stimulation zzso a random electrical zzso spectrum is applied over the zzso A previous study recently reported that application of weak zzso zzso over primary motor zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso both during and after stimulation in the healthy human zzso Here, blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso was used to monitor zzso in human zzso activity after the application of zzso zzso zzso maps for a right hand zzso finger opposition task were obtained for nine subjects after sham and zzso zzso in separate zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a decrease in the mean number of activated zzso by zzso in the hand zzso Our results indicate that zzso applied with different zzso and/or in combination with a task might result in different zzso Application of zzso to the human zzso allows an zzso and thus painless, selective, zzso and zzso activity change within the cortex, its main advantage being the direction zzso of the zzso zzso also provides a zzso new way of producing and interfering with brain zzso although, further research is required to zzso stimulation parameters and zzso
