zzso sleep zzso zzso is associated with cognitive zzso in working memory zzso zzso zzso during zzso tasks can be indirectly assessed by blood oxygen zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The purpose of this study was to describe zzso responses during 2 separate working memory tasks and a finger tapping task in men with zzso A secondary aim was to explore the possible relation between zzso severity zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso 

Nine zzso men zzso age zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso underwent zzso zzso testing on a zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso subjects performed a zzso zzso zzso zzso task zzso an auditory zzso task zzso task, and an alternating finger zzso 

zzso and zzso tasks produced similar patterns of increased bilateral zzso in zzso zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso signal zzso were observed within zzso cingulate, zzso and inferior frontal regions during zzso and zzso but not during zzso With increased disease severity, zzso zzso patterns were increased in the right zzso zzso but decreased in the zzso zzso 

These preliminary findings suggest that the severity of zzso may correlate with neural zzso during tasks of working memory, potentially reflecting zzso neural responses in severe zzso
