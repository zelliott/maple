We describe a technique for functional MR imaging zzso with high spatial and zzso resolution using a long zzso zzso zzso contrast agent, zzso 

All zzso zzso used a rat model of sensory zzso zzso with zzso electrical stimulation under zzso zzso Standard blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso measurement was initially zzso zzso was then zzso administered and a zzso zzso measurement was performed by using a zzso zzso zzso 

We found that a dose of zzso zzso zzso produced adequate signal intensity changes in rat sensory zzso to demonstrate zzso Using a zzso stimulation pattern with a standard correlation analysis, the locations of the most significantly activated zzso zzso highest Z zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not significantly zzso 

zzso zzso has the advantage of using a zzso zzso rather than the highly zzso sequences used in other common zzso zzso This could reduce the zzso artifacts associated with zzso
