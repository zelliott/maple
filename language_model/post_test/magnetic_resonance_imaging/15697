To investigate the efficacy of a new zzso model for zzso to evaluate drug distribution and to zzso zzso design for zzso infusion therapy 

The model consisted of a zzso artery zzso tube through which blood zzso water flowed continuously and a water zzso zzso were inserted into the tube and a zzso contrast medium was injected at rates suitable for zzso or zzso zzso evaluation and commensurate with the clinical drug infusion zzso zzso images of the tube were obtained with a zzso scanner and zzso echo zzso zzso studies and zzso tests were zzso The points at which drug and water were completely mixed were defined as the site with uniform enhancement nearest the zzso zzso 

Flip angle and zzso zzso were zzso at 90 degrees, and at zzso and 500 zzso for the high and low infusion rates, zzso Drug distribution near the zzso tips was clearly zzso The drug was mixed in shorter distances via the slit zzso than the zzso or zzso zzso and the smaller zzso than the larger at either zzso 

This model appeared to be effective for evaluation of drug distribution and zzso of zzso zzso
