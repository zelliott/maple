The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of and the appropriate technique for performance of MR zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso MR zzso zzso joint zzso were performed using an open zzso scanner with a vertically oriented magnetic field, adapted for zzso zzso Two different approaches to the shoulder were zzso a modification of the traditional anterior approach zzso zzso and an zzso approach zzso zzso mimicking the anterior zzso zzso The average procedure duration was zzso A retrospective review of needle zzso and zzso position was determined for the zzso zzso 

Average procedure duration was 21 zzso for the anterior approach and 12 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso needle zzso was minimal with the anterior approach, contributing to prolonged imaging zzso zzso zzso was much improved with the zzso zzso Nine of the 31 zzso procedures involved zzso injection of the zzso or zzso zzso At the time of retrospective review, the needle was too zzso or too zzso positioned in six of these nine zzso 

With consideration of the technical demands of MR imaging guidance for zzso procedures, MR zzso zzso of the shoulder is zzso The traditional zzso approach to the shoulder must be modified to provide adequate zzso of the zzso The zzso approach meets this zzso
