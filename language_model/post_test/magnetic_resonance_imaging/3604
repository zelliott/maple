To correlate clinical features with zzso findings in advanced zzso zzso and to determine the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in detecting tumor zzso 

zzso zzso case zzso 

We included 75 patients with group E zzso 

zzso and clinical features were recorded at zzso zzso zzso was performed to study tumor characteristics and extent of zzso zzso zzso was performed and zzso features zzso zzso analysis was done using the zzso test to determine correlation between clinical features and zzso zzso zzso and accuracy of zzso in detecting tumor invasion were zzso 

zzso associations between clinical findings at presentation and high-risk zzso and correlation between zzso results and zzso evidence of tumor zzso 

A significant association was found between iris zzso and zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure and zzso nerve invasion zzso zzso zzso and shallow anterior chamber and iris invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter did not show any significant correlation with high-risk zzso On zzso tumor volume showed a significant association with zzso nerve invasion zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of zzso in detecting zzso invasion was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso invasion was correctly identified in 9 out of 15 eyes zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso whereas the accuracy of zzso in detecting zzso invasion was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body invasion was correctly identified in 5 out of 7 eyes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso invasion in 5 out of 6 eyes zzso zzso zzso zzso 

As far as we are aware, this is the first prospective study on the correlation of clinical features and zzso findings with zzso risk factors in eyes primarily zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso pressure, shallow anterior chamber, and tumor volume correlated well with high-risk zzso Because zzso has limitations in reliably predicting microscopic zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso decision in favor of zzso chemotherapy on the basis of suspected zzso invasion on zzso is not justified in the absence of zzso evidence of zzso
