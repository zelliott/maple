zzso nerve injury leads to changes in zzso activity in the zzso and zzso primary zzso zzso zzso which may lead to enduring sensory dysfunction and zzso zzso in the barrel and visual zzso has been shown to occur in a zzso zzso However, little is known about the layer specific changes associated with limb zzso 

To determine the zzso changes in zzso activity associated with short-term plasticity induced by peripheral nerve injury in the zzso 

In zzso zzso recordings zzso activity and local field zzso and high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques were applied to characterize zzso and zzso responses across the depth of zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso 

Within 60 minutes following injury, zzso increases in zzso and zzso responses in the deprived S1, zzso to the zzso zzso were observed in response to stimulation of the zzso zzso The most prominent increases in zzso activity in the deprived zzso occurred in layer zzso 

zzso V zzso provide the major output of zzso and they send and receive zzso zzso Thus, the immediate changes in zzso firing patterns in layer V induced by the injury, can adversely affect the activity of zzso regions and also interfere with normal cortical processing and zzso zzso zzso a rehabilitation strategy that targets layer V zzso activity and starts immediately after the injury may benefit the functional zzso
