The recall of an object from features is a specific operation in semantic memory in which the zzso and zzso motor area zzso are zzso zzso Other zzso semantic zzso are also likely to be zzso We used the zzso zzso with more sensitive scanning techniques and larger sample size, to replicate and extend our previous zzso zzso right-handed healthy participants performed an zzso task and an association semantic task, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance zzso During zzso subjects determined whether words pairs describing object features combined to recall an object; during the association task they decided if two words were zzso Of brain areas specifically involved in object recall, in addition to the zzso and zzso other regions included the left zzso prefrontal cortex, inferior zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso and bilateral zzso anterior zzso and inferior frontal zzso These regions are involved in semantic processing, verbal working memory and zzso detection and zzso The zzso likely helps to coordinate activity of these different brain zzso zzso the circuit that normally mediates this process is relevant for zzso where many regions in this circuit are functionally abnormal and semantic memory is zzso
