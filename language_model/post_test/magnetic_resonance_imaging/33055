Previous anatomical zzso studies have shown that healthy aging is associated with gray matter tissue loss in specific cerebral zzso However, these studies may have potentially missed critical elements of age-related brain changes, which largely exist within zzso among brain zzso This magnetic resonance imaging research aims to assess the effects of aging on the organization of gray matter structural zzso zzso Here, we used zzso zzso on high-definition brain scans to compare the patterns of gray matter structural zzso networks that sustain different zzso and zzso cognitive functions among young zzso mean zzso years, zzso and older zzso mean zzso years, zzso zzso This approach relies on the assumption that functionally correlated brain regions show correlations in gray matter volume as a result of mutually zzso influences or common zzso zzso We found reduced structural association in older adults compared with younger adults, specifically in zzso cognitive zzso Major differences were observed in the structural zzso networks that zzso the zzso a) the zzso semantic network, b) the executive control network, and c) the zzso zzso Moreover, these cognitive functions are typically altered in the older zzso Our results indicate that healthy aging alters the structural organization of cognitive networks, shifting from a more distributed (in young zzso to a more localized zzso organization in older zzso
