This report illustrates a new strategy of designing a zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso for zzso delivery and zzso zzso zzso embedded iron oxide zzso zzso are zzso into zzso in the water phase with the help of zzso acid modified low molecular weight zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso possess good stability, zzso with narrow size distribution and competitive zzso zzso MR imaging zzso The zzso system is capable of binding and delivering zzso for zzso of a gene of interest while maintaining its magnetic properties and zzso This new zzso embedded iron oxide zzso provides an important platform for safe and efficient gene delivery with zzso zzso zzso zzso monitoring zzso
