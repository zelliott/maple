zzso zzso assessed using paper-and-pencil tests, occurs with multiple zzso including heart zzso however, relationships between test performance and brain injury are zzso 

To determine the extent of brain injury assessed by magnetic resonance zzso zzso procedures in a mixed sample with cognitive impairment as measured by the zzso State zzso zzso Test parts A zzso and B zzso and the Watson zzso Test zzso 

A comparative design was used with a convenience sample of 66 participants (age zzso zzso zzso years, 41 zzso 52 zzso zzso and abnormal performances on cognitive tests were compared using zzso relaxation values across the brain zzso zzso zzso zzso of the participants were healthy, and 12 had heart failure (New York Heart Association classes zzso left zzso ejection fraction zzso 

All participants scored normally on the zzso State zzso thus, this test was excluded from further zzso zzso cognitive scores were found in zzso of the participants, with significant brain injury appearing in participants with abnormal test zzso Injured structures included zzso zzso zzso insular, and zzso zzso corpus zzso and zzso The zzso results showed the greatest extent of structural zzso The zzso test demonstrated relationships to specific injury sites, whereas the zzso showed relationships only to isolated areas of zzso 

The findings suggest that paper-and-pencil cognitive tests relate to injury in brain structures, with zzso values relating to the greatest extent of zzso zzso damage sites may correlate with unique tests, such as zzso Specialized tests should be developed that would indicate neural injury in specific zzso
