Since the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging in Mexico, the development of this important medical imaging technology has been almost zzso in our zzso The very first surface zzso prototypes for clinical applications in magnetic resonance imaging has been developed at the Center of Research in Medical Imaging and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso University, Campus zzso Two surface zzso prototypes were zzso a) a zzso zzso and b) a square-shaped zzso for multiple regions of the body, such as heart, brain, knee, hands, and zzso These coils were tested on the zzso zzso of the ABC zzso located in Mexico zzso Brain images of healthy volunteers were obtained in different zzso zzso zzso and zzso Since images showed a zzso clinical quality for diagnosis, it is fair to say that these zzso prototypes can be used in the clinical environment, and with small zzso they can be made compatible with almost any commercial zzso This type of development can offer new alternatives for further collaboration between the research centers and the zzso community, in the search of new applications and developments of this imaging zzso
