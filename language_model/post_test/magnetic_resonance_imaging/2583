We present a new zzso for the robust and accurate tracking of the zzso in cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso zzso First, a rough estimate of the location and diameter of the zzso is obtained by applying a zzso zzso function using the available a zzso zzso Then, this estimate is refined using an zzso zzso model which we define in a zzso zzso zzso In this context, we propose a global zzso technique based on zzso relaxation, zzso zzso zzso which is shown to be superior to other zzso techniques, for minimizing the energy of the zzso zzso We have evaluated the performance and zzso of the zzso on clinical compliance studies in cardiovascular MR zzso The zzso and tracking has been successfully tested in zzso MR images of the zzso The results show the ability of the zzso to produce not only accurate, but also very reliable results in clinical routine zzso
