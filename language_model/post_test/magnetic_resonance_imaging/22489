To compare zzso zzso carotid imaging at zzso and zzso and assess zzso between zzso zzso of carotid arteries at zzso and zzso 

Five healthy subjects and two zzso patients were scanned in zzso and zzso scanners with a similar protocol providing zzso zzso zzso and zzso density zzso zzso images using a fast zzso sequence with zzso zzso or zzso zzso double inversion recovery zzso zzso Wall and zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso were compared in 44 artery zzso by paired zzso zzso zzso of the zzso area zzso wall area zzso and mean wall thickness zzso was assessed using zzso zzso 

Wall zzso and zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso at zzso with a zzso gain for zzso images and a zzso gain for zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ for zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso but was larger at zzso for zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso The zzso WA, and zzso demonstrated good agreement with no significant bias zzso zzso a zzso of variation zzso of zzso zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

This study demonstrated significant improvement in zzso zzso and image quality for zzso resolution zzso imaging of carotid arteries at zzso zzso zzso are compatible between zzso and zzso
