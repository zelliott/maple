A series of organic zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso represent molecular zzso for imaging zzso These organic zzso have been labeled with zzso zzso for imaging tumors by zzso zzso zzso zzso Among these organic zzso zzso zzso was selected for extensive evaluation using magnetic resonance imaging zzso based on its higher tumor zzso and better zzso zzso zzso This report presents the development of a new zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso contrast zzso The contrast agent was zzso and characterized in zzso and in zzso In zzso cell viability showed low zzso at low zzso zzso Cell zzso experiment shows that the zzso has high affinity for tumor zzso The in zzso zzso zzso measured at zzso T is about 50% higher than those of contrast agents in clinical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso imaging studies in zzso mice at zzso T demonstrated significant signal enhancement at the site of the zzso zzso is a promising zzso zzso contrast agent for diagnostic zzso
