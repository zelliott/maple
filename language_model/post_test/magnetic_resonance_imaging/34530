To investigate the zzso consequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso we used zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso in the zzso region in 12 zzso infants with predominantly small zzso Both sides of the brain were investigated zzso zzso zzso were calculated as the zzso zzso recorded with zzso zzso zzso s and TE zzso 272 zzso divided by the fully relaxed water signal corrected for zzso relaxation time constant zzso zzso At the first investigation, when the infants were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age, the zzso was unilateral or markedly zzso in size in 10 of 12 zzso The zzso index was higher zzso zzso zzso and the zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lower in the side with the larger zzso At the second investigation, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age, no sign of a previous zzso could be seen on magnetic resonance imaging in three of 10 zzso zzso could be detected in two of 10 infants only, and the zzso and zzso zzso did not differ between zzso However, the zzso index was significantly higher in the side with the larger zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is initially followed by zzso zzso and possibly a delay in maturation as indicated by the zzso low zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, an increased zzso index at the corrected age of 3 zzso indicates a more persistent zzso change after small zzso
