To investigate the associations between dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso parameters and the zzso score zzso for prostate cancer zzso with zzso information provided by concurrent apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso 

zzso male patients received MR scans, including diffusion zzso imaging zzso and zzso zzso on a zzso T MR zzso All patients were confirmed to have zzso in the following biopsy within 2 zzso zzso maps calculated from zzso were used to zzso zzso and zzso regions on zzso zzso for zzso analysis zzso zzso parameters zzso enhancement, initial zzso and zzso zzso zzso and quantitative parameters zzso , zzso , and zzso zzso were calculated and correlated with the zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the zzso parameters in assessing the aggressiveness of zzso 

A total of 41 zzso zzso were included in the zzso Among all quantitative and zzso zzso only zzso showed significant correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso By defining tumor aggressiveness as a zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a good diagnostic performance, with the area under the zzso curve being zzso Under a zzso point of zzso zzso zzso zzso , the sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso shows a significant association with zzso and good diagnostic performance in assessing tumor zzso zzso zzso is a potential marker of zzso
