zzso of tumor zzso and zzso have been correlated with zzso grade and zzso Dynamic zzso zzso zzso can zzso map tumor blood flow, zzso and zzso In this prospective zzso cohort pilot study, zzso imaging was correlated with molecular markers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and overall patient zzso 

zzso modeling methods were used to generate maps of tumor blood flow, extraction zzso zzso area product, transfer constant, zzso rate, zzso volume, blood volume, zzso transit time, and zzso zzso from zzso zzso data in human zzso zzso zzso was obtained from areas of zzso zzso active zzso hypoxic zzso and zzso core and evaluated for zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso values were correlated with zzso protein expression at tissue sample zzso 

Patient survival correlated with zzso parameters in 2 zzso zzso zzso in active tumor and zzso volume in areas of zzso zzso zzso significant correlations were observed between several zzso parameters and tissue zzso In addition, zzso index was zzso of overall survival zzso zzso zzso and correlated with vascular zzso growth factor expression in hypoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso density correlated with worse patient outcome zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso may facilitate zzso zzso predictions of areas of tumor with increased zzso and zzso Both imaging and zzso zzso are zzso of patient zzso This has the potential to allow unprecedented zzso decisions and to guide therapies to specific tumor zzso
