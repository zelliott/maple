zzso of zzso zzso during the observation and zzso of human actions is now increasingly accepted, but it remains unclear how the zzso is able to resolve potential conflicts between the observation of another person's action and the ongoing control of one's own zzso Recent data suggest that this overlap leads to a systematic bias, where lifting a box influences zzso zzso judgments of the weight of a box lifted by another zzso We now investigate the neural basis of this bias effect using zzso zzso participants performed a zzso weight judgment task or two control conditions while lifting a light box, a heavy box or no box during zzso Brain regions related to zzso bias were localized by zzso individual differences in bias with zzso zzso Five regions were found to show correlations with zzso zzso left inferior frontal zzso left central zzso left zzso body area, left zzso zzso and right zzso zzso The cluster in primary motor zzso was also activated by box zzso and the cluster in zzso body area by the observation of hand actions and the weight judgment zzso We suggest that these brain areas are part of a network where motor processing zzso zzso judgment of observed human actions, and thus visual and motor processes cannot be thought of as two distinct systems, but instead interact at many zzso
