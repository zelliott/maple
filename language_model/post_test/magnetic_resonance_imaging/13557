We used zzso zzso zzso to map the neural zzso of human short-term memory for orientation, defined as retaining a single orientation in memory over a long zzso by comparing a successive discrimination task with a zzso delay to the same task with a brief zzso s delay and to an identification control zzso zzso memory engaged the superior zzso lobe zzso the middle zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso prefrontal zzso In addition, we studied the resistance to a zzso item by comparing the successive discrimination task with long zzso with and without an intervening zzso zzso This manipulative process engaged left zzso zzso zzso and left zzso prefrontal zzso The zzso of left zzso prefrontal zzso is interpreted as reflecting zzso between task zzso These results, combined with those of two previous studies using an identical reduction strategy, underscore the functional zzso in the prefrontal zzso during short-term and working zzso
