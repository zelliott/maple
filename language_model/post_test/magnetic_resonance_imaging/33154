To evaluate zzso zzso of zzso zzso field zzso in breast and to assess effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso applied to bilateral zzso 

A fast, zzso efficient method to calculate zzso zzso field from anatomical images was zzso The method was validated against the conventional zzso zzso mapping method and was used to generate data for linear and zzso zzso simulation on 13 zzso 

Most volunteers showed a significant zzso zzso zzso The majority of the subjects also exhibited a statistically significant zzso zzso The second- and zzso zzso provided only minor zzso each) improvement in zzso zzso 

The shape of the zzso boundary determines most of the observed zzso distribution in bilateral zzso Despite significant zzso among subjects, a common feature traceable to generic anatomy exists in the linear zzso zzso variation of zzso zzso field occurs over a relatively short length scale and is likely best zzso by zzso or localized zzso
