To assess the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance zzso zzso in detecting common zzso duct stones in the zzso investigation of patients zzso referred for zzso disease, to find out the zzso of zzso common duct stones, and to correlate clinical symptoms and history and liver function tests zzso with the actual occurrence of common duct zzso 

Prospective zzso 

General hospital, zzso 

180 consecutive zzso patients referred with symptomatic zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso abdominal zzso zzso zzso retrograde zzso zzso zzso 

Positive and negative zzso values and accuracy of zzso number of patients with zzso stones, and correlation of symptoms with the presence of zzso 

zzso patients had common duct stones zzso Only one zzso had an zzso zzso For detection of such stones, zzso positive zzso value was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso negative zzso value zzso zzso to zzso and accuracy zzso zzso to zzso zzso missed 5 stones zzso zzso in size in 5 zzso zzso patients with raised zzso had stones zzso The probability of stones was highest when the patients had both raised zzso and a zzso common zzso zzso zzso duct zzso There were no zzso with zzso stones in the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso values of zzso were fairly good, but zzso misses some small stones zzso zzso in zzso zzso stones in the common duct are not common in this population and should not be screened zzso The probability of stones increases with the number of zzso zzso Patients should be questioned carefully about signs of zzso zzso and only be offered zzso zzso should they have a suspicious history, raised zzso or a zzso common zzso
