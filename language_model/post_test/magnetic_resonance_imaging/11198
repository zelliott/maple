The purpose of our study was to assess zzso the value of zzso in characterization of soft tissue tumors zzso and soft tissue zzso zzso in a zzso setting by a group of zzso The material consisted of zzso zzso and proven zzso or zzso zzso originating from a zzso database of zzso in which zzso consecutive patients with zzso examined by zzso were registered between 1 January 2001 and 28 April zzso Based on zzso findings, a suitably ordered differential diagnosis was made in consensus by two zzso zzso and zzso zzso diagnoses were compared with zzso results zzso cases, zzso and/or zzso follow-up zzso cases, zzso as reference zzso The correlation between the zzso and zzso diagnosis and between the zzso and zzso zzso were statistically zzso One hundred zzso patients presented with a zzso zzso 425 patients presented with a benign zzso zzso differentiation between zzso and benign zzso zzso a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso negative zzso value zzso of zzso and positive zzso value zzso of zzso with accuracy of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso if only the first zzso diagnosis was taken into account, a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and accuracy of zzso were zzso For benign zzso sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and accuracy of zzso were zzso The zzso definition of zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and an accuracy of zzso A correct diagnosis compared with zzso assessment was proposed in zzso of the 455 zzso confirmed zzso Despite zzso MR zzso zzso the results of our prospective study were better than those reported in previous studies and demonstrated the need for a zzso approach to such rare zzso
