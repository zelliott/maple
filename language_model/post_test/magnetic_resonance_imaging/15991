The importance of the zzso to the well-being of the normal knee is zzso However, there is no ideal repair or zzso approach for damaged zzso Gene therapy provides one promising alternative strategy, especially when combined with zzso tissue engineering to achieve minimally invasive clinical zzso We asked whether the introduction of human zzso growth factor 1 zzso gene could improve the repair of zzso zzso zzso We created zzso zzso defects in the zzso zzso of the anterior horn in 48 zzso Bone zzso zzso cells with the zzso of zzso gene and zzso calcium zzso gel were mixed together to repair the zzso three control groups included cells without zzso gel without cells, and defects left zzso After 4, 8, and 16 weeks, the animals were zzso and the excised defects were examined by zzso assessment, zzso analysis, electron zzso zzso determination, and zzso Sixteen weeks after surgery the repaired zzso defects were filled with white tissue similar to that in normal zzso zzso The repair tissue was composed of cells embedded within zzso that filled the spaces of the zzso The zzso content in the zzso tissue engineering group was higher than those in the control groups, and less than that in the normal zzso The results suggest zzso zzso defects in regions without blood supply can be reconstructed with zzso zzso tissue zzso
