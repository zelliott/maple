An important aspect of zzso our understanding of the central nervous system function after menopause is to examine the cerebral zzso that appears to be influenced by zzso zzso drugs in the presence and absence of zzso This pilot study investigated the effects of two zzso drugs on brain zzso and working memory performance in zzso women not taking zzso This approach simulates the effects of zzso or zzso zzso or zzso loss by temporarily blocking zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Six healthy zzso women took part in three drug challenges using the zzso drug zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso the zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso during functional magnetic resonance zzso The cognitive measure was a visually presented verbal zzso test of working zzso 

Neither zzso nor zzso significantly impaired performance on the verbal zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging results showed greater increases in frontal lobe zzso in the zzso condition relative to each drug condition with different specific regional zzso for zzso and zzso 

These preliminary results suggest that brain zzso patterns are sensitive to zzso zzso in zzso women and that differential effects may be observed following zzso versus zzso zzso This approach offers a potentially valuable method for modeling age-related changes in brain function, and the findings may have implications for zzso contributions to normal and zzso zzso
