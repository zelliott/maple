zzso zzso magnets have been used in zzso for many years, but success has been limited because these magnets are susceptible to zzso by the saliva and because their zzso force is weak relative to the initial retention offered by mechanical zzso More recently, magnets have been made from zzso of the rare earth elements zzso and zzso which provide stronger magnetic force per unit zzso In addition, a new generation of zzso containers has improved protection from zzso zzso The current resurgence of interest in this type of attachment appears justified because, unlike mechanical attachments, magnets have potential for unlimited durability and might therefore be superior to mechanical ball or bar attachments for the retention of removable zzso on zzso To date, no long-term prospective trials have been conducted to confirm the clinical durability of this new generation of magnets for retaining zzso on either teeth or zzso The aim of this study was to document initial clinical experiences and levels of satisfaction among zzso patients treated with zzso zzso zzso retained using a new generation of zzso magnetic zzso At the outset, all but one of the 17 patients had had several years of experience with zzso zzso During the first year, the mean overall satisfaction among these 17 patients increased from less than 70 to over 90 out of 100 zzso visual analogue zzso No unusual difficulties were encountered in rendering the treatment or maintaining the zzso This report offers preliminary evidence of the excellent potential of these magnets for retaining zzso zzso zzso
