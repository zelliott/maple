The aim of this study was to determine an appropriate management plan for childhood and adolescent zzso in particular to establish an zzso for zzso diagnosis and zzso 

Between 1985 and 2003, 4 children with zzso were zzso Of these 4 patients, 3 zzso zzso underwent tumor zzso and 1 zzso zzso was treated by conservative zzso Clinical data, pathological findings and follow-up were evaluated zzso 

The 3 patients in Group A were zzso while the 1 patient in Group B was zzso In 3 of 4 patients, a homogeneous tumor with a central zzso area was noted on abdominal zzso CT scan and MR zzso In case 2, zzso MR imaging was useful for zzso zzso from zzso zzso Though zzso needle biopsy was performed in case 3, a zzso definitive diagnosis was zzso An open biopsy was performed in case 4 and zzso was zzso In case 4 treated by conservative management, the tumor size did not change during the 7 years after the diagnosis of zzso 

zzso is usually treated conservatively because of the good evolutionary outcome of the zzso Surgery is indicated in cases of zzso compressed adjacent zzso zzso zzso or for symptomatic zzso We advocate the use of less invasive zzso MR imaging instead of open biopsy when the diagnosis of focal liver zzso is not clear after zzso CT scan and zzso MR zzso
