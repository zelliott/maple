We measured soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso in the serum and zzso fluid zzso of 35 clinically active zzso zzso multiple sclerosis zzso patients who underwent both zzso puncture and zzso zzso zzso zzso within an zzso of 1 week, and of 30 neurological controls of whom 17 had zzso zzso diseases zzso 8 bacterial meningitis zzso and 5 AIDS zzso complex zzso Thirteen of the zzso patients assumed zzso at the time of the zzso While zzso serum levels were highest in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients showed levels higher zzso zzso zzso than treated zzso and zzso but similar to zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso group had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values higher than the treated group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso high zzso index was found also in zzso zzso zzso patients with one or more zzso zzso zzso zzso had higher mean values of zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso cells compared to patients without such zzso zzso In the zzso zzso patients, zzso serum levels were higher zzso zzso zzso than those in zzso zzso In the latter group, there were positive correlations between the number of zzso zzso cells and both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and the Expanded zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso There were no significant correlations in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso index can be a better marker of zzso zzso synthesis than zzso levels and provide additional zzso in zzso into the zzso barrier mechanisms underlying zzso zzso in clinically active zzso zzso
