The purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso in zzso the tissue zzso properties during high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso zzso For this purpose, a total of 52 localized zzso were performed in the zzso of six pigs with zzso monitored in real time by zzso MR zzso The kidney zzso was modified by zzso of the flow in the zzso by zzso of an inflatable zzso zzso The resulting temperature data were analyzed using the zzso transfer model in order to validate the model under in zzso conditions and to estimate zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso An excellent correspondence was observed between the zzso transfer model and the experimental zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were independent of the flow, with mean values zzso standard zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso K zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, whereas the zzso decreased significantly by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso flow zzso values of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as predicted by the zzso The quantitative analysis of the zzso temperature distribution during zzso zzso zzso allows the determination of the zzso zzso and may therefore improve the quality of the planning of zzso therapy with zzso zzso
