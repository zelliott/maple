A zzso zzso digital zzso receiver system was designed to achieve high bandwidth zzso imaging zzso acquisitions for applications such as zzso The modular system design allows for easy extension to an arbitrary number of zzso A zzso receiver was developed and integrated with a General Electric zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso performance was evaluated on zzso and human volunteers using a zzso zzso zzso brain surface zzso zzso At an output bandwidth of 1 zzso a zzso acquisition duty cycle was zzso zzso system noise figure and dynamic range were better than zzso zzso and 84 zzso zzso During repetitive zzso scanning on zzso the relative zzso standard zzso of the image intensity zzso was below zzso As compared to the product zzso head zzso zzso reception with the custom array yielded a nearly zzso zzso gain in the cerebral zzso and a zzso zzso gain in the center of the zzso The excellent system stability combined with the increased sensitivity and zzso capabilities of zzso coils are expected to significantly benefit and enhance zzso zzso
