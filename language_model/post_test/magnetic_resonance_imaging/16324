The emergence of magnetic zzso Imaging zzso technique has made it possible to answer many questions in the field of anatomy more precisely while observing different zzso parts of living persons at different zzso This study was conducted to determine the dimensions of different parts of zzso and also comparing the data in accordance with age and sex by zzso 

The present study carried out on 300 healthy individuals referred to imaging center at zzso Reza hospital in the city of zzso zzso The precondition for people to be included in the study was the approval made by in-house physician based on person's state of health and the lack of any pathological zzso in brain on the basis of images obtained by zzso Following zzso zzso the dimensions of target parts in zzso were calculated by the zzso measuring system and recorded along with the age and sex of the zzso zzso were recorded in zzso and based on selecting the largest zzso zzso and length of the organ during the examination of all zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Data analysis was performed using zzso test and zzso zzso The significance level was set at zzso 

The mean size of different parts of zzso recorded in zzso was as zzso The height of zzso of zzso in men and women were zzso and zzso zzso The height of zzso of zzso was zzso in men and zzso in zzso The length of zzso in men was zzso and in women zzso The length of zzso in men and women were zzso and zzso zzso The length of zzso of zzso was zzso in men and zzso in zzso Lastly, the zzso length of the zzso of zzso was zzso in men and zzso in zzso 

The values obtained for the zzso zzso length of zzso of zzso height of zzso and height of zzso in men were larger than those found for zzso There were significant relationships between the zzso zzso length of zzso of zzso height of zzso of zzso and the age in zzso There was no significant relationship between dimension of zzso and age in zzso
