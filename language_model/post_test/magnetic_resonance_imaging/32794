The purpose of this study was to describe the magnetic resonance imaging zzso characteristics of suspected instability in dogs with zzso fractures or zzso Eleven dogs that had zzso examinations of the spine prior to surgical stabilization of zzso fractures and/or zzso were included in the zzso Nine dogs also had survey zzso Four dogs had cervical fracture or zzso and presented with zzso with intact zzso zzso zzso 2) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven dogs had zzso zzso or zzso and presented with zzso with intact zzso zzso zzso 5) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso model was applied to the interpretation of both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso identified zzso disruption consistent with spinal instability in seven out of the nine cases zzso In zzso studies, zzso of the supportive soft tissue structures and/or fracture in at least two compartments could be zzso Nine cases had spinal zzso changes on zzso including signal intensity changes, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscle intensity changes were also visible at each trauma zzso zzso resonance imaging provided helpful information on the location and extent of damage to supportive soft tissue structures and enabled assessment of spinal zzso injury in this group of dogs with surgically confirmed zzso fractures and zzso
