The purpose of this work was to develop an MR zzso animal model of zzso zzso zzso We zzso that real-time MR imaging of the brain can be performed during stroke zzso and can provide real-time feedback and guidance on the success of zzso 

zzso strokes were induced in 5 adult dogs by the use of zzso blood zzso with a sixth dog serving as an experimental zzso zzso MR zzso and zzso imaging was performed to track the evolution of the zzso The apparent diffusion zzso zzso and quantitative cerebral blood flow zzso were compared in the normal and stroke zzso During and after the administration of a chemical zzso agent, MR imaging was performed to assess the outcome of the zzso 

Strokes were successfully created in 5 zzso No zzso or zzso changes were observed in the control zzso Both zzso and zzso values were found to be significantly different in the region affected by the zzso Restoration of flow was observed in 1 zzso 

We have successfully implemented an MR zzso canine model of zzso zzso zzso
