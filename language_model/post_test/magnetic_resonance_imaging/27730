To design a zzso magnetic resonance zzso foot pedal device that allows in zzso mapping of changes in zzso and in strain of different musculoskeletal components of the lower leg under passive, zzso concentric, and eccentric zzso 

A zzso zzso in the control room pumped zzso fluid to rotate a zzso inside the zzso To validate the performance of the device, six subjects were zzso with gated zzso zzso zzso imaging to investigate the dynamics of muscle and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging clearly delineated different muscle compartments by differences in distribution of mechanical zzso High zzso of contraction cycles allowed establishing that zzso zzso zzso more during passive compared with eccentric zzso zzso separation during passive zzso between three locations: zzso zzso and active zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar but significantly different from concentric zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso regions showing mostly negative values for the first two zzso but positive for the zzso 

The device was sufficiently robust and zzso to accurately zzso using zzso imaging, zzso important structure and dynamics of the zzso zzso
