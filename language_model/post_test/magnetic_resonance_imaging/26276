To study the relationship of the length of the external zzso of the zzso aqueduct and the ratio of the zzso potential and action potential zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso case zzso 

zzso referral zzso 

zzso patients with zzso disease and nine control subjects without zzso zzso 

The external zzso of the zzso aqueduct was measured from a three-dimensional surface reconstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on patients with zzso zzso 

The length of the external zzso of the zzso aqueduct in the zzso disease ears was related to the zzso ratio in the zzso disease ears and compared with zzso 

The average length of the external zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso disease ears and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control ears zzso zzso zzso An enlarged zzso ratio was found in zzso of ears in the group with zzso external zzso of the zzso aqueduct, zzso of ears in the zzso zzso group, zzso of ears in the zzso zzso group, and zzso of ears in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The length of the external zzso of the zzso aqueduct in patients with zzso disease is significantly shorter than in those without zzso zzso zzso zzso evidenced by an enlarged zzso ratio, was related to the length of the external zzso of the zzso zzso The shorter the external zzso the more often the zzso ratio was zzso A short or zzso external zzso of the zzso aqueduct is a zzso factor to the development of zzso zzso
