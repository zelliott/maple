Most patients with zzso zzso zzso encephalitis have zzso synthesis of zzso which cause a decrease of cell surface and synaptic zzso zzso are zzso G zzso and zzso zzso and can potentially activate zzso We examined whether complement zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso are present in the brain of these zzso 

zzso rat zzso zzso were used in an zzso zzso to test whether patients' zzso can fix zzso Using the same zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso complement zzso was determined in the brain of 5 patients, the zzso of 21 patients, and appropriate control zzso A set of markers for B zzso T zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso were used to examine the brain inflammatory zzso 

zzso zzso were able to bind complement in zzso but deposits of complement were not detected in patients' zzso Parallel experiments with zzso showed that in contrast to the brain, the neural tissue of the tumors contained zzso Analysis of the inflammatory infiltrates in brain samples from autopsy or biopsy performed zzso weeks after symptom presentation demonstrated numerous zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso and zzso spaces, and B and T cells predominantly located in zzso zzso 

zzso mechanisms do not appear to play a substantial zzso role in zzso zzso In contrast, there are copious infiltrates of zzso cells zzso zzso in the zzso of these zzso The demonstration of these cells provides an explanation for the zzso synthesis of zzso and has implications for zzso
