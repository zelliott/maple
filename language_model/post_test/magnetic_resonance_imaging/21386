A prospective quantitative MR study of brain zzso was performed to show the potential of combining different MR techniques to distinguish various disease processes in routine clinical zzso 

zzso patients with various zzso zzso before treatment zzso confirmed by a zzso and 59 healthy subjects were examined on a zzso system by conventional MR imaging, zzso zzso imaging, diffusion zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso and their ratios, zzso relaxation times and mean zzso were calculated and correlated on a zzso basis and compared to control zzso 

Different zzso types and different zzso revealed specific patterns of correlations between zzso zzso and mean zzso or zzso relaxation zzso The patterns distinguish given tissue states in the examined zzso healthy zzso tissue infiltrated by zzso active zzso zzso infiltrated by zzso zzso zzso This method is able to describe the complexity of a highly zzso tissue in the zzso and its vicinity, and determines crucial parameters for tissue zzso 

A combination of different MR parameters on a zzso basis in individual patients enables better identification of the zzso type, direction of proliferation and assessment of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resonance offers many different methods of examining the zzso zzso A combination of quantitative MR parameters helps distinguish different brain zzso zzso Different zzso types revealed specific correlation patterns amongst different MR parameters zzso The correlation patterns reflect highly zzso complex tissue within zzso
