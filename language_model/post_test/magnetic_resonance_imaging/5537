zzso in the magnitude of zzso fluid zzso zzso flow through the cerebral aqueduct between healthy and zzso patients have been previously zzso However it is not clear whether this is directly related to the zzso or secondary to altered zzso zzso and zzso This work aims to determine the role of zzso and zzso factors in modulating the magnitude of zzso flow through the zzso 

Twenty subjects (10 healthy and 10 patients with zzso zzso of different zzso were studied by zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso scans of zzso blood and zzso flows as well as zzso flow through the zzso zzso MR data were used for zzso of zzso volumes, third zzso zzso and gray and white brain tissue zzso zzso imaging was used for zzso of zzso and cervical zzso stroke volumes zzso zzso zzso area, and zzso zzso zzso volume zzso Because data from normal and zzso patients were zzso a battery of statistical methods that accounted for the group effects were zzso zzso correlation was used to determine which of these parameters were most significantly associated with zzso stroke volume zzso Multiple linear zzso analyses were employed to identify zzso and zzso models with the least amount of variables that are significant zzso of zzso Finally, the association between the magnitude of zzso and the zzso zzso area, and its implication on the zzso flow dynamic characteristics and zzso pressure difference was zzso 

Using partial zzso 5 of the 6 zzso parameters and none of the zzso parameters and brain tissue volume were found to be statistically zzso The highest partial correlations were with the total zzso volume zzso zzso zzso and third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These parameters were also found to be significant zzso of zzso in the multiple linear zzso analyses with third zzso volume and group effects as insignificant zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso R zzso zzso On the other hand, both cervical zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be weak zzso of zzso with group effects as the only significant variable of the zzso model zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso R zzso zzso A combined zzso model including the zzso variables of the zzso model and the zzso provides the strongest zzso of determination (R zzso zzso zzso correlation analysis revealed a very strong relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso area zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso flow is strongly correlated with zzso zzso especially with the total zzso volume and the third zzso zzso but not with the tested zzso zzso In addition, zzso is zzso correlated with zzso zzso area, suggesting that the zzso zzso flow characteristics can be explained by zzso pressure differences on the order of less than zzso zzso These findings may explain why a zzso zzso is a poor diagnostic marker and an insensitive indicator of shunt outcome in idiopathic normal pressure zzso
