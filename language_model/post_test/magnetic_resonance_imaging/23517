UK guidelines for breast cancer recommend zzso zzso assessment via surgical methods such as zzso zzso zzso biopsy zzso However, these procedures are associated with adverse effects such as zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso imaging zzso The aim of this study is to evaluate the zzso of zzso and PET compared with zzso for assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso early stage breast cancer patients in the zzso 

An individual patient zzso simulation model was developed in zzso to estimate the lifetime costs and benefits of replacing zzso with zzso or zzso or adding zzso or PET before zzso zzso outcomes were derived from a recent systematic zzso patient utilities and resource use data were zzso from the zzso 

Based on our analysis the baseline zzso strategy is dominated by the strategies of replacing zzso with either zzso or zzso The strategy of replacing zzso with zzso has the highest total zzso life years zzso and lowest total zzso However, clinical evidence for zzso is based on a limited number of small studies and replacing zzso with zzso or PET leads to more zzso and zzso zzso The strategy of adding zzso before zzso is zzso but subject to greater zzso 

Based on this analysis the most cost-effective strategy is to replace zzso with zzso However, further large studies using up-to-date techniques are required to obtain more accurate data on the sensitivity and specificity of zzso
