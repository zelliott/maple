After zzso zzso zzso geometry and function, as well as energy zzso change zzso In zzso heart failure, zzso of zzso zzso zzso improves zzso zzso by improving zzso performance relative to a reduced energetic zzso However, the zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso have not been characterized in failing hearts after zzso After undergoing permanent coronary zzso mice received a zzso zzso or zzso or matching zzso in the daily drinking zzso Four weeks later, zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso were used to zzso in zzso functional and zzso changes in zzso remodeled mouse zzso and the effects of zzso on that zzso zzso zzso and zzso volumes zzso were increased by more than zzso after zzso left zzso zzso mass doubled zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ejection fraction zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso compared with control hearts zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso at 1 zzso The zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso was also significantly decreased in zzso remodeled hearts zzso zzso zzso compared with control animals zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in agreement with prior studies in larger zzso The zzso zzso and zzso did not change zzso mass but limited the increase in zzso and zzso of zzso hearts by zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso We conclude that zzso improve zzso function after zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratio in heart zzso Thus zzso therapy offers a new and potentially complementary approach to limit the adverse zzso and zzso consequences after zzso
