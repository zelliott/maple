The purpose of this study was to compare the zzso ratio zzso of phantom and rat brain images performed at zzso T on a clinical MR system and at 7 T on a zzso experimental zzso zzso was carried out by taking into account zzso values based on a single sample acquisition at zzso and 7 T as well as on simultaneous imaging of multiple samples at zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso assessed on a phantom and rat brains at zzso and 7 T using 25 zzso surface coils and compared to theoretical zzso gain zzso The feasibility of zzso imaging, using the hardware capabilities available on the zzso T system, was zzso Finally, rat brain images obtained on a single animal at 7 T and on multiple animals acquired simultaneously at zzso T were zzso 

zzso determined zzso at 7 T was far below theoretical zzso Taking into account chemical shift, zzso artifacts and modifications of zzso and zzso relaxation times at higher field, a zzso system holds limited advantage over a zzso zzso Instead, a zzso acquisition methodology was demonstrated on a clinical zzso zzso This acquisition method significantly increases imaging efficiency and competes with single animal acquisitions at higher zzso 

zzso imaging using a standard clinical scanner has a great potential as a zzso acquisition method for small zzso
