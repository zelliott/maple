The zzso zzso using zzso acid zzso is a well established method for the treatment of brain zzso especially zzso zzso However, there is no report on zzso diagnosis zzso for spinal zzso In the present study, we evaluated the usefulness of zzso for spinal zzso using zzso 

Three patients with spinal zzso received oral doses of zzso (20 zzso body zzso 2 hours before zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed with a zzso zzso sharp cut filter after zzso with a violet semiconductor laser zzso zzso and was verified by analysis of fluorescent zzso zzso fluorescent samples taken from the tumor cavity were examined zzso 

Fluorescence peaked at zzso in the removed tumors in all zzso Fluorescent tissue tended to exist at the zzso and zzso portion in the tumor cavity or around the anterior median zzso The residual fluorescent tissue was not detected after removal of the tumor in case zzso The residual fluorescent tissue was composed of tumor cells and zzso lining in case 2 or the infiltrated inflammatory cells and vascular zzso cells in case zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging showed no residual tumor in any of the zzso 

The results of this study indicate the usefulness of zzso tumor zzso in guiding zzso of spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso may label spinal zzso easily and clearly enough to enhance the zzso of tumor zzso
