Water diffusion in neurological zzso is known to possess zzso diffusion zzso The zzso of fast and slow apparent diffusion components have often been attributed to the volume zzso of zzso space zzso and zzso space zzso although diffusion zzso are at zzso with the tissue compartment volume zzso In this article this puzzle was examined with a finite difference diffusion simulation model on the basis of optical images from zzso rat spinal zzso Here the results show that assignment of zzso obtained from zzso fits of fast and slow diffusion zzso to zzso and zzso volume ratios is not zzso Rather, the observed zzso diffusion behavior is caused by zzso restriction and limited zzso water exchange in that at long diffusion times diffusion zzso is shown to become zzso Although the measured apparent diffusion zzso also depend on zzso relaxation time of water zzso in the various zzso the sensitivity to zzso is small and thus zzso differences are unlikely to explain the mismatch between apparent diffusion zzso and cellular volume zzso
