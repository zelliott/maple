zzso zzso is a valuable adjunct to zzso zzso therapies as it helps to determine when lethal doses are reached at the target and whether surrounding zzso are safe from zzso When the targeted zzso is mobile, MR data can further be used for zzso zzso The present work introduces pulse sequence modifications that enable significant improvements in terms of both zzso properties and zzso zzso Instead of sampling a single zzso zzso as in typical MR zzso zzso the zzso design introduced here involves sampling at least one additional zzso Image reconstruction changes associated with the proposed sampling scheme are also zzso The method was implemented on two commonly used MR zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso imaging zzso Data from the extra zzso enabled zzso improvements by up to zzso without increasing scan zzso Potentially of greater significance is that the sampled pathways featured very different contrast for blood vessels, zzso their detection and use as internal landmarks for tracking zzso Through improved zzso and zzso abilities, the proposed zzso design may facilitate the use of zzso zzso zzso as an effective treatment option even in mobile zzso such as the liver and zzso
