Previous zzso studies in patients with major depressive disorder zzso have reported changes in several brain areas, such as the zzso and zzso zzso cortex, amygdala, zzso and zzso zzso However, the results of these studies are inconsistent, and relatively few studies have been conducted using zzso zzso zzso to detect gray matter concentration zzso abnormalities in patients with zzso 

We examined 47 zzso patients and 51 healthy controls to investigate structural abnormalities using a zzso T magnetic resonance imaging system, which was zzso to a customized zzso template and segmented with zzso zzso Analysis of zzso with age and gender as zzso was adopted for the zzso zzso the level of statistical significance was set at zzso for the corrected false discovery zzso 

zzso GMC was found in zzso patients in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the central zzso of the zzso and the zzso encompassing the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Half of our study subjects were taking zzso This may have been a potential zzso factor if any of the medications affected cortical zzso 

The results suggest that the GMC of several regions associated with emotion regulation was lower in zzso zzso In particular, we found decreased GMC in the zzso These findings may provide a better understanding of the anatomical properties of the neural mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso
