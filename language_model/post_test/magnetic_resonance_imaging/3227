zzso exploit a range of visual depth cues to estimate three-dimensional zzso For example, the slant of a nearby zzso can be judged by combining information from zzso disparity, texture and zzso zzso tests show humans combine cues zzso a feat that could depend on discriminating the zzso from zzso mechanisms or on fusing signals into a common zzso Although fusion is zzso attractive, it poses a substantial challenge, requiring the integration of zzso different zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to provide evidence that zzso visual area zzso meets this zzso Specifically, we found that zzso responses are more zzso when two cues zzso disparity and relative zzso zzso signal depth, and that information provided by one cue is diagnostic of depth indicated by the zzso This suggests a cortical zzso important when zzso depth, and highlights zzso based on fusion in the zzso zzso
