The present study applied zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging to examine if mild cerebral zzso and subsequent brain swelling are implicated in the zzso of acute mountain sickness zzso Twenty-two subjects were examined in zzso zzso zzso after 16 hours passive exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a simulated altitude of 4,500 m and after 6 hours recovery in zzso Clinical zzso was diagnosed in 50% of subjects during zzso and corresponding headache scores were markedly elevated zzso versus zzso zzso was associated with a mild increase in brain volume zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso that resolved during zzso zzso zzso was also associated with an increased zzso relaxation time zzso and a general trend toward an increased apparent diffusion zzso zzso During the zzso recovery, brain volume and zzso recovered to zzso baseline values, whereas a more marked reduction in zzso in the zzso of the corpus zzso zzso was observed zzso While changes in brain volume and zzso were not selectively different in zzso zzso values were consistently lower zzso versus zzso and associated with the severity of zzso zzso Acute mountain sickness was also characterized by an increased brain to zzso volume ratio zzso versus zzso These findings indicate that mild zzso zzso zzso contributes to the generalized brain swelling observed at high zzso independent of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso combined with an zzso predisposition to a zzso brain may prove of zzso significance, although the increase in brain volume in zzso was only about zzso of total brain zzso
