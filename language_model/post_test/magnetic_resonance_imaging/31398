The zzso effect is a phenomenon zzso zzso information influences the perception of the phonetic category boundary for stimuli from zzso zzso At issue is whether this effect is due to zzso influence of upper levels of processing on zzso processing, or instead is due to zzso zzso In this study, brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging as subjects performed a phonetic categorization task on items taken from 2 zzso in which one end of the zzso was a real word and the other was not zzso and zzso If the zzso effect has a zzso basis, zzso of zzso should be seen as a function of the zzso effect in areas such as the superior zzso zzso zzso which have previously been implicated in zzso zzso In contrast, if the effect is purely due to zzso factors, such zzso would be expected only in areas which have been linked to executive zzso such as frontal and zzso zzso zzso of zzso as a function of the zzso biased shift in phonetic category boundary was observed in the zzso zzso as well as in frontal and zzso zzso This zzso pattern suggests that the zzso effect has at minimum a zzso zzso in addition to an executive zzso zzso These results challenge the view that zzso effects on phonetic boundary placement are due solely to zzso zzso zzso and support those models of language processing which allow for zzso zzso information to directly influence the perception of incoming zzso
