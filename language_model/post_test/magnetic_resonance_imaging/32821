Previous research suggests that zzso patients are characterized by both reduced activity in the inferior frontal zzso zzso during response zzso tasks (such as the zzso zzso and reduced activity in the zzso zzso during reward anticipation tasks (such as the zzso zzso zzso However, no prior research has applied either of these zzso in zzso adults with zzso nor have these been implemented in an zzso zzso 

The sample consisted of 19 zzso adults with zzso and 19 control zzso Main group analyses were based on individually defined regions of zzso the zzso and the zzso for the zzso and the zzso task zzso In addition, we analyzed the correlation between the two measures, as well as between these measures and the clinical symptoms of zzso 

We observed reduced bilateral zzso activity in adults with zzso during reward zzso No differences were detected in zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that the two tasks are independent at a neural level, but are related zzso in terms of the zzso of the performance reaction zzso zzso in the bilateral zzso but not in the zzso was associated zzso with symptoms of zzso 

zzso underline the implication of the reward system in zzso adult zzso and suggest that frontal abnormalities during response zzso performance may not be such a pivotal aspect of the zzso in zzso In addition, our findings point toward response zzso as a core feature of the zzso
