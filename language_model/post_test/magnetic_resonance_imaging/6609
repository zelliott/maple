zzso like color or movement, is a basic property of the zzso Recently, single zzso tuned to number have been observed in zzso We used both zzso and zzso to examine whether a similar neural coding scheme is present in zzso When participants viewed sets of items with a variable number, the bilateral zzso zzso responded selectively to number zzso zzso the shape of this response indicates that humans, like other animal species, zzso approximate number on a compressed internal zzso zzso the zzso site coding for number in humans is compatible with that observed in zzso zzso Our results therefore suggest an evolutionary basis for human elementary zzso
