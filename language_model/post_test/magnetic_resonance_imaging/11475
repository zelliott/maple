We studied the association of zzso zzso with carotid zzso and zzso cerebrovascular zzso in patients with essential zzso zzso normal patients with essential hypertension zzso 138 male, 155 zzso mean age, 65 zzso and zzso control subjects zzso were studied with zzso zzso of the common and internal carotid arteries and magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso Plasma zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso patients were divided into groups with carotid plaques and low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carotid plaques and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso PM zzso carotid plaques and high zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no plaques and low zzso zzso no plaques and zzso zzso zzso and no plaques and high zzso zzso Overall, zzso zzso were significantly higher in patients than in control zzso zzso plaque prevalence was significantly related to zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed a significant positive relationship with the number of zzso zzso zzso of the brain in zzso patients with carotid plaques zzso zzso No significant relationship was seen between zzso and zzso zzso scores in patients with zzso zzso did not show a relationship to either brain zzso type in patients without carotid zzso Thus, zzso may foster zzso zzso cerebral zzso by promoting carotid zzso in patients with essential zzso
