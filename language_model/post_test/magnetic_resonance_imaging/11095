zzso behavior requires contextual zzso of learned zzso that is, the retrieval or zzso zzso of behavioral elements depending on zzso zzso Here we report neural zzso of these elementary aspects of behavior as identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of a zzso behavioral program was represented in the brain by reduction of net synaptic activity in the zzso zzso The zzso correlate of zzso was a zzso zzso primary zzso superior zzso zzso cortex, and zzso decrease of the blood zzso zzso zzso signal to below the resting state zzso zzso with a zzso decrease of motor cortical zzso The reverse was true for zzso We propose that contextual zzso of learned behavioral programs depends on an interplay of focal increases and decreases of neural activity and that the zzso changes are reflected by negative zzso responses in an extended zzso network of zzso zzso
