To zzso evaluate zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging, as compared with zzso cortical zzso for identification of the central zzso 

Fifteen patients (six men, nine zzso age range, zzso zzso with a zzso near the primary zzso zzso (13 zzso one cavernous zzso and one zzso were examined after institutional review board approval and written informed consent from each patient were zzso At zzso evoked magnetic fields to median nerve stimulation were recorded; at functional MR imaging, zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso of the wrist were zzso General linear model analysis with contextual zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze functional MR imaging data, and zzso modeling was used to analyze zzso zzso zzso and functional MR zzso were compared with zzso cortical zzso The distance from the area of functional MR imaging zzso to the tumor margin was compared between the patients with zzso and those with zzso zzso mapping findings by using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso depicted the central zzso correctly in all 15 patients, as verified at zzso zzso The functional MR imaging zzso results agreed with the zzso zzso in 11 zzso In all four patients with a false zzso the primary zzso was in the zzso zzso region, but it did not differ significantly from the primary zzso in the patients with correct zzso with respect to proximity to the tumor zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, at functional MR imaging, multiple zzso areas were zzso with considerable zzso zzso 

Although both zzso and functional MR imaging can provide useful information for zzso planning, in the present study, zzso proved to be superior for locating the central zzso zzso of multiple zzso cerebral areas may confound the interpretation of functional MR imaging zzso
