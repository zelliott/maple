The relative merits of zzso contrast zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso to predict zzso function improvement after zzso coronary intervention have not been evaluated until zzso We studied 35 consecutive patients with acute zzso zzso who underwent zzso coronary intervention using zzso and zzso and zzso imaging for evaluation of zzso zzso zzso zzso was included as another method to differentiate viable from zzso zzso zzso was performed by power zzso and intravenous zzso A zzso model of the left zzso was used to analyze all zzso contrast zzso and magnetic resonance zzso At 60 days of zzso zzso showed improvement of function in 115 of 192 zzso dysfunctional zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for the prediction of functional improvement were comparable among zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, all p zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso allowed for prediction of zzso function improvement after zzso coronary zzso zzso had a comparable accuracy and, as a bedside technique, may be an alternative tool in the acute phase of acute zzso zzso
