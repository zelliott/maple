zzso zzso I and T and brain zzso zzso are the accepted standards to zzso identify zzso necrosis and elevated wall zzso In addition, they allow risk zzso in cardiovascular zzso The clinical significance of increases in cardiac markers after zzso endurance exercise in obviously healthy athletes is zzso 

We therefore examined the zzso and clinical significance of zzso increases in cardiac zzso I and T and zzso pro brain zzso zzso after two standardized endurance exercise trials in healthy endurance athletes with prior zzso zzso of cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty male athletes zzso years; zzso zzso zzso per zzso completed a zzso and a zzso exercise study zzso zzso 100 and zzso respectively, of the individual zzso zzso on two different days in zzso order to determine cardiac markers before, 30 zzso and 3 h after zzso In addition to zzso and zzso zzso including tissue zzso imaging, delayed enhancement zzso was performed after a zzso exercise study to detect zzso zzso 

A marginal increase in cardiac zzso I was documented after both exercise trials (from zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso T remained without significant zzso zzso pro brain zzso zzso increased by 9 and 30 zzso after zzso and zzso exercise studies, respectively zzso zzso zzso In contrast to cardiac zzso increases in zzso pro brain zzso zzso after competition correlated with those after zzso exercise study zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso were demonstrated by zzso or zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

Due to the missing zzso and evidence of zzso damage, zzso increases in cardiac zzso may represent a zzso reaction under special conditions and seem to be without pathological significance in healthy zzso
