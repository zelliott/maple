An actively zzso zzso zzso surface zzso for human body imaging at 4 T has been constructed and compared with a conventional linear surface zzso The zzso could be used as a zzso or a zzso device in combination with a volume transmit zzso zzso reception profiles and the corresponding images acquired with each zzso as well as with both individual modes of the zzso zzso are zzso Data collected using a tissue equivalent loaded phantom recorded with the linear surface zzso demonstrated significant intensity zzso due to zzso penetration zzso The zzso surface zzso on the other hand, provided compensation of the artifact, separately in its transmission and reception profiles as well as in the zzso zzso zzso sensitivity gain was also observed for the zzso zzso compared to the linear zzso zzso advantages of using the zzso surface zzso over the linear device at 4 T have, therefore, been zzso
