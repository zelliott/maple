We reported a patient with transient zzso attack zzso subsequently evolving to a cerebral zzso in whom zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso detected early zzso zzso in the left zzso The patient was a 30-year-old right-handed male medical doctor, who had an zzso episode of zzso with zzso and right zzso which lasted for 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained 110 minutes after symptom onset demonstrated an area of high signal intensity in the left zzso and zzso zzso whereas T zzso and zzso images were entirely zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso showed zzso zzso in the M 2 branches of the left middle cerebral zzso The second zzso obtained 90 minutes after resolution of the symptoms showed nearly complete zzso of the left middle cerebral artery, suggesting that the zzso was zzso zzso However the patient rapidly developed similar neurological symptoms again zzso hours after the zzso episode, evolving finally to a completed zzso A brain CT obtained 1 hour after the second episode demonstrated diffuse zzso zzso in the left zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in the left zzso zzso zzso 3 and 7 days later displayed completed zzso of which distribution was consistent with that of the zzso zzso on the earlier zzso The left middle cerebral artery remained patent on the follow-up zzso The patient fairly recovered and returned to his zzso position as medical doctor with a mild residual right hand zzso In this patient, zzso and zzso zzso documented an zzso and a reopening of the middle cerebral zzso The zzso mechanism remains unknown despite detailed zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso we would like to point out that the zzso injury, secondary delayed zzso death, and other factors may be involved in the second zzso evolving to the completed zzso
