Patients with rare diseases and complex clinical presentations represent a challenge for clinical zzso zzso approaches are allowing the identification of novel zzso in genes for very rare disorders, enabling a molecular zzso zzso is also revealing a zzso expansion zzso the full spectrum of clinical expression conveyed by zzso zzso at a locus can be better zzso 

To zzso the molecular cause of a complex zzso zzso in 3 patients by applying zzso sequencing zzso 

Three affected individuals from 2 unrelated families presented with a complex zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso They were recruited into the Centers for zzso zzso research program to identify the molecular cause of their zzso zzso targeted zzso sequencing, and high-resolution zzso zzso zzso were performed in zzso clinics of zzso care pediatric hospitals and biomedical research zzso 

zzso and zzso sequencing identified the zzso responsible for the patients' clinical zzso 

We identified compound zzso zzso in 2 affected siblings from 1 family and a zzso nonsense zzso in the third unrelated patient in the zzso zzso 1 gene zzso In the latter subject, we found a common zzso on which the nonsense zzso occurred and that zzso in the zzso Jewish zzso 

We report the identification of zzso zzso in 3 children from 2 unrelated families with a previously zzso complex zzso motor and sensory zzso accompanied by severe zzso zzso and cerebral zzso Our data raise the question of whether zzso zzso disturb cell cycle progression and may result in zzso of cells in the nervous zzso The application of unbiased zzso approaches allows the identification of potentially zzso zzso in zzso genes in highly genetically zzso and zzso neurological zzso
