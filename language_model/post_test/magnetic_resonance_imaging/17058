Most zzso are thought to have an effect on zzso and zzso zzso although their zzso versus zzso binding has not been clearly established in zzso in zzso However, the development of zzso now permits the differentiation of antipsychotic activity on these two zzso zzso In this study we examined the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso receptors by comparing zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mixed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions before and after the initiation of antipsychotic zzso The investigation therefore represents a zzso zzso follow-up design wherein zzso patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were first scanned in a zzso state and then again after zzso weeks of antipsychotic treatment zzso or zzso zzso potential zzso zzso or zzso was obtained to derive estimates of drug occupancy in the identified brain zzso zzso treatment was associated with the expected zzso in the zzso zzso unexpectedly though, patients showed a higher, rather than the expected lower, zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso despite simultaneous evidence for ongoing zzso blockade in the other regions zzso and zzso In conclusion, patients treated with zzso zzso demonstrated no evidence of zzso zzso occupancy, but instead possible zzso zzso following short-term zzso The present findings add to a very limited body of evidence related to zzso binding in zzso zzso offer new opportunities for exploring the potential therapeutic significance of the zzso zzso in schizophrenia and the action of zzso
