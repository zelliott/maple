We performed a prospective zzso study using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to better characterize the relationships between clinical expression and brain function in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso at eight European sites zzso zzso patients and 60 zzso healthy zzso Patients showed greater zzso zzso zzso in brain regions including the zzso and zzso inferior and superior zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso all statistics corrected for multiple zzso Both patients and healthy controls showed greater brain zzso with increasing age in the zzso zzso and inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not controls, showed greater brain zzso in the anterior zzso zzso and the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with less hand zzso An interaction between functional zzso changes in zzso and age was zzso This large zzso study over a broadly selected zzso patient population confirms that movement for patients demands significantly greater cognitive zzso zzso and suggests age-related differences in brain responses to the zzso These observations add to evidence that brain functional responses (including potentially zzso brain zzso contribute to zzso of clinical expression of zzso pathology and demonstrate the feasibility of a zzso functional zzso study of zzso
