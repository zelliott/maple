To evaluate the relationships between zzso change in circulatory zzso growth zzso zzso zzso brain volumes, and zzso outcome at 2 y of age in very zzso zzso 

zzso was measured weekly, and nutritional intake was calculated daily from birth until a zzso age zzso of zzso Individual zzso zzso for zzso zzso representing the rate of increase in zzso from birth until a zzso of zzso were zzso Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at term age, with zzso into total brain, zzso gray matter, and zzso white matter volume zzso zzso outcome was evaluated using zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with mean zzso age zzso of zzso were evaluated at mean zzso zzso corrected zzso Higher zzso zzso and zzso volume were associated with a decreased risk for a Mental zzso Index zzso zzso 85 zzso ratio zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, higher zzso and higher zzso combined with female gender constituted the two models with the highest zzso value for zzso zzso zzso 

A higher rate of increase in circulating zzso is associated with a decreased risk for zzso zzso at 2 y of corrected zzso This relationship is in part dependent on brain volume at term zzso
