We conducted a retrospective study on the relation of the zzso imaging patterns to the prognosis of patients with small zzso after zzso Forty patients with small zzso less than 2 zzso in diameter without vascular invasion were enrolled in this zzso There were no significant differences in the signal intensity of zzso on zzso and zzso findings such as zzso or tumor zzso zzso images of the internal of tumor were classified into two zzso Six cases with homogeneous pattern were significantly worse in cumulative survival rate than 28 cases with zzso pattern zzso zzso zzso The same results were obtained with respect to limitation of cases treated by relative zzso operation zzso zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso grading and zzso potential of small zzso could be evaluated by zzso of the pattern of internal zzso images, and complete zzso therapy, and that intense course observation for cases with zzso homogeneous pattern would be zzso
