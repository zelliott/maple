To create a zzso zzso zzso phantom of the brain zzso to evaluate zzso zzso methods using zzso zzso zzso An objective phantom is needed to test the many different zzso programs currently used to measure zzso volumes in patients with Alzheimer's zzso 

A zzso model was constructed from zzso using a digital mesh of the zzso created from the 3 zzso zzso zzso of a subject with Alzheimer's zzso The zzso was placed in a brain mold and surrounded with material composed of zzso zzso in water, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to match the signal intensity properties of brain tissue in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso images of the phantom were acquired and zzso zzso software was used to measure zzso zzso 

The images acquired of the phantom successfully zzso in zzso signal intensity differences between the zzso and surrounding tissue in zzso zzso images and were robust to zzso The zzso volume was zzso to zzso accuracy at zzso zzso zzso 

The phantom represents a simple, realistic and objective method to test the accuracy of lateral zzso zzso methods and we project it can be extended to other anatomical zzso
