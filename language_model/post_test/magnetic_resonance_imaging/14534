zzso individual zzso for the prediction of altered neurological outcome is a challenge of modern medicine and zzso zzso based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso stands as a good candidate to zzso extract information from zzso by zzso the information obtained in a few network features that can be used as individual zzso of neurological zzso However, this approach typically requires the use of diffusion and/or functional zzso to extract individual brain networks, which require high acquisition times and present an extreme sensitivity to motion artifacts, critical problems when scanning fetuses and zzso zzso of individual networks based on zzso similarity from gray matter is a new approach that benefits from the power of graph theory analysis to describe gray matter zzso as a large-scale zzso network from a typical clinical zzso acquisition such as zzso zzso In the present paper we propose a methodology to zzso these large-scale zzso networks to a brain network with standardized size based on a zzso zzso The proposed methodology was applied to reconstruct individual brain networks of 63 zzso zzso 41 infants with zzso growth restriction zzso and 22 controls, showing altered network features in the zzso group, and their association with zzso outcome at two years of age by means of zzso zzso analysis of the network features obtained with zzso zzso for zzso and zzso Development, third zzso Although it must be more widely zzso this methodology stands as a good candidate for the development of zzso for altered zzso in the pediatric zzso
