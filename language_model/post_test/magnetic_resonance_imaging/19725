zzso markers of zzso disease zzso particularly in the early zzso are needed for clinical assessment and zzso We have evaluated a novel method to segment and zzso the zzso system and obtain zzso measures zzso The zzso horn volume zzso and index in patients with mild cognitive impairment zzso and in those with zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso volume imaging was performed in 52 subjects (21 patients with zzso 10 with zzso and 21 healthy control zzso An interactive watershed transformation and zzso zzso analysis were implemented to produce segmented zzso and zzso horn zzso zzso zzso of zzso to lateral zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso horn size could be zzso zzso from all 52 zzso The method was fast and zzso zzso zzso inspections using surface rendering zzso could uncover zzso process with enlargement of the whole and especially zzso horn zzso Both zzso and zzso of patients with zzso were significantly larger than those of patients with zzso or control subjects zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in zzso and zzso between patients with zzso or control subjects zzso zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between the zzso performance and both zzso and zzso across groups zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso could be used as markers of zzso in the clinical environment and are expected to be helpful in monitoring therapeutic zzso
