Stem cell therapy has emerged as a potential therapeutic option for cell zzso heart zzso Application of zzso cell tracking approaches is necessary to determine tissue distribution and lifetime of stem cells following their injection and will likely provide knowledge about poorly understood stem cells mechanisms of tissue zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is a potentially excellent tool for high-resolution zzso of the fate of cells after transplantation and for evaluation of therapeutic zzso The application of zzso for in zzso cell tracking requires contrast agents to achieve efficient cell labeling without causing any toxic cellular effects or zzso any other side zzso For these reasons clinically approved contrast agents zzso zzso and incorporation zzso zzso zzso are currently the preferred materials for cell labeling and zzso Here we describe how to use zzso iron oxide zzso to label cells and to monitor cell fate in several disease zzso
