The objective of this study was to determine the relationship in regional cerebral blood flow zzso as measured with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and single zzso zzso computer zzso zzso zzso was determined in 26 healthy subjects with zzso and zzso After zzso of zzso with zzso zzso was determined in 10 brain regions relative to the whole slice zzso zzso was evaluated with and without elimination of large zzso zzso from zzso zzso significantly with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso with and r zzso zzso without elimination of large zzso p zzso zzso for zzso zzso of large vessels reduced the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in most zzso zzso from zzso shows good correlation with zzso from zzso Because zzso is sensitive to flow in large vessels while zzso is not, elimination of large vessels in zzso reduces the zzso zzso of zzso and improves zzso between the two zzso zzso is a reliable zzso method for zzso zzso
