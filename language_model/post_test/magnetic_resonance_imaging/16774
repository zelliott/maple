To demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso fusion was feasible in characterizing pancreatic tumors zzso comparing zzso and zzso zzso zzso as mapping images for fusion with PET as well as fused zzso and zzso 

We zzso reviewed 47 sets of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso examinations to evaluate suspected or known pancreatic zzso To assess the ability of mapping images for fusion with zzso CT (of zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR images (all zzso were graded regarding the visibility of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso MR images of the upper abdomen were evaluated to determine whether mapping images provided additional diagnostic information to PET alone zzso zzso The overall quality of zzso or zzso sets in diagnosis was also assessed zzso zzso These zzso scores were compared to zzso scores and the accuracy in characterizing zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso on CT or zzso including 30 with abnormal zzso zzso and 13 zzso The confidence score for the visibility of zzso was significantly higher on zzso zzso than zzso The scores for additional diagnostic information to PET and overall quality of each image set in diagnosis were significantly higher on the zzso zzso set than the zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy was higher on zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than zzso zzso but statistical significance was not zzso 

zzso fusion, especially PET with zzso zzso was demonstrated to be superior to zzso in characterizing zzso offering better mapping and fusion image zzso
