zzso evaluation of low back and leg pain has progressed rapidly over the past zzso The development of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso and magnetic resonance imaging has markedly increased diagnostic accuracy in detecting zzso zzso With this increased accuracy has come recognition of a 50% prevalence of underlying abnormalities in patients between 20 and 60 years old who have no zzso When such patients have a back injury, subsequent imaging will show in half of the population studied abnormalities that are not related to an acute zzso zzso of the spine zzso in all patients throughout their zzso and nearly all of the population will have back discomfort at some zzso zzso and zzso compensation for back injuries related to accidents and on-the-job injuries provides an incentive for patients not to improve on therapy and to zzso symptoms, further complicating the clinical evaluation of their zzso The goal of zzso zzso and invasive imaging evaluation presented in the following chapters is to increase specificity by zzso pain generators from zzso underlying zzso zzso When used with intensive conservative management and zzso testing, this zzso approach has resulted in much better treatment outcomes in our zzso The zzso approach is quite simple, consisting of rigorous correlation of zzso changes demonstrated by zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso and magnetic zzso or invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso nerve root block and facet zzso with the patient's symptoms to evaluate whether the symptoms and the zzso zzso are zzso or zzso Patient symptoms and history are evaluated by use of a pain drawing and information zzso The patient's pain pattern is zzso into a zzso pattern or into one of four recognizable zzso patterns zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Because each spinal zzso is typically zzso primarily via one of the four symptom zzso the distribution of expected symptoms from each zzso feature can be compared with the patient's pain drawing, and an assessment of the significance of zzso zzso can be zzso The patient's presenting symptoms are also used to determine the most cost-effective and zzso use of initial diagnostic imaging zzso In a minority of patients the findings on zzso imaging either will not correlate with the patient's symptoms or will demonstrate multiple abnormalities that could account for the patient's zzso In these patients, invasive techniques are extremely helpful in defining a pain generator or pain zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
