To zzso using resting state zzso functional connectivity zzso the selectivity of involvement of the zzso network in patients with acquired zzso and with zzso zzso peripheral zzso zzso and the correlations of zzso zzso abnormalities with clinical impairment and structural brain zzso zzso associations among zzso networks were also zzso 

zzso zzso scans were acquired from 13 zzso 12 zzso and 18 zzso and zzso healthy zzso Independent component analysis and functional network connectivity were used to investigate zzso zzso within and among zzso networks with potential functional zzso 

Compared to controls, patients had a decreased zzso of the right zzso zzso and an increased zzso zzso of the zzso within the zzso zzso Both decreased and increased zzso zzso also involved the visual and auditory networks, which additionally had an increased zzso of function with the zzso network (more pronounced in zzso zzso zzso modifications in patients extended to several cognitive networks and were correlated with disease zzso In zzso they were also correlated with the severity of clinical impairment and corpus zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso modifications extend beyond the zzso network and involve other sensory and cognitive zzso The correlations between zzso zzso patterns and disease duration in patients as well as with clinical impairment in patients with zzso suggest that modifications of zzso might reflect an zzso zzso which takes time to occur and helps to limit the clinical consequences of peripheral zzso
