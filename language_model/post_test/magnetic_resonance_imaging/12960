zzso effects of nicotine appear to depend on the nature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms, too, may vary depending on the function zzso This functional magnetic resonance imaging study recorded blood oxygen zzso zzso activity in minimally deprived smokers during tasks of simple stimulus zzso selective attention, or divided attention after zzso application of a zzso nicotine (21 zzso or zzso zzso zzso performance in the zzso condition was zzso as compared with matched zzso zzso reduced reaction time zzso in the stimulus detection and selective attention but not divided attention zzso Across all task conditions, nicotine reduced zzso in zzso zzso zzso and visual regions and enhanced zzso in so-called zzso zzso zzso effects correlated with zzso reduction selectively during stimulus zzso An interaction with task condition was observed in middle and superior frontal zzso where nicotine reduced zzso only during stimulus zzso A zzso control experiment provided evidence against zzso effects of zzso In conclusion, although prefrontal activity partly displayed differential zzso by zzso most zzso effects were identical across tasks, despite differential performance effects, suggesting that common zzso mechanisms can selectively benefit different zzso zzso Overall, the effects of nicotine may be explained by increased functional efficiency and zzso zzso zzso zzso
