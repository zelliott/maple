We present a patient with an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region on zzso magnetic resonance images and a thin line of signal void between this region and the zzso on zzso zzso These findings were interpreted initially as representing an zzso spinal zzso However, CT revealed an zzso collection of zzso zzso which was subsequently removed via a zzso zzso The apparent separation of zzso from the zzso zzso on zzso images and interpreted as the zzso was probably caused by chemical shift artifact, chemical shift zzso and/or zzso motion zzso
