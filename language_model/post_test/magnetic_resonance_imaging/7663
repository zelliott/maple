We propose a simple scheme of zzso zzso spin echo zzso with zzso flip angles zzso for obtaining sufficient zzso zzso The low zzso can easily lead spins into a zzso zzso condition, but a preparation scheme is required for smooth transition into zzso zzso For obtaining zzso contrast, zzso preparation is the most important factor, and therefore we focused on the zzso zzso To zzso the zzso contrast in the proposed zzso we compared the following zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and a zzso preparation scheme of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to demonstrate the quality of the proposed zzso we compared the image quality regarding conventional zzso zzso and zzso spin echo zzso A combination of an zzso of zzso and the zzso preparation scheme showed the highest zzso zzso The zzso sequence provided higher contrast and sharper images compared to zzso zzso and it showed contrast and a zzso ratio similar to those of zzso zzso
