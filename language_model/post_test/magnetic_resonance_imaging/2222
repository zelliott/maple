The purpose of the study was to investigate by in zzso and in zzso methods the zzso zzso zzso ratio as an expression of the energy zzso state of human zzso in comparison with zzso skeletal zzso The contents of zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso smooth muscle and zzso zzso zzso from seven term pregnant women were determined in zzso and compared with results obtained in zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso of eight zzso zzso The zzso ratio in the zzso skeletal muscle was about three times higher than that of the zzso The results of the in zzso biopsy part of the study and the in zzso zzso part zzso with each zzso In the zzso both zzso and zzso zzso were significantly lower in the zzso than in the zzso muscle, but the difference for zzso was more zzso accounting for the significantly lower zzso ratio in the zzso smooth zzso The energy zzso pattern of zzso smooth muscle differs from that of zzso skeletal muscle regarding the contents of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso This in zzso finding is the first report on human smooth muscle using zzso
