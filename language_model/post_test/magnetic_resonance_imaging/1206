To measure spatial and zzso variations in zzso fluid zzso flow through the cardiac cycle and throughout the zzso space at magnetic resonance zzso imaging in volunteer subjects with no known zzso or spinal problems and in patients with zzso I zzso 

A zzso zzso MR technique was used to acquire images at 14 time points evenly spaced through the cardiac cycle in 10 volunteers and eight patients with zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso were displayed as zzso and spatial plots and examined for zzso differences between flow anterior and flow zzso to the spinal cord, zzso zzso flow, and zzso of the zzso flow and zzso flow in each zzso Indexes for flow zzso zzso zzso flow, and preferential flow direction were zzso and differences between the patient and volunteer groups were tested for significance with a zzso test of the zzso 

In volunteers, zzso zzso peaked in two regions in the anterior zzso zzso zzso Patients had greater zzso of flow than zzso They had substantially increased flow zzso in the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso flow was seen in six of the patients and in none of the zzso zzso flow in the jets or zzso zzso zzso proportion of zzso and zzso flow in the anterior compartment zzso zzso for zzso and the fraction of zzso with flow zzso zzso zzso differed significantly between patients and zzso 

zzso flow in symptomatic patients with zzso I zzso unlike that in volunteer subjects, is characterized by flow jets, regions with a preponderance of flow in one direction, and zzso zzso zzso
