zzso overt zzso in adults zzso is a unique form of zzso that develops during childhood and zzso symptoms during zzso The aim of the present study was to analyze the specific zzso characteristics of zzso 

The specific diagnostic criteria for zzso include severe zzso in adults that is associated with zzso measuring more than two standard zzso in head circumference and/or zzso evidence of a significantly expanded or destroyed zzso zzso Twenty patients who fulfilled these criteria, 14 males and six zzso were zzso zzso These patients' ages at diagnosis ranged from 15 to 61 years zzso zzso zzso All had symptoms and/or signs indicating that zzso first occurred at birth or during infancy in the absence of any known underlying zzso The authors performed a zzso study that included specific variations of magnetic resonance zzso imaging, such as zzso inversion recovery and zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso three-dimensional computerized zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso was caused by zzso zzso in all zzso Severe zzso involving the lateral and third zzso was associated with a marked expansion or destruction of the zzso zzso in 17 zzso zzso zzso imaging did not reveal any significant movements of zzso fluid in the zzso zzso CT zzso confirmed that the expanded third zzso zzso into the zzso and, sometimes, extended a zzso Fourteen patients revealed symptoms and signs that indicated increased zzso with prominent pressure zzso zzso or mental zzso was seen in 11 patients, gait zzso in 12, and urinary zzso in zzso all three of these symptoms were observed in seven zzso Thirteen patients experienced visual zzso Nine patients underwent zzso shunt zzso as the initial treatment, leading to zzso zzso zzso in all seven cases in which a differential pressure valve was zzso Nine patients, three of whom were initially treated by shunt placement, underwent a zzso zzso mainly for third zzso zzso zzso returned to normal, and marked zzso zzso movements at the site of zzso were recognized on zzso imaging in patients treated zzso However, the zzso was little zzso zzso all patients eventually demonstrated improvement in response to either a shunt equipped with a zzso valve or an zzso zzso however, depression appeared in six patients, who required psychiatric consultation or zzso 

Such remarkably decreased zzso compliance but relatively high zzso dynamics are the zzso characteristics of zzso The therapeutic regimen should be determined based on the zzso specific zzso zzso
