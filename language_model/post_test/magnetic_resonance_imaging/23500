zzso zzso dominant zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso is considered a genetic form of zzso disease causing zzso zzso A relevant role of zzso injury was recently proposed to explain disability and cognitive decline in this zzso The retinal nerve fiber layer zzso is the only part of the brain where zzso zzso can be zzso and zzso in zzso Their assessment may be an easily zzso marker of neurodegenerative zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso zzso in zzso by measuring zzso thickness and zzso it with zzso measures of global and regional cerebral zzso 

zzso thickness was measured using optical zzso zzso in 17 zzso zzso Average values per zzso zzso superior, zzso zzso and overall values were compared with those of normal zzso and zzso zzso Data of 13 patients were analyzed for correlations with zzso global and regional brain volumes zzso for head zzso 

zzso thickness was significantly reduced in zzso patients with respect to controls zzso zzso zzso No significant correlations were found between zzso thinning and brain zzso 

zzso thinning suggests that retinal zzso loss occurs in zzso even in the absence of zzso visual zzso
