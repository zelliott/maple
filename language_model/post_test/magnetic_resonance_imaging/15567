To zzso evaluate the clinical, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging findings of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso fatty liver disease zzso 

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study; the need for patient informed consent was zzso zzso zzso and imaging findings were zzso evaluated in 22 men zzso age, zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso CT and MR images were reviewed for zzso features such as tumor size, margins, zzso and degree of zzso 

zzso diabetes, and hypertension were common findings and were observed in 12 zzso 14 zzso and 13 zzso of the 22 patients, zzso The serum zzso level was elevated in eight patients zzso All patients had zzso evidence of zzso zzso was zzso in seven patients, moderately differentiated in 11, and poorly differentiated in zzso Large tumors zzso diameter, zzso zzso were depicted at CT and/or MR imaging in all zzso zzso patients had a solitary or dominant zzso At imaging, tumor margins were well defined in 17 patients, with a smooth surface in 17, and there was evidence of a tumor capsule in zzso zzso was depicted in 16 zzso There was no evidence of zzso central scar, fat, or abdominal zzso CT was performed in 20 zzso zzso was zzso on zzso CT scans in 14 patients, zzso zzso in the zzso phase in 20, and zzso in the portal phase in zzso MR imaging was performed in 16 zzso zzso was zzso compared with liver zzso at zzso MR imaging in all 16 patients, zzso at zzso imaging in 14, zzso zzso at zzso phase zzso imaging in 16, and zzso at portal phase zzso imaging in zzso 

zzso in patients with zzso is more likely to manifest as a large solitary or dominant mass characterized by smooth and possibly zzso margins, zzso and zzso
