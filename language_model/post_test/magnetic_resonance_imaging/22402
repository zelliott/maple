zzso response to blood borne drugs is critically dependent on the efficiency of vascular delivery and zzso zzso However, increased tumor zzso fluid pressure zzso forms a barrier to zzso transfer, leading to resistance to drug zzso We present here a new, zzso method which estimates zzso and its spatial distribution in zzso using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso This method was tested in zzso human zzso lung cancer which exhibited a high zzso of approximately 28 zzso zzso and, for comparison, in zzso zzso human breast tumors which exhibited a lower zzso of approximately 14 zzso zzso both implanted in nude zzso The zzso protocol consisted of slow infusion of the contrast agent zzso acid zzso into the blood for approximately 2 hours, sequential acquisition of images before and during the infusion, and zzso of zzso relaxation rates before infusion and after blood and tumor zzso concentration reached a steady zzso Image analysis yielded zzso images of zzso tissue zzso concentration with high values of this concentration outside the tumor zzso approximately 1 zzso declining in the tumor periphery to approximately zzso zzso and then steeply decreasing to low or zzso zzso The distribution of zzso tissue zzso concentration reflected the distribution of zzso showing an increase from the rim inward, with a high zzso plateau inside the zzso The changes outside the borders of the tumors with high zzso were indicative of zzso transport through the zzso This work presents a zzso method for assessing the spatial distribution of tumor zzso and mapping barriers to drug delivery and zzso
