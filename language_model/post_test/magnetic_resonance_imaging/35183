To assess the use of visual evoked zzso zzso for the in zzso detection of impaired visual function in a zzso model of multiple zzso The sensitivity of the zzso recordings was determined by comparison with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso were recorded in six healthy zzso monkeys in response to zzso zzso Experimental zzso zzso zzso was induced in four of the six zzso Clinical scores were assessed daily, and zzso were recorded every second zzso In zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of the brains and zzso nerves were performed at the end of the zzso 

After induction of zzso all four zzso exhibited clinical signs between day 26 and 38 after zzso zzso were normal during the induction phase of the disease, but deteriorated in zzso with the occurrence of clinical symptoms in all zzso zzso revealed bilateral zzso zzso and signal zzso in the zzso tracts and zzso zzso white matter in two of the zzso In the remaining two animals, zzso detected signal zzso in the zzso zzso white zzso zzso results were zzso with the zzso zzso 

zzso are an easily accessible zzso tool for measuring visual function and diagnosing impairment of the visual zzso in a zzso zzso zzso
