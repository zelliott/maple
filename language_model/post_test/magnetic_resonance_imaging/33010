The significance of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is still not well zzso zzso in the present study we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso in a larger series of patients with zzso zzso zzso over a zzso period using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Of 215 children who had undergone surgery for zzso zzso 89 cases zzso zzso had zzso prior to zzso All zzso were screened for zzso zzso 

Only one patient zzso zzso with isolated zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso which was defined as a zzso zzso descent greater than 5 zzso below the zzso zzso However, no clinical symptoms were associated with zzso zzso in this zzso 

As zzso zzso is more likely to be associated with zzso zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso a general use of zzso as a screening tool for zzso zzso should not be recommended for patients with zzso zzso who lack clinical zzso
