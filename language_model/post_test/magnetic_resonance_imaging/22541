To monitor lung motion in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after chemotherapy zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso dynamic zzso zzso in comparison with zzso 

Twenty-two patients with zzso were examined before zzso as well as after 3 and 6 zzso cycles (3 months and 6 zzso using zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 slab zzso zzso using parallel imaging in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso lung dimensions zzso and lung volumes zzso were zzso separated into the zzso and zzso zzso Vital capacity zzso was measured for comparison using zzso 

Using zzso technique, there was a significant difference between the zzso and the zzso zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso and after 3 zzso cycles zzso zzso zzso whereas difference was not significant in the second zzso In the zzso zzso mobility increased significantly from the status before versus after 3 zzso cycles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Using zzso technique, at maximum zzso the volume of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso L and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L before zzso In the follow-up zzso these volumes changed to zzso zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso there was no significant change in VC zzso zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is capable of monitoring changes in lung motion and zzso in patients with zzso not detected by global zzso Thus, zzso is proposed for use as a further measure of therapy zzso
