The ability to evaluate the cerebral zzso structure and function is crucial for investigating pathological processes in brain zzso Previous zzso methods based on blood oxygen zzso zzso contrast offer appropriate zzso of the cerebral zzso but these methods remain to be zzso in order to extract more comprehensive zzso This study aimed to integrate the advantages of zzso zzso in both structural and functional vascular zzso The zzso contrast was manipulated by a zzso challenge, and signal changes in zzso images were zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso a functional index representing the regional cerebral blood volume was derived by zzso the zzso values of a given region to those of zzso zzso of the zzso This method is named zzso gas zzso zzso zzso The advantages of using zzso gas zzso to observe the zzso include the ability to distinguish zzso zzso a high zzso contrast, and not being affected by damage to the zzso zzso A stroke model was used to demonstrate the ability of zzso gas zzso to provide information about zzso zzso at 3 days after zzso However, this technique has some limitations that cannot be overcome and hence should be considered when it is applied, such as magnifying vessel sizes and predominantly revealing zzso zzso
