To prevent left kidney organ exposure, an zzso of the left kidney into the right zzso zzso was zzso An zzso of the kidney was initially zzso 

zzso a zzso zzso showed a normal function of both zzso allowing sufficient zzso treatment zzso Target volume coverage was easily obtained using a combination of zzso zzso and a sequential boost by an zzso zzso 

In difficult individual treatment situations, surgical zzso as well as organ zzso might be useful in reducing zzso organ dose zzso
