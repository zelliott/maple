A critical feature of higher cognitive functioning is the capacity to zzso tailor information processing and behaviors to current zzso zzso Recent zzso models have been zzso to account for the dynamic nature of human executive processing by zzso two zzso cognitive control zzso proactive and zzso zzso These may involve partially zzso but temporally distinct neural zzso in the prefrontal zzso Prior brain imaging studies exploring proactive control have mainly used tasks requiring only information about zzso to be retained over zzso zzso Whether proactive control can also be zzso to facilitate performance in more complex working memory tasks, in which concurrent processing of intervening items and updating is mandatory during contextual cue maintenance remains an open zzso To examine this issue and to zzso the extent to which overlapping neural zzso zzso proactive and zzso control we used zzso and a modified verbal zzso paradigm with embedded cues zzso of zzso zzso This task requires context information to be retained over multiple intervening zzso We found that performance improved with zzso cues predicting forthcoming zzso despite increased working memory zzso zzso dynamics of zzso in the right inferior frontal zzso suggest flexible switching between proactive and zzso control in a zzso fashion, with greater sustained responses zzso in the zzso task involving context maintenance of cue information and greater transient responses zzso in the zzso task absent of zzso
