Major depressive disorder zzso is associated with a zzso processing bias in the zzso toward face stimuli portraying sad expressions that is evident even when such stimuli are presented below the level of conscious zzso The extended functional anatomical network that maintains this response bias has not been established, zzso 

To identify neural network differences in the zzso response to implicitly presented facial expressions between depressed and healthy control zzso 

zzso participants with zzso zzso and healthy controls zzso zzso underwent functional zzso as they viewed face stimuli showing sad, happy or neutral face expressions, presented using a backward masking zzso The zzso dependent zzso signal was measured to identify regions where the zzso response to the emotionally zzso stimuli differed between zzso 

The zzso subjects showed greater zzso responses than the controls to zzso versus zzso faces in the zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso While viewing both zzso and zzso faces relative to zzso faces, the depressed subjects showed greater zzso responses than the controls in a network that included the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso and anterior zzso zzso 

zzso and healthy participants showed distinct zzso responses to zzso and zzso faces in neural circuits known to support the processing of emotionally zzso stimuli and to integrate the sensory and zzso aspects of emotional zzso zzso function within these networks in zzso may establish and maintain zzso differences in the zzso of zzso zzso such that attention is biased toward negative and away from positive zzso
