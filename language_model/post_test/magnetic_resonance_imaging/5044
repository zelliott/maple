zzso of the zzso nerves and their zzso is critical in clinical practice, medical research and zzso However to our best knowledge, a comprehensive source capturing full three-dimensional zzso relationships of the zzso nerves along with surrounding zzso is not yet zzso This work addresses the construction and validation of an zzso of the zzso nerves with their zzso correlated with surface zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso The zzso is zzso zzso zzso detailed, fully zzso completely labeled, consistent in zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso geometrical model of the 12 pairs of zzso nerves with zzso was created from an in zzso magnetic resonance scan exploiting in-house developed tools and methods, including zzso and zzso zzso interactive editing, and mesh zzso This virtual model contains zzso objects with 121 different names, labeled based on zzso zzso The model was integrated with a zzso zzso of structure, zzso and tracts developed earlier, and correlated with zzso magnetic resonance zzso The whole model or its components can be zzso zzso zzso zzso and add or removed with a simple few zzso The studied material can be zzso selected in an in-depth manner by using controls available in the user zzso This zzso is potentially useful for anatomy browsing, user zzso automatic student assessment, preparing materials, and zzso in clinical zzso
