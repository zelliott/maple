A new pulse sequence for fast zzso zzso mapping is zzso This method is based on calculating zzso from spin echo zzso and zzso echo zzso images obtained with different degrees of zzso zzso and uses the zzso acquisition scheme of the fast phase acquisition of composite echoes zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso technique, the two echoes are sampled zzso Experimental comparisons confirm that the new sequence layout overcomes most of the zzso zzso such as its motion sensitivity and the need for a fully complex data zzso Moreover, this method offers a higher precision for long zzso values and a further reduction of acquisition zzso
