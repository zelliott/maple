The objective of our study was to evaluate the success rate for zzso zzso of zzso tumors and to determine the risk of serious zzso 

No serious complications occurred after 27 zzso zzso zzso sessions in 22 zzso In total, no residual tumor was detected on follow-up zzso CT or zzso zzso months zzso 7 zzso after final tumor zzso in 20 zzso of 22 zzso Two patients with residual viable tumor deferred further zzso Complete tumor zzso was achieved after a single treatment session in zzso of patients, and in zzso of patients after subsequent zzso zzso zzso was the major zzso for achieving tumor zzso with a single session of zzso with all 11 tumors 3 zzso or smaller being completely zzso after one zzso zzso location, zzso and the presence of zzso disease did not correlate with treatment zzso zzso CT performed immediately after zzso is reliable to exclude residual viable zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumors is safe and has a high rate of success in the treatment of small zzso tumors, with no evidence of recurrence at midterm follow-up of treated zzso
