zzso zzso zzso are an increasing problem and investigation of these zzso can be fraught with zzso There is currently no gold standard for diagnosis or zzso This review was undertaken to determine the present reliability of the zzso assessment of zzso potential and diagnosis of pancreatic zzso zzso using available imaging zzso 

A zzso search using the terms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Publications were screened to include studies examining the performance of CT, zzso zzso zzso and zzso PET in the determination of benign or zzso zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso 

zzso studies were identified that met the inclusion zzso zzso PET had a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso and an accuracy of zzso in determining benign versus zzso zzso CT had a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso in determining benign disease but had an accuracy of making a specific diagnosis of zzso zzso had a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso in assessing main pancreatic duct zzso 

CT is a good quality initial investigation to be used in conjunction with clinical zzso zzso can add useful information regarding zzso communication but should be used zzso PET may have a role in zzso cases to determine zzso Further examination of zzso in this patient group is zzso
