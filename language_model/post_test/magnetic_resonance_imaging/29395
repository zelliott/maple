Over the past 15 years, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso has vaulted to the forefront as the ideal diagnostic zzso for the evaluation of both left and right zzso zzso The accumulated literature supports this contention for the left zzso However, for the right zzso typically poorly zzso accurately by traditional imaging techniques, zzso has emerged as the test of zzso Although earlier zzso sequences have become even more zzso resulting in further improvements in spatial and zzso resolution, zzso has avidly remained the gold zzso Yet, these attributes that have so benefited investigations of the zzso need not be so zzso In this review, we discuss recent applications of zzso to the study of zzso demonstrating the potential for further advances in our understanding of zzso
