The possibility that zzso zzso in patients with poorly controlled zzso may produce zzso damage and contribute to progressive functional and cognitive declines observed in some patients with zzso has major clinical and therapeutic implications for urgency of treatment and effective intervention to achieve complete zzso 

Advances in magnetic resonance imaging techniques, technical and conceptual advances in experimental analysis of zzso death at the cellular and molecular level, and long-term zzso observations have provided substantial new data and insights into phenomena of zzso plasticity in neural zzso that address the question zzso zzso zzso damage the zzso 

The emerging perspective is that zzso damage should be regarded not only as zzso loss but as adverse long-term behavioral and cognitive zzso This perspective provides a strong rationale for development of zzso treatments to zzso adverse long-term consequences of repeated seizures, and for the importance of zzso effective intervention that achieves complete seizure zzso
