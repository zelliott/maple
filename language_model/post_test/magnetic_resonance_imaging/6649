In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated how people solve zzso equivalent problems presented in two alternative zzso zzso story format or zzso equation zzso Although representation format had no effect on behavior, anterior prefrontal zzso was greater in the story condition and zzso zzso zzso was greater in the equation zzso These results show that there exist alternative neural pathways that implement different and yet equally efficient problem-solving zzso
