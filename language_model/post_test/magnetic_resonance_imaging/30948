We report on a patient with the combination of a zzso and a zzso spinal zzso which zzso zzso The clinical course and diagnostic steps reveal important observations helpful in the management of this zzso 

A zzso male patient presented with a six-month history of progressive weakness of the lower zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed zzso and zzso spinal veins of the lower zzso spinal zzso Spinal zzso confirmed the diagnosis of spinal zzso zzso at level zzso on the zzso The patient underwent surgery and the zzso was surgically zzso Two months after initial improvement, the clinical symptoms of lower limb weakness zzso On zzso a spinal zzso zzso was found at level zzso that was not apparent on the previous zzso and on the zzso control zzso The patient underwent surgery again, and the second zzso was also zzso The clinical symptoms subsequently zzso 

The interesting point in this case was the rare combination of a zzso and a zzso spinal zzso They presented zzso and could not be identified simultaneously on the first zzso Only after closure of the first zzso did the second become zzso We believe that this may be a result of a zzso pressure change in the zzso system of the zzso After closure of the first zzso the zzso zzso shunt of the second zzso developed zzso The possibility of a second zzso should be considered in the presence of persistent zzso of the zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso and subsequent clinical zzso
