To compare zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso with zzso guided by zzso acid zzso zzso in patients with zzso and to evaluate the impact of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

From January 2005 to February 2009, 33 patients with zzso (6 with World Health Organization zzso grade II, 7 with WHO grade III, 20 with WHO grade zzso who underwent zzso with zzso and received zzso by the same zzso were investigated zzso In 19 patients, operations were performed using a combination of zzso with zzso zzso zzso All patients were subjected to zzso zzso zzso to confirm the extent of zzso 

Of 33 patients with zzso 21 (4 with WHO grade III and 17 with WHO grade zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso Surgery with zzso zzso was performed in 10 of the 21 patients, and the average zzso rate was zzso The average zzso rate of patients who underwent surgery without zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was not detected in 12 patients (6 with WHO grade II, 3 with WHO grade III, and 3 with WHO grade zzso with zzso Surgery with zzso zzso was performed in 9 of 12 patients, and the average zzso rate was zzso The average zzso rate of patients who underwent surgery without zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso resulted in a better zzso rate in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a powerful tool to treat zzso zzso zzso zzso low zzso and zzso is useful for high-grade zzso The combination of zzso zzso and zzso has a synergistic effect in zzso zzso Additionally, precise tumor grading in zzso imaging studies can be zzso Surgery for zzso should be performed using both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
