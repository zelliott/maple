Based on recent findings of zzso zzso in the corpus zzso zzso in 3 individuals after nonfatal high-altitude cerebral zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso in the brain after high-altitude exposure are specific for zzso and remain zzso over many zzso 

This was a zzso study involving 37 zzso in 4 groups: 10 had experienced zzso 8 high-altitude pulmonary zzso 11 severe acute mountain zzso and 8 had climbed to zzso zzso m without developing any high-altitude zzso zzso was defined as zzso zzso assistance with walking and/or decreased zzso Within zzso to 38 months after the qualifying incident, zzso of the brain was performed using a zzso scanner and high-resolution zzso magnetic resonance sequences for detection of zzso zzso which were zzso by a zzso 

zzso zzso located in the zzso of the zzso were found in 8 subjects and questionable zzso were found in 2 subjects 1 to 35 months after zzso They were located outside the zzso in 5 more severe zzso zzso remained unchanged in those zzso after 12 to 50 zzso A few unequivocal zzso in the zzso of the zzso were found in one subject after severe acute mountain zzso while one subject with high-altitude pulmonary zzso and 2 of the extreme altitude zzso had questionable zzso In all other subjects, zzso were unequivocally zzso 

zzso zzso by zzso zzso predominantly in the zzso of the zzso are long-lasting zzso of zzso
