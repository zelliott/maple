zzso zzso zzso implants have been used since the zzso More recently, synthetic zzso zzso implants have been used, in both primary and secondary zzso zzso zzso The implant may be drilled and zzso if required, after adequate zzso of the implant has zzso In this study we evaluated the clinical results and zzso of synthetic zzso zzso zzso 

Twelve consecutive patients who had synthetic zzso zzso implants were evaluated clinically and 8 of these patients had zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans with intravenous zzso performed at least 9 months zzso to assess zzso of the zzso Six patients had primary zzso implants at the time of zzso and 6 patients had secondary zzso 

No significant complications occurred following zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso All patients reported zzso satisfaction with the results of zzso zzso scans revealed zzso enhancement in 3 of the 4 patients receiving primary zzso All patients with secondary implants and 1 patients who had a primary implant had moderate to large areas of poor enhancement in the zzso 

zzso zzso implants gave good clinical results but variable zzso occurs, especially with secondary zzso
