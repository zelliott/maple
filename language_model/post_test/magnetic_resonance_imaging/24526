A new neurological zzso the zzso was developed to provide a relative measurement of zzso which permits a zzso technique to detect and zzso zzso in zzso drainage systems and, thus, to identify mechanical damage to shunt zzso The zzso of this device can be used to administer medication or a contrast agent, to extract cerebral spinal fluid zzso and with the possibility of directly measuring zzso The zzso was evaluated to identify possible zzso issues at zzso and zzso 

Standard testing techniques were zzso to evaluate magnetic field interactions zzso zzso attraction and zzso zzso heating, and artifacts at zzso for the zzso In addition, 12 samples of the zzso underwent testing to determine if the function of these devices was affected by zzso to various zzso conditions at zzso and zzso 

zzso field interactions for the zzso were not zzso The heating results indicated a highest temperature rise of zzso zzso which poses no patient zzso zzso were relatively small in relation to the size and shape of the zzso but may interfere zzso if the area of interest is near the zzso All devices were unaffected by zzso to zzso conditions at zzso and zzso 

When specific guidelines are followed, the zzso is zzso zzso for patients undergoing zzso examinations at zzso or zzso
