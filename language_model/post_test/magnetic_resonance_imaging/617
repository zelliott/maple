Progress in the treatment of zzso with drugs is making it necessary to improve the prediction of the outcome of zzso zzso 

We evaluated clinical, hormonal and zzso zzso based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso of surgical outcome in patients with zzso 

This retrospective analysis included 125 consecutive patients investigated for zzso in a single zzso unit since the use of zzso imaging began zzso zzso of these patients zzso zzso underwent zzso surgery and were investigated before and after surgery in our zzso A zzso unaware of the surgical outcome analyzed the results of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso and 59% based on mean zzso zzso concentration under zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerance test zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso concentration normal for age and sex zzso In zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso concentration used as the criterion for zzso young age zzso high zzso concentration before surgery zzso high zzso zzso concentration before surgery zzso and high zzso zzso before surgery zzso were zzso of poor zzso The following results in standardized zzso analysis were associated with a higher probability of not being zzso zzso greater than 15 zzso in diameter zzso zzso extension zzso zzso extension zzso and invasive zzso zzso according to zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso extension showed that stages above B2 zzso zzso extension with sign of invasion of the space below the carotid zzso were associated with a lower probability of zzso normal zzso plasma levels zzso In zzso analysis, age, zzso hormonal levels and zzso size remained the major zzso of surgical zzso 

This report provides the first evidence that detailed zzso analysis of zzso size, location and potential invasion, together with zzso clinical and hormonal zzso can be used for the prediction of hormonal outcome after zzso surgery for zzso
