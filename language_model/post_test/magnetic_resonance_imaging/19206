One of the major current challenges related to juvenile idiopathic inflammatory zzso is the search for highly sensitive and specific zzso methods for diagnosis as well as for zzso 

The aim of our study was to describe typical magnetic resonance imaging findings and to investigate the usefulness of this method in detecting active muscle disease in juvenile zzso and juvenile systemic lupus zzso zzso 

zzso study, blinded zzso 

University referral unit zzso zzso section, Department of Pediatrics, zzso Federal de zzso Paulo zzso zzso zzso de zzso 

Thirteen patients (9 zzso with zzso as well as 13 patients (12 zzso with juvenile systemic lupus zzso and 10 normal children (5 zzso were enrolled in the zzso 

zzso and quantitative analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed and evaluated by two zzso blinded to all clinical zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso was used in all zzso zzso 

The different muscle groups presented zzso involvement in the zzso The patients with zzso presented acute and chronic muscular zzso while those with lupus presented only chronic zzso especially zzso In the zzso group, the major zzso were found in the zzso and zzso regions zzso intensity and fat zzso The signal intensity was increased in all acute zzso 

The qualitative and quantitative resonance analyses are useful in detecting clinically active disease in patients with zzso
