zzso germ cell tumors zzso originating in the zzso zzso are zzso The authors investigated factors related to the diagnosis of these zzso as well as outcome in order to help decrease the time to diagnosis and improve treatment zzso 

The authors reviewed the clinical features of 142 cases of zzso zzso in their zzso Fourteen cases of zzso zzso zzso were zzso The symptoms, zzso findings, delay between symptom onset and diagnosis or treatment, initial and further treatment, and outcome were zzso

Early diagnosis requires MR imaging with administration of contrast medium in young patients presenting with motor weakness and/or precocious zzso zzso zzso studies should be performed if any tiny zzso is detected in the zzso zzso Since insufficient treatment resulted in early zzso radiation therapy with adequate dose and field is zzso
