zzso of the radio frequency zzso field B1 leads to intensity variations in MR images and to spatial dependence of spectral line zzso In this paper, a simple method of measuring the B1 field components of an zzso linear zzso is zzso The method is designed for the coils operating up to 20 zzso The B1 field distribution is replaced by the zzso magnetic field caused by DC current flowing through the zzso The technique involves rotating the zzso 90 degrees so that measured B1 component is aligned with zzso and measuring the shift of resonance frequency using a zzso imaging zzso Experimental results were in good agreement with the theoretical zzso
