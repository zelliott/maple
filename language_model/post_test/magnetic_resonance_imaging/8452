There are limitations to currently available zzso tests for zzso Our objective was to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a novel tandem mass zzso zzso for the measurement of zzso urinary zzso in patients suspected to have a zzso We also developed clinically based zzso for zzso of this zzso 

We examined the medical records of zzso patients (including 102 patients with a zzso zzso who underwent measurement of zzso urinary zzso zzso using tandem mass zzso as well as adrenal imaging at Mayo zzso zzso The zzso for zzso were defined as zzso total zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso were zzso 

The diagnostic efficacy was as zzso zzso fraction sensitivity zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso fraction sensitivity zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso fraction sensitivity zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso Areas under the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso for total zzso and zzso zzso for a zzso zzso curve incorporating both the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso urinary zzso zzso by a tandem mass zzso zzso appears to be an effective zzso technique in the investigation of zzso
