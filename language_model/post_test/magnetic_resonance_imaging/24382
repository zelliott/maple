zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso significant logistical advantages over direct zzso and does not require zzso zzso In this study, we determined the diagnostic performance of zzso in relation to conventional zzso and zzso or surgery in detecting tears of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso tears in a standard clinical zzso 

zzso symptomatic patients underwent conventional zzso and zzso of the affected shoulder, followed by either zzso or open zzso The scans were interpreted independently by two experienced zzso consultants with a special interest in musculoskeletal zzso Using the surgical findings as the standard of reference, sensitivity, zzso and diagnostic accuracy of conventional zzso zzso and zzso in the detection of zzso tears were zzso 

The sensitivity of zzso was 95 and zzso respectively, for two zzso as opposed to 79 and zzso for conventional zzso For both zzso the specificity of zzso as well as zzso was zzso for detection of zzso tears of all zzso zzso of diagnosis was 93 and zzso respectively, for two zzso with indirect zzso compared to 84 and zzso with zzso zzso 

This retrospective study shows that zzso is a highly accurate and sensitive method for the detection of zzso zzso The data obtained supports the use of zzso as standard practice in patients with shoulder instability due to suspected zzso pathology where further investigative imaging is zzso
