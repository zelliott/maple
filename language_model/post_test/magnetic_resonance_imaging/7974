zzso zzso imaging zzso has become a useful tool for investigating early white matter zzso abnormalities in motor zzso zzso Furthermore, fiber tracking packages that apply zzso zzso such as zzso imaging zzso have been proposed as alternative approaches to overcome zzso limitations in depicting fiber tracts with different zzso within the same zzso We explored motor and zzso zzso tract abnormalities in zzso zzso zzso lateral sclerosis zzso cases aiming to establish a consistent zzso zzso signature of zzso We performed a zzso zzso zzso spatial statistics analysis with deterministic zzso of zzso body and zzso of corpus zzso zzso and zzso tracts zzso in 20 ALS patients (12 classical and 8 lower motor zzso zzso compared to 20 healthy zzso Mean tract zzso fiber volume and density, and generalized fractional zzso were extracted and related to clinical zzso of zzso impairment zzso motor zzso zzso disease disability zzso functional rating zzso and zzso ALS patients showed significantly decreased fiber density and volume, and increased tract length in all regions of zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso body, zzso impairment was zzso correlated to fiber density zzso zzso zzso while in zzso zzso clinical disability zzso zzso zzso and progression zzso zzso zzso were zzso correlated to tract zzso Our findings further suggest that zzso zzso might represent a promising approach for investigating structural zzso in neurodegenerative diseases and confirm that zzso involvement is a consistent feature of most ALS zzso significantly related to both zzso dysfunction and disease zzso
