Despite the essential role of the brain energy generated from zzso zzso in supporting cortical zzso activity and brain function, it is challenging to zzso image and directly zzso the energy expenditure in the human zzso In this study, we applied an advanced in zzso MRS imaging approach to obtain regional cerebral zzso rates of zzso zzso reactions zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and to determine zzso and zzso in pure gray mater zzso and white mater zzso zzso It was found that both zzso and zzso rates are three times higher in zzso than zzso and zzso is seven times higher than zzso in zzso and zzso Among the total brain zzso consumption in the human cortical zzso and zzso zzso of them are used by zzso in which approximately zzso is by zzso A single cortical zzso zzso approximately zzso billion zzso per second in a resting human zzso This study demonstrates the unique utility of in zzso MRS imaging zzso for direct imaging of brain energy generated from zzso zzso and provides new insights into the human brain zzso and its role in supporting zzso activity and brain zzso
