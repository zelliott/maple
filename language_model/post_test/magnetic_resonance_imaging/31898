To make sense of a sentence, we must zzso zzso and zzso relationships between its zzso and arguments and evaluate the resulting zzso meaning against any preceding context and our real-world zzso Recent zzso studies suggest that, in comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso breakfast the boys would zzso zzso zzso violated zzso zzso zzso breakfast the eggs would zzso and zzso violated zzso zzso zzso breakfast the boys would zzso evoke a similar neural zzso This response is distinct from that evoked by zzso that only violate real-world knowledge zzso zzso breakfast the boys would zzso Here we used zzso to examine the zzso regions engaged in response to these three zzso zzso violations, relative to other sentence types, led to increased activity within the left anterior inferior frontal cortex, reflecting zzso increased and prolonged efforts to retrieve semantic knowledge about the likelihood of events occurring in the real zzso In contrast, zzso zzso violations of the actions depicted by the central zzso engaged a zzso zzso zzso network known to mediate the execution and comprehension of zzso zzso We suggest that the recruitment of this network reflected a zzso zzso process that involved an attempt to determine whether the actions described by the zzso could be executed by their zzso zzso zzso this network was also activated to zzso violations between the zzso and their subject zzso zzso Our findings support the pattern of zzso findings in suggesting zzso that a clear division within the semantic system plays out during sentence zzso and zzso that zzso and zzso violations of zzso within simple active sentences are treated similarly by the zzso
