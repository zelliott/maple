Early detection of zzso cancer remains crucial for improving patient survival zzso However, zzso disease is often zzso and population screening is currently zzso zzso masses may be zzso zzso but most are identified at zzso zzso in patients who are zzso and most may be characterized as benign or zzso zzso are available to estimate the risk of zzso on the basis of clinical and US zzso However, zzso masses remain indeterminate in some cases, with some benign zzso demonstrating features of zzso at zzso In these cases, use of magnetic resonance zzso imaging improves the ability to characterize zzso masses and reduces the number of indeterminate zzso zzso the likelihood of zzso on the basis of imaging features is important to the zzso detection of early zzso cancer and profoundly influences referral and management zzso Conventional and contrast zzso MR imaging are used to evaluate zzso features, including zzso complexity, signal intensity, and enhancement of solid zzso At dynamic zzso MR imaging with zzso analysis, early enhancement characteristics may help differentiate some complex benign and zzso zzso zzso imaging has a limited but useful role in evaluating zzso zzso Those with a zzso solid area on both zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso and zzso images are likely benign, whereas those that are zzso on zzso images zzso zzso 1000 zzso with intermediate signal intensity on zzso images are likely zzso
