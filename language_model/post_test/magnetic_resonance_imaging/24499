The diagnostic characteristics of zzso mapping zzso were evaluated in zzso zzso zzso zzso models with the parallel application of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso from the aspect of different zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the left anterior descending coronary artery zzso balloon zzso or zzso deployment in the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso artery zzso zzso zzso was applied zzso in 16 domestic zzso Regional left zzso viability data were captured via zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso value was significantly decreased in segments containing zzso and zzso late enhancement compared with viable segments in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis revealed area under the curve values of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso territory, and zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso territory for the zzso compared with zzso viability results as zzso late enhancement or viable tissue and zzso late enhancement or viable zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso value detected the presence of zzso tissue with differential zzso extent and which represented proper diagnostic features both in the zzso and zzso zzso This data could provide additional benefit in the clinical use of zzso for diagnostic zzso
