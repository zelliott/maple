Studies using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso indicate that zzso acutely depressed patients have decreased levels of zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to use zzso to determine if changes in zzso and frontal cortical zzso levels were present in patients with a history of depression who had recovered and were no longer taking zzso We used zzso to measure levels of zzso in both zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso in zzso fully recovered subjects with a history of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in both zzso and anterior zzso zzso were significantly lower in recovered depressed subjects than healthy zzso Our data provide preliminary evidence that a history of zzso depression is associated with decreased zzso levels in anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso These changes could represent part of the zzso vulnerability to zzso depressive zzso
