Previous zzso zzso studies with healthy, zzso adults reported no significant differences between smokers and zzso on total zzso zzso However, these studies did not specifically test for greater age-related volume loss in the total zzso or zzso zzso in smokers, and did they did not examine relationships between zzso and zzso volumes and episodic learning and memory zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 years of zzso smokers zzso and zzso zzso were compared on total zzso and zzso volumes derived from high-resolution 4 zzso zzso emphasizing testing for greater age-related volume losses in zzso zzso between zzso volumes and measures of episodic learning and memory were zzso 

Smokers showed significantly smaller volumes, as well as greater volume loss with increasing age than zzso in the bilateral total zzso and multiple zzso In smokers, greater zzso were associated with smaller volumes of the total zzso zzso and zzso In the entire zzso performance on measures of learning and memory was related to larger total zzso and several zzso volumes, predominately in the left zzso 

zzso cigarette smoking in this zzso aged cohort was associated with smaller total zzso and zzso volumes, which were exacerbated by advancing zzso zzso also indicated an adverse smoking zzso response zzso zzso with total zzso and select zzso zzso These zzso volume abnormalities in smokers may be related to the deficiencies in episodic learning and memory in zzso smokers reported in previous zzso
