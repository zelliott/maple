zzso induced zzso lead tip heating is one of the main reasons magnetic resonance imaging zzso is zzso for patients with zzso The objective of this work was to evaluate the dependence of zzso lead tip heating during zzso scanning on the electrical zzso of the medium surrounding the zzso lead zzso The effect of zzso was measured using zzso zzso zzso acid, and saline with zzso ranging from 0 to 3 zzso which spans the range of human tissue zzso The maximum lead tip heating observed in zzso acid was zzso zzso at zzso zzso in zzso cellulose the maximum was zzso zzso at zzso zzso and in saline the maximum was zzso zzso at zzso zzso The maximum power transfer zzso was used to calculate the relative power deposited in the solution based on the characteristic zzso of the zzso lead and test solution zzso The results demonstrate a strong correlation between the relative power deposited and zzso lead tip heating for zzso cellulose and saline zzso zzso power deposition occurred when the zzso of the solution matched the zzso lead zzso zzso lead tip heating is dependent upon the electrical zzso of the solution at the lead tip and should be considered when planning in zzso gel or saline zzso
