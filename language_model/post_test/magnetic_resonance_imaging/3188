Our goal was to determine the value of zzso in the assessment of vascular invasion in the zzso staging of pancreatic zzso 

In 53 consecutive patients with an established diagnosis of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso echo images at zzso T were obtained before and after zzso injection of zzso Major zzso vessels were evaluated for the presence of zzso no tumor invasion, zzso zzso with zzso and zzso tumor zzso All patients subsequently underwent zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso studies were compared with the zzso findings in the zzso specimens in 34 cases and with the surgical findings in 19 zzso zzso 

In six patients, zzso examination showed the presence of tumor confined to the zzso with no vascular zzso With zzso five of these cases were correctly zzso in the remaining case, zzso zzso was erroneously zzso In 21 patients, tumor zzso with adjacent vessels was found at zzso zzso At zzso 16 of these cases were correctly zzso and 5 were zzso as tumors confined to the zzso Of the remaining 26 patients, 7 had vascular zzso by tumor at zzso examination of the zzso zzso the other 19 patients had zzso tumors zzso the adjacent vessels at surgical zzso zzso detected vascular zzso in 21 of these 26 zzso in the other 5, tumor zzso was incorrectly zzso The overall accuracy of zzso for determining vascular invasion was zzso 

zzso is a helpful method for zzso assessment of vascular involvement due to pancreatic zzso
