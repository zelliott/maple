It is not known how cerebral vascular zzso affect the function of the surrounding zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso can provide information about normal functional zzso and its zzso by vascular zzso and therapeutic zzso 

We performed zzso studies in 24 patients harboring vascular zzso adjacent to primary zzso zzso and visual zzso The zzso studies consisted of the acquisition of an image time series coupled with functional zzso of zzso zzso or visual zzso in both zzso zzso zzso were identified using frequency domain zzso and their number and zzso location were compared between the affected and unaffected zzso 

Every patient capable of performing the desired task showed functional zzso Eight patients without neurological deficits showed a symmetrical pattern of zzso between the zzso Each had a vascular zzso located one or more zzso from the functional region zzso Three patients showed zzso symmetry in the location of activated zzso but with a marked asymmetry in the number of activated zzso Each zzso vascular zzso located within one zzso of the functional region and showed either subtle or no neurological zzso Eleven patients showed zzso asymmetry in the location of activated zzso In 6, the zzso displacement appeared to be due to a mass effect of the zzso In 5, the zzso occurred at a different zzso zzso and the patients exhibited gross neurological deficit in the respective zzso zzso changes in functional zzso reflected elimination of the mass effect or recovery of clinical zzso 

zzso zzso studies are possible in patients with vascular zzso in brain regions adjacent to primary zzso zzso and visual zzso zzso of the activated region and zzso asymmetry in the number of activated zzso in the functional regions appear to reflect the zzso and zzso impact of the vascular zzso Changes in zzso findings after intervention reflect the consequences of therapy and parallel clinical zzso
