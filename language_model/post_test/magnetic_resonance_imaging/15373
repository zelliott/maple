The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of zzso and a combination of zzso zzso and MR zzso in the diagnosis of tears and cartilage abnormalities of the wrist zzso 

The feasibility of combining zzso zzso and MR zzso and performing them with an zzso contrast solution was evaluated in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso enrolled subjects with suspected wrist ligament tears underwent zzso and a combined zzso and MR zzso zzso Two observers reviewed the images for evidence of tears and cartilage abnormalities of the zzso and zzso ligaments and triangular zzso zzso zzso agreement was determined with zzso statistics, and the diagnostic accuracy of each technique was zzso 

A zzso solution of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and 300 zzso zzso zzso provided adequate contrast enhancement for both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and MR zzso zzso zzso agreement was substantial for zzso zzso zzso zzso and MR zzso zzso zzso zzso and almost perfect for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso zzso and MR zzso for tears of the zzso ligament were 59% and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso for the first observer and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso for the second zzso For tears of the zzso zzso these values were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso for the first observer and 50% and zzso zzso and zzso and 50% and zzso for the second zzso The three techniques appeared equivalent for complete tears of the zzso and zzso ligaments, but partial tears were significantly better zzso with zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso zzso and MR zzso for triangular zzso complex tears were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso for the first observer and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso for the second zzso For cartilage zzso these values were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso for the first observer and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso for the second zzso 

zzso zzso appears more accurate than zzso and MR zzso particularly for discerning partial tears of the zzso and zzso ligaments that do not zzso surgical zzso
