To correlate clinical features, imaging and zzso findings in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the orbit zzso in order to predict long-term zzso 

Clinical features, imaging and zzso findings of three patients with biopsy proven zzso are zzso zzso and clinical features were recorded at presentation and at each zzso imaging was performed as a diagnostic tool and for zzso A biopsy was performed at presentation and subsequently when symptoms zzso zzso specimens were reviewed zzso to corroborate zzso zzso and zzso features were zzso A correlation was made between clinical, imaging and zzso results to identify outcome zzso of zzso locally aggressive behavior and zzso zzso 

All cases presented zzso tumors with locally aggressive behavior over zzso All were women in the fifth decade of zzso zzso induced zzso swelling of the lids and eye displacement at presentation and were diagnosed as other types of zzso tumors before zzso zzso was zzso Mean follow-up was zzso years zzso zzso zzso findings for all cases included a heterogeneous, irregular tumor containing zzso spaces filled with zzso material zzso enhancing with imaging zzso zzso findings included a zzso zzso within the center of the tumor mass, which was not present at primary zzso zzso could not detect specific cellular patterns or zzso markers related to these zzso 

zzso and locally aggressive behavior was better predicted by imaging and surgical findings rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors may suggest zzso transformation over zzso
