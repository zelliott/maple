Various zzso mechanisms of familial zzso zzso have been zzso One hypothesis suggests that overproduction of bone at the zzso is the primary origin of zzso which affects brain and zzso growth zzso through altered zzso pressure zzso zzso Fusion zzso Other hypotheses suggest that decreased zzso base growth or abnormal brain growth are the primary cause of zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso This study was designed to investigate which model best describes zzso changes associated with zzso in a rabbit model through zzso path zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans and zzso pressure zzso were obtained at 10, 25, and 42 days of age from 18 zzso six controls, six with zzso zzso and six with zzso zzso Five variables were collected from each zzso zzso thickness at the affected zzso zzso base zzso brain volume, zzso fluid volume, and zzso zzso This data set was used to test zzso zzso relationships generated by the proposed zzso zzso of fit was measured by experimental group for each zzso 

zzso zzso Fusion Model best explained the variables in both zzso and zzso zzso rabbits zzso of fit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Base Model zzso of fit zzso zzso best explained the data in control zzso 

zzso suggest that the primary site of zzso in zzso rabbits is most likely the zzso zzso Other zzso vault anomalies are most likely secondary zzso zzso zzso of the present study may provide insight regarding the zzso zzso of zzso
