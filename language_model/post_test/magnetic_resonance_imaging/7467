The aim of this work was to zzso and study in zzso and in zzso zzso used as magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agents that accumulate in tumor cells specifically zzso folate zzso 

zzso were prepared by zzso of zzso acid and zzso zzso and were zzso with zzso zzso zzso acid served as a targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso folate receptors were used as a model zzso For in zzso experiments, zzso cells were transplanted under the zzso capsule of zzso zzso 

In zzso results showed the significant zzso of zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that targeting zzso accumulated in zzso The zzso fusion images resulted in the exact zzso of zzso 

The zzso provides a suitable means for the early diagnosis of tumors based on their zzso of folate zzso
