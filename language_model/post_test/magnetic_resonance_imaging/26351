For experimental studies investigating zzso and efficacy of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso an animal model resembling the human situation as closely as possible would be zzso Specifically, zzso tumor growth characteristics with the capability for appropriate in zzso imaging to monitor treatment efficacy are zzso 

Morris zzso zzso was implanted into the liver of 30 zzso zzso zzso growth was followed by zzso zzso zzso 10), ultrasound zzso zzso zzso zzso native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and native magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso 30) between day 8 and day 36 after zzso The zzso zzso characteristics were compared with the zzso and microscopic zzso findings of the zzso zzso 

In all 30 animals a solitary liver tumor was found and zzso no signs of zzso zzso or zzso tumor were zzso On zzso examination tumor sizes ranged between 27 zzso 3 zzso zzso 8) and zzso zzso 79 zzso zzso zzso The first signs of tumor necrosis occurred at day zzso US allowed tumor zzso from day 8, zzso from day 8, zzso from day 10, and CT from day zzso 

The tumor model has the potential to be used for the zzso of tumor growth by zzso and zzso The potential for monitoring therapeutic effects of zzso needs to be zzso
