We studied the early detection of zzso pulmonary injury by magnetic resonance imaging in zzso zzso zzso was induced in ten rats by intravenous injection of zzso at 100 zzso zzso zzso images were acquired in five rats every 30 zzso for 120 zzso after zzso zzso Five rats served as zzso The rats were sacrificed immediately after imaging and examined zzso CT images were also acquired in five rats every 30 zzso for 120 zzso after zzso zzso Five rats served as zzso The rats were sacrificed immediately after imaging, and the zzso ratio of the lung was zzso In zzso images, relative signal intensity from the lung with zzso zzso rose from 30 zzso to 120 zzso and was greater than that from normal lung every zzso In zzso images, there was no statistically significant difference in relative signal intensity of the lung between zzso zzso and the control during 120 zzso In CT images, there was also no statistically significant difference in lung density between zzso zzso and the control during 120 zzso There was no statistically significant difference in the zzso lung ratio between zzso lung and normal zzso In zzso study, mild congestion and zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso These results suggest the potential capability of MR imaging in detecting the early phase of zzso pulmonary zzso
