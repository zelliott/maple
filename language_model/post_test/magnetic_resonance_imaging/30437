zzso zzso span a wide range of spatial and zzso scales that extend beyond traditional clinical zzso Recent research suggests that zzso zzso zzso in the ripple zzso zzso and fast ripple zzso zzso frequency range, may be signatures of zzso brain and involved in the generation of zzso However, most research investigating zzso in humans comes from zzso recordings, whose relationship to standard clinical zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso In this study zzso recordings zzso - zzso zzso were obtained from human zzso zzso lobe using custom depth zzso containing both zzso and clinical zzso zzso and zzso zzso recorded from both zzso and clinical zzso were increased in seizure generating brain regions compared to control zzso The distribution of zzso zzso recorded from the zzso was concentrated in the ripple frequency range, compared to a broad distribution of zzso zzso recorded from zzso The average frequency of ripple zzso recorded from zzso was lower than that recorded from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso rank sum zzso zzso zzso were most often recorded on a single zzso supporting the hypothesis that zzso zzso are primarily generated by highly zzso zzso scale zzso zzso that are most effectively sampled by zzso zzso Future research will address the clinical utility of these recordings for zzso zzso networks and understanding seizure zzso
