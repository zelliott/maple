Our purpose was to evaluate the reliability of zzso case zzso clinical findings, and magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans in zzso the diagnosis of zzso zzso and in predicting clinical outcomes after surgical zzso zzso We studied 19 consecutive patients with zzso proved zzso zzso All had zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was performed when there was zzso pain with zzso zzso and positive findings on zzso zzso Case zzso clinical findings, and findings on zzso scans were correlated with clinical zzso zzso clinical findings including zzso correlated with zzso findings in 11 of 19 patients zzso and zzso scans correlated in 16 of 19 patients zzso Of the 19 patients, zzso achieved satisfactory zzso Neither reliable clinical findings or findings on zzso scans nor confirmation of clinical findings by zzso correlated with a superior result, but zzso of patients with zzso measuring more than 5 zzso in zzso measurement on zzso scans had good zzso only zzso with zzso measuring 5 zzso or less had good zzso zzso zzso and diagnosis of zzso zzso is better achieved with zzso than through clinical zzso A more favorable clinical outcome can be expected after surgical zzso zzso when a zzso zzso has a zzso measurement larger than 5 zzso on zzso zzso
