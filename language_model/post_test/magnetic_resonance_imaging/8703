zzso of the prognosis of comatose survivors after zzso arrest zzso so-called zzso zzso zzso relies on neurological examination zzso Early laboratory indicators of poor prognosis zzso zzso are not sensitive zzso 

We analyzed the results of magnetic resonance zzso imaging with zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso imaging zzso in 22 consecutive patients with zzso Clinical details such as arrest place and zzso time along with neurological examination findings including items of zzso coma scale zzso and the Full zzso of zzso zzso score were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced to determine zzso yield of the parameters zzso 

zzso was classified as zzso zzso zzso Performance zzso 4 or 5) in 16 and zzso zzso score zzso in 6 zzso The lower limit of confidence zzso zzso of the area under the curve zzso of the zzso was higher than zzso for zzso motor and total scores of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso pattern of zzso or zzso cortical involvement, termed as zzso cortical zzso zzso in MR imaging was a very good predictor of poor prognosis with an zzso of zzso of zzso zzso of zzso motor part score and MR was zzso zzso zzso zzso Motor part of the zzso score has a slightly lower sensitivity zzso with zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso of MR to the motor scores zzso zzso or zzso zzso improved sensitivity to 100 % zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso for the combination of MR and zzso motor zzso 

This study provides the preliminary evidence that zzso when used in conjunction with a neurological examination, may have potential in terms of predicting outcome in patients with zzso
