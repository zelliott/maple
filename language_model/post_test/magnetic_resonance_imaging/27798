Just as zzso breast density influences zzso sensitivity, the degree of background enhancement in breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso may influence the sensitivity of breast zzso The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of background enhancement on the accuracy of breast cancer extent assessment using zzso and to assess the correlation between the accuracy of breast cancer extent assessment and the kinetic analysis of background enhancement in dynamic zzso zzso 

zzso bilateral breast zzso examinations were evaluated to assess the extent of a known primary zzso zzso enhancement was classified into four categories by visual zzso zzso mild, moderate, and zzso in the early dynamic phase and in the late dynamic zzso The correlation of the results with zzso findings was zzso 

zzso enhancement grade showed a significant tendency to increase during dynamic zzso zzso When zzso background enhancement at early dynamic phase, the accuracy of tumor extent assessment by zzso with zzso background enhancement was zzso which was lower than the zzso accuracy with zzso background enhancement, but not significantly so zzso When zzso background enhancement at late dynamic phase, the accuracy with zzso background enhancement was zzso which was significantly lower than the zzso accuracy with zzso background enhancement zzso There was no zzso bias between the groups zzso 

The degree of background enhancement on breast zzso affects the accuracy of breast cancer extent assessment, especially at late dynamic zzso
