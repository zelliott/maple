The sensitivity limitations for magnetic resonance imaging of organic molecules have recently been addressed by zzso methods, which prepare excess nuclear spin zzso This approach can increase sensitivity by orders of zzso but the enhanced signal zzso away in tens of seconds, even in favorable zzso Here we show theoretically that zzso states between strongly coupled spins in molecules can be used to store and retrieve population in zzso disconnected zzso as long as the zzso between the spins substantially exceeds both the zzso to other spins and the resonance frequency difference between zzso zzso zzso zzso has a disconnected zzso that can store population for minutes and is read out by zzso to make the two spins zzso
