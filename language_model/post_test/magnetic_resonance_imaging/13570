There is little reliable quantitative information on zzso quality of life of patients with brain zzso The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of the volume, location, and zzso grade of brain zzso on the zzso quality of life of zzso 

The study population consisted of 101 successive patients with brain zzso at zzso Clinic for zzso studied with CT or zzso for zzso determination of zzso location and zzso The Nottingham health profile zzso and zzso zzso scale were used at that time to measure quality of zzso 

zzso size did not correlate zzso with impairment of quality of zzso Large zzso zzso zzso were associated with poorer quality of life than small zzso zzso or zzso zzso The patients with a zzso located on the right side or in the anterior region reported a poorer quality of life than those with a zzso on the left side or zzso Quality of life assessments made by doctors using the zzso performance scale showed no differences between the two zzso Patients with the most zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed the poorest quality of zzso 

Large zzso apparently damage several parts of the brain and/or raise zzso pressure to a level that exceeds the zzso zzso zzso zzso to earlier understanding, zzso in the right zzso seemed to be related to poorer quality of zzso This effect was especially clear in the patients' zzso evaluation of their quality of zzso As the location of the brain zzso thus affects perceived quality of life, any zzso of the quality of life of patients with brain zzso should take into account the location and zzso of the zzso
