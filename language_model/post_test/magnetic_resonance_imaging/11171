To develop and test an artificial neural network zzso for predicting zzso recurrence based on the combined use of pelvic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and biopsy zzso score, after radical zzso and to investigate whether it is more accurate than zzso zzso analysis zzso in men with clinically localized prostate zzso 

We evaluated 191 consecutive men who had undergone zzso radical zzso for clinically localized prostate zzso None of the men had zzso zzso zzso as determined by adequate follow-up and zzso zzso The zzso zzso variables included clinical zzso stage, serum zzso level, biopsy zzso score, and zzso zzso The predicted result was zzso failure zzso level of zzso zzso or zzso The patient data were randomly split into four zzso sets and used to develop and validate the zzso and ANN zzso The zzso ability of the ANN was compared with that of zzso Han tables, and the zzso zzso using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso 

Of the 191 patients, 57 zzso developed disease progression at a median follow-up of 64 months zzso 61, range 2 to zzso Using all the input zzso the zzso of the ANN was significantly greater zzso zzso than the zzso of zzso Han tables, or the zzso zzso for the prediction of zzso recurrence 5 years after radical zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso findings from the previous models, the zzso of the ANN decreased statistically significantly zzso zzso and was comparable to the zzso of conventional zzso tools zzso zzso 

Using the zzso findings, the ANN was superior to zzso zzso tables, and zzso to predict zzso recurrence zzso zzso studies are zzso
