The mechanisms underlying the effects of zzso treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease zzso are zzso The neural changes after successful therapy investigated by zzso methods can give insights into the mechanisms of action related to a specific treatment zzso To study the mechanisms of neural zzso of repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso and zzso 21 zzso depressed patients were zzso into only two active treatment groups for 4 zzso active zzso over left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso motor zzso with zzso pill and sham zzso with zzso 20 zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with emotional stimuli was performed before and after treatment - in two sessions zzso and zzso at each zzso The two groups of treatment had a zzso similar mood zzso After zzso treatment, there were brain activity decreases in left zzso zzso zzso and right zzso and brain activity increases in left zzso and anterior zzso zzso compared to zzso In contrast, after zzso treatment, there were brain activity increases in right zzso and right zzso prefrontal zzso There was a significant interaction effect between groups zzso time in the left zzso prefrontal cortex, suggesting that the activity in this area changed differently in the two treatment zzso Our findings show that zzso effects of zzso and zzso in zzso are associated with changes in different areas of the zzso neural zzso
