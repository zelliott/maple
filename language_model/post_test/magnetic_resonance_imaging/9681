An MR zzso zzso model of a zzso zzso zzso is presented that allows the calculation of plasma fluid and zzso transport within zzso Such zzso models of solid tumors may be used to zzso zzso zzso This model incorporates zzso zzso and tissue zzso to account for zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was conducted following intravenous infusion of zzso to provide 1 h of zzso distribution data within zzso Early time points (19 zzso were used to construct zzso zzso and zzso maps using a zzso zzso zzso transport was predicted at later time points using a zzso porous media zzso Model development involved selecting an zzso input function zzso and conducting a sensitivity analysis of model parameters zzso zzso and initial zzso of zzso concentration in zzso to investigate the effects on transport for a specific zzso The developed model was then used to predict transport in two additional zzso The sensitivity analysis suggests that plasma fluid transport is more sensitive to zzso changes than zzso transport due to the dominance of zzso zzso zzso distribution was similar to experimental patterns, but differences in zzso magnitude at later time points may result from inaccurate selection of zzso Thus, accurate zzso zzso is important for later time point prediction of low molecular weight zzso or drug transport in smaller zzso
