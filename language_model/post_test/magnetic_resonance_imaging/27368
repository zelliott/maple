To determine the effect of surgical implants on the depiction of canine stifle anatomy in magnetic resonance zzso images, three canine zzso limbs were zzso at zzso T before and after zzso plateau leveling zzso zzso zzso zzso advancement zzso and zzso stabilization zzso zzso zzso artifacts associated with implants were identified in MR images as a signal void and/or signal zzso which obscured or distorted the zzso Using the zzso images as a reference, zzso structures of the stifle in zzso images were graded using an zzso scale to describe to what degree each zzso structure could be evaluated for clinical zzso The zzso zzso which contains zzso stainless steel, produced marked zzso artifacts that obscured or distorted most stifle zzso The titanium zzso zzso implants and the stainless steel zzso used for zzso produced zzso artifacts that mainly affected the lateral aspect of the zzso but allowed the cruciate ligaments and zzso zzso to be evaluated zzso zzso artifact was significantly less marked in images obtained using zzso zzso zzso sequences than in sequences employing spectral fat zzso Clinical MR imaging of canine zzso containing certain metallic implants is feasible using zzso sequences without fat zzso
