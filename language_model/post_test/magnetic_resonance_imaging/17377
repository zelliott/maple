zzso therapy for cervical cancer involves a team of specialists, including diagnostic zzso zzso radiation zzso zzso and medical physicists zzso to zzso zzso radiation therapy zzso The purpose of the study was to investigate the zzso variations in tumor zzso on MR images of cervical cancer within the same and among different zzso Twenty zzso cervical cancer studies were independently reviewed by two zzso two zzso and two zzso For every study, each specialist contoured the tumor regions of interest zzso on zzso zzso Spin Echo zzso images on all slices containing zzso and the total tumor volume was zzso for statistical zzso Analysis of zzso zzso was used to compare the differences in tumor volume zzso among the zzso A graph of all zzso volumes was generated, and differences between the maximum and minimum volumes over all the readers for each patient zzso were zzso Challenges during the evaluation process for tumor zzso were recorded for each zzso zzso variations of delineated tumor volumes were significant zzso zzso zzso among all observers based on a repeated measures zzso which produced an zzso zzso zzso The median difference between the maximum delineated volume and minimum delineated volume was zzso zzso (which can be zzso by a sphere of zzso zzso zzso across all 20 zzso Challenges noted for tumor zzso included the zzso zzso partial zzso by zzso fat at the periphery of the zzso zzso extension of the tumor into zzso space; zzso similar signal intensity of structures zzso to the tumor such as zzso muscles, zzso wall, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso changes such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso artifacts from bowels and zzso zzso zzso presence of other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso factors that affect pelvic zzso including the degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our limited study indicates significant zzso variation in tumor zzso Despite rapid progress in technology, which has improved the resolution and precision of image acquisition and the delivery of zzso to the zzso level, such zzso variations (at the zzso zzso may overshadow the gain from technical advancement and impact treatment zzso Strategies of zzso and training in tumor zzso need to be zzso
