Although human evolution is characterized by a vast increase in brain size, it is not clear whether or not certain regions of the brain are enlarged disproportionately in humans, or how this enlargement relates to differences in overall neural zzso The aim of this study is to determine whether or not there are specific suites of features that distinguish the zzso of the human brain from that of zzso The study sample consists of whole brain, in zzso magnetic resonance images zzso of zzso modern humans zzso sapiens zzso and five zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso landmarks, including surface and internal features of the brain were located on zzso zzso reconstructions of each individual using zzso zzso zzso coordinate data were scaled for differences in size and analyzed using zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso to statistically compare the brains of each zzso zzso species to the human zzso zzso of analyses show both a pattern of brain zzso that is consistently different between all apes and humans, as well as patterns that differ among zzso Further, both the consistent and zzso patterns include cortical and zzso zzso The pattern that remains consistent across species indicates a zzso reorganization of 1) relationships between cortical and zzso frontal structures, 2) expansion of the zzso lobe and location of the amygdala, and 3) expansion of the anterior zzso zzso Additionally, results demonstrate that, although there is a pattern of zzso that uniquely defines the human brain, there are also patterns that uniquely differentiate human zzso from the zzso of each zzso zzso species, indicating that reorganization of neural zzso occurred at the evolutionary divergence of each of these zzso
