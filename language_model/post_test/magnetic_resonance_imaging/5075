The zzso zzso working group issued three parts of recommendations and highlighted the pivotal role of zzso for the successful zzso of zzso zzso cervical cancer zzso zzso The main advantage of zzso as an imaging zzso is its superior soft tissue depiction zzso To exploit the full potential of zzso for the better ability of the radiation zzso to make the appropriate choice for the zzso application technique and to accurately define the target volumes and the zzso at risk, certain MR imaging criteria have to be zzso Technical requirements, patient preparation, as well as image acquisition protocols have to be tailored to the needs of zzso zzso zzso The present recommendation is focused on the general principles of MR imaging for zzso zzso zzso zzso and parameters have been developed and progressively validated from clinical experience from different institutions zzso Universities of Vienna, zzso zzso and zzso and successfully applied during expert meetings, zzso workshops, as well as within clinical and zzso zzso It is useful to perform pelvic zzso scanning prior to zzso zzso zzso and at the time of zzso zzso zzso zzso with one MR zzso Both low and zzso zzso as well as both open and close magnet zzso conform to the requirements of zzso zzso cervical cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso image zzso zzso images obtained with pelvic surface coils are considered as the golden standard for zzso of the zzso and the critical zzso The use of complementary zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Patient preparation has to be adapted to the needs of zzso intervention and MR zzso It is recommended to zzso and interpret the MR images on dedicated zzso zzso which should also assist the zzso zzso Choice of imaging parameters and zzso equipment is made after taking into account aspects of interaction between imaging and zzso zzso as well as those between imaging, geometry and dose zzso In a prospective clinical context, to implement zzso zzso cervical cancer zzso and to take advantage of its full potential, it is essential to successfully meet the MR imaging criteria described in the present recommendations of the zzso zzso working zzso
