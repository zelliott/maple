Comprehensive assessment of pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso should identify structural causes and subsequent zzso consequences of zzso This currently requires the use of several imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso is routinely used for pulmonary zzso zzso Our aim was to assess whether combined pulmonary and coronary zzso zzso using zzso zzso CT zzso would allow satisfactory pulmonary zzso coronary zzso and zzso to be combined into a single acquisition using a single imaging zzso 

We assessed zzso in 30 consecutive adult patients zzso age zzso zzso with a diagnosis of zzso In addition to the standard assessment of lung zzso and pulmonary zzso we assessed the ability of CT to zzso zzso coronary vessels and zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso volume zzso zzso volume zzso stroke volume zzso and ejection fraction zzso and mass and these parameters were correlated with same day cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso 

Lung zzso pulmonary and coronary vessels were fully zzso in all zzso zzso correlated well with same day zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and RV mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso g (all zzso Associated zzso cardiovascular zzso were zzso in zzso zzso 

A zzso protocol allows safe, fast, comprehensive, zzso assessment of the possible anatomical causes and zzso zzso of zzso in adult patients, demonstrating zzso heart zzso coronary artery disease and cardiac zzso
