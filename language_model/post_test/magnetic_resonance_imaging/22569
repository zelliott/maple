Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that results from an abnormal or missing X zzso in females and is typically associated with zzso in zzso but not zzso information zzso These zzso processing zzso may be exacerbated with increased task demands, such as those engaged during working memory zzso While previous studies have examined spatial zzso function in Turner syndrome, none have directly compared the neural zzso of spatial and verbal zzso processes across the zzso maintenance and retrieval zzso We employed both zzso assessments and functional zzso zzso to examine the neural zzso underlying both verbal and zzso zzso functions in individuals with Turner syndrome and normal zzso We zzso examined the vulnerability of zzso zzso zzso to zzso presented during zzso zzso Fifteen healthy female volunteers and eight individuals with Turner syndrome performed a zzso zzso task during zzso zzso zzso tests revealed impaired performance across both verbal and spatial zzso in Turner syndrome, with greater impairment on tasks with zzso zzso zzso regions in controls showed significantly sustained levels of zzso during zzso zzso This sustained zzso was significantly reduced in the group with Turner zzso zzso zzso of zzso regions, in contrast, did not differ between the two zzso zzso distraction during the zzso maintenance phase did not zzso alter zzso zzso between the two zzso The results reveal impaired zzso zzso recruitment during zzso executive processing in Turner syndrome, suggesting a significant role for the X zzso in the development of these zzso
