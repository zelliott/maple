To evaluate the usefulness of contrast zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in objective assessment of zzso zzso and the role of MR imaging in the modification of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients with localized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso underwent MR imaging without contrast enhancement before zzso and zzso and zzso MR imaging within 1-3 weeks after zzso The first 20 patients also underwent MR imaging at 3 months after zzso MR imaging findings were correlated with those from zzso zzso zzso staging zzso 

zzso prostate was identified as avascular regions characterized by absolute signal void on zzso zzso With progressive modification of zzso technique, complete zzso of the prostate was achieved in the latter nine of the 38 zzso When zzso was considered complete according to MR imaging criteria, findings invariably correlated with those at zzso with no residual prostate tissue or zzso 

zzso MR imaging of the prostate after zzso provides a highly accurate means of monitoring zzso zzso MR imaging findings allow modifications to the technology and technique, resulting in optimal therapeutic results with zzso zzso
