zzso the limiting factor in the zzso management of diabetes, is the result of the interplay of therapeutic insulin excess and compromised zzso zzso The key feature of the latter is an attenuated zzso response to zzso that typically follows an episode of recent zzso zzso zzso a phenomenon termed zzso zzso failure zzso in zzso We investigated the role of cerebral mechanisms in zzso by measuring regional brain zzso during zzso zzso with attenuated zzso responses and comparing it with initial zzso in healthy zzso 

We used zzso and zzso zzso zzso to measure regional cerebral blood flow as a marker of brain synaptic activity during zzso zzso zzso (55 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso condition zzso 1) and after approximately 24 h of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) in nine healthy zzso 

zzso zzso produced attenuated zzso zzso and other zzso responses to zzso on day 2, a model of zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso during zzso was significantly greater on day 2 than day 1 zzso zzso zzso 

Greater synaptic activity associated with attenuated zzso responses indicates that the zzso zzso zzso plays an active zzso role in reducing zzso and symptomatic responses to zzso when previous zzso has occurred, the key feature of zzso in zzso
