We report the spectrum of muscle involvement on magnetic resonance imaging in 11 patients with a zzso confirmed diagnosis of zzso acid zzso zzso at different clinical zzso Muscle magnetic resonance imaging showed a selective progressive pattern of muscle involvement with a constant involvement of the zzso zzso and zzso at the early stage of the disease and a later fatty zzso of the long head of the biceps zzso zzso and of the anterior thigh zzso In the advanced zzso a selective sparing of zzso zzso and zzso muscles and peripheral portions of the zzso zzso was also zzso Muscle strength and magnetic resonance imaging findings were positively zzso The results suggest that muscle magnetic resonance imaging may provide valuable diagnostic guidance for the assessment of accurate selective muscular involvement in acid zzso zzso and may help monitor the progression of the zzso Further control studies in a larger cohort are needed to evaluate the specificity of these zzso
