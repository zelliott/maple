Our purpose was to evaluate and compare the performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to assess the usefulness of their combined zzso Comparative experiments on a phantom as well as a prospective clinical study in 47 patients were zzso zzso images acquired with the following methods were zzso zzso zzso zzso segmented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and qualitative criteria as well as zzso zzso were analyzed against the zzso zzso fast zzso zzso zzso For contrast and zzso ratio zzso between gray and white matter, zzso was zzso The visibility of small markedly zzso zzso was best with zzso and zzso in the clinical zzso Small zzso zzso were detected equally well with all four zzso although all performed significantly worse than zzso The two zzso zzso were better than the zzso for the zzso zzso The combination of the zzso and zzso was judged best, and sometimes superior to the zzso zzso zzso or zzso alone cannot substitute for zzso in the screening evaluation of the zzso However, together, zzso and zzso could provide comparable diagnostic information to that of zzso because their combination compensates for their individual zzso
