zzso zzso of zzso cartilage are associated with an increase in cartilage water that results from a damaged collagen zzso and provide a marker for cartilage zzso We used zzso mapping to zzso the rim of cartilage defects that appeared to be intact on the zzso zzso to determine whether there are early zzso changes already zzso 

We calculated zzso values for the rim of cartilage defects in 25 patients and compared these values to another area of control cartilage in these zzso 

A highly significant increase in zzso values of the deep, superficial, and global layer of the rim versus the control cartilage was zzso zzso showed a significant correlation of the zzso levels with the zzso values of the deep and global zone of the adjacent cartilage zzso but not with the superficial zzso 

Although cartilage appears to be intact on zzso zzso zzso mapping can show a loss of structural zzso of collagen and the associated increase in cartilage water that indicates the destruction of the adjacent zzso zzso information about the degree of damage of the collagen zzso will support decision making for cartilage zzso
