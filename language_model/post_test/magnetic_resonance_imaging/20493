To determine how the proportion of the cervical volume excised affects cervical zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

University zzso 

Women planning to undergo zzso treatment for cervical zzso zzso who wish to have future zzso 

The cervical volume (and zzso is calculated with magnetic resonance imaging zzso before zzso The volume (and zzso of the cone is assessed before fixation by a zzso tube and a zzso the percentage zzso of zzso is zzso zzso zzso is estimated by repeat zzso at 6 zzso 

zzso zzso in relation to proportion of zzso zzso analysis was performed by box plots and analysis of zzso 

A total of 48 women have been zzso 29 have completed 6 months follow zzso Both the total cervical volume (from zzso before treatment and the volume of the zzso cone varied zzso The estimated proportion of zzso varied significantly between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso linear zzso revealed that the zzso deficit at 6 months zzso was determined mainly by the proportion of the excised zzso 

zzso assessment of risks and benefits of treatment is essential when deciding to treat women who wish to have future zzso Assessment of the proportion of the cervical volume and length excised might identify those that need further surveillance during future zzso
