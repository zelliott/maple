zzso zzso a potent zzso reduces local blood flow to levels that produce zzso injury when injected directly into brain zzso The purpose of this study was to compare 4 different methods of inducing focal zzso with zzso zzso topical application to the zzso motor region of the cortex, zzso zzso injection into the zzso motor region of the cortex, zzso a combination of zzso and zzso injections and zzso injection of zzso adjacent to the middle cerebral artery zzso We examined the effect of delivery method and dose of zzso on zzso size, zzso zzso and behavioral outcome on 3 separate tests of motor function and limb zzso We calculated success rate as the percentage of animals that survived surgery and developed a significant impairment zzso decrease in performance zzso in the zzso zzso All 4 methods produced similar deficits in the staircase, balance zzso and cylinder tests, but the application of zzso adjacent to the zzso though widely used, provided the lowest success zzso The combined cortical and zzso zzso produced a high success rate and consequently we examined cerebral blood flow zzso the apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso changes for this zzso We found that zzso volume measured using zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso together predicted which areas will suffer permanent zzso The combined cortical and zzso injection model offers a number of advantages for studies of recovery of zzso
