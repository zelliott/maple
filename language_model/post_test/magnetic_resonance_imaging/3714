The functional zzso zzso zzso zzso has been found to be associated with anxiety disorders and depression as well as with neural zzso of emotional processing, with, however, contradictory zzso Thus, the aim of the present study was to re-evaluate the impact of the zzso zzso zzso on neural zzso zzso of emotional face processing in a sample of healthy zzso In 85 healthy subjects zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were assessed by means of zzso Participants were presented with zzso and zzso faces in a robust zzso zzso For exploratory reasons, a supplementary zzso analysis of the zzso model and a zzso analysis were zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed an zzso effect on increased predominantly zzso zzso activity in response to zzso facial stimuli zzso This effect was independent from the distribution of the frequently studied zzso zzso for which a linear effect of zzso on zzso responsiveness was zzso The influence of zzso zzso zzso was only discerned in the female zzso of zzso The zzso analysis suggested associations of the zzso zzso zzso with increased activity in areas of the zzso visual stream and the lateral prefrontal zzso The present results provide further support for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the genetic and neural zzso of zzso and zzso intermediate zzso and may aid in further clarifying the differential role of zzso zzso driven zzso zzso in the processing of emotionally salient zzso
