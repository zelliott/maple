One of the most prominent zzso models of zzso assumes an altered function of the anterior zzso zzso zzso as the crucial neural correlate of zzso So far functional imaging studies have yielded zzso zzso zzso we tested this hypothesis in healthy zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty zzso and 30 zzso right-handed male subjects zzso by the zzso Toronto zzso zzso zzso were investigated with zzso zzso using a picture viewing zzso The stimuli consisted of happy, fearful and neutral facial expressions zzso as well as positive, negative and neutral pictures from the International zzso Picture zzso 

zzso the zzso with the zzso group we observed increased zzso of the zzso zzso for different emotional zzso as well as for different emotional zzso Moreover, there was a positive correlation of the zzso with the individual zzso scores but no correlations with the individual zzso Depression zzso zzso Additionally, there was no difference in activity of the zzso 

We demonstrated that the zzso zzso is constantly activated more strongly in zzso subjects and that this zzso is related to the symptoms of zzso and not to associated symptoms such as zzso zzso our findings support the hypothesis of an altered function of the zzso in zzso
