To zzso the effects of surgery on the zzso deficits of zzso and assess the zzso for such zzso 

The subjects were 16 consecutive patients (12 men, 4 zzso mean zzso duration of sensory symptoms, zzso zzso zzso presenting with the typical symptoms of zzso related to zzso I zzso or zzso and requiring surgical zzso They were evaluated before surgery, then at six months and two zzso zzso evaluation included determination of the extent of zzso deficits and quantitative assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso and pain zzso zzso pain intensity was evaluated on visual analogue zzso zzso resonance imaging was done before and after surgery to measure zzso zzso 

The magnitude and extent of zzso deficits improved in a zzso of patients and this was best predicted by the duration of sensory zzso patients operated on less than two years after the onset of their symptoms tended to improve, while those operated on later were zzso or deteriorated zzso The effect of surgery on zzso deficits was correlated with the duration of sensory zzso Surgery also affected zzso deficits in patients with the zzso zzso zzso pain on effort, and zzso zzso 

The duration of sensory deficits is the best zzso factor of the efficacy of surgery for the zzso symptoms of zzso Early surgery is required if these deficits are to be zzso
