To look for changes in the motor zzso in patients with brain zzso 

Both cerebral zzso in seven patients with brain tumors were examined with functional MR imaging during a motor task performed by the hand opposite the site of zzso The ratio of the activated area in the motor zzso zzso to the tested hand was calculated for each zzso Twenty healthy subjects were also examined in the same manner for zzso 

The ratio of the zzso activated area was zzso high in three patients with zzso zzso of the tested zzso The ratio was significantly greater in patients with zzso than in healthy zzso 

This study demonstrated increased activity in the zzso zzso motor area during a hand motor task in patients with brain tumor and zzso which was thought to reflect zzso reorganization induced by the functional zzso
