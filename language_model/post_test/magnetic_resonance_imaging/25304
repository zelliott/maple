Our goal was to determine whether zzso MR imaging of facial muscles predicts facial function after facial nerve zzso 

A retrospective review of all patients undergoing facial nerve zzso between 1997 and 2001 revealed 26 zzso Twelve of the patients had adequate zzso MR images available for review and had undergone clinical follow-up for at least 12 zzso Eight had zzso zzso tumors, and four had benign skull base or zzso zzso zzso facial muscle MR imaging appearance was zzso as symmetrical or zzso The zzso images were further classified into mild or pronounced zzso zzso facial function was classified by using the zzso zzso zzso function was graded with the May zzso 

Four patients had symmetrical facial muscles shown by zzso MR imaging, three had mild zzso and five had pronounced zzso No or mild asymmetry had an zzso positive zzso value for good to excellent functional zzso Eighty percent of patients with pronounced asymmetry experienced poor functional zzso Six of eight patients with zzso and zzso tumors at surgery had zzso facial muscles revealed by zzso MR imaging zzso 

zzso or mildly zzso facial muscles are zzso of good facial function after nerve zzso zzso asymmetry of facial muscles on MR images is zzso of poor facial function after zzso zzso facial muscles on zzso MR images are associated with zzso tumor spread in patients with zzso zzso
