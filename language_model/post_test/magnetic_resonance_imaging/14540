zzso functional zzso zzso has emerged as a promising zzso technique used to identify global hubs of the human brain functional zzso However, most zzso studies on functional hubs mainly zzso traditional zzso data with relatively low sampling rates zzso repetition time zzso zzso zzso data scanned with higher sampling rates are important for the characterization of reliable functional zzso because they can provide temporally complementary information about functional integration among brain regions and simultaneously reduce the effects of high frequency zzso zzso Here, we employed a publicly available zzso zzso zzso with a zzso sampling rate zzso zzso to identify global hubs in the human zzso functional networks, and further examined their zzso zzso reliability over scanning zzso We showed that the functional hubs of human brain networks were mainly located at the zzso regions zzso zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso as well as the lateral zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso and visual zzso These hub regions were highly zzso zzso where short-range and long-range hubs were primarily located at the primary zzso and the zzso association cortex, zzso We found that most functional hubs exhibited fair to good zzso reliability using zzso correlation zzso Interestingly, our analysis suggested that a zzso scan duration was able to reliably detect these functional zzso Further comparison analysis revealed that these results were approximately consistent with those obtained using traditional zzso scans of the same subjects with zzso zzso but several regions zzso lateral frontal cortex, zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso exhibited different zzso zzso Finally, we showed that several regions (including the zzso prefrontal zzso and lateral zzso zzso were identified as brain hubs in a high frequency band zzso zzso which is beyond the frequency scope of traditional zzso zzso Our results demonstrated the zzso of zzso zzso data to reliably detect functional hubs in the zzso zzso networks, which motivated the acquisition of high zzso resolution zzso data for the studies of human brain functional zzso in healthy and diseased zzso
