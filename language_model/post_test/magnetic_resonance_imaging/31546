Clinical applications of blood oxygen zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso depend heavily on robust zzso imaging methods and analysis zzso In this work, as a means to zzso and perform quality assurance of the entire imaging and analysis chain, a phantom that provides a well known and zzso signal change similar to a block type zzso experiment is zzso It consists of two gel compartments with slightly different zzso that zzso enter and leave the zzso zzso The homogeneous gel in combination with a zzso geometry results in a zzso zzso difference causing a signal difference between the two compartments in zzso MR zzso From time series data obtained with the zzso maps of percent signal change zzso and zzso are zzso As an example of image zzso zzso the phantom is demonstrated to be useful for accurate determination of the influence of echo time zzso on zzso zzso results, taking the zzso as a measure of zzso In addition, the phantom is proposed as a tool for quality assurance zzso since zzso time series and zzso are obtained in a series of independent repeat zzso The phantom is relatively simple to build and can therefore be used by any clinical zzso zzso
