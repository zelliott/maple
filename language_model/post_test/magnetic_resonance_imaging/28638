To investigate the role of zzso zzso Imaging zzso in assessing the effects of radiation therapy and in zzso zzso zzso tissue from residual zzso we examined 22 patients with primary zzso cell zzso of the tongue and floor of the mouth treated with definitive radiation zzso all patients were examined before and after zzso zzso zzso showed mass effect and obliteration of the zzso planes, with zzso signal on zzso and zzso zzso injection sequences in all zzso zzso exams were performed 4 months after radiation therapy completion to wait for zzso zzso changes to become less zzso The role of zzso exams was determined on the basis of clinical and zzso zzso zzso therapy yielded complete zzso in zzso patients and partial zzso in zzso MR follow-up zzso in complete zzso patients, persistently obliterated zzso planes in zzso patients zzso and a residual mass, zzso on zzso sequences and without enhancement in zzso patients zzso In all partial zzso patients, zzso showed some residual tissue zzso on zzso zzso with persistent zzso zzso zzso in primary tumor sites, such as residual tissue and zzso plane zzso are frequent findings after zzso zzso signal and enhancement can persist for months after radiation therapy as signs of zzso zzso To zzso zzso performed 4 months after radiation therapy appears as a reliable tool to refer a residual mass to zzso tissue when MR signal is zzso on zzso and enhanced sequences and to residual tumor when MR signal is zzso on zzso and zzso zzso
