zzso of long-term tumor control, zzso of hormonal zzso including zzso and time course of zzso dysfunction following zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

In a retrospective study, the data of 87 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso treated between 1984 and 1994 were zzso All patients underwent surgery and received zzso zzso zzso with a mean dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

After a follow-up of 15 years the local tumor control rate achieved was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was noted in 24 of 26 patients zzso zzso zzso follow-up data were analyzed by an experienced endocrinologist in 77 zzso After a median follow-up of zzso years zzso zzso range zzso zzso in 75 of 77 patients zzso a zzso was observed zzso zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso 47 zzso and 68 out of 77 patients zzso showed evidence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso function was most commonly affected, followed by zzso zzso and adrenal zzso The zzso axis showed to be the first to be zzso 67 patients zzso required a hormone replacement zzso 

zzso after zzso surgery is highly effective in reducing hormonal zzso and preventing zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso are commonly observed after zzso requiring a close follow-up to ensure timely diagnosis of zzso dysfunction and an early inception of hormone replacement zzso
