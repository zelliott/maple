The role of the primary motor zzso zzso in tasks involving action words remains zzso zzso we investigated whether the previously reported involvement of zzso in processing of action words results from the semantic representation of action words per se, or if zzso zzso may actually depend on whether or not subjects zzso or zzso adopt a strategy of simulating the zzso zzso silently read short phrases describing a situation which either involved a motor scene or not zzso zzso zzso zzso and performed a secondary zzso either they were explicitly asked to imagine the situation or they performed letter detection preventing them from using a simulation strategy zzso imagery zzso letter zzso In addition, phrases were presented both in 1st and 3rd person singular ( 

1st zzso 3rd zzso This allowed us to investigate the influence of the secondary tasks zzso detection versus explicit motor zzso on the neural activity in zzso during the processing of motor and zzso zzso We found differential left zzso activity in the task by stimulus interaction with enhanced zzso zzso for imagery in the presence of motor phrases zzso zzso zzso compared to letter detection of motor zzso zzso zzso This zzso was not zzso modulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso previously found in experiments of silent reading of action words may have resulted from the subjects' strategy to mentally simulate the movements during the processing of action zzso
