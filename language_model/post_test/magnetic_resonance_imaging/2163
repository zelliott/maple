zzso thought disorder is a core symptom of zzso It is associated with a reversed zzso of the superior zzso zzso volume, an area that is implicated in zzso zzso We investigated the neural zzso of word retrieval during continuous speech in patients with formal thought disorder using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Blood zzso level dependent zzso contrast was measured with zzso while six patients with schizophrenia and six healthy control subjects spoke about seven zzso zzso for 3 zzso zzso zzso produced varying amounts of speech during each zzso In a within subject design, the number of words produced was correlated with the zzso contrast in the two runs in each participant who showed the highest zzso of speech zzso 

In control subjects, the amount of speech produced was mainly correlated with zzso in the left superior zzso zzso In the patient group, the main correlations were in the right superior zzso zzso 

During the production of continuous speech, patients with formal thought disorder showed a reversed zzso of zzso in the superior zzso zzso This is consistent with findings of zzso zzso interaction in zzso particularly in patients with formal thought zzso
