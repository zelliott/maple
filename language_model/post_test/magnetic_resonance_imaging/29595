The evolution of zzso during repeated application of the zzso sequence is zzso with the aim of identifying sequence parameters that maximize sensitivity to signal produced by the distant zzso field zzso Phase cycling schemes that allow cancellation of signals following zzso zzso pathways are also zzso zzso and imaging experiments carried out at 3 T on zzso and the human head were used to verify the zzso The results indicate that in the absence of phase zzso the zzso zzso ratio zzso per unit time is zzso using zzso zzso along with values of the zzso flip angles zzso approximately 90 degrees and beta approximately 60 degrees ), and echo time zzso that have previously been shown to maximize the zzso signal at long zzso However, with zzso zzso there can also be a significant signal contribution due to zzso echo effects (up to zzso of the signal for water at 3 T and zzso zzso Using a zzso phase cycle, the zzso echo signal is eliminated and the maximum zzso per unit time occurs for zzso zzso It is also demonstrated that sensitivity to signal changes caused by small variations in zzso is zzso by setting zzso
