In this paper, we present a framework for functional MR image restoration based on the Hidden zzso Tree zzso zzso Under this zzso the zzso zzso of the distorted image are filtered using the zzso model of the baseline image to zzso the statistical divergence between two zzso An zzso zzso between image registration and zzso filtering is developed to achieve a zzso between the least mean square error (in the spatial zzso and the minimum statistical divergence (in the spectral zzso We demonstrate that the proposed method can eliminate the motion zzso (such as spikes and zzso in the zzso MR Imaging data more zzso leading to reliable neural activity zzso This method can also be used for image restoration in other medical imaging zzso
