Our goal was to characterize the patterns of zzso enhancement in zzso MR images and correlate these patterns with the clinical zzso 

The MR scans, medical records, and laboratory findings of 83 patients, whose zzso MR studies of the head demonstrated zzso enhancement, were reviewed zzso The patterns of enhancement of the different layers of the zzso were divided into two zzso zzso zzso and zzso when enhancement of the zzso followed the zzso of the zzso and/or involved the zzso around the zzso zzso and zzso zzso when the enhancement was thick and linear or zzso along the inner surface of the zzso zzso or zzso without extension into the cortical zzso or zzso zzso zzso Enhancement around the zzso zzso was considered zzso since the zzso is widely separated from the zzso in this zzso Further, the zzso enhancement was divided into five zzso subgroups, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The medical history, clinical zzso and findings on zzso analysis were used to distinguish infectious from zzso zzso zzso enhancement due to surgery, zzso or trauma was considered zzso while zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso chemotherapy were classified as chemical zzso Meningitis secondary to involvement by collagen vascular disease or zzso was considered to be zzso 

Thirty of the 83 subjects had zzso 28 zzso 14 zzso 8 chemical, and 3 inflammatory zzso for zzso Twenty-five cases zzso of the zzso 14 zzso of the zzso 3 zzso of the zzso and 1 zzso of the chemical meningitis zzso demonstrated zzso enhancement, while 28 cases zzso of the infectious meningitis and 7 zzso of the chemical meningitis zzso had zzso zzso Only five cases zzso of the zzso meningitis zzso showed zzso zzso Four of these five cases were as a result of direct spread of zzso tumors or through zzso extension, rather than zzso zzso Only one patient with zzso meningitis demonstrated zzso enhancement without clear zzso zzso 

The recognition of various patterns of zzso enhancement zzso versus zzso may help in zzso between infectious and zzso zzso This study demonstrated that infectious meningitis presents mostly as zzso while zzso meningitis presents as zzso
