There is increasing interest in understanding the neural systems that mediate zzso thinking, which is essential for learning and fluid zzso The aim of the present study was to shed light on the cerebral zzso of geometric zzso processing and on zzso changes at the behavioral and brain zzso In healthy participants a bilateral zzso network was engaged in processing geometric analogies and showed greater blood zzso dependent zzso signals as resource demands zzso This network, as well as zzso and zzso brain regions, additionally showed zzso decreases in the zzso signal over zzso The general finding that brain regions were modulated by the amount of resources demanded by the task, and/or by the reduction of allocated resources due to short term training, reflects increased zzso terms of more focal and more specialized brain zzso more economically process the geometric zzso Our data indicate a rapid adaptation of the cognitive system which is efficiently modulated by short term training based on a positive correlation of resource demands and brain zzso
