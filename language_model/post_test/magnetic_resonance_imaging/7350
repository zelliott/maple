The aim of this study was to clarify both the present status of treatment for carotid zzso with highly zzso plaques and the appropriate zzso 

A total of 140 consecutive treatments for carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso artery zzso zzso zzso were enrolled in the zzso We classified the patients into zzso plaque zzso and zzso plaque zzso groups by calcium score, determined by a receiver operating characteristic analysis, and we compared the results after both zzso 

The mean degree of residual zzso and improvement rates of the zzso after zzso for the zzso group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, whereas those for the zzso group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (both P zzso zzso A multiple zzso zzso analysis revealed that only the calcium score was an independent zzso predictor of residual zzso zzso at 6 months was observed frequently in the zzso group after both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome was observed in 2 cases of zzso 1 for each plaque zzso The 30-day and zzso rates for any stroke or death after zzso were zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso groups, respectively, whereas those after zzso were zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso zzso score zzso treated by zzso showed a disadvantage in the degree of zzso expansion compared to carotid zzso with zzso suggesting that zzso may be recommended as a surgical zzso
