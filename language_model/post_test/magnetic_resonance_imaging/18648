The aim of the present study was to compare zzso conditioning in zzso patients with zzso including the territory of the superior zzso artery zzso and in patients with zzso restricted to the territory of the zzso inferior zzso artery zzso The zzso areas known to be most critical in zzso conditioning based on animal data zzso zzso zzso H VI and zzso zzso are commonly supplied by the zzso zzso conditioning was expected to be impaired in zzso but not in zzso zzso A total of 27 zzso patients and 25 zzso controls were zzso zzso zzso were primarily unilateral zzso zzso zzso Most patients suffered from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso The other patients presented with zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The extent of the cortical zzso zzso which zzso were zzso and possible involvement of the zzso zzso was determined by zzso As expected, the ability to acquire classically zzso zzso responses was significantly reduced in the group of all zzso patients compared with the zzso In the patients with unilateral zzso zzso conditioning deficits were present zzso In zzso patients with zzso including zzso zzso VI and zzso I, zzso conditioning was significantly reduced on the affected side compared with the unaffected zzso No significant difference between the affected and unaffected sides was present in patients with zzso restricted to the common zzso territory zzso zzso II and zzso zzso deficits were neither significantly different in zzso patients with pure cortical zzso compared with zzso patients with additional nuclear impairment nor in zzso patients with unilateral zzso compared with zzso patients with bilateral zzso To zzso unilateral cortical zzso of the superior zzso appear to be sufficient to reduce zzso conditioning in humans zzso
