zzso of cerebrovascular zzso zzso can give valuable information about existing pathology and the risk of adverse events, such as zzso A common method of obtaining regional zzso values is by measuring the blood flow response to carbon dioxide zzso air using zzso spin labeling zzso or blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso Recently, several studies have used zzso gas zzso only CO2 and zzso as an alternative zzso A direct comparison was performed between zzso values acquired by zzso and zzso imaging using stimuli of zzso zzso CO2 in air and zzso zzso CO2 in oxygen zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso values are shown to be correlated for CO2 in air zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this correlation disappears during a zzso stimulus zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso imaging should generally not be used in conjunction with a zzso stimulus when measuring zzso and that care must be taken when interpreting zzso as measured by zzso as values obtained from different stimuli zzso in air versus zzso are not directly zzso
