zzso zzso functioning coupled with executive control deficits arising from abnormal frontal cortical function are considered key mechanisms in the development and maintenance of cocaine zzso The same features are thought to zzso high trait zzso observed in zzso zzso 

zzso resting state functional zzso the current study sought to identify zzso circuit zzso in cocaine addiction and examine the degree to which circuit connectivity contributes to zzso risk and zzso among zzso zzso 

zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity was assessed in 45 zzso individuals relative to 22 healthy controls using seed volumes in the left and right zzso zzso and nucleus zzso zzso individuals completed scans in the final week of a 2-4 weeks residential treatment zzso zzso by day 30 zzso served to separate zzso individuals into zzso and zzso zzso All participants completed the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso individuals exhibited reduced positive connectivity between the bilateral zzso and zzso zzso and right zzso zzso Group differences were primarily driven by reduced connectivity in zzso individuals relative to zzso No zzso versus zzso differences zzso zzso zzso was higher in zzso participants, an effect that was partially zzso by reduced zzso zzso connectivity in this zzso 

zzso addiction, zzso risk and zzso were associated with reduced connectivity in zzso zzso zzso circuits implicated in zzso zzso and habitual zzso zzso provide new insight into the zzso mechanisms underlying zzso and zzso in cocaine zzso
