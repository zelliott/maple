This study evaluated whether zzso episodes of zzso zzso zzso were associated with an increased risk of silent cerebral zzso zzso and stroke in diabetic patients younger than 60 years who did not have other clinical evidence of zzso and cerebrovascular disease at zzso 

In type 2 diabetic patients, zzso of strokes are of unknown cause, and zzso episodes of zzso may be a common zzso zzso 

A total of zzso type 2 diabetic patients younger than 60 years were included in a zzso zzso study and matched to patients without zzso Patients underwent zzso zzso zzso monitoring quarterly to detect brief zzso episodes of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and were followed up for 37 zzso The outcomes were zzso assessed by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and stroke events during the follow-up zzso 

The prevalence of zzso episodes of zzso was significantly greater among patients with diabetes compared with matched healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During an average duration of 37 months, 43 stroke events occurred in the diabetic population and no events occurred in healthy zzso zzso patients with silent episodes of zzso zzso zzso had a higher baseline prevalence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a higher number of stroke events zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the follow-up period than the other patients zzso zzso An episode of silent zzso was an independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and an independent predictor of the occurrence of stroke in diabetic patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso episodes of zzso occurred frequently in type 2 diabetic patients and were associated with a significantly increased risk of zzso and zzso
