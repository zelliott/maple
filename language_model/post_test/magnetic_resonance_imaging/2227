To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the assessment of zzso findings at zzso such as indeterminate focal or diffuse breast zzso zzso breasts with extensive zzso dense zzso and findings suggesting zzso or zzso breast zzso 

254 patients underwent zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso Dynamic MR imaging was done using a zzso three-dimensional zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso 5 zzso flip angle zzso 25 zzso which was applied in a dynamic fashion before and every 90 seconds after injection of zzso zzso zzso were confirmed at biopsy zzso zzso zzso or by follow-up zzso zzso zzso 

Among various breast anomalies, the highest proportion of breast zzso was associated with dense breast tissue zzso architectural distortion zzso and irregular scars zzso zzso of dynamic MR imaging was zzso and specificity was zzso As compared to zzso and zzso MR detected 6 zzso zzso and showed additional zzso zzso in zzso women zzso with zzso breast zzso 

MR imaging of the breast may provide valuable additional information in indeterminate breast zzso However, because of its inherent limitations, it should not replace core needle biopsy in all zzso which are amenable to zzso Because of its high sensitivity in the detection of invasive zzso in any type of breast zzso MR imaging is considered the zzso of choice in the evaluation of dense breasts in high-risk patients or in patients with clinical suspicion of zzso breast cancer, and for zzso tumor zzso
