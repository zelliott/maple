To assess the role of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso staging for patients undergoing seed zzso zzso with or without external beam zzso zzso 

Between October 1994 and December 1998, 390 patients underwent prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of patients had a prostate serum zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso had zzso of zzso and zzso of patients had zzso of zzso zzso Ten percent of patients had a zzso score zzso of zzso zzso had zzso 6, zzso had zzso 7, and zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed in zzso of patients, and the remaining zzso received combined zzso and zzso Three hundred zzso were staged by high-resolution phased array pelvic zzso or in most cases, an zzso zzso zzso The zzso findings were used to guide zzso treatment recommendations, and to assist in the zzso and zzso of seed zzso The criteria zzso to determine zzso stage were founded on the reported literature from the University of zzso All zzso studies were reviewed by zzso zzso or zzso who were unaware of clinical stage at the time of their zzso The biopsy report was available to them as the only clinical zzso 

Of the zzso patients staged by zzso zzso were upstaged from the digital zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso of zzso zzso patients were upstaged to zzso zzso invasion and the percentage of positive zzso predicted for zzso zzso stage zzso zzso zzso for both zzso zzso findings changed the overall treatment recommendation in zzso zzso zzso The majority of these patients were advised to receive combined therapy instead of zzso after the zzso documented more extensive zzso The seed distribution was modified in zzso zzso patients, mostly related to zzso zzso coverage of bulky or zzso disease seen on zzso With a mean follow-up of 38 months zzso zzso zzso freedom from progression zzso was zzso at 5 zzso Cox zzso analysis showed that only the percentage of positive zzso zzso zzso zzso and failure to have zzso staging zzso zzso zzso predicted for zzso zzso zzso level, zzso score, zzso invasion, and external beam zzso did not significantly predict for zzso zzso We compared our zzso zzso zzso group patients treated by combined therapy with a previous study of zzso zzso group treated by radical zzso zzso at the University of zzso Our zzso zzso zzso was zzso compared with zzso for the previous study's zzso zzso 

zzso is a valuable staging procedure for prostate cancer patients treated by zzso zzso zzso results appear to be improved by zzso zzso zzso zzso disease can be treated more effectively by zzso + zzso than by zzso
