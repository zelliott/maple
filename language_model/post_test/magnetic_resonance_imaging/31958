zzso dysfunction is a hallmark feature of zzso In recent years, it has been proposed that zzso in attention, working memory and executive function may all reflect an underlying deficit in context zzso In individuals with zzso deficits in context processing have been associated with functional zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso 

We used a variation of the continuous performance task, the zzso to test the hypothesis that genetic high-risk individuals (full siblings of individuals with zzso have deficits in context processing and abnormal zzso of the zzso as compared to community zzso 

zzso of individuals with schizophrenia made significantly more zzso errors on the zzso indicative of a deficit in context zzso They also showed zzso zzso in a number of brain regions, including the zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso may zzso deficits in context processing and contribute to the genetic vulnerability for developing zzso
