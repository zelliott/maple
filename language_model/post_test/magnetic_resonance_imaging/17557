zzso related changes in cerebral zzso and zzso were studied using zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso of cerebral blood flow and zzso fluid zzso flow zzso Ten healthy volunteers zzso age 29 zzso 7) were studied in zzso and upright zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso technique was used to image the zzso blood flow to the brain, the zzso zzso through the internal zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso flow between the zzso and the spinal zzso Previously published analyses were applied to calculate and compare total cerebral blood flow zzso zzso compliance and pressure in both zzso A lower zzso mean zzso was measured in the upright position compared to zzso zzso A considerable smaller amount of zzso flow between the zzso and the spinal canal zzso a much larger zzso compliance (a zzso zzso and a corresponding decrease in the zzso zzso were also measured in the sitting zzso These changes suggest that the increased cerebrovascular and zzso zzso in the upright posture are primarily due to reduced amounts of blood and zzso residing in their respective zzso compartments in the upright zzso This work demonstrates the ability to zzso zzso parameters associated with regulation of cerebral zzso and zzso from dynamic MR imaging of blood and zzso zzso
