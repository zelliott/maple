We used low field magnetic resonance imaging and zzso to study 10 recently head injured zzso On the zzso images we identified 36 abnormalities in 9 of the 10 zzso After contrast enhancement was seen in 9 of these zzso in 3 patients zzso 5-6 days after zzso zzso blood brain barrier zzso to zzso was not seen in 6 patients studied within 4 days of zzso We did not identify any zzso with zzso that were not present on the zzso zzso We do not think that the routine use of contrast in head injury is justified since clinically important zzso will be present on routine zzso However the use of zzso may provide information about the nature and timing of the underlying zzso zzso In human head injury zzso zzso occurs early and zzso zzso does not occur until 5-6 days after zzso
