Despite the popularity of zzso as a zzso treatment for zzso cartilage defects in the knee, systematic information on its clinical efficacy for zzso cartilage repair and long-term improvement of knee function is not zzso 

zzso analysis of the existing clinical literature of zzso in the knee can improve the understanding of the advantages and limitations of this cartilage repair technique and can help to zzso its indications and clinical zzso 

zzso zzso 

A comprehensive literature search was performed using established search engines zzso zzso zzso Cochrane Central Register of Controlled zzso to identify original human studies of zzso cartilage repair with zzso zzso Coleman zzso Scores were used to analyze the quality of the existing zzso Clinical efficacy of zzso cartilage repair was evaluated by systematic analysis of zzso and long-term functional outcome scores, zzso and microscopic repair cartilage quality, and findings of zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso studies describing zzso patients were included in the zzso The average follow-up was 41 months, with only 5 studies reporting follow-up of 5 years or zzso Six studies were zzso controlled trials and the mean Coleman zzso zzso was 58 zzso zzso zzso effectively improved knee function in all studies during the first 24 months after zzso but the reports on durability of the initial functional improvement were zzso Several factors were identified that affected clinical zzso zzso fill on magnetic resonance imaging was highly variable and correlated with functional zzso zzso repair cartilage quality positively affected long-term failure rate, while the influence of zzso repair tissue quality remained zzso 

This systematic analysis shows that zzso provides effective short-term functional improvement of knee function but insufficient data are available on its long-term zzso zzso of the technique include limited zzso repair zzso variable repair cartilage volume, and possible functional zzso The quality of the currently available data on zzso is still limited by the zzso of results and study zzso Further zzso studies are needed to determine the long-term efficacy of zzso and to define its specific clinical indications compared to other cartilage repair zzso
