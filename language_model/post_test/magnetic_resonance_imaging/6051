zzso zzso with zzso echoes zzso is a quantitative imaging technique that encodes tissue displacement in the phase of the acquired zzso Various zzso sequences have zzso displacement using methods analogous to the simple zzso methods of phase contrast zzso zzso We developed general zzso balanced zzso zzso for zzso Using these methods, phase noise zzso decreased zzso by zzso zzso and zzso compared with simple methods, which closely matched the theoretical decreases of zzso zzso and zzso for one-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Phase noise zzso decreased by zzso and zzso for balanced zzso and zzso zzso consistent with the zzso zzso The direction bias inherent to the simple methods was decreased to almost zero using balanced zzso zzso phase noise and improved displacement and strain maps using balanced methods were visually observed in phantom and volunteer zzso Balanced zzso zzso can also be applied to PC zzso
