Brain scans were evaluated for volume of white matter zzso (by fully automated imaging zzso and for zzso of zzso (by visual reading with a zzso assessment zzso zzso function was assessed by a battery of tests including the zzso state zzso 

zzso zzso participants reported a history of severe headache and 116 had zzso of whom 17 zzso reported aura zzso An association was found between any history of severe headache and increasing volume of white matter zzso The adjusted odds ratio of being in the highest third for total volume of white matter zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso P for trend zzso for participants with any history of severe headache when compared with participants without severe headache being in the lowest zzso The association pattern was similar for all headache zzso zzso with aura was the only headache type strongly associated with volume of deep white matter zzso zzso third odds ratio zzso zzso to zzso P for trend zzso and with brain zzso zzso zzso to zzso The location of zzso was predominantly outside the zzso and brain zzso Evidence was lacking for cognitive impairment for any headache type with or without brain zzso 

In this population based study, any history of severe headache was associated with an increased volume of white matter zzso zzso with aura was the only headache type associated with brain zzso Evidence that headache of any type by itself or in combination with brain zzso was associated with cognitive impairment was zzso
