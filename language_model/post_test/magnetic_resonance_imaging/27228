To assess the correlations between parameters measured on dynamic zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso correlations were only demonstrated between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No significant differences were found in imaging parameters between well, moderately and poorly differentiated zzso zzso However, there was a trend that higher imaging values were found in poorly differentiated zzso 

Positive correlations were found between zzso and zzso values in primary zzso zzso suggesting an association between zzso and zzso activity and further reflecting that zzso activity in zzso phase is better associated with tumor metabolism than the zzso zzso
