zzso zzso is the most common zzso infection of the central nervous system, and its prevalence is continuing to increase in the United zzso The diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso may be difficult, and surgery frequently fails to resolve zzso A retrospective review of magnetic resonance zzso imaging characteristics and zzso outcomes may improve management strategies of this zzso 

The authors report the presentations, zzso zzso surgical management, and outcomes of 30 patients with zzso treated over a 10-year period zzso follow-up period 4 zzso zzso were located in the lateral zzso (five zzso the third zzso (five zzso and the fourth zzso (21 zzso One patient had zzso in both the lateral and fourth zzso zzso symptoms were related to zzso or mass effect from the zzso All patients underwent computerized zzso zzso and MR imaging of the zzso Treatment consisted of shunt zzso or primary zzso of an zzso zzso Outcomes after operations and zzso were evaluated in light of enhancement characteristics on MR zzso zzso zzso scanning demonstrated zzso zzso in zzso of cases, and MR revealed zzso in zzso of zzso In patients in whom zzso zzso enhancement of zzso zzso was demonstrated on MR imaging, the zzso failure rate was higher and patients required zzso and in those in whom zzso enhancement was absent the zzso failure rate was lower zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging is superior to CT scanning for detecting zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso enhancement on MR imaging is an indication for zzso of the zzso If zzso enhancement is present, shunt surgery should be performed, and zzso reserved for treatment of those patients with symptomatic zzso secondary to mass zzso A treatment zzso based on patient symptoms, zzso location, and MR imaging zzso enhancement characteristics is zzso
