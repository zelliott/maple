We report the finding of unique zzso inclusions in a series of pediatric zzso patients, all of whom presented with zzso in their first year of life and had zzso zzso zzso All eventually underwent surgical treatment for zzso zzso and, on pathological examination, were found to have distinctive, zzso zzso zzso inclusions confined to cortical zzso These inclusions were almost exclusively zzso highly zzso spared zzso zzso or zzso zzso processes and were strongly and exclusively zzso for zzso A, an zzso binding protein involved in zzso zzso zzso inclusions have been identified and characterized in cases of zzso syndrome, a rare zzso zzso The presence of the same inclusions in the zzso of zzso patients, some of whom had zzso brain anomalies related to zzso problems, prompted us to consider that these patients may lie within a spectrum of disease involving dysfunction of zzso or zzso zzso The term zzso is tentatively proposed as a distinct pathological entity for this condition in which clinical manifestations range from zzso in mildly zzso impaired patients to severe mental and physical handicap in the zzso zzso Future studies will be necessary to unravel the exact nature of the zzso A protein or gene aberrations in these zzso
