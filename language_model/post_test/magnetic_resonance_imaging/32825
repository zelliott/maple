Evidence for an zzso zzso of age-related volume reduction along the zzso zzso axis has been reported in normal aging, but functional changes have yet to be systematically zzso The current study applied an advanced brain mapping technique, large deformation zzso metric mapping zzso automatically zzso the zzso into the anterior and zzso segments based on anatomical zzso We studied this zzso zzso in terms of structural and functional zzso in 66 participants aged from 19 to 79 zzso The results showed age-related structural volume reduction in both anterior and zzso zzso with greater tendency for anterior zzso zzso task contrasts that robustly activated the anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed only significant reduction of zzso in the anterior zzso as age zzso Our results revealed positive correlation between structural zzso and functional decrease in the anterior zzso regardless of task performance in normal zzso These findings suggest that anatomy and functions related to the anterior zzso may be more vulnerable to aging, than previously zzso
