zzso zzso are important for zzso and zzso Previous studies have addressed the neural zzso of self-referential processes in response to or related to external zzso We here investigated brain activity associated with a short, exclusively mental process of zzso in the absence of external stimuli or zzso zzso Healthy subjects reflected either on themselves, a personally known or an unknown person during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The reflection period was zzso by a cue and followed by photographs of the respective persons zzso of pictures of oneself or the other zzso 

zzso compared with reflecting on the other persons and to a major part also compared with zzso photographs of zzso was associated with more prominent zzso and lateral zzso insular, anterior and zzso zzso zzso Whereas some of these areas showed activity in the zzso as well, zzso characteristics were revealed in right zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso for zzso in anterior zzso zzso for zzso and in the left inferior zzso lobe for zzso and zzso 

Altogether, cingulate, zzso and lateral zzso insular and inferior zzso regions show relevance for zzso zzso with in part zzso in terms of comparison with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the results are obtained here without zzso response supporting the reliability of this zzso approach of applying a solely mental zzso We suggest considering the reported structures when investigating zzso affected zzso zzso
