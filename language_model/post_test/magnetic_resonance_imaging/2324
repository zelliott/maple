To evaluate an zzso technique to reduce global motion in shoulder magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

In the zzso technique, zzso zzso echoes are used to provide a measure of zzso displacement along the zzso direction for each image echo in the zzso The information is then zzso applied to the zzso data to correct for global shoulder zzso This zzso was evaluated in a series of 143 consecutive patient shoulder examinations by comparing the original image set for each patient with the same image set after retrospective correction by means of this zzso 

The average zzso of zzso motion was zzso zzso Image degradation due to motion was apparent in 100 zzso of the 143 zzso Application of the zzso technique improved image quality in 73 zzso of these 100 examinations or 51% of all 143 zzso 

zzso motion correction improved image quality in approximately three-quarters of the examinations in which motion was zzso
