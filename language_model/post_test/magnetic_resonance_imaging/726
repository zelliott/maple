Executive functions such as zzso switching are thought to depend on the frontal zzso However, more precision is required in identifying which components of such high-level processes relate to which, if any, zzso of the zzso In a recent study of 19 patients with focal right frontal zzso zzso and 17 with left frontal zzso zzso we found that response zzso as measured by the zzso task, was specifically disrupted by damage to the right inferior frontal zzso zzso The present study examined zzso performance in this same group of patients and in matched controls on the grounds that zzso mechanisms may also be required to switch zzso Both zzso and zzso patients showed significantly larger switch costs (the difference, in reaction time and zzso between changing tasks and repeating the same zzso than controls, but apparently for different zzso For zzso patients, a part of the switch deficit could be accounted for by impaired zzso of inappropriate responses or zzso triggered by zzso and one measure of the switch cost correlated reliably with damage to the zzso specifically the zzso zzso zzso For zzso patients, a part of the switch deficit may have arisen from weak zzso control of zzso The degree of zzso control correlated reliably with the extent of damage to the left middle frontal zzso zzso This study zzso two components of the complex zzso process zzso of zzso and/or responses and zzso control of zzso to the right zzso and the left zzso zzso
