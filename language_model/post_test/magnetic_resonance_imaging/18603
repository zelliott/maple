Research of the zzso bases of learning and memory suggest that these processes are not zzso in nature, but rather that relatively independent neural systems appear to mediate different types of zzso zzso studies, for instance, have identified zzso cognitive or zzso and zzso zzso memory systems that rely upon the zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Evidence indicates that multiple memory systems are activated simultaneously and in parallel in various learning tasks, and recent findings suggest that these systems may zzso One form of interaction between zzso zzso lobe and zzso zzso memory systems appears competitive in nature, and has been revealed in zzso animal studies in which damage to a given memory system results in enhanced zzso Recent human zzso research has also provided evidence in favor of competition between memory zzso Thus, zzso evidence across species supports the hypothesis of interactive multiple memory systems in the zzso zzso Potential zzso mechanisms zzso such interactions include direct anatomical projections between the zzso zzso lobe and zzso zzso indirect zzso influences of other brain structures zzso zzso zzso and activity of zzso brain regions involved in zzso response zzso
