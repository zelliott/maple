zzso zzso factor zzso zzso the pruning of zzso silent zzso zzso The Met zzso of the zzso gene is associated with a reduction in the zzso zzso zzso We used zzso imaging to construct structural brain networks for 36 healthy subjects with known zzso zzso Through zzso testing we discovered clear differences in connection strength between subjects carrying the Met zzso and those zzso for the Val zzso We trained a zzso process zzso capable of identifying the subjects' zzso group with zzso accuracy and high zzso zzso In Met carriers structural connectivity was greatly increased throughout the zzso particularly in connections corresponding to the anterior and superior zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso projections from the zzso zzso and prefrontal portions of the internal zzso zzso connectivity was also increased via the corpus zzso and anterior zzso and extremely high connectivity values were found between inferior zzso frontal polar regions via the anterior zzso We propose that the decreased availability of zzso leads to deficits in zzso maintenance in carriers of the Met zzso and that this produces zzso changes in white matter zzso
