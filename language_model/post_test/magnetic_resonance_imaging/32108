We evaluated the ability of canine bone zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso bone in a cavity of the zzso created by zzso and zzso with liquid nitrogen zzso zzso zzso were harvested from the zzso crest and expanded in zzso Their potential to differentiate into zzso zzso and zzso lineages was confirmed using a standard differentiation induction zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso of bone tissue when the cavity was left alone, demonstrating severe collapse and zzso as observed in human zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso and a zzso bone graft with zzso zzso failed to zzso bone in the zzso zzso When the same procedure was performed using zzso however, zzso zzso showed no collapse and zzso and the cavity was completely filled with normal zzso bone within 4 zzso These results suggested the potential of using zzso to treat zzso zzso
