zzso resonance imaging was used to study the behavior of the gel layer thickness in zzso zzso cellulose zzso zzso loaded with different amounts of soluble zzso zzso The time dependence of the diffusion front, effective zzso and zzso analysis clearly indicates a Case II diffusion mechanism in the system composed of water solution of zzso acid zzso zzso 2) and zzso The zzso penetration front was used to describe the swelling properties as well as the integrity of the zzso zzso The results show that the zzso zzso decreases the resistance of the zzso network structure against the movement of zzso zzso On the other hand the swelling properties of the zzso increase with the amount of drug in the zzso
