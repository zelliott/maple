zzso zzso of head and neck tumors were examined by simultaneous bone and tumor zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso The effectiveness and reliability of tumor diagnosis by this method was the primary interest in this zzso 

Before zzso imaging, a phantom experiment using dried zzso specimens was performed to establish anatomical details of the skull base with the zzso zzso zzso zzso window zzso and control patients were also examined prior to zzso zzso Twenty patients with suspected tumor invasion of the skull base underwent zzso 

zzso experiments revealed that zzso effects could be disregarded with adequate window zzso and routine administrative doses of the zzso zzso detected bone destruction and the extent of tumor invasion for all 12 patients in whom zzso involvement was diagnosed by CT or zzso For the three patients in whom CT or zzso revealed no tumor invasion, the zzso images did not show any abnormal zzso in similar zzso In the remaining five patients without CT and zzso confirmation of zzso invasion, the zzso findings showed zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso invasion was confirmed surgically or by clinical zzso The remaining two patients had negative zzso zzso 

zzso is an effective and reliable diagnostic technique for detecting tumor invasion in the complex zzso regions of the skull zzso
