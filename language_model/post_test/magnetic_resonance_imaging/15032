To assess the value of conventional and zzso transfer zzso zzso measures of white matter zzso and gray matter zzso damage, and their 12-month change, in predicting long-term disability and cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis zzso 

Conventional and zzso zzso brain scans were obtained at baseline and at 12 months in 73 patients, who were followed zzso with clinical visits and rating of the Expanded zzso zzso zzso score and the zzso severity score zzso for a median period of zzso zzso At zzso zzso a zzso assessment was also performed when zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes, zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso average zzso zzso ratio zzso average zzso zzso average zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Random forest and multivariable analyses were performed to identify the zzso of zzso deterioration and cognitive impairment at 13 zzso 

At zzso zzso zzso of patients showed significant worsening of disability and 37% had worsened zzso The multivariable model, in which Expanded zzso zzso zzso deterioration at final follow-up was the dependent zzso identified baseline zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso as the only predictor of worsening of disability zzso zzso zzso zzso disease duration zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and average zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were independent variables associated with cognitive deterioration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso predicted zzso at follow-up zzso zzso zzso 

zzso damage is one of the key factors associated with long-term zzso of disability and cognitive impairment in zzso
