zzso zzso of a quantum mechanical angular momentum zzso about an applied magnetic field forms the basis for a range of magnetic resonance techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and magnetic resonance zzso We have used a polarized laser zzso scheme with zzso imaging detection to zzso for the first time, the zzso motion of a quantum mechanical angular momentum zzso zzso of zzso at 157 zzso provides a clean source of fast-moving zzso zzso with their electronic angular momentum zzso strongly aligned perpendicular to the zzso zzso In the presence of an external magnetic field, the distribution of atomic angular zzso zzso about the field direction, and zzso images of the atomic scattering distribution recorded as a function of field strength yield zzso style movies of the zzso zzso We present movies recorded in various experimental zzso and discuss potential consequences and applications in atmospheric chemistry and reaction zzso
