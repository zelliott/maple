zzso refers to increased neural activity during zzso tasks or rest compared with zzso zzso Several groups have reported that a particular set of brain regions, including the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso prefrontal cortex, among others, is consistently zzso Taken together, these typically zzso brain regions appear to constitute a zzso network of brain activity that zzso in the absence of a demanding external zzso zzso a passive, zzso sensory task with a standard zzso analysis zzso epochs zzso stimulus zzso we demonstrate that the zzso network is zzso in one run and only partially zzso in a second zzso Using independent component analysis, however, we were able to detect the full zzso network in both runs and to demonstrate that, in the majority of subjects, it persisted across both rest and stimulus zzso zzso from the task zzso and so mostly zzso as zzso We also replicate an earlier finding that the zzso network includes the zzso suggesting that episodic memory is incorporated in zzso cognitive zzso Furthermore, we show that the more a zzso zzso activity was correlated with the rest epochs (and zzso during stimulus zzso the greater that zzso zzso to the visual and auditory zzso We conclude that activity in the zzso network may persist through both experimental and rest epochs if the experiment is not sufficiently zzso zzso analysis of zzso activity provides a measure of the degree to which a task engages a subject and whether it is sufficient to interrupt the zzso zzso internally generated, and involving episodic zzso by the zzso zzso
