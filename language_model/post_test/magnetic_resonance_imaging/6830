The feasibility of a zzso technique for mapping zzso and zzso in zzso cartilage in the human knee was zzso The technique, zzso mixed magnetic resonance zzso imaging, is based on a pulse sequence in which zzso and zzso zzso are zzso The sequence was first validated in a phantom experiment in which zzso and zzso values obtained with an accepted zzso technique were correlated with those obtained by using a clinical magnetic resonance zzso with the zzso mixed zzso zzso maps were obtained with zzso mixed imaging in 25 volunteers (17 men, eight zzso mean age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso A high correlation zzso zzso zzso was found between zzso and zzso values obtained at zzso and those obtained at zzso mixed zzso Relative differences in the range of cartilage relaxation times between the two techniques were less than zzso zzso mixed imaging in human volunteers showed zzso cartilage relaxation times that corresponded with previously published zzso zzso mixed imaging, thus, is feasible for zzso mapping of zzso
