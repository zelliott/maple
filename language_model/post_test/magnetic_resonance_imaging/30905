zzso zzso inflammation of the central nervous system zzso presents in processes that are difficult to zzso such as acute zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and multiple sclerosis zzso zzso resonance imaging allows these problems to be identified more frequently than in the zzso 

We carried out a retrospective study of the cases of episodic zzso inflammation of the zzso according to clinical features and compatible zzso at the zzso Unit of the Hospital zzso Miguel zzso between May 1990 and August zzso 

Of the zzso children evaluated over this period, 10 met the eligibility criteria, with a minimum age at onset of 2 years and 2 zzso In four cases there was a history of an infectious process or zzso Clinical involvement was zzso the most frequent being zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nerve zzso Six of them had zzso fluid disorders and only two presented disorders in the zzso zzso Five of them were given zzso zzso Progress was zzso except in two zzso one due to the persistence of a zzso dependent optical zzso and the other because of zzso in the right zzso 

Diagnosis of zzso is established by signs of zzso clinical involvement and zzso and depends on a compatible zzso zzso is generally good and zzso seem to be effective, at least in zzso the time the clinical features zzso It is not possible to completely differentiate it from zzso especially in recurring zzso Clinical and magnetic resonance controls must be carried zzso
