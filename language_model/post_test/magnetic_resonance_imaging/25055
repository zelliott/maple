The authors developed a novel zzso that shows zzso activity in a variety of in zzso models, as well as in a clinically relevant experimental model of traumatic brain injury zzso in zzso Treatment with zzso zzso a zzso zzso derived from a modified zzso hormone zzso zzso significantly reduced cell death associated with necrosis zzso zzso zzso or mechanical injury in zzso zzso zzso subjected to lateral fluid zzso zzso and then treated with 1 zzso intravenous zzso thirty minutes after trauma showed significantly improved motor recovery and spatial learning compared with zzso zzso Treatment also significantly reduced zzso volumes as shown by magnetic resonance imaging, and decreased the number of zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso Unlike zzso or traditional zzso zzso zzso treatment did not change mean zzso pressure, body temperature, or zzso hormone release, and did not have zzso zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso or typical zzso zzso zzso administration after zzso did not alter zzso concentration or cellular zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso did not act with high affinity at 50 classical zzso channels, or zzso Thus, zzso shows none of the typical zzso actions associated with zzso but possesses zzso actions in zzso and in zzso and appears to zzso both zzso and zzso cell zzso
