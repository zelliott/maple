To introduce a new technique for zzso of zzso zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso We compare the accuracy of a new zzso with fixed zzso to a previous technique zzso zzso coils were attached zzso to landmarks on the zzso 

A zzso with fixed zzso coils is used to determine the position of the head in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is performed by a zzso zzso The advantage of fixing the coils is that the zzso system is not based upon arbitrary and operator dependent zzso points that are attached to landmarks zzso zzso and the zzso points), but rather on those that are permanently fixed in relation to the zzso 

As a consequence of minimizing zzso movement during zzso errors in zzso of the coils are significantly reduced, as shown by a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso caused by removal and repositioning between zzso recordings is minimal ( approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso accuracy of a zzso mapping paradigm shows a zzso of approximately 5 zzso The overall accuracy of the new procedure is greatly improved compared to the previous zzso 

The zzso reliability and accuracy of target zzso with the new design is superior to techniques that incorporate zzso zzso points or coils placed on the circumference of the zzso
