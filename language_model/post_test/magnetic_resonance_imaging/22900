Large zzso zzso of the zzso may be associated with zzso and significant zzso in the zzso zzso At times, the differences between zzso zzso can be very zzso leading to errors in zzso zzso with vascular zzso and zzso are often found to have the zzso phenomenon, which is a zzso zzso However, other zzso or vascular zzso can be accompanied by zzso zzso zzso It is important to obtain accurate diagnoses of the zzso and the zzso because the treatments of zzso tumors and zzso can be markedly zzso 

The authors report the case of a newborn with a zzso tumor of the left hand that was accompanied by a zzso that caused significant zzso 

A presumption was made by the zzso critical care physicians and zzso that the infant had a zzso zzso along with the zzso zzso However, steroid treatment did not reduce the size of the mass or correct the zzso Only after obtaining consultation with a hand surgeon and a tissue diagnosis was it learned that the patient had an infantile zzso that was accompanied by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso along with chemotherapy markedly improved the patient's zzso 

Large zzso zzso presenting with attendant bleeding zzso must be rapidly and accurately diagnosed with both a zzso tissue diagnosis and a zzso characterization of the nature of the zzso The differential diagnosis of a zzso mass in the zzso can be zzso and zzso diagnosis, as occurred in this case, can lead to incorrect or delayed zzso Specifically, zzso zzso must be differentiated from infantile zzso The principles of infantile zzso treatment are zzso zzso and zzso
