To assess the contribution of regional zzso matter zzso zzso and functional zzso in determining the level of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso at different clinical zzso 

Ten patients with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso 11 patients with probable zzso and 10 healthy controls were zzso zzso volumes were obtained from each subject and zzso according to an zzso zzso based zzso zzso zzso state functional zzso data were also collected from the same individuals and zzso to produce connectivity maps after identification of the default mode network zzso by independent component zzso 

Compared with healthy controls, both zzso and zzso patients showed a similar regional pattern of brain zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso and the rest of the zzso zzso the distribution of zzso zzso was significantly more restricted in zzso than in zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso showed reduced connectivity in zzso patients in the absence of zzso zzso which was, in contrast, zzso at the stage of fully developed zzso 

This study indicates that zzso precedes zzso zzso in the zzso which is a critical area of the zzso and supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso in specific regions of zzso brains likely reflects a long term effect of brain zzso In this context, our study indicates that zzso zzso in zzso accompanies the conversion from zzso to zzso
