We studied the natural history of zzso zzso zzso discs using zzso zzso patients with zzso disc zzso were included in this zzso Ages ranged from 19 to zzso On the zzso zzso MR image, the signal intensity in the zzso mass was measured and the ratio to that in the original nucleus zzso nucleus zzso from which they zzso was calculated zzso intensity zzso zzso The relationship with zzso and duration of illness was zzso In ten patients who were zzso by zzso after conservative treatment, the size of the zzso measured by zzso zzso MR image was compared before and after zzso The signal intensity of zzso became higher than that of the original nucleus immediately following zzso and thereafter decreased with time, suggesting that initial zzso of the zzso occurred shortly after zzso followed by zzso of the zzso The size of the zzso with a zzso value of zzso and higher on zzso MR images decrease with time, however, the zzso with a zzso below zzso did not show any size zzso The zzso of zzso and higher is a good indicator predicting spontaneous reduction of the zzso zzso in the zzso may play an important role in the reduction of the zzso disc zzso
