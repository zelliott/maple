To measure zzso fluid zzso flow zzso in the zzso zzso in patients with idiopathic zzso zzso 

Patient consent for this retrospective study was zzso by the institutional review board within the guidelines of zzso The authors reviewed the medical records of a neurosurgery specialty clinic to identify patients with zzso is, zzso without evidence of zzso zzso zzso or substantial spine zzso Patients without zzso or zzso zzso identified from the review served as control zzso The data of patients and control subjects who had undergone zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging were included in the zzso MR flow images were inspected for evidence of zzso zzso zzso flow and zzso spatial and zzso flow zzso Peak zzso flow zzso in the IS and control groups were zzso and differences were tested for statistical significance by using the zzso rank sum zzso 

Eight patients who met the criteria for IS and six who met the criteria to serve as control subjects were zzso The zzso MR images obtained in five of the eight patients with IS and in none of the control subjects depicted zzso zzso flow and/or large flow zzso Mean peak zzso zzso zzso flow zzso were zzso zzso in the IS group and zzso zzso in the control zzso the difference was significant zzso zzso zzso Mean peak zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso in the IS and control groups, zzso the difference was not significant zzso zzso zzso 

Some patients with IS have increased peak zzso zzso flow zzso
