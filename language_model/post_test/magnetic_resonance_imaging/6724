This study examined brain zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso healthy participants performed a fixed zzso zzso pinch force, zzso tracking task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The dynamic task required the subject to press a rubber bulb with the thumb to trace a zzso square wave varying in force zzso from zzso zzso and having a frequency of zzso zzso Response hand order and direction of the stimulus presentation zzso or zzso were zzso across zzso Two forms of functional cerebral asymmetry were observed, zzso specialization and zzso zzso zzso The superior portion of the right middle frontal zzso and the left supplementary motor area appeared specialized for zzso tracking regardless of response hand used or stimulus movement zzso zzso effects appeared in the primary zzso hand area, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso These zzso areas of zzso surfaced when either response hand or direction of stimulus movement was zzso The zzso task used in this study activated zzso neural activity in the vertically organized zzso system and in sensory systems involving visual attention or zzso
