Recent studies disclosed zzso zzso in layer 3 of the association zzso in patients with progressive zzso zzso This zzso may be associated with corpus zzso zzso and may impair the function of cortical regions indispensable for complex cognitive zzso To investigate whether corpus zzso zzso is associated with cognitive impairment and cerebral cortical zzso we studied 10 patients with progressive zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso with zzso as a zzso Compared with 23 zzso control subjects, the patients had significantly decreased zzso zzso area ratios, with anterior predominance of the degree of zzso The corpus zzso zzso was accompanied by a decreased mean cortical zzso zzso rate, predominantly in the frontal region of the cortex, and poor performance on the picture arrangement zzso of the zzso Adult Intelligence zzso and the verbal zzso zzso We conclude that corpus zzso zzso with anterior predominance is present in progressive zzso zzso and that this zzso is associated with cognitive impairment and cerebral cortical zzso especially in the frontal cortical zzso Corpus zzso zzso may reflect the pathological changes in the cerebral cortex, zzso in the frontal region, that contribute to the development of frontal lobe dysfunction in this zzso
