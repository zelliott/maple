This paper reports the first ever detailed study about eye movement patterns during single object recognition in visual zzso Eye movements were recorded in a patient with an zzso zzso deficit during two recognition tasks: common object naming and novel object recognition zzso The patient showed normal directional biases in zzso and fixation dwell times in both tasks and was as likely as controls to fixate within object zzso zzso regardless of recognition zzso In contrast, following initial zzso of similar zzso to controls, the patient showed a bias for short zzso In object naming, but not in recognition memory, the similarity of the spatial zzso of patient and control zzso was modulated by recognition zzso The study provides new evidence about how eye movements can be used to zzso the functional zzso underlying object recognition zzso We argue that the results reflect a breakdown in normal functional processes involved in the integration of shape information across object structure during the visual perception of zzso
