Recent experimental data have shown that an increase of zzso zzso acids and the initiation of inflammatory responses within the injured spinal zzso may play a role in post-traumatic zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso MR imaging with apparent diffusion zzso zzso maps could provide earlier evidence of spinal zzso zzso in a rat model of zzso than available with conventional MR zzso 

The spinal zzso gray matter of four rats was injected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Animals were sacrificed at 1, 4, or 8 weeks after injection, and the spinal cords were fixed in zzso for 1 week and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso One control zzso was also zzso zzso maps were constructed from the zzso zzso zzso analyses of sections stained with zzso violet were compared with the MR zzso 

By 1 week after injection, zzso maps at the level of injection showed areas within the gray matter of increased intensity and increased zzso values as compared with the control zzso These bright areas corresponded to zzso or cavities within the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso values within affected gray matter areas progressively increased at 4 and 8 weeks, also corresponding to zzso zzso Conventional zzso and zzso images showed corresponding zzso with zzso characteristics at 4 and 8 weeks, but not at 1 zzso 

In an animal model of zzso zzso imaging with zzso maps detected zzso zzso within spinal zzso gray matter before they were seen on conventional zzso and zzso zzso
