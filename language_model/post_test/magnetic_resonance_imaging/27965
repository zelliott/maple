The authors assess performing zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso after zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso contrast agent, as an invasive but potentially highly sensitive means of focal zzso zzso 

Eight pigs underwent superior zzso artery zzso and injection of 10 zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging at zzso T zzso was performed before, then at 15 and 30 minutes after zzso Seven or more days later, the same zzso protocol was performed after intravenous injection of 10 zzso zzso 

Fifteen minutes after zzso injection, enhancement of the liver predominated zzso zzso zzso followed by the zzso zzso (44 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso At 30 minutes, enhancement of zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in enhancement of the liver, zzso zzso or zzso zzso when we compared zzso and intravenous zzso 

After the injection of 10 zzso zzso into the superior zzso artery of pigs there is no significant difference in visceral organ enhancement compared to intravenous zzso The data suggests that the zzso binding sites may be overwhelmed by this dose and/or injection rate of zzso
