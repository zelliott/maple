This study aims to understand the neurological manifestations of patients with an indeterminate zzso repeat length zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso evaluation of 10 patients was zzso zzso of follow-up was zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso Three patients had a zzso repeat length of 37, three 38 and four zzso Mean zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso Data from clinical zzso neurological zzso the United zzso Disease zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging were zzso 

Four patients developed facial chorea, zzso impaired tongue zzso abnormal zzso and intermittent eye pursuits, zzso and impaired zzso 3 hand zzso Early in its natural history the neurological syndrome is dominated by zzso chorea, subtle cognitive deficits and mild zzso Three patients developed a formal diagnosis of HD within 5 zzso The illness progression was variable and associated with different zzso zzso scans showed zzso zzso as a common zzso Scores from zzso Total zzso zzso zzso and zzso state examination zzso suggested significant zzso and functional impairment with compromised cognitive zzso Two patients had subtle manifestations and four remained zzso (3 patients zzso 1 patient zzso 

This study documents the disease manifestations and natural history of people with zzso repeat lengths within the indeterminate zzso The findings reveal zzso in disease progression and have implications on the advice that should be given to patients and families on risk assessment and zzso zzso follow up of such patients is essential as the neurological presentation of indeterminate zzso repeat length zzso might be accelerated by associated medical disorders and treatments, environmental and zzso genetic zzso
