The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of zzso zzso in zzso of the index zzso of prostate zzso 

Fifty-one patients who underwent zzso zzso of the prostate with a pelvic zzso zzso that included zzso zzso and dynamic zzso sequences before zzso were zzso Six zzso assessed all images to identify the zzso most suspicious of being the index zzso which was localized to one of 18 zzso A zzso using the same zzso scheme reviewed the zzso slides to zzso the index zzso zzso performance was assessed by requiring either an exact match or an approximate match zzso of up to one zzso between the zzso and zzso findings in terms of assigned zzso 

The pathologist identified an index zzso in 49 of 51 zzso In zzso analysis, the average sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso and the average positive zzso value zzso was zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, the average sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso and the average zzso was zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity was higher for index zzso with a zzso score greater than 6 in zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso zzso analyses and for index zzso measuring at least 1 zzso in zzso analysis zzso vs zzso zzso In zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso of abnormalities found with one, two, and three zzso parameters represented the index zzso zzso 

The sensitivity and zzso of zzso zzso for index zzso zzso were moderate, although they improved in the setting of more aggressive zzso features and a greater number of abnormal zzso zzso zzso
