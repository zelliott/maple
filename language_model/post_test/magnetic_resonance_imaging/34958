Response zzso is one of the highest evolved executive functions of human zzso Previous studies revealed a wide variety of brain regions related to response zzso although some of them may not be directly related to zzso but to zzso effects or zzso cognitive functions such as attention, response competition, or error zzso Here, we conducted zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in which all subjects performed both zzso and zzso tasks in order to explore key neural zzso within the response zzso network irrelevant to task designs and other cognitive zzso The successful zzso in the zzso and zzso tasks, respectively, activated a set of predominantly zzso zzso zzso The common zzso regions across the two tasks included the right middle prefrontal zzso in addition to the right middle zzso zzso zzso analysis was carried out within these areas between intensity of zzso and behavioral performance in the two zzso Only the region located in the middle prefrontal zzso showed significant correlations in both zzso We believe this region is the key locus for execution of response zzso in the distributed zzso neural zzso
