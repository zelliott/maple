zzso for zzso as an acute stroke treatment is determined through the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso time since stroke zzso and patient zzso Assessing zzso patterns, which can be examined only through the use of diagnostic technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso CT zzso may be able to better select patients for zzso However, zzso in terms of administration time and cost may affect the value of using these diagnostic zzso 

We examined the zzso among patient selection via usual care with CT, usual care plus zzso using zzso and zzso imaging, and usual care plus zzso for their effect on costs and outcomes when diagnosing stroke and selecting candidates for zzso in the United zzso 

A zzso model was zzso zzso and utilities were obtained from published zzso zzso were obtained from standard UK costing sources and were supplemented with data from the published zzso Outcomes included a favorable outcome zzso Rankin zzso score zzso costs, zzso zzso zzso and incremental zzso zzso 

Compared with usual care selection, adding zzso or zzso to better select patients for zzso reduced the number of patients receiving zzso by 9 and zzso per 1000 patients treated, respectively, while improving favorable outcome zzso and zzso per 1000 patients treated, zzso In both scenarios, costs were decreased zzso Both zzso and zzso selection were cost saving (more zzso and less zzso compared with zzso CT zzso zzso selection was found to dominate zzso zzso 

Adding diagnostic tests such as zzso and zzso to select UK patients for zzso may be a good value for the money and may improve patient zzso If a preferred diagnostic test had to be chosen based on economic value, zzso might be the best compromise between zzso CT selection and zzso zzso
