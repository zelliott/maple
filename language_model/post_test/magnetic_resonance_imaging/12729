zzso is the zzso of sound that is not related to an acoustic source outside the zzso For many forms of zzso mechanisms in the central nervous system are believed to play an important role in the zzso Specifically, three mechanisms have been proposed to zzso zzso zzso changes in the level of spontaneous neural activity in the central auditory system, zzso changes in the zzso pattern of neural activity, and zzso reorganization of zzso zzso The zzso methods zzso and PET measure signals that presumably reflect the firing rates of multiple zzso and are assumed to be sensitive to changes in the level of neural zzso There are two basic zzso that have been applied in functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso responses as well as steady state neural activity have been measured to compare zzso patients to healthy zzso zzso zzso that involve zzso of zzso by a controlled stimulus allow for a zzso comparison that identifies neural activity that may be correlated to the zzso zzso Even though there are many differences across studies, the general trend emerging from the zzso studies, is that zzso in humans may zzso to enhanced neural activity across several centers of the central auditory zzso Also, neural activity in zzso areas including the frontal areas, the zzso system and the zzso seems associated with the perception of zzso These results indicate that in addition to the auditory system, zzso systems may represent a neural correlate of zzso Although the currently published zzso studies typically show a correspondence between zzso and enhanced neural activity, it will be important to perform future studies on subject groups that are closely matched for characteristics such as age, gender and hearing loss in order to rule out the contribution of these factors to the abnormalities specifically ascribed to zzso
