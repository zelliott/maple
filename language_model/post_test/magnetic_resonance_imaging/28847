To determine whether the zzso zzso lobe is zzso in subjects with mild cognitive zzso and whether zzso of this structure is a better predictor of zzso than memory zzso zzso zzso subjects aged zzso years were randomly selected from a population based study to obtain a sample with Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso and a clinically zzso sample zzso zzso zzso Twenty of the latter subjects displayed some cognitive impairment and fulfilled zzso criteria for zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to zzso the zzso zzso zzso The volume of the zzso zzso and zzso was measured, and zzso zzso lobe zzso was assessed zzso The memory zzso from the zzso was used as a measure of memory zzso The follow-up period was 3 zzso Nine subjects who were diagnosed as being minimally zzso at baseline met the criteria for zzso during zzso At baseline the volume of the zzso zzso of these subjects was smaller than that of the other subjects with minimal zzso The memory score was the best predictor of clinical zzso All zzso zzso lobe measures increased the accuracy of prediction compared with only the memory score, by reducing the number of zzso zzso of zzso Severe zzso zzso lobe zzso is present even in some subjects with mild cognitive impairment and is an indicator of subsequent zzso The absence of zzso zzso lobe zzso however, does not exclude the development of zzso In the majority of subjects memory impairment was a better predictor of zzso than zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The combination of the two increased zzso zzso zzso subjects with severe zzso of the zzso zzso lobe could be enrolled in drug trials aimed at slowing the progression of zzso
