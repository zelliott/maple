In conventional zzso gated zzso imaging of the heart, slice position and phase in the heart cycle are not independent zzso This drawback is removed by simultaneous imaging of multiple zzso This paper describes a technique which is based on simultaneous zzso of several slices by zzso selective zzso zzso In comparison to conventional cardiac zzso imaging an improved quality of heart images is zzso because more acquisitions are attributed to the MR signal of the zzso The gain in zzso ratio per measurement time increases with the square root of the number of slices investigated zzso This is demonstrated using phantom experiments and cardiac zzso
