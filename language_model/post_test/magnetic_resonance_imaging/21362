The association between zzso delay and zzso damage has previously been assessed by evaluation of the duration from symptom onset to invasive treatment, but results have been zzso System delay defined as the duration from first medical contact to first balloon zzso is less prone to bias and is also zzso The purpose was to evaluate the impact of system delay on zzso salvage index zzso and zzso size in patients with zzso zzso zzso treated with primary zzso coronary intervention zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and final zzso size were assessed using cardiovascular magnetic zzso zzso area at risk was measured within 1 to 7 days, and final zzso size was measured 90 zzso 21 days after zzso Patients were grouped according to system delay zzso to zzso 121 to 180, and zzso zzso 

In 219 patients, shorter system delay was associated with a smaller zzso size zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso and larger zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso for a system delay of up to zzso 121 to 180, and zzso minutes, zzso A short system delay as a continuous variable independently predicted a smaller zzso size zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and larger zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in multivariable linear zzso zzso Finally, shorter system delay zzso minutes) was associated with improved function zzso zzso zzso and volumes of left zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A shorter system delay resulted in smaller zzso size, larger zzso and improved zzso function in patients treated with primary zzso Thus, this study confirms that minimizing system delay is crucial for primary zzso zzso
