We present a case of focal zzso sponge kidney zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso of a patient with history of zzso revealed a left zzso mass of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images revealed a mass of mixed intensity protruding toward the zzso zzso On zzso zzso MR images, the zzso remarkable zzso suggested the presence of an zzso of tiny zzso On zzso MR images, the mass also demonstrated high intensity, and its apparent diffusion zzso was partly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso images revealed no zzso in the zzso Although slight enhancement was seen in the zzso phase, thick and dense streaks of contrast radiating peripherally were identified in the mass in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso We discuss the potential of MR imaging for diagnosing focal zzso
