We tested the hypothesis that retinal blood flow has a zzso zzso zzso response modulated by zzso duration and zzso activity, and that zzso blood flow does zzso 

zzso and paralyzed rats zzso zzso 34) were zzso zzso and zzso blood flow was measured by laser zzso imaging and laser zzso zzso zzso Blood zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso was used to measure changes in relative blood zzso of the retinal and zzso zzso zzso carotid zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso on the common carotid zzso Several zzso zzso were tested during dark, constant light, and flicker light conditions to zzso zzso zzso The zzso response magnitude was zzso by zzso the area above the blood flow baseline for the 3 minutes after release of the zzso 

zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by the carotid zzso and was similar among animals and zzso zzso blood flow had a zzso zzso but zzso blood flow did not zzso 14 zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso The zzso magnitude increased as a zzso function of zzso duration and reached a plateau at zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso The zzso magnitude was not altered by different lighting conditions at zzso zzso of 15 and 60 zzso zzso zzso results were similar to the zzso blood flow zzso 

The results indicate that zzso local control has a negligible role in zzso blood flow regulation and only partially accounts for the blood flow behavior in the retinal zzso
