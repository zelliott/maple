The left zzso and adjacent regions have been implicated in processing and zzso familiar words, yet its role in zzso novel characters has not been well zzso 

Using functional zzso the present study examined the hypothesis that the left zzso is also involved in zzso novel characters and spaced learning could enhance the memory by enhancing the left zzso activity during zzso zzso native Chinese readers were scanned while zzso the visual form of 120 Korean characters that were novel to the zzso Each character was repeated four times during zzso zzso suppression was manipulated by using two different repetition zzso massed learning and spaced learning, zzso mixed within the same scanning zzso Under the massed learning condition, the four repetitions were consecutive (with a zzso zzso zzso to improve the design zzso Under the spaced learning condition, the four repetitions were zzso with a minimal zzso lag of 6 zzso zzso learning significantly improved zzso performance during the recognition memory test administered one hour after the zzso zzso left zzso and inferior zzso zzso activities during learning zzso across four zzso were associated with better memory of the characters, based on both zzso and zzso zzso Compared to massed learning, spaced learning significantly reduced neural repetition suppression and increased the overall activities in these regions, which were associated with better memory for novel zzso 

These results demonstrated a strong link between cortical activity in the left zzso and memory for novel characters, and thus challenge the visual word form area zzso zzso Our results also shed light on the neural mechanisms of the spacing effect in zzso novel zzso
