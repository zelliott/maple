Human zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso transplantation has been shown to promote zzso and zzso in central nervous system zzso injuries and neurodegenerative zzso To develop this approach into a clinical setting it is important to be able to follow the fates of transplanted cells by zzso zzso zzso precursor cells and zzso stem cells can be efficiently labeled by zzso iron oxide zzso zzso The purpose of our study was to zzso evaluate the influence of zzso on zzso and the feasibility of tracking for zzso by zzso zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging zzso can efficiently detect low numbers of zzso zzso and that the intensity of the signal was zzso to the number of labeled zzso After transplantation into focal areas in adult rat spinal zzso transplanted zzso zzso produced a zzso signal using zzso zzso in rats that persisted for up to 2 zzso This study demonstrated the feasibility of zzso imaging of transplanted zzso
