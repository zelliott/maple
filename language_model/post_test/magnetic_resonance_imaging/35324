To characterize imaging findings from zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso in patients with infected zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed the records of 21 patients zzso zzso women, 4) with proven infected zzso zzso and compared the imaging findings zzso zzso scans, zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance images, zzso zzso 2; and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were located in the descending zzso zzso zzso zzso 10; zzso abdominal zzso zzso zzso 6; zzso zzso arch zzso zzso 3; zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2; zzso zzso were zzso in 19 zzso and zzso in 2 zzso zzso diameters were greater than 10 zzso in 2 patients zzso 5 to 10 zzso in 11 zzso and less than 5 zzso in 8 zzso Average diameters were zzso zzso in the zzso arch, zzso zzso in the descending zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the abdominal zzso zzso zzso wall zzso occurred in 19 patients zzso Other features included disrupted zzso zzso zzso 15; zzso prominent and irregular wall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso soft tissue mass zzso zzso 15; zzso rim enhancement zzso zzso 18; zzso zzso gas zzso zzso 7; zzso zzso zzso and fluid retention zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3; zzso adjacent bone destruction zzso zzso 1; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12; zzso and associated zzso aneurysm zzso zzso 2; zzso 

zzso zzso adjacent soft tissue masses, rim enhancement, zzso fluid, gas, and unusual adjacent zzso destruction highly suggest infected zzso
