zzso and zzso studies suggest that upright and zzso face stimuli are processed by zzso and zzso distinct zzso Specifically, zzso faces seem to be addressed by general object perception systems, avoiding zzso zzso We tested this model by examining the zzso signal response of a functionally defined zzso face area and bilateral zzso cortical areas during the perception of upright and zzso stimuli zzso and zzso While inversion of face stimuli had no effect upon the magnitude of responses in the zzso face area, zzso faces evoked greater neural responses compared to upright faces within object zzso This finding supports the assertion that object areas are involved to a greater degree in the perception of zzso vs upright zzso
