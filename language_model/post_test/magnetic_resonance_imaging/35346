Prior research has identified the lateral zzso complex zzso as a critical cortical region for the representation of object shape in zzso However, little is known about the nature of the representations contained in the zzso and their relationship to the zzso experience of zzso We used human functional zzso to measure the physical, zzso and neural similarity between pairs of novel shapes to ask whether the representations of shape contained in zzso of the zzso more closely reflect the physical stimuli themselves, or the zzso experience of those zzso zzso similarity measures for each pair of shapes were obtained from a zzso zzso zzso physical similarity measures were based on stimulus zzso and neural similarity measures were obtained from zzso pattern analysis methods applied to anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that the pattern of zzso shape similarities in zzso most closely matched physical shape similarities, whereas shape similarities in zzso most closely matched zzso shape zzso Further, shape representations were similar across participants in zzso but highly variable across participants in zzso Together, these findings indicate that zzso patterns in zzso of zzso zzso zzso objects according to a zzso with zzso representations in zzso regions and zzso and zzso representations in anterior zzso
