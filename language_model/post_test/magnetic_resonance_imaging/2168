This study aimed to investigate the suitability of using zzso muscle thickness zzso zzso to estimate the muscle volume zzso of the zzso zzso as an alternative approach to magnetic resonance imaging zzso The subjects were 46 men aged from 20 to 70 years who were randomly allocated to either a validation or a zzso zzso In the validation group, multiple and simple zzso zzso which used a set of zzso values determined at zzso and thigh length zzso and the product of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, as independent zzso were derived to estimate the zzso measured by zzso Because the two equations were zzso the data from the two groups were pooled to generate the final prediction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the multiple zzso equation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the simple zzso zzso In the multiple zzso zzso zzso explained zzso of the variation in the zzso measured by zzso The zzso and the standard error of the estimate zzso of the equations were zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for the multiple zzso equation and zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for the simple zzso zzso Thus, the present results indicate that zzso zzso zzso at zzso are useful for zzso the zzso of knee zzso However, the observed SEE values suggest that the prediction equation obtained in this study may be limited to population studies rather than individual assessments in zzso zzso
