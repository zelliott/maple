Increased relative cerebral blood volume zzso was previously found in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso is not increased in zzso we aimed to evaluate whether zzso values of the whole zzso area are accurate to differentiate solitary zzso from zzso irrespective of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso dynamic zzso contrast zzso was performed in 52 patients with zzso solitary brain zzso before zzso In each zzso slice depicting the zzso zzso a rim within approximately zzso was defined in the zzso zzso The zzso values were zzso to zzso values of the zzso normal white zzso zzso between zzso and zzso for zzso zzso values for each slice were determined with the zzso U test zzso 

zzso examination revealed 29 zzso and 23 zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower in zzso than in zzso zzso Using the zzso value zzso for discriminating zzso from zzso yielded a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso a positive zzso value of zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso 

The zzso in the zzso area of zzso brain zzso has a high diagnostic accuracy to discriminate zzso from zzso irrespective of surrounding zzso and without the bias of slice selection and zzso zzso zzso should be zzso if at least one zzso slice reveals an increase of zzso zzso compared to the normal zzso brain zzso zzso value zzso zzso the decrease of zzso zzso may not reliably exclude zzso
