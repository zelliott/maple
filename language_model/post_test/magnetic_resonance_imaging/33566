zzso of the magnetic field zzso by a 50 zzso long auditory zzso from three normal subjects and one head injured subject, are used to estimate the three zzso distribution of generators in the zzso The resulting images are compared with point source solutions obtained with the usual single current zzso fitting procedures, over a zzso range which includes the zzso in the zzso measured zzso In all cases considered, 100 or so epochs zzso to the stimulus were zzso zzso These were zzso and then analyzed using two zzso a new distributed current model known as zzso Field zzso zzso and the standard single current zzso zzso zzso Both methods provide estimates of the current generators in the zzso In two of the normal subjects, the zzso solutions are zzso onto zzso zzso Images zzso of the relevant cortical zzso The results show that when the zzso model provides a reasonable description of the data, the zzso estimate shows one dominant localized region in agreement with the current zzso zzso In the zzso sequence of solutions the activity zzso smoothly; multiple areas of activity often arise as the focal activity in one region declines while focal activity in another region zzso In contrast the zzso solutions during these intermediate periods fit the data poorly, and may move erratically from one locale to zzso We conclude that zzso seems to provide a reasonable description of the activity through cortical and zzso zzso The evolution of activity, as derived from the average zzso can be traced continuously from the onset of the zzso not just at the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
