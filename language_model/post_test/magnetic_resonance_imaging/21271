We investigated zzso levels during the progression of pathology in zzso rats, a transgenic animal model of Alzheimer's disease, and in healthy zzso zzso zzso were subjected to in zzso zzso H magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at age 3, 9 and 12 months and of frontal zzso at 9 and 12 zzso At 3 months, a stage in which only zzso zzso are present, lower zzso zzso and total zzso content were apparent in zzso zzso At age 9 months, lower levels of zzso zzso zzso and total zzso and elevated zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso whereas lower levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in frontal zzso At age 12 months, only the zzso level was significantly different in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and total zzso levels were significantly higher in frontal zzso zzso rats did not show the same changes in zzso levels with age as displayed in the controls, and overall, prominent and complex zzso differences were evident in this transgenic rat model of Alzheimer's zzso The findings also demonstrate that in zzso zzso H MRS is a powerful tool to investigate zzso zzso changes in the zzso
