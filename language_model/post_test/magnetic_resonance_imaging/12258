zzso zzso are a manifestation of small vessel disease and are common in patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso However, their clinical significance in this condition is zzso We hypothesized that zzso contribute to disturbances of the cerebral network in zzso and as such may affect zzso 

The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between zzso and brain networks in patients with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso or early zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso 29) or early zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent cognitive testing and zzso zzso zzso were rated zzso zzso zzso imaging and graph theoretical analysis were used to reconstruct brain networks and to zzso network efficiency for each zzso Network measures were compared between patients without and with zzso zzso and between patients without or with zzso zzso In secondary zzso cognitive functioning was compared between zzso zzso were adjusted for age and zzso and additionally for other markers of small vessel disease and zzso 

Network measures did not differ between patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 26) and patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso However, patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significant white matter zzso longer path zzso and less global efficiency than patients without zzso independent of other markers of small vessel disease and zzso zzso functioning did not differ between patients without zzso and patients with zzso or zzso zzso 

Multiple zzso are related to structural network disruption in patients with early zzso but their direct impact on cognitive functioning appears to be zzso
