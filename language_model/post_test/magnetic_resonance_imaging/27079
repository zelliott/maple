A major issue in zzso processing concerns storage and access of zzso zzso Here we make use of the base frequency effect to examine zzso Specifically, reaction time to zzso complex words zzso made up of base and suffix, zzso zzso typically reflects frequency of the base element zzso total frequency of all words in which agree zzso rather than surface word frequency zzso frequency of agreeable zzso We term these complex words zzso However, a class of words termed zzso do not show such sensitivity to base frequency zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso design, we exploited the fact that processing zzso words increases zzso activity relative to high frequency ones, and examined effects of base frequency on brain activity for zzso and zzso zzso zzso complex words, half high and half low base frequency, were compared to match high and low frequency simple zzso words using a zzso decision zzso zzso complex words increased zzso in the left inferior frontal and left superior zzso zzso versus simple zzso The only area to mirror the behavioral distinction between the zzso and the zzso types was the zzso Surprisingly, most zzso areas failed to show base frequency zzso This variety of responses to frequency and word type across brain areas supports an zzso view of multiple variables during zzso access, rather than a zzso between zzso access and zzso zzso zzso access appears best captured as interplay of several neural processes with different sensitivities to various linguistic factors including frequency and zzso zzso
