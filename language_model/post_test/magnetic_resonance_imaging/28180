Central zzso is an impairment of color perception caused by damage to the visual association zzso Its zzso zzso remain poorly zzso We report our attempt to characterize the zzso along critical dimensions of color space, taking advantage of the same standardized tasks that allow detailed profiles in patients with retinal cone zzso We studied two zzso The results in patient 1 showed that zzso color space was collapsed along the zzso zzso and zzso cone zzso dimensions but that zzso along zzso dimensions were relatively zzso Additional observations showed that the zzso was dependent on target size, and that processing of surface and light source effects that differ from color zzso zzso was zzso Patient 2 showed a less severe color processing zzso involving signals arising from the zzso of the zzso although an zzso zzso was also zzso The profiles in these two patients demonstrate that central zzso encompasses a range of color processing zzso with varied zzso zzso
