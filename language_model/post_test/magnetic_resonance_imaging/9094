It is commonly assumed that functional brain connectivity reflects structural brain zzso The exact relationship between structure and function, however, might not be zzso In this review we aim to examine how our understanding of the relationship between structure and function in the zzso brain has advanced over the last several zzso We discuss eight articles that directly compare zzso functional connectivity with structural connectivity and three clinical case studies of patients with limited white matter connections between the cerebral zzso All studies examined show largely zzso zzso the strength of zzso functional connectivity is positively correlated with structural connectivity zzso However, functional connectivity is also observed between regions where there is little or no structural zzso which most likely indicates functional correlations zzso by indirect structural connections zzso via a third zzso As the zzso for measuring structural and functional connectivity continue to improve and their complementary strengths are applied in zzso we can expect important advances in our diagnostic and zzso capacities in diseases like zzso multiple zzso and zzso
