Recovery mechanisms supporting upper zzso motor recovery following stroke are well established, but cortical mechanism associated with lower zzso motor recovery is zzso The aim of this study was to assess cortical reorganization associated with lower zzso motor recovery in a zzso zzso 

Six control subjects and a 17 year-old woman with left zzso zzso due to an zzso zzso zzso were zzso The motor function of the zzso (left) hip and knee had recovered slowly to the extent of her being able to overcome gravity for 10 months after the onset of zzso However, her zzso upper zzso showed no significant motor zzso Blood zzso level dependent zzso functional zzso at zzso zzso was used to determine the zzso location of cortical zzso in the zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso in combination with a novel zzso reconstruction zzso was zzso to investigate the pattern of the zzso zzso connectivity between the areas of the motor zzso All subjects' body parts were secured in the scanner and performed a sequential knee zzso with a predetermined angle of zzso degrees at zzso zzso 

zzso showed anticipated zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the descending zzso fibers stemming from motor zzso In contrast to control normal subjects, the stroke patient showed zzso zzso only in the unaffected (right) primary zzso during either zzso or zzso knee zzso zzso fiber tracing data showed that the zzso tract fibers were found only in the unaffected zzso but not in the affected zzso 

Our results indicate that an zzso motor zzso from the unaffected (right) motor zzso to the zzso (right) leg was present in this zzso This study raises the potential that the zzso zzso zzso is involved in cortical reorganization associated lower zzso motor recovery in zzso This study is the first zzso evidence that the combined zzso and zzso fiber tracing can significantly expand the explanatory power of probing cortical reorganization underlying motor recovery mechanism in zzso
