zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has the potential to zzso zzso zzso To date, however, no agent has been found that has a sustained effect that allows zzso detection for the entire duration of zzso and zzso and thus is useful in conjunction with stress test zzso In this article, we introduce the zzso complex of zzso zzso acid zzso an agent potentially useful for such a zzso 

Four protocols were carried zzso zzso partially zzso zzso zzso was used in protocols A through zzso In protocol A, in zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso induced a 70 zzso zzso intensity enhancement lasting 3 zzso In protocol B, the left anterior descending coronary artery was zzso and a zzso zzso contrast verified zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso 5) or zzso zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso In the zzso group a sustained contrast and in the zzso group a short-lived contrast were zzso In protocol C zzso zzso zzso during zzso a 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast was evident between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso a contrast of 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso persisted for 5 and 15 minutes, zzso Beyond 15 minutes, the contrast continued to diminish zzso zzso zzso verified zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso in this zzso In protocol D zzso zzso zzso blood delta zzso data showed that the blood pool retained zzso for the entire time frame of the experiment at high enough concentration to provide an appropriate zzso effect during the initial contrast enhancement and during zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso zzso a sustained zzso contrast between regions of normal versus zzso zzso showing the potential of this agent for the diagnosis of zzso heart disease in conjunction with stress zzso
