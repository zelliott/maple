Spinal zzso zzso is a useful tool for studying spinal mechanisms of pain, hence for zzso drug zzso Its technical feasibility in both humans and rats has been zzso This study investigates the zzso zzso and spatial accuracy of zzso of zzso spinal zzso zzso due to zzso noxious and zzso electrical stimulation of the zzso in zzso zzso Blood zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso zzso data were acquired without and with intravenous injection of ultra small zzso iron oxide particles zzso respectively, using a zzso echo zzso echo zzso imaging zzso technique at zzso zzso zzso zzso in the spinal zzso induced by noxious stimulation to the zzso (2 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso known to activate zzso can be robustly detected by both zzso techniques with excellent zzso and peaked at the stimulus frequency of 40 zzso However, both zzso techniques were not sensitive to zzso zzso in spinal zzso induced by zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso zzso known only to activate zzso zzso the zzso signal extended approximately 5 zzso in the zzso direction, covering zzso zzso In the zzso direction, the highest signal change of blood zzso zzso was in the middle of the zzso zzso horn, which roughly zzso to zzso V and zzso while the highest signal change of zzso zzso was in the zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that spinal zzso zzso can be performed in zzso rats reliably and zzso offering it as a potential tool for zzso drug zzso
