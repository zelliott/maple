Since patient cooperation in zzso and infants up to 5 years is always reduced, deep sedation is usually recommended to obtain constant high-quality images during zzso According to the widely accepted zzso zzso deep sedation is not always distinguishable from general zzso zzso the demand for state-of-the-art zzso This is particularly true in this age group, where zzso and zzso show wide zzso zzso In this review we outline the techniques required to provide safe and effective patient care in the unique zzso zzso 

From the viewpoint of induction time, zzso of action and success rate, we have found that inhalation zzso and zzso present clear zzso Both offer rapid induction and zzso allowing zzso examinations in a tight schedule with a reliable sedation zzso zzso zzso or a zzso mask airway is required to supply volatile zzso and to secure the zzso since zzso in appropriate doses causes respiratory depression and loss of the protective zzso zzso ventilation is recommended since the reduction of tidal volumes by sedative drugs (including high-dose zzso zzso zzso may cause zzso and decreased oxygen zzso 

Several zzso work well outside a critical magnetic field strength of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The use of long zzso tubing zzso zzso allows the zzso to be placed at the zzso end of the patient zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso tube zzso facilitate compensation for losses in tidal volume due to gas zzso zzso pumps work properly when kept outside the 10 zzso zzso Some zzso zzso zzso zzso are approved for use in strong magnetic zzso 

zzso monitoring is also zzso for high-risk patients, including invasive pressure zzso Since wiring without special filters may not cross the zzso shield of the examination room, zzso and zzso systems are used zzso pressure by zzso airway monitoring by zzso zzso zzso fibers are used for pulse zzso A zzso zzso is usually provided by the zzso zzso Because zzso are distorted by the magnetic field, the monitors are placed outside the examination zzso In addition, this eliminates the possibility of erasing the zzso contained in most zzso 

With the setup zzso the presence of a second zzso within the examination room is zzso A second zzso team can shorten the time lag between examinations by overlapping induction if a separate zzso induction and emergence room is zzso 

The level of sedation required for zzso in newborn and infants can only be achieved safely and efficiently by general zzso performed by trained zzso Complete state-of-the-art zzso care can be delivered if appropriate zzso is zzso
