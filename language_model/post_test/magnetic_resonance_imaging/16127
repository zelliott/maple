One finding in recent motor control and learning research is that an external focus zzso attending to environmental zzso improves performance, whereas an internal focus zzso controlling bodily zzso zzso zzso Despite being zzso in behavioral studies, the zzso basis of this phenomenon remains largely zzso The present authors separate global attention to actions into an external and an internal zzso Using a zzso design, participants were either trained to attend to moving their fingers zzso zzso or to the keys to be hit zzso zzso during learning a finger zzso zzso they applied functional magnetic resonance imaging under focus zzso dual task, and zzso zzso zzso revealed higher zzso in primary zzso and motor zzso for an external compared to an internal zzso The authors conclude that external participants focused on the zzso environment zzso the zzso to enhance tactile input to zzso areas that closely connect to motor zzso
