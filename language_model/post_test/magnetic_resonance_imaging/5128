We evaluated the effect of short-term and long-term heroin zzso on brain responses to zzso cues using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso male heroin addicts following short-term zzso and 19 male heroin addicts following long-term zzso underwent zzso scanning while viewing zzso and neutral zzso zzso craving and withdrawal symptoms in the subjects were zzso 

Following short-term zzso greater zzso was found in response to heroin cues compared to neutral cues in bilateral zzso zzso zzso cingulate, anterior cingulate, thalamus, zzso and left zzso In contrast, zzso in bilateral zzso and zzso and zzso in bilateral zzso bilateral zzso left zzso cingulate, zzso thalamus, zzso zzso and bilateral zzso were observed following long-term zzso zzso comparisons between conditions showed greater brain zzso in response to smoking cues following short-term zzso In addition, short-term zzso had more serious withdrawal symptoms than the zzso 

The present findings indicate that compared to zzso long-term zzso zzso less serious withdrawal symptoms and significantly decreases neural responses to zzso cues in brain regions zzso visual sensory processing, attention, memory, and action zzso These findings suggest that long-term zzso can decrease the zzso of zzso cues, thereby reducing the risk of zzso The study's limitations are zzso
