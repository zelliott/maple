zzso motion of the zzso fluid zzso was investigated by analysis of the zzso phase of zzso zzso and zzso signal enhancement in magnitude images using zzso zzso zzso In the cerebral aqueduct, zzso flow from the third to the fourth zzso begins 200 zzso after the zzso of the zzso and simulates an zzso pulse wave zzso It lasts about zzso of the cardiac cycle and is followed by zzso from the fourth to the third zzso which is slower and zzso In the spinal canal, zzso zzso motion precedes flow from the third to the fourth zzso by about zzso zzso and is superimposed on a bulk flow, which moves simultaneously in opposite directions in separate zzso zzso it is directed mainly zzso in the anterior cervical zzso zzso
