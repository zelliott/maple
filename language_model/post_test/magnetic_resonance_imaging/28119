We evaluated the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso soft tissue zzso The series contained 37 cases, including 18 benign tumors, 8 zzso tumors, and 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso Images were obtained on a zzso T magnet with zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso were compared with those of zzso zzso images zzso and zzso zzso zzso images zzso The zzso images were similar to zzso images with respect to the signal behavior and internal architecture of the masses in many zzso In some instances, they were better than zzso images in zzso the zzso and adjacent fat zzso in zzso the zzso and adjacent small vessels, and in depicting special features such as zzso zzso They were inferior to zzso images in zzso the zzso and adjacent zzso Because of reduced zzso zzso zzso images can not be zzso for zzso images in the evaluation of zzso zzso but are useful as an adjunct in some zzso
