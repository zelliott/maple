The study aimed to identify brain zzso during direct and automatic processing of zzso stimuli in specific zzso 

zzso to zzso and neutral pictures zzso and zzso were measured by means of zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging during two different zzso In the identification task, subjects were asked to identify the object zzso or zzso In a demanding distraction task, subjects had to match geometric figures displayed in the foreground of the zzso 

zzso showed greater responses to zzso versus mushrooms in the left amygdala, left zzso left anterior zzso zzso zzso and left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso during the identification task and in the left and right zzso during the distraction zzso All of these zzso were also significantly increased compared to control subjects who did not show stronger brain zzso to zzso versus mushrooms under any task zzso 

Our findings propose specific neural zzso of automatic versus direct evaluation of zzso zzso While the amygdala, especially the right amygdala, seems to be zzso involved in automatic stimuli processing, zzso of areas such as the zzso zzso and zzso is rather associated with direct threat evaluation and requires sufficient zzso zzso
