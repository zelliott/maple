Time processing is important in several cognitive and motor functions, but it is still unclear how the human brain perceives time intervals of different zzso zzso of time in zzso and second intervals may depend on different neural networks and there is now considerable evidence to suggest that these intervals are possibly measured by independent brain zzso Using repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso we determined that the zzso is essential in explicit zzso processing of zzso time zzso In the first experiment, subjects' performance in a time reproduction task of short zzso zzso and long zzso zzso zzso were evaluated immediately after application of zzso zzso trains over the left and right lateral zzso zzso and the right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso We found that zzso over the lateral zzso impaired time perception in the short zzso zzso zzso only; for the second range zzso impaired timing was found selectively for stimulation of the right zzso In the second experiment, we observed that zzso involvement in zzso time processing was evident when the time intervals were zzso but not when they were retrieved from zzso Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso can be considered as an internal timing system, zzso to assess zzso time zzso
