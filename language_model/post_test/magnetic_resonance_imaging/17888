It remains unclear to what extent zzso maps can undergo large-scale plasticity following damage to human visual zzso The literature has predominately focused on zzso changes in patients with retinal zzso or zzso brain zzso Yet, damage to the adult visual zzso itself is common in cases such as stroke, zzso or zzso To address this issue, we used a unique database of zzso vision maps in patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathology of the visual zzso We identified zzso zzso organization in three patients zzso with zzso and one with zzso zzso consisting of an expanded zzso field representation that was on average zzso times greater than healthy zzso The expanded representations were located at the vertical zzso borders between visual areas such as zzso Additionally, two of the three patients had apparently an zzso zzso zzso representation of the zzso field within lateral zzso zzso that is normally associated with visual areas zzso (and possibly other zzso Both zzso cases had direct damage to early visual zzso itself (rather than to the zzso drive zzso resulting in a mostly zzso zzso The zzso case had severe cortical zzso of the visual zzso and was zzso Our results are consistent with a competitive model in which unilateral damage to visual zzso or disruption of the zzso connections removes zzso suppression from zzso zzso in intact visual zzso that represent the vertical zzso and zzso visual zzso
