Patients who have a greater distribution of zzso zzso tissue as compared with subcutaneous zzso tissue and an increased ratio of zzso zzso tissue to subcutaneous zzso tissue are at greater risk for developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes zzso In previous MR zzso researchers have used conventional zzso zzso images to determine the ratio of zzso zzso tissue to subcutaneous zzso zzso However, no investigation, to our knowledge, has been performed to determine the accuracy of using different MR sequences to estimate zzso zzso The purpose of our investigation was to compare MR imaging and zzso techniques in calculating the ratio of zzso to subcutaneous zzso tissue using an zzso zzso 

A phantom was created to simulate the distribution of subcutaneous and zzso fat (with known zzso zzso MR images were obtained twice through the phantom using a zzso slice thickness and zero gap for the following zzso zzso zzso fast Dixon, and three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso An in-house computer software program was then used to segment the volumes of fat and calculate the volume of zzso zzso tissue and subcutaneous zzso tissue and the ratio of zzso to subcutaneous zzso zzso Each imaging data set was segmented three times, so six sets of data were yielded for each imaging zzso The percentage predicted of the true volume was calculated for each MR imaging technique for each fat zzso The mean percentages for each variable were then compared using zzso analysis of zzso to determine whether differences exist among the three MR zzso 

The three MR imaging techniques had statistically significant different means for the predicted true volume of two zzso volume of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and volume of zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso Estimates based on fast Dixon images were closest to the true volumes for all the zzso All MR imaging techniques performed similarly in zzso the ratio of zzso zzso tissue to subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso The acquisition time for the zzso zzso zzso images was zzso times faster than for the other zzso 

Conventional zzso zzso MR imaging, the current sequence used in practice for measuring visceral zzso may not be the optimal MR sequence for this zzso We found that the zzso fast Dixon sequence was the most accurate at zzso all fat zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence generated similar ratios of zzso to subcutaneous zzso tissue in a fraction of the acquisition zzso
