zzso of working memory zzso systems in the frontal zzso have revealed two stimulus dimensions along which frontal cortical representations may be functionally zzso One hypothesized dimension zzso verbal from zzso zzso zzso dividing left from right frontal zzso The second hypothesized dimension zzso spatial from zzso zzso dividing zzso from zzso frontal zzso Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to probe zzso processes associated with three different types of zzso letters zzso and zzso abstract shapes zzso and zzso and locations zzso and zzso In a series of three experiments using the zzso zzso zzso direct statistical comparisons were made between zzso patterns in each zzso combination of the three stimulus zzso Across the experiments, no regions that demonstrated responses to zzso zzso were discovered to be unique to any of the three stimulus zzso zzso no evidence was found to support either a zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso While this could reflect a limitation of the present behavioral and imaging techniques, other factors that could account for the data are considered, including subjects' strategy selection, zzso of information into zzso and the nature of zzso schemes in prefrontal zzso
