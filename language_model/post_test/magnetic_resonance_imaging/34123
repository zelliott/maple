zzso of bone zzso involvement is important in staging zzso disease zzso so we compared the effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging zzso with bone zzso biopsy in diagnosing bone zzso involvement in HD zzso 

Twenty-six patients with the diagnosis of HD were included in this zzso The ages of the patients were between 4 and 24 years, with a median of zzso Eleven of them had stage III or IV disease and 15 had been previously diagnosed as having HD and were in zzso They were evaluated by bone zzso biopsy and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso were taken from the zzso zzso spine with an zzso zzso biopsy zzso Within 14 days following zzso zzso of zzso zzso was carried zzso 

zzso revealed decreased signal intensity in zzso images in 7 of 26 zzso On the other hand, bone zzso zzso showed HD involvement in three out of seven zzso The remaining 19 patients who had normal bone zzso were negative for HD in their bone zzso zzso The patients with positive zzso and negative biopsy for HD had bone zzso One of them had a zzso zzso reaction on bone survey; the other two had height loss in their zzso zzso zzso There was a statistically significant difference in the zzso survival rates between zzso and zzso patients in the following 24 months period zzso zzso zzso 

This study suggests that zzso is a useful method for diagnosing bone zzso involvement in zzso in that our zzso patients had a higher zzso rate in the 24 months follow-up period than the zzso zzso
