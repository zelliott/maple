There are zzso and characteristic age-related deficits in motor abilities that may reflect structural and chemical changes in the aging zzso 

To delineate age-related changes in the physiology of brain systems zzso simple motor zzso 

Ten strongly right-handed young zzso years of zzso and 12 strongly right-handed elderly zzso years of zzso subjects with no evidence of cognitive or motor deficits participated in the zzso zzso functional imaging was performed on a zzso zzso scanner using a spiral pulse sequence while the subjects performed a visually paced zzso motor task with their dominant right hand alternating with a rest zzso 

Although the groups did not differ in zzso there was an increase in reaction time in the elderly subjects zzso score plus minus zzso young subjects zzso zzso zzso 97 zzso elderly subjects zzso zzso zzso 280 zzso p zzso zzso There was a greater extent of zzso in the zzso zzso cortex, lateral zzso area, supplementary motor area, and zzso zzso in the elderly subjects relative to the young subjects zzso zzso zzso Additional areas of zzso absent in the young subjects, were seen in the zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the elderly zzso 

The results of this study show that elderly subjects recruit additional cortical and zzso areas even for the performance of a simple motor zzso These changes may represent zzso mechanisms invoked by the aging brain, such as reorganization and zzso of functional networks to compensate for age-related structural and zzso zzso
