zzso within the zzso structural network determined by graph theoretical analysis play a crucial role in brain zzso We mapped zzso hubs zzso using a sample population of 63 young zzso zzso were zzso with high resolution structural and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging zzso Multiple network zzso were then constructed per subject, using random zzso to define the zzso and using zzso zzso to determine the connectivity between the zzso The networks were zzso with graph theoretical zzso Our results give reference maps of hub distribution measured with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the hubs zzso with key areas from known overlapping cognitive zzso Several hubs were zzso organized across zzso Furthermore, females have hubs with higher zzso zzso and males have hubs with higher zzso zzso Female networks have higher zzso zzso
