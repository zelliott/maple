In conclusion, it is unlikely that zzso will replace ultrasound as the primary zzso imaging zzso in the near zzso zzso has a proven record of accuracy and safety in addition to its easy access and low zzso zzso has promise, however, in providing crucial information in patients with underlying medical or surgical conditions that would zzso require zzso radiation for zzso Currently, zzso is helpful in evaluating gross fetal anomalies and disturbances of fetal growth and development when ultrasound is limited by zzso or maternal zzso Further experience is required to determine the value of zzso and quantitative relaxation times regarding fetal metabolism and fetal zzso zzso improvements and software updates will reduce imaging time and increase spatial resolution, thus rendering zzso more competitive with existing imaging zzso The ultimate role, however, that zzso will have in the evaluation of the fetus is currently zzso
