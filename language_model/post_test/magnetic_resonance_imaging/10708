zzso balance is altered in a variety of common zzso including zzso zzso zzso failure, and zzso Because of robust cellular pH zzso mechanisms, most of the pathological zzso in pH are expressed as changes in the zzso systemic zzso There are data to indicate that altered pH is not simply an zzso of zzso or zzso imbalance but that chronic pH zzso can have important zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate that pH zzso of up to zzso pH unit can exit within zzso zzso Although measurement of blood pH can indicate systemic problems, it cannot pinpoint the zzso or zzso assess the magnitude of excursion from normal zzso zzso there is a need to develop zzso measurement methods with high zzso zzso The two major approaches being investigated include zzso transfer methods and relaxation zzso zzso zzso effects can observed with zzso signals or zzso applied zzso zzso While zzso signals have the advantage of being fully zzso and relatively straightforward to apply, they lack a full zzso characterization and dynamic range that might be afforded by future zzso zzso zzso zzso also requires the injection or infusion of zzso contrast zzso In both zzso and zzso approaches, the magnitude of the effect, and, thus, the ability to zzso zzso depends on a zzso and temporally varying concentration of the zzso A number of approaches have been proposed to solve this problem and, once it is zzso pH imaging methods will be zzso to human clinical zzso
