zzso sensory motor zzso zzso zzso can occur during hand movements following cerebral zzso We studied the effect of increasing task difficulty and temporary peripheral paralysis on patterns of motor system zzso 

Six healthy subjects completed a functional zzso paradigm of right finger abduction with four zzso light resistance, strong resistance, imagined movement and attempted abduction after zzso nerve zzso zzso maps compared images acquired during rest and task, while region of interest analysis measured numbers of activated zzso 

All subjects showed some zzso zzso zzso Across all subjects and all tasks involving hand movement, zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso remained stable despite differing effort or hand zzso The zzso and zzso zzso appear to act in a coordinated fashion during unilateral hand zzso
