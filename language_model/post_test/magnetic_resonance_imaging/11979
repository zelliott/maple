Multiple images acquired simultaneously from an array of surface coils can be combined to give a composite image with an improved zzso ratio zzso and a large field of zzso The composite zzso zzso can be zzso by taking advantage of noise correlations between coils and phase shifts induced by surface zzso zzso zzso are derived for making optimal composite images with uniform noise or with uniform zzso A simplified model is used to provide an intuitive understanding of the interaction of noise correlation and phase shift zzso
