We previously demonstrated relatively intact cognitive function (with the exception of suggestive evidence for persistent deficits in spatial information zzso in middle-aged long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso for 6 months or more) compared to age and gender comparable zzso controls zzso zzso et zzso zzso 

In the current study, we examine cortical gray matter volumes in the same samples to determine whether gray matter volumes in zzso are consistent with the cognitive zzso exhibiting gray matter volumes comparable to zzso in most brain regions, except for possible indications of persistent shrinkage in the zzso lobe zzso spatial information zzso 

We found gray matter shrinkage in zzso in the zzso lobe consistent with the spatial processing deficits in this same zzso More compelling, in zzso the magnitude of zzso gray matter shrinkage was zzso associated with spatial processing domain performance and positively associated with alcohol zzso Gray matter volume deficits were present in the zzso and other cortical zzso but poorer zzso test performance correlated significantly with smaller volumes in the zzso zzso zzso 

Taken together, the cognitive and structural imaging data provide compelling evidence that chronic alcohol abuse results in shrinkage of the zzso zzso with associated deficits in spatial information zzso
