zzso resonance imaging zzso has been applied to zzso zzso zzso with the use of zzso injected zzso zzso iron oxide zzso However, zzso zzso in zzso remains zzso and the zzso enhancement patterns observed by zzso point to multiple zzso zzso This study focused on specific imaging of zzso zzso into the brain by zzso of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso in a rat model of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso At day 5 after zzso zzso animals were zzso with zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso or free zzso (17 zzso zzso zzso was performed 24, 72 and, 120 h zzso To investigate zzso changes directly after intravenous zzso administration, zzso was performed repeatedly up to 8 zzso zzso zzso showed that rat zzso were efficiently labeled in zzso using zzso zzso zzso After zzso of zzso zzso a significant increase in contrast enhanced area zzso in the zzso zzso was observed not before 72 zzso zzso enhancement after zzso injection increased up to zzso at a much earlier point of time (24 zzso and diminished zzso zzso zzso directly after zzso injection showed significant contrast enhancement in the zzso within 2 zzso Our study shows that zzso enables in zzso tracking of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, our data suggest that contrast enhancement after injection of free zzso does not primarily represent signals from peripherally labeled zzso that migrated toward the inflammatory zzso The use of zzso zzso provides a better tool to specifically assess the time window of zzso zzso
