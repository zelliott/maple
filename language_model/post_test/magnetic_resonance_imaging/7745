Patients with traumatic brain injury zzso were reported to have difficulty making advantageous decisions, but the underlying deficits of the network of brain areas involved in this process were not directly zzso We report a patient with zzso who demonstrated problematic behavior in situations of risk and complexity after cerebral injury from a traffic zzso The Iowa gambling task zzso was used to reveal his deficits in the decision-making zzso To examine underlying deficits of the network of brain areas, we examined zzso structural zzso diffusion zzso imaging zzso and zzso zzso in this zzso The patient showed zzso in zzso zzso results showed a significant decrease in fractional zzso zzso in the zzso between the brain stem and cortical regions via the zzso He showed significant decrease in gray matter volumes in the bilateral insular cortex, zzso and zzso zzso cortex, possibly reflecting zzso zzso secondary to the zzso zzso zzso showed significant blood flow decrease in the broad cortical areas including the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso Our study showed that the patient had dysfunctional decision-making zzso zzso zzso in the zzso likely from the traffic accident, caused reduced zzso feedback to the brain, resulting in less efficient zzso Our findings support the zzso hypothesis zzso where zzso feedback to the brain influences the decision-making zzso
