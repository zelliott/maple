The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between clinical presentation and the extent of cortical involvement in patients with zzso 

The magnetic resonance imaging findings of 26 patients were evaluated for the location and distribution of zzso zzso of zzso at birth and zzso tests for zzso infections, the presence and type zzso zzso of motor deficits, mental zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso patients had zzso whereas seven had unilateral zzso Patients with unilateral zzso presented later with milder zzso The most encountered symptom in patients with bilateral involvement was mental motor zzso zzso zzso and speech problems zzso clinical presentations of patients with zzso and positive zzso tests for zzso zzso were zzso patients with positive zzso tests for zzso had bilateral zzso The zzso region was affected in zzso patients with unilateral zzso The most encountered presenting symptom in these patients was zzso zzso zzso was seen in three zzso of the patients, and all of them had left zzso zzso zzso and speech delay were detected in one zzso of the zzso 

Late presenting zzso may be a predictor of zzso zzso and is associated with relatively good zzso zzso infection and the presence of zzso are zzso of worse zzso
