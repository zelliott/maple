zzso or simulating future events has been shown to activate the anterior right zzso zzso more than remembering past events zzso One fundamental difference between simulation and memory is that imagining future scenarios requires a more extensive constructive process than remembering past experiences zzso Indeed, studies in which this constructive element is reduced or eliminated by zzso events in a prior session do not report differential zzso activity during zzso In this zzso study, we examined the effects of repeatedly simulating an event on neural zzso During zzso participants imagined 60 future zzso each event was simulated three zzso zzso in the zzso showed a significant linear decrease across zzso as did other neural regions typically associated with zzso zzso such decreases in zzso could not be explained by zzso linear zzso effects, with no reductions in activity evident for the control task across similar time zzso Moreover, the anterior zzso exhibited significant functional connectivity with the zzso network during the first, but not second and third simulations of future zzso There was also evidence of a linear increase in activity across repetitions in right zzso zzso right zzso zzso and left anterior prefrontal cortex, which may reflect source recognition and retrieval of internally generated contextual zzso Overall, our findings demonstrate that repeatedly imagining future events has a zzso effect on zzso of the zzso and many other regions engaged by the initial construction of the zzso possibly reflecting the decreasing novelty of simulations across zzso and therefore is an important consideration in the design of future studies examining zzso
