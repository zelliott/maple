zzso patients with zzso zzso were examined with zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso The accuracy of both CT and MR imaging in the depiction of cartilage invasion was evaluated in 16 patients by comparing findings at CT and MR with zzso zzso zzso cartilage that has been invaded by cancer is frequently seen on CT scans as having an intact zzso zzso approaching zzso cartilage may simulate cartilage zzso On zzso MR images, invaded zzso of ossified cartilage is of intermediate signal intensity, allowing it to be differentiated from normal bone zzso On zzso images, tumor is of increased signal intensity, which allows it to be differentiated from zzso zzso In our experience, the zzso of CT and MR imaging were approximately equal zzso and zzso respectively), but CT had a considerably lower sensitivity than MR zzso zzso zzso Gross movement artifacts, which resulted in zzso images, occurred in zzso of the MR zzso MR imaging is recommended as the zzso of choice in the diagnosis of cartilage zzso
