To investigate the clinical value of different magnetic resonance zzso pulse sequences in diagnosis of spinal zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients with clinically suspected spinal zzso tumor were included in this zzso These patients were with documented primary zzso Four MR pulse zzso zzso spin echo zzso zzso zzso fast spin echo zzso zzso short time inversion recovery zzso and zzso echo zzso zzso echo data imaging combination zzso zzso were used to detect spinal zzso 

Fifteen zzso bodies were entire involvement, 38 zzso bodies were section involvement, and totally 53 zzso bodies were zzso There were 19 focal infections in zzso of zzso arch, 15 zzso in zzso process and zzso zzso zzso zzso bodies were abnormal in zzso zzso zzso and GE zzso 35 zzso bodies were found abnormal in zzso zzso and 50 zzso bodies were found abnormal in zzso The verges of focal signal of involved zzso bodies were comparatively clear in zzso SE, comparatively clear or vague in zzso zzso vague in zzso and clear in GE zzso 

GE zzso may be the most sensitive technique to detect zzso So three sequences zzso SE, zzso zzso GE zzso can demonstrate the early changes of spinal zzso zzso
