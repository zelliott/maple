We evaluated zzso zzso zzso density of the zzso volume zzso estimated using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso and zzso density of the transition zone zzso volume zzso estimated using zzso zzso zzso in the diagnosis of prostate cancer zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients, who were suspected to have zzso based on zzso ranged between zzso and zzso zzso were enrolled in this zzso 

The zzso volume estimated using zzso was smaller than the volume estimated using zzso by zzso in the patients with zzso levels ranging zzso zzso zzso in those zzso zzso and zzso in those zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were correlated with the zzso volume estimated using zzso and zzso and zzso volume estimated using zzso in the patients without zzso however, the level was not correlated with them in the patients with zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of zzso zzso was higher than that of zzso zzso however, there was no statistical zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis for the prediction of zzso by using zzso parameters confirmed that zzso zzso was the most significant predictor in patients with zzso levels in the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso volume estimated using zzso was smaller than the volume estimated using zzso zzso zzso is the most significant predictor in the four zzso
