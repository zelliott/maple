The purpose of this study was to increase the allowed number of acquired slices per unit time zzso time zzso for zzso deposition zzso abdominal acquisitions at zzso zzso 

zzso zzso protocols include various zzso zzso and zzso acquisitions that require extended spatial coverage and zzso zzso each acquisition is completed within one zzso At zzso zzso power deposition zzso specific zzso rate zzso concerns can limit achieving these conflicting needs because conventional sequences are based on zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso sequences based on an approved short-term zzso zzso zzso criterion and added a delay time after zzso to fulfill the long-term zzso zzso power deposition zzso 

Using our strategy, image acquisition time efficiency at zzso T was increased approximately twofold compared with conventional abdominal zzso pulse sequences for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso zzso free zzso zzso Volunteers experienced a slight sensation of warmth for the zzso fast zzso zzso the most zzso zzso 

Our zzso strategy is not zzso is easily implemented for all conventional scanners zzso one can access and modify the pulse sequences directly, or the vendors can make the necessary zzso yields a higher zzso imaging efficiency, and still zzso all the regulatory power deposition zzso
