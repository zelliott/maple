A zzso magnetic resonance zzso has been shown to be zzso for use in patients with zzso cochlear zzso and zzso Our zzso middle ear device uses a new adhesive bone zzso zzso for zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso magnet to the zzso 

Five zzso magnets and four solid titanium zzso were cemented onto the zzso of five preserved human zzso bones and two zzso zzso They were all inserted into a magnetic resonance zzso and evaluated for possible zzso 

zzso to the magnetic torque, the three magnets on the zzso bone were disrupted from the zzso The two zzso on the zzso bones and the two zzso and two magnets on the whole heads were not zzso The magnetic resonance imaging field did not affect the coercive force of the zzso zzso 

The large zzso produced by a magnetic resonance zzso may disrupt the zzso and zzso zzso causing zzso We zzso that patients with zzso magnets on the zzso should not undergo magnetic resonance imaging zzso
