zzso outcome of acute type B dissection zzso is strongly related to zzso zzso zzso In order to clarify the influence of the clinical presentation on the outcome, we analyzed the patients of the International zzso of Acute zzso zzso zzso All patients affected by complicated zzso enrolled in the zzso from zzso were zzso zzso were defined as the presence of zzso zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acute zzso failure, limb zzso zzso pain, zzso pain or zzso hypertension zzso zzso All other patients were zzso as uncomplicated zzso zzso A comprehensive analysis was performed of all clinical variables in relation to zzso zzso 

The overall zzso mortality among 550 patients was zzso zzso in group I zzso zzso was zzso zzso compared to zzso in group II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso complications were zzso syndrome, abrupt onset of pain, zzso pain, any focal neurological deficits, need for higher number of diagnostic examinations and use of magnetic resonance and/or zzso abdominal vessels involvement at zzso larger descending zzso diameter, especially zzso zzso zzso zzso and widened zzso on chest zzso zzso zzso of a non complicated status were normal chest X-ray and medical zzso In group I, zzso mortality following surgical and zzso intervention were zzso and zzso zzso zzso Independent zzso of overall zzso mortality included age zzso years, female zzso zzso showing zzso zzso acute zzso failure, zzso limb zzso zzso zzso and surgical zzso The only independent variable protective for mortality was magnetic resonance as diagnostic zzso 

zzso is a zzso disease that produces dissimilar clinical subsets, each of which can have specific clinical signs, management and zzso zzso In zzso zzso uncomplicated patients, medical therapy was associated with best hospital outcome, while zzso interventions were associated with better results than surgery when invasive treatments were zzso Although selection bias may be possible, and irrespective of treatments, knowledge of significant risk factors for mortality may contribute to a better management and a more defined zzso in patients affected by zzso
