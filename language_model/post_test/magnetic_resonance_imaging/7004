Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we investigated the implicit language processing of zzso and zzso words zzso zzso transcriptions of normally written zzso zzso and zzso Twelve right-handed native Japanese speakers performed size judgments for character stimuli zzso language task for linguistic zzso size judgments for zzso stimuli zzso language task for zzso zzso and zzso decisions zzso language zzso The size judgments for zzso stimuli and zzso stimuli produced zzso on the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso the bilateral zzso regions zzso zzso and the bilateral superior and inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, besides these areas, zzso of the left inferior frontal region zzso area, BA zzso and the left zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso BA zzso which have been considered as language areas, were additionally activated during size judgment for zzso character zzso zzso judgment for zzso character stimuli also activated zzso area, the left zzso and the left zzso zzso zzso BA zzso The zzso of these language areas were zzso in the zzso decisions for both zzso and zzso These findings suggest that language processing of both zzso and zzso scripts is obligatory to literate Japanese zzso Moreover, comparison between the scrambled zzso and the scrambled zzso showed no zzso in the language areas, while greater zzso in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso comparison during the size judgment and the zzso zzso zzso minus zzso activated the left zzso during the size judgment, and zzso area and the left zzso zzso junction during the zzso zzso These results probably reflect that in implicit or explicit reading of zzso words and zzso words zzso zzso transcriptions of zzso zzso although using largely overlapping cortical regions, there are still some zzso zzso reading may involve more heavily visual zzso retrieval and zzso system through the zzso route, while zzso transcriptions of zzso words require zzso zzso to gain semantic access through the zzso zzso
