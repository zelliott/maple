Working memory zzso the process by which information is coded into memory, actively maintained and subsequently zzso declines with zzso To test the hypothesis that age-related changes in prefrontal zzso zzso may mediate this zzso decline, we used functional zzso to investigate age differences in zzso activity during separate zzso task components zzso zzso zzso We found greater zzso activity in younger than older adults only in zzso zzso during memory zzso Fast younger subjects showed less zzso zzso zzso during retrieval than slow younger subjects, whereas older adults showed the opposite zzso Thus age-related changes in zzso zzso and not zzso zzso account for zzso decline with normal zzso
