This study investigates whether zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso phalanx zzso can be used to predict the maximum force that can be exerted by the thumb in zzso at the zzso zzso A zzso equation was obtained via which zzso of fossil zzso can be used to predict zzso force in zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso which increased the available magnetic field zzso strength from 10 to 40 zzso zzso was used to acquire high resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images of the left and right thumbs of nine zzso The subjects' age, sex, weight, height and zzso zzso were zzso The MR images were transferred to a computer for zzso of sections in the zzso and zzso plane zzso zzso were made of the maximum length zzso breadth zzso zzso breadth zzso and joint depth zzso of the zzso For each subject the maximum zzso force that could be exerted by each thumb was zzso The mean maximum zzso force generated was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in the magnitude of the force difference between the left and right thumbs and this is greatest in individuals with the strongest zzso The best model produced by multiple linear zzso analysis of all the available data has a value of r zzso zzso and needs only the two zzso of sex and weight, zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso However, in order to be useful for predicting the maximum zzso force of the thumb in zzso the model should only contain those parameters which can be measured for fossil zzso zzso the best zzso model has a value of r zzso zzso and needs only the two zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso The maximum force predicted for any of the zzso fossil zzso was not significantly different from those recorded for the volunteers in the present study, although they were on average somewhat lower than those obtained for modern zzso This may be a reflection of the zzso overall smaller body zzso
