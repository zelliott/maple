A functional connectivity zzso method that groups neighboring zzso in relation to their degree of zzso zzso between their time courses is zzso This grouping generates a zzso field, which is assumed to provide insights into the local organization of zzso zzso Application with high spatial resolution zzso rat data subjected to electric zzso sensory stimulation zzso zzso 156 zzso 1000 zzso shows a significant localized increase of the zzso field zzso in cortical layers 4 and 2/3 of the primary sensory zzso and in layer 2/3 of the primary motor cortex, suggesting a strong correlation with local zzso zzso zzso field zzso exhibit a transition with zzso zzso from zzso zzso during rest to clusters of common zzso zzso size is shown to be zzso dependent on the zzso of the zzso field zzso and zzso zzso position within clusters generates a zzso zzso orientation zzso This suggests that changes in zzso zzso upon zzso represent changes in the internal correlation between zzso that is interpreted as a change in the internal zzso zzso
