The investigation of post zzso syndrome zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso after treatment with zzso loaded DC zzso zzso 

The study included 237 patients treated with sequential zzso performed at set time intervals every two months until 3 zzso month zzso Patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and B zzso zzso zzso were as selective as possible with DC zzso of zzso in diameter followed by zzso loaded with zzso at zzso of hydrated zzso zzso 

zzso regardless of severity was observed in up to zzso However grade 2 zzso ranged between zzso and zzso across zzso Temperatures above zzso were seen in zzso to zzso across zzso No statistically significant increase of zzso was seen in beads of zzso in zzso zzso of fever and pain presented correlation with the extent of zzso zzso across zzso zzso tumor diameter was associated with zzso of fever zzso zzso of fever correlated with the extent of zzso zzso zzso was not associated with zzso of liver zzso and was correlated with degree of necrosis zzso 

zzso after zzso represents tumor response to treatment and does not represent collateral healthy liver zzso
