Selective zzso remains the zzso treatment for zzso disease zzso until recently by microscopic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surgery zzso is emerging as a novel, less invasive treatment for zzso zzso and has become the optimal surgical zzso 

There are no published series for the treatment of zzso CD by zzso and we report our zzso preliminary zzso 

zzso zzso 

Six zzso patients zzso age zzso years; range zzso zzso fulfilled standard diagnostic criteria for zzso zzso no zzso was identified on zzso MR scanning in 3 zzso patients, one had a zzso zzso zzso zzso sampling demonstrated central zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The same zzso and zzso zzso surgeon undertook all the zzso 

zzso outcome and rate of zzso 

Clinical recovery and zzso zzso were achieved in 5 zzso patients, and a zzso zzso was confirmed zzso in all cured zzso One case developed zzso zzso leak requiring zzso drain zzso and zzso At a mean zzso of zzso years zzso zzso zzso cured patients have shown no zzso One patient, with a large diffuse zzso requiring more extensive surgery, has zzso and another patient has zzso and zzso zzso 

Our experience shows that zzso for removing zzso zzso in children, in most cases not zzso on zzso is minimally invasive and gave excellent zzso zzso In skilled hands, this technique provides an alternative to conventional zzso microscopic surgery in managing zzso zzso
