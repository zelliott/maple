zzso learning has been reported to be effective in the rehabilitation of patients with impaired cognitive functions following brain zzso This study compared brain zzso in zzso learning zzso and zzso learning zzso in patients with diffuse zzso injury zzso using a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The participants were 13 patients with zzso Thirteen healthy individuals were evaluated as a control zzso The participants learned words under the zzso and zzso conditions in advance and performed the recognition task during zzso zzso 

zzso in the control group was significantly faster than zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group scored significantly higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso showed significant zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 31) and zzso zzso 7) in the control group when zzso zzso zzso but in the zzso zzso 7, 31) and bilateral inferior zzso zzso zzso 39, 40) in the zzso zzso 

These results indicate the disadvantage of zzso and advantage of zzso to zzso zzso The findings also reflect brain plasticity in patients with zzso in the chronic zzso
