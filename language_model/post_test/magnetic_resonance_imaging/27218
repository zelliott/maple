We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to analyze changes in brain activity associated with stimulation of the zzso trigger zone in patients with classic zzso zzso zzso Fifteen consecutive patients with zzso in the second or third division of the zzso were included in this zzso The zzso paradigm consisted of light tactile stimuli of the trigger zone and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the affected side induced pain in seven patients, but was not painful in eight patients on the day of the zzso zzso stimuli were associated with significantly increased activity in the spinal zzso nucleus zzso thalamus, primary and secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, prefrontal areas, zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulation of the trigger zone activated all but three of these structures zzso zzso and zzso After a successful surgical treatment, zzso induced by stimulation of the operated side was confined to zzso and zzso Our data demonstrate the pathological zzso of the zzso zzso system, including the second order zzso sensory zzso during evoked attacks of zzso Such zzso may depend on pain zzso systems involving both the zzso zzso zzso gray and adjacent zzso and interconnected cortical structures zzso zzso The fact that large portions of the classical zzso zzso were also activated during zzso stimulation of the trigger zone, could reflect a state of maintained zzso of the zzso zzso systems in zzso
