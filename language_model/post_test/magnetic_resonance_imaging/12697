Current evidence suggests that the mechanisms underlying depth zzso zzso beginning with zzso zzso onset patterns are functionally distinct from those giving rise to zzso fast zzso onset zzso However, both groups have been associated with zzso zzso zzso indicating a need to clarify the zzso zzso of each zzso onset zzso We used three-dimensional zzso zzso mapping to zzso zzso and determine whether each onset group exhibited a unique distribution of zzso consistent with the functional differences that distinguish the two onset zzso 

Sixteen zzso patients with medically zzso zzso were assigned to zzso or zzso groups according to zzso onset patterns recorded with zzso depth zzso Using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso levels of zzso defined zzso were determined by comparison with matched controls, and the distribution of local zzso was mapped onto zzso zzso surface zzso 

zzso and zzso groups exhibited significant and equivalent levels of zzso zzso to seizure zzso Patients with zzso onset zzso also showed significant zzso volume zzso On zzso zzso maps zzso patients exhibited an zzso pattern consistent with classical zzso sclerosis zzso whereas zzso zzso was distributed more zzso and zzso zzso zzso maps also showed regions of zzso zzso 

The zzso distribution of zzso and the restriction of zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso patients are consistent with focal zzso zzso and suggest a mechanism utilizing zzso zzso In contrast, the bilateral distribution of zzso zzso in the zzso group may reflect mechanisms involving both zzso and zzso zzso
