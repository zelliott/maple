The response of the central nervous system to space radiation is largely zzso The zzso which is known for its critical role in learning and memory, was evaluated for its response to zzso zzso At 1 month, animals exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined using zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso imaging zzso diffusion weighted imaging zzso and zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed after zzso The zzso zzso and zzso images revealed no overt anatomical changes after zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a significant increase in zzso at 2 zzso compared to 0 zzso The apparent diffusion zzso zzso revealed an inverse zzso quantitative change in water zzso Compared to 0 zzso the zzso increased zzso at 1 zzso and declined to zzso above control levels at 4 zzso MRS showed a significant increase in the zzso ratio at 4 zzso and a zzso zzso zzso demonstrated no overt pathological changes in zzso and zzso zzso However, a significant inverse zzso zzso change in the zzso population was detected in zzso zzso Our results suggest that early tissue zzso modifications induced by zzso radiation can be detected by zzso in the absence of evident zzso These changes may indicate fundamental changes in the structure and function of the zzso
