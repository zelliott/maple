Both direct current zzso and alternating current zzso have been used for zzso zzso stimulation zzso during functional zzso zzso The zzso effects of apparent rotation persist while the current is being applied, but there is a zzso zzso over the entire stimulation zzso Particularly during zzso in a zzso position, subjects report a strong zzso sensation related to the onset and offset of the zzso and weaker effects during constant zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed zzso zzso data from a group of volunteers with two different statistical zzso In model I, the effects of zzso were modeled as a single zzso that described the periods during which the current was switched zzso In model II, an additional zzso describing the onset and offset of the stimulation was zzso The zzso pattern found by using model I included only a subset of the zzso patterns known to respond to zzso stimulation from previous imaging zzso Model II revealed two different zzso zzso block effects similar to the results obtained in model I and additional transient zzso effects with larger zzso clusters and higher zzso This extended zzso pattern resembled the results obtained during zzso including zzso zzso projection zzso We show that the major part of the blood zzso level dependent zzso responses zzso by zzso is related to the zzso and offset of stimulation currents and reflects the zzso experience zzso In addition, the separate modeling of transient and persistent effects of zzso can identify distinct cortical zzso of those zzso
