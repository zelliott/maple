We studied the prevalence of injuries of the zzso cartilage and zzso bone after acute trauma in zzso immature knees using high-resolution zzso 

We reviewed knee zzso of 126 young children and adolescents suspected to have internal knee zzso including 82 with open zzso and a control group of 44 who were zzso zzso zzso zzso density and zzso pulse sequences were used in all zzso The prevalence of common injuries in the two groups was compared using zzso zzso zzso of zzso agreement for evaluation of zzso zzso in the zzso immature group were determined using the zzso zzso 

In the zzso immature group, zzso zzso were the most prevalent injuries zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso followed by zzso and anterior cruciate ligament injuries zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No significant difference in the prevalence of zzso injury before and after zzso closure was seen zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the prevalence of anterior cruciate ligament injuries between the two groups, but zzso injuries were more prevalent in the zzso mature patients zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso agreement for zzso injuries in the group with open zzso was good (weighted zzso zzso zzso 

The most common injuries occurring as a result of acute trauma to the immature knee were zzso In patients with open zzso zzso injuries were significantly more prevalent than anterior cruciate ligament and zzso zzso
