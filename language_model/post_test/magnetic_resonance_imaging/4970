To develop a magnetic resonance imaging zzso sequence zzso and white matter suppression, zzso for generating two sets of images from a single zzso one with contrast similar to a zzso zzso rapid zzso sequence zzso for structural zzso the other with zzso white matter zzso signal intensity, similar to the fast gray matter zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso for improved zzso of zzso brain zzso 

The recently proposed zzso which is a modification of the zzso and generates two image sets at different inversion times, was employed to generate the zzso contrast zzso and zzso contrast zzso Five healthy volunteers were scanned at zzso and brain tissue contrast and zzso were zzso 

zzso and zzso exhibited similar tissue contrast and zzso as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso minimum value images generated from zzso and zzso provided a gray zzso zzso 

zzso provides two zzso zzso volumes, one with zzso zzso signal intensity and another with zzso zzso zzso The zzso nature of the two zzso allows for generating images that might be helpful in zzso zzso and clinical zzso
