zzso deficit has been implicated in the genesis of zzso and in the mechanisms adopted to compensate for the visual zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to magnetic resonance images of zzso adults to detect any abnormal brain zzso which could not be easily identified by simple zzso The gray matter volume in zzso adults was smaller than that in normal subjects at the areas consistent with the zzso eye field zzso and zzso eye field zzso However, greater gray matter volume was found in zzso adults relative to normal controls at the areas consistent with the frontal eye field zzso the supplementary eye field zzso the prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso regions such as the zzso and the zzso zzso These opposite gray matter changes in the visual and the zzso processing areas are compatible with a hypothesis of plasticity in the zzso regions to compensate for the cortical deficits in the visual processing zzso
