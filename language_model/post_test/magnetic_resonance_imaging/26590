The purpose of this study was to determine if in zzso high resolution zzso zzso and localized zzso MR zzso zzso can detect brain findings resembling Alzheimer's disease in a transgenic mouse model of zzso zzso Seven double transgenic zzso female mice and 7 zzso zzso zzso female mice were evaluated at 5 months of zzso To confirm the usefulness and consistency of in zzso zzso we also scanned the brains of 14 male mice (7 zzso and 7 zzso zzso at 8 months of zzso Mean zzso and cerebral zzso volumes in the female zzso mice were zzso and zzso smaller than that in the zzso controls zzso zzso Mean zzso and cerebral zzso volumes in the male zzso mice were zzso and zzso smaller than that in the zzso controls zzso zzso The mean volumes of the zzso were not statistically different between the zzso and the zzso zzso MRS assessment revealed that the zzso to total zzso ratios zzso a measure of zzso were significantly higher in the zzso of zzso mice relative to zzso mice zzso for the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso in the same animals verified previously published data showing zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and cortical and zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that in zzso zzso can be a zzso zzso to assess brain zzso and related zzso changes in the zzso mouse zzso
