zzso developed zzso zzso zzso are more conspicuous than conventional zzso zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso images because they produce recognizable zzso signal patterns zzso To determine how zzso parameters influence these patterns, the imaging characteristics of nine zzso zzso concentration zzso to zzso zzso zzso were studied systematically and compared with three zzso All zzso were studied in stationary and moving zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strength using zzso and zzso pulse zzso zzso always produced a signal zzso zzso produced zzso the size of which depended on the orientation of the zzso with respect to the main magnetic field, the concentration of zzso agent in the zzso and the direction and strength of the frequency zzso zzso When zzso were positioned perpendicular to the main magnetic field, they produced zzso however, when they were parallel to the main magnetic field, zzso produced no zzso thus having a similar appearance to the zzso zzso zzso produce conspicuous patterns on MR images that depend on zzso orientation in the main magnetic field and vary predictably with the zzso zzso
