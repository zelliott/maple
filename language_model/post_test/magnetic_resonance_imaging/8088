In this zzso magnetic resonance imaging study, zzso rotation was measured in the zzso plane of the normal, zzso spine of persons with a complete mirror image reversal of the internal body zzso called zzso zzso zzso 

To determine if a pattern of rotation exists in the normal spine of persons with zzso zzso zzso opposite of what was found in humans with normal organ zzso 

In humans, as well as in zzso the mid and lower zzso zzso of the normal, zzso spine show a zzso pattern of rotation to the right zzso This zzso pattern is similar to what is seen in the most prevalent types of adolescent idiopathic zzso and, therefore, probably plays an important role in determining the direction of spinal zzso once zzso starts to zzso The cause of this zzso zzso however, is zzso 

zzso resonance imaging scans of the zzso and abdomen of 37 persons with zzso zzso zzso and a normal, zzso spine were acquired to measure zzso zzso rotation from zzso to zzso with a previously developed computer-based measurement zzso 

The results of this study showed a zzso rotation to the left side of the mid and lower zzso zzso and to the right side of the upper zzso and zzso zzso The mean zzso rotation angles differed significantly from zero degrees rotation at the mid and lower zzso levels, with a maximum rotation of zzso degrees at level zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The normal spine of humans with a zzso zzso zzso shows a zzso pattern of zzso rotation opposite of what is seen in humans with normal organ zzso This study shows a relation between the zzso position of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso rotation in the normal zzso
