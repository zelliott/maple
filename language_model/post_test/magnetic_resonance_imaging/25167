Recent studies suggest that zzso is caused by zzso of zzso zzso producing zzso To find evidence for this hypothesis, we aimed to detect structural changes in the zzso and/or zzso projection areas of patients with zzso 

We used zzso zzso zzso an unbiased zzso zzso method with a high sensitivity for subtle changes in gray and white matter zzso 

Image acquisition was carried out in the department of zzso at zzso University Medical Center; image zzso was performed in the zzso Department of zzso zzso zzso 

Fifteen zzso patients were zzso all having zzso and typical findings on Multiple Sleep zzso zzso All patients were zzso positive and zzso zzso The control group consisted of 15 age and sex matched healthy zzso 

We found no differences in global gray or white matter volumes between patients and zzso Furthermore, regional gray or white matter volumes in the zzso and zzso projection areas did not differ between patients and zzso 

zzso failed to show structural changes in the brains of patients with zzso This suggests that zzso either is associated with microscopic changes zzso by zzso or that functional abnormalities of zzso zzso are not associated with structural zzso
