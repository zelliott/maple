The literature suggests zzso of zzso knee zzso zzso for spontaneous zzso of the knee ranges from zzso to zzso at 10 to 12 zzso However, these data arise from small series zzso to 33 zzso jeopardizing meaningful zzso 

We determined zzso the longer-term zzso of zzso in a larger group of patients with spontaneous zzso of the zzso zzso their zzso zzso and functional zzso and zzso the percentage of failures and reasons for failures to identify relevant zzso zzso and technical parameters for treatment with a modern implant zzso 

We zzso evaluated all 84 patients with late-stage spontaneous zzso of the knee who had a zzso zzso from 1998 to zzso All patients had zzso zzso to confirm the diagnosis, exclude zzso involvement, and confirm the absence of major degenerative changes in the lateral and zzso zzso The mean age of the patients at surgery was 66 years and mean zzso was zzso We conducted zzso survival analysis using revision for any reason as the end zzso Minimum followup was 63 months zzso 98 zzso range, zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso Ten revisions were zzso the most common reasons were subsidence of the zzso component zzso and zzso loosening of the zzso component zzso No patient underwent revision for progression of zzso in the lateral or zzso zzso 

Our data suggest spontaneous zzso of the knee may be an indication for zzso provided secondary zzso of the knee is ruled out, zzso zzso documents the absence of disease in other zzso and there is no zzso in any zzso
