Motion during diffusion zzso leads to different phase errors in different shots of zzso zzso zzso Phase error zzso among shots results in zzso signal cancellation when data from all shots are zzso zzso phase error correction for zzso zzso imaging zzso has been studied extensively and there exist multiple phase error correction zzso A commonly used correction method is the direct phase zzso zzso zzso however, can suffer from incomplete phase error correction due to the zzso of the phase errors in the high spatial resolution zzso Furthermore, improper sampling density compensation is also a possible issue of zzso Recently, zzso phase error correction was incorporated in the zzso zzso zzso image reconstruction procedure to get a zzso phase correction method that is also zzso to parallel zzso Although the zzso method overcomes the issues of zzso its zzso requirement is zzso Further, zzso restricts to sensitivity zzso zzso for parallel zzso In this paper, a new zzso and flexible zzso and zzso combination zzso zzso for rigid body zzso phase error correction is zzso zzso estimates the zzso phase errors in image space using the zzso capability of the variable density spiral zzso The correction is then performed in k zzso The zzso is shown to overcome the problem of zzso phase zzso Further, the zzso preserves the phase of the imaging object and receiver coils in the corrected k zzso data, which is important for parallel imaging zzso After phase error zzso any parallel reconstruction method can be zzso The zzso zzso is tested with both simulated and in zzso data with both zzso single-coil and zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso correction results in zzso images with higher zzso ratio zzso and fractional zzso zzso maps with better resolved fiber tracts as compared to zzso In zzso acquisitions, zzso is comparable to the zzso zzso
