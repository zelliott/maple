Cell therapy is a proven and efficient method for treating multiple zzso For both basic research and clinical practice, the development of zzso in zzso imaging methods is essential for monitoring the trafficking or zzso of transplanted zzso One attractive approach for the effective imaging of transplanted cells is the efficient labeling of cells with a contrast zzso In this study, we developed a novel contrast agent of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso was efficiently zzso into cells without zzso However, the zzso of zzso was observed because of its low stability in culture zzso zzso zzso may have led to a zzso test zzso In future studies, we should verify not only the efficiency of labeling cells but also the stability of the contrast agent of zzso for clinical zzso
