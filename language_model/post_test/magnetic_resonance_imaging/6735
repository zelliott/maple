To determine whether zzso analysis of zzso transfer ratio zzso maps can provide evidence of a coherent pattern of gray matter zzso zzso and microscopic tissue damage in patients at the earliest stage of multiple sclerosis zzso 

We acquired zzso zzso maps in 18 patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of zzso zzso and 18 zzso and zzso healthy zzso We evaluated the clinical status of the patients using the zzso functional composite score and the expanded disability status zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for height zzso was used to compare zzso zzso maps from patients and controls on a zzso zzso We then extracted data from regions with zzso above the statistical threshold to verify the significance of differences using a zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso comparison of zzso maps revealed large abnormalities in the zzso zzso including the bilateral thalamus, bilateral zzso nucleus, bilateral head of zzso and zzso and smaller abnormalities in the right zzso right BA 4, and left BA zzso The zzso measured in the left zzso and right zzso was zzso correlated with duration following the first clinical zzso 

These results suggest that although zzso is a zzso zzso disease that affects white matter zzso a pattern of tissue damage is present inside the zzso involving predominantly zzso zzso at the earliest stage of the zzso
