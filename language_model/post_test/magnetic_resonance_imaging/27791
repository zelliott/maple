The role of zzso zzso zzso zzso scans in the staging of head and neck cancer zzso is zzso The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines do not recommend routine zzso zzso beyond physical examination, chest zzso and laboratory zzso The purpose of this report is to examine the accuracy of staging PET scans for detecting distant zzso disease in patients with zzso 

zzso review of 182 consecutive newly diagnosed zzso patients who had a staging PET scan at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital between 2003 and zzso 

The overall zzso of confirmed distant zzso disease in this population was zzso About 26 of the staging PET scans had areas suspicious for a zzso zzso Of total, 23 patients were further evaluated with imaging and/or zzso revealing 9 zzso true zzso and 14 zzso false zzso Of the 156 negative PET scans, there was 1 false negative and 155 true zzso Thus, the sensitivity of PET was zzso and specificity was zzso Positive zzso value was zzso and negative zzso value was zzso No patients with zzso clinical stage I or II cancer had confirmed distant zzso The only statistically significant predictor for zzso disease was clinical stage IV versus all other stages zzso 

Given the marked differences in the treatment of locally zzso zzso versus zzso zzso we recommend PET for clinical stage IV zzso Although the sensitivity, zzso and negative zzso value rates were acceptable, the positive zzso value was zzso Patients found to have a PET scan zzso for zzso disease require zzso imaging or zzso zzso
