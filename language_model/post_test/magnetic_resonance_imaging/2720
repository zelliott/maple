The in zzso zzso effect and brain levels of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso a competitive zzso zzso zzso were compared with its in zzso zzso zzso The zzso for in zzso zzso against both zzso toxicity and combined zzso deprivation zzso was determined in zzso zzso zzso zzso cultures of zzso cells from feta mice were injured by exposure to 500 zzso zzso for 10 zzso or to zzso for 45 zzso The effect of zzso zzso in both injury zzso was assessed zzso and zzso by determination of zzso zzso zzso Near complete zzso was found at high doses of zzso zzso The zzso for protection against zzso toxicity was zzso zzso M, and against zzso the zzso was zzso zzso For the in zzso paradigm rabbits underwent 2 h of left internal zzso anterior zzso and middle cerebral artery zzso followed by 4 h zzso zzso injury was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso The rabbits were treated with 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso or saline 10 zzso after zzso zzso zzso and brain levels of zzso zzso were 12 zzso and 5 zzso respectively, at 1 zzso 6 zzso and 5 zzso at 2 zzso and 13 zzso and 7 zzso at 4 zzso These levels were zzso in this model, reducing cortical zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso damage by zzso These results suggest that a single zzso dose zzso the zzso barrier, attaining sustained zzso levels that are in the range for in zzso zzso
