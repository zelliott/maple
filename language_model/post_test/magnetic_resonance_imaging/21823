The neural zzso of mental image generation were investigated with functional zzso zzso listened to words under two different instructional conditions: to generate visual mental images of the zzso zzso or to simply listen to each word and wait for the next zzso zzso were performed which directly compared the regional brain activity during each condition, with the goal of discovering whether mental image generation engages zzso visual areas, whether it engages primary visual cortex, and whether it recruits the left zzso to a greater extent than the zzso zzso revealed that visual association cortex, and not primary visual cortex, was engaged during the mental image generation zzso Left inferior zzso lobe zzso area zzso was the most reliably and robustly activated area across subjects, had activity which extended zzso into zzso association zzso zzso zzso The results of this experiment support the hypothesis that visual mental imagery is a function of visual association cortex, and that image generation is zzso localized to the zzso
