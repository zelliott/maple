zzso resonance imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso were used to assess zzso the tissue response of a new zzso hybrid braided zzso made from a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison to a silicone impregnated braided zzso zzso zzso control zzso zzso Both zzso were monitored for a period of 30 days following zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso rabbit zzso In all cases, MR images and zzso demonstrated that the hybrid zzso zzso either a milder or a similar tissue and cellular response compared to the control zzso These findings were confirmed by conventional zzso analysis of the surrounding zzso They also demonstrated that the hybrid zzso promoted faster healing in terms of collagen zzso between the zzso and individual zzso This milder inflammatory reaction and improved zzso represent a real advantage in the healing performance of zzso for cardiac and vascular surgery, and support the need for continued research and development of hybrid zzso This study also demonstrated the ability of zzso techniques to zzso evaluate the zzso of zzso By extending the capacity of MR diagnostic tools from patients to experimental animals, it is now possible to validate the healing performance of foreign materials with statistical reliability and fewer zzso
