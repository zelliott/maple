In this work we show the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging at a detection field of 59 zzso To this purpose we have built an zzso zzso assembly zzso an zzso zzso for zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso field of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso for zzso or zzso zzso acquisition at the detection field of 59 zzso A removable zzso circuit that allows the zzso to be tuned to the zzso frequency zzso zzso zzso or the zzso frequency zzso zzso zzso without removing the sample was built and zzso Switching of the zzso between the zzso and zzso frequency is thus achieved in less than 1 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso images show higher enhancement in the sample regions with higher free radical zzso This work is the first zzso step towards the development of an zzso scanner capable of acquiring zzso zzso and zzso zzso images in animal models at very low zzso
