zzso zzso zzso the most common primary zzso zzso usually develops in patients with zzso growing zzso from zzso zzso zzso to frank zzso zzso Its recognition is critical because zzso treatment and prognosis require early zzso Survival in patients with zzso relates directly to the number, size, and extent of zzso at zzso Imaging of zzso is complicated because the tumor has a varied imaging appearance and frequently coexists with other zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso the best available diagnostic technique, offers good contrast resolution and diagnostic sensitivity ranging from zzso to zzso The main difficulty is not in diagnosing large tumors, but rather small tumors zzso zzso because of considerable overlap on imaging between benign zzso borderline zzso and zzso zzso zzso degrees of zzso zzso are associated with increasing zzso and loss of portal blood zzso therefore, recognition of zzso requires dynamic imaging with zzso zzso zzso Typically, zzso is a focal zzso with high signal intensity on zzso images, variable signal intensity on zzso images, intense zzso phase enhancement after zzso injection, and zzso or zzso at the portal zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso for detecting small zzso is low, and improvement is still zzso Newer contrast agents, higher field strength (3 zzso imaging, and zzso and diffusion zzso techniques possibly will provide greater sensitivity and specificity for detecting small zzso in the zzso
