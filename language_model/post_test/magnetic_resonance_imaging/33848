The aim of this study was zzso to compare zzso zzso with zzso zzso for the staging of zzso zzso of the bone and zzso with regard to accuracy in detecting residual disease after zzso chemotherapy for zzso 

zzso patients with 36 zzso zzso zzso were zzso including 7 patients with primary or zzso zzso zzso and 14 patients with zzso zzso and simultaneous or secondary involvement of the zzso After zzso therapy, zzso and zzso zzso were performed on 13 zzso The zzso status based on all clinical and zzso findings during the follow-up was used as the gold zzso 

The zzso zzso were located on the zzso skeleton in zzso of patients and on the zzso skeleton in zzso zzso zzso detected zzso of the zzso zzso examined by zzso For restaging after zzso therapy, zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso when dynamic zzso information was zzso There were several zzso results as a result of the zzso increase in signal intensity ratios of zzso zzso regions after zzso For zzso zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso were zzso 

These data show that monitoring zzso zzso of the bone still presents diagnostic zzso Given the high sensitivity of zzso and the high specificity of zzso zzso but the limited specificity of zzso and sensitivity of zzso zzso both methods are valuable but should be used as complementary diagnostic zzso
