zzso DNA from 18 patients with combined zzso hormone zzso was screened for zzso deletion zzso in zzso gene by zzso restriction zzso analysis of zzso zzso 2 gene zzso Two unrelated female patients were zzso for this zzso zzso Patient 1 presented at zzso zzso with severe short stature zzso zzso zzso slightly enlarged zzso zzso at zzso and zzso enlarged zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in matched zzso with zzso enhanced signal at zzso weighted image at zzso and zzso views at magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso repeated at age 15 zzso revealed a marked reduction of zzso height (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in matched zzso Patient 2 presented at 27 zzso with short stature zzso zzso zzso without zzso development, normal zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of reduced size zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in matched zzso of normal intensity at zzso Both patients had normal zzso stalk and normally located zzso zzso features were characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Patient 1 had normal cortisol zzso at zzso zzso and at zzso zzso had developed partial cortisol zzso whereas patient 2 maintained normal cortisol zzso at zzso zzso We conclude that 1) a large zzso zzso and an enlarged zzso anterior lobe with zzso enhanced signal at zzso at zzso can be suggestive of zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso can change during follow-up of patients with zzso gene zzso and 3) hormonal deficiencies could include the adrenal zzso
