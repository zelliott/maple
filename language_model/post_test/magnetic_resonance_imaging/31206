zzso E zzso has been associated with an zzso course of multiple sclerosis zzso The mechanisms responsible for this are zzso although zzso zzso demonstrated a higher extent of zzso zzso zzso in such zzso Here, we have studied the impact of the zzso zzso on both the zzso evolution of focal zzso zzso and global zzso volume change zzso brain tissue zzso Ninety-nine zzso patients underwent zzso zzso clinical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and after zzso zzso zzso years to assess zzso load zzso and zzso In zzso patients, the annual reduction in brain volume was fivefold higher zzso zzso zzso than in those without zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso higher in zzso carriers, despite a shorter disease duration and absence of significant clinical zzso During zzso zzso zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group, although zzso zzso did not change, leading to a significantly higher increase in the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio remained almost constant in zzso patients zzso vs zzso zzso brain tissue loss and a higher proportion of zzso evolving into zzso therefore provide magnetic resonance imaging evidence for more pronounced tissue destruction in zzso patients with zzso
