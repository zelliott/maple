To the zzso knowledge, no effective medical therapy currently is available for advanced zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor targeting zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Six patients with advanced zzso were treated with zzso zzso at a dose of 800 zzso zzso In all patients, the tumor was found to be positive for zzso and in four patients zzso was shown to be zzso 

After a treatment period of zzso or zzso 1 year, overt tumor zzso was evident on zzso zzso zzso scan in the first zzso In previous months, a decrease in contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Similar signs on zzso and PET were observed in subsequent patients, who had a shorter treatment zzso One of these patients initially was removed from therapy and then was readmitted to therapy because of difficulties with regard to tumor response zzso 1 month after the zzso of therapy, an overt decrease in tumor density was visible on CT scan in this zzso In four of five symptomatic patients, a zzso improvement was observed early in the course of zzso The first patient died after 17 months, with a zzso mostly liquefied zzso Another patient died early, apparently of unrelated zzso The remaining patients were on therapy at the time of last zzso 

zzso zzso has been found to have zzso activity in patients with zzso This activity might be zzso by zzso of zzso zzso response zzso through patterns that are similar to those observed in patients with gastrointestinal zzso tumors who respond to zzso therapy, but zzso more zzso The benefit to the patient entailed by this pattern of tumor response in zzso needs to be zzso but may be limited in the presence of significant local zzso
