Because MR imaging is becoming integral to the evaluation and treatment of very early stroke, it is critical to prove that MR imaging is at least as sensitive to acute zzso zzso zzso as is zzso The present study was conducted to evaluate the possibility of detecting a small amount of acute zzso diluted by zzso not revealed by CT but identified on zzso zzso zzso MR images in an in zzso zzso 

Acute zzso was simulated with zzso of artificial zzso and zzso blood zzso zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso by zzso We scanned these zzso with CT and zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso inversion time, zzso zzso echo train zzso zzso and we measured zzso and zzso relaxation times of these zzso at temperatures within 36 degrees C to 37 degrees zzso zzso of CT value from the different zzso mixture ratios versus zzso were generated and correlated with the average CT value from normal zzso We measured zzso and zzso relaxation times of these zzso and normal zzso and generated zzso relaxation zzso as a function of effective TE for a specific inversion time zzso and determined the zzso zzso for the zzso sequence by using a theoretical equation for the zzso inversion recovery signal zzso 

Above a zzso of zzso blood, the mixture was denser on CT scans than was the normal zzso At a selected time longer than an effective TE of zzso above a zzso of zzso blood, the mixture was more zzso than the normal zzso on zzso zzso At selected times longer than an effective TE of zzso above a zzso of zzso blood, the mixture was more zzso than was the normal zzso 

zzso imaging is more sensitive than CT in the detection of a small amount of acute zzso diluted by zzso at selected appropriate zzso as determined in an in zzso zzso
