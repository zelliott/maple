This case study describes the usefulness of high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of the cervical spinal zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

To examine whether zzso imaging could zzso deterioration of cervical spinal zzso function associated with a variable degree of zzso and to determine its potential usefulness during assessment of zzso 

A few studies have described the use of zzso imaging in cervical zzso diseases, but zzso of the cervical spinal zzso before and after surgical zzso for zzso zzso has not been zzso The potential usefulness of zzso imaging for assessment of the function of compressed cervical zzso has not been discussed zzso 

An zzso scan was performed before and after surgery in seven patients with cervical zzso zzso The correlation between the zzso rate of zzso of the cervical spinal zzso and zzso scores was zzso The zzso rate of zzso in different zzso levels was also zzso 

zzso zzso rate of zzso was high in two patients but low in the other zzso At the time of the second zzso examination, zzso rate of zzso was higher in six of the seven patients, and the increase was associated with zzso zzso Use of zzso was not related to changes in signal zzso on zzso magnetic resonance zzso The zzso rate of zzso decreased at the affected zzso level in four patients, increased in two, and did not change in one, relative to the unaffected zzso 

zzso zzso zzso may provide clinically useful qualitative and quantitative zzso of impaired zzso activity of the compromised cervical spinal zzso in zzso zzso zzso images may also offer additional information related to zzso dysfunction induced by mechanical zzso
