To apply zzso and further develop a new image interpretation model based on repeated imaging and aimed at improving assessments of technical efficacy and diagnostic accuracy in the detection of small zzso 

zzso zzso was implanted in the liver of 14 rabbits as two zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed before and 4 days after zzso and then every second day up to the 14th to 20th zzso One zzso sequence zzso zzso and three zzso sequences zzso zzso GE zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso was performed zzso three readers independently interpreted image sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso were included at the last examination zzso zzso By concurrent interpretation of repeated zzso the earliest day at which tumors became visible and tumor size were recorded zzso zzso Records were corrected zzso 4) and autopsy was performed zzso zzso Two procedures for use in calculating repeated detection rates of tumors with different magnetic resonance imaging sequences are presented and zzso 

Of 40 zzso tumors, 34 were zzso They were mainly small zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when they became visible as determined at step 3, which was consistently earlier than observed at step zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and GE zzso did not differ significantly regarding earliest day of detection zzso zzso while zzso zzso revealed the tumors zzso The initial repeated detection rates were higher with zzso zzso than with the other zzso zzso of false zzso varied over time, indicating fluctuating criteria for reporting zzso 

A theoretical image interpretation model previously described proved to be zzso for detection of experimental liver zzso The model was improved by introducing calculations of repeated detection rates for initial image interpretation using an imaging reference zzso
