zzso white matter zzso zzso is a common zzso in brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso and is known to be associated with zzso zzso Previous studies revealed that the risk factors for cerebral zzso were age, female zzso hypertension and zzso In this study we examined the association between cerebral zzso and zzso syndrome, a cluster of hypertension, zzso zzso abdominal obesity and zzso 

We reviewed the results of brain zzso of zzso subjects who underwent routine zzso including laboratory tests at the Seoul National University Health Care zzso Among the subjects who met the inclusion criteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had cerebral zzso They were characterized by old age, female zzso higher body mass index zzso larger waist zzso higher blood pressure, higher zzso plasma zzso level, and higher zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso age, female gender and hypertension were the independent risk factors for cerebral zzso zzso syndrome was associated with cerebral zzso after adjusting for age and gender zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Among the components of zzso syndrome, hypertension was independently associated with cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Age, female gender and hypertension were risk factors for cerebral zzso in the Korean zzso zzso zzso was also associated with zzso zzso however, zzso syndrome offered no advantage over hypertension alone in predicting cerebral zzso
