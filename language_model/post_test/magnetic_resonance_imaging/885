The zzso of individuals exposed to zzso by inhalation is often based on zzso of zzso in body zzso such as blood, plasma or zzso or on assessments of DNA damage in zzso surrogate zzso such as peripheral blood zzso These techniques are of some use as zzso of internal exposure or biological effect, mainly in the case of soluble zzso compounds, but they provide at best only indirect information about zzso zzso in the main target organ of interest - the zzso An urgent need exists for a zzso technique to permit the zzso and zzso of zzso in the lung of exposed zzso This study details the development of a lung imaging technique based on the detection of zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso reductive conversion of zzso is a crucial zzso step in its zzso and the zzso method described here relies on the conversion of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso species such as zzso zzso studies with zzso revealed that a range of zzso zzso zzso instilled in rat lung is considered to be the lower limit of detection of this zzso It was possible to demonstrate the presence of 30 zzso zzso in our zzso rat zzso The ultimate objective of this work is to determine whether this technique has zzso to the zzso of zzso inhalation zzso that result in zzso lung doses in human zzso
