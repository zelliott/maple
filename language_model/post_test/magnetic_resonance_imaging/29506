To determine whether stunned zzso can be delineated at magnetic resonance zzso imaging with differential cellular zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso adult zzso rats underwent either zzso a sequence of three episodes of 10 minutes of coronary artery zzso and 12 minutes of zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso a single episode of 10 minutes of zzso followed by zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso designed to produce different degrees of zzso zzso or zzso a single episode of 2 minutes of zzso followed by zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso designed to produce no zzso zzso wall zzso was measured on zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso infused for 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained to detect subtle regional differences in zzso zzso Hearts were stained at sacrifice to define area at risk and to test for zzso zzso zzso of differences in mean values was evaluated with zzso analysis of zzso 

All hearts were free of zzso as detected with zzso zzso zzso On zzso zzso images, the hearts from rats in groups 1 and 2 exhibited clearly delineated regions of diminished zzso zzso in the expected territory of the zzso zzso The zzso extent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar to that of the area at risk zzso zzso zzso zzso wall zzso in the zzso was significantly zzso zzso less than in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso respectively, for groups 1 and zzso The hearts from rats in group 3 demonstrated no wall zzso deficit or abnormal zone on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was delineated with zzso MR imaging as a zzso zzso This finding suggests that zzso channel activity is diminished in stunned zzso
