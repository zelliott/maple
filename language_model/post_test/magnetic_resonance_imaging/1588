We used zzso zzso zzso analysis to investigate the generators of spikes with and without zzso jerks in a 12-year-old patient with zzso zzso zzso secondary to left zzso cortical zzso We recorded zzso and right wrist zzso zzso zzso and collected 42 spikes with jerks zzso zzso and 42 spikes without jerks zzso zzso We applied a single moving zzso model to the individual and averaged zzso zzso at the negative peak of individual jerking and zzso spikes were localized in the zzso zzso At the onset of the averaged jerking spike that preceded the zzso zzso by 20 zzso the zzso was in the motor cortex, whereas for the averaged zzso zzso the zzso was in the sensory zzso The zzso moment at averaged jerking spike onset was twice that of the averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of averaged spikes differentiated the generator of jerking and zzso spikes in zzso zzso zzso Individual zzso demonstrated the area of zzso cortical zzso
