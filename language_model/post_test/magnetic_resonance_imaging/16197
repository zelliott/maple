zzso zzso zzso zzso constitute zzso of all zzso and have long been zzso The purpose of our study was to investigate zzso features of this unique zzso in a cohort of 7 zzso 

CT and/or MR imaging features (with and without contrast zzso of 7 patients who underwent zzso for zzso proved zzso were reviewed and analyzed zzso zzso management was also zzso 

All zzso zzso from zzso region and extended into unilateral zzso angle in 6 cases, and bilateral in 1 zzso Seven tumors were of zzso origin and 5 of 7 were of zzso growth pattern with location in the zzso area of brain zzso On CT scans, tumors were zzso in solid component and zzso in zzso component with zzso or without zzso (3 zzso and destruction in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso formation zzso with zzso on zzso imaging and zzso on zzso imaging in 5 cases, zzso both on zzso and zzso imaging in 2 zzso The solid components and capsule revealed mild to moderate zzso enhancement after administration of contrast zzso Total tumor removal was accomplished in 5 cases, zzso removal and partial removal in 1 case zzso 

zzso are well zzso zzso tumors, typically with zzso parts or purely zzso Most of zzso demonstrate a zzso growth pattern and characteristic zzso zzso with zzso component arises from zzso region and then extends to zzso zzso which should be strongly suspected as a zzso The combined zzso and zzso approach is an ideal choice for surgical management of zzso
