The groin pain experienced by patients with hip zzso zzso is often accompanied by areas of referred pain and changes in skin zzso We aimed to identify the zzso influences that zzso these clinical manifestations that we consider indicative of possible central zzso 

Twenty patients with hip zzso awaiting joint replacement and displaying signs of referred pain were recruited into the study, together with zzso zzso All subjects completed pain psychology questionnaires and underwent quantitative sensory testing zzso in their area of referred zzso Twelve of 20 patients and their zzso and zzso controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while the areas of referred pain were zzso using cold stimuli (12 degrees zzso and zzso stimuli zzso zzso The remaining 8 of 20 patients underwent zzso stimulation zzso 

Patients were found to have significantly lower threshold perception to zzso stimuli and were zzso to the noxious zzso stimulus in their areas of referred zzso zzso brain imaging illustrated significantly greater zzso in the zzso of zzso patients in response to zzso stimulation of their referred pain areas compared with healthy controls, and the magnitude of this zzso positively correlated with the extent of zzso elements to the patient's pain, as indicated by the zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso and brain imaging methods zzso zzso we have identified increased activity with the zzso zzso matter associated with stimulation of the skin in referred pain areas of patients with hip zzso This offers a central target for analgesia aimed at improving the treatment of this largely peripheral zzso
