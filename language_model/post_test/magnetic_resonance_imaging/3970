zzso resonance images of the zzso zzso of male zzso guinea pigs were obtained in two and three dimensions at zzso T using a wide range of zzso and zzso imaging zzso The effect of slice position on zzso of zzso cartilage, bone and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso sections was investigated along with the resolution and zzso ratio zzso Based on that survey, a two-dimensional spin echo sequence zzso time zzso 1500 zzso echo time zzso 40 zzso was found to give optimum zzso of the normal joint anatomy with zzso resolution of 75 zzso 150 zzso and a 1 zzso slice thickness in an imaging time of 25 zzso This protocol was also found to be highly effective in distinguishing many features of the spontaneous, zzso pathology found in the zzso of older animals compared to juveniles and therefore provides a means of monitoring disease progression zzso zzso spin echo imaging methods demonstrated focal changes in signal intensity in the zzso cartilage of the zzso zzso plateau in older zzso The resulting imaging times of several hours, however, zzso their routine use in zzso
