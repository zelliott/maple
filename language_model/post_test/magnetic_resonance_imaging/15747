Most studies of zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso have applied the zzso correlation in the time courses to investigate the functional connectivity between brain zzso zzso the power of low frequency fluctuation zzso may also be used as a zzso to assess spontaneous zzso The purpose of the current study is to evaluate whether the zzso of the zzso zzso relates to cerebral zzso zzso Ten healthy subjects underwent four zzso zzso scanning sessions, two for zzso zzso and two for zzso zzso conditions, with two sets of parameters zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso After data zzso zzso was obtained by calculating the square root of the power spectrum in the frequency range of zzso zzso Our results showed that the zzso in zzso was significantly higher than that in zzso zzso zzso in the bilateral visual zzso Furthermore, the zzso in zzso was significantly reduced in the right zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso Region of interest zzso analysis showed that the zzso differences between zzso and zzso were consistent for each zzso In contrast, no significant zzso differences were found between zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso All these results agree well with previous studies comparing zzso and zzso zzso Our finding of the distinct zzso difference between zzso and zzso in the visual zzso implies that the zzso may be a novel zzso for zzso states of the zzso
