zzso hypersensitivity in gastric zzso is a possible zzso for functional zzso The cortical representation of gastric zzso is still zzso Growing evidence shows that the zzso but not the primary or secondary zzso region zzso or zzso may be the cortical target for visceral zzso Animal studies have also demonstrated that zzso plays an important role in processing visceral zzso We used zzso to study central projection of stomach pain from zzso balloon zzso We also tested the hypothesis that there will be neither zzso nor zzso zzso but zzso zzso with the zzso zzso A zzso was performed on 10 healthy subjects during zzso fullness zzso zzso zzso zzso and moderate gastric pain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal was zzso by zzso the predetermined zzso zzso zzso comparisons were performed between conditions on a group zzso zzso pain activated a wide range of cortical and zzso structures, including zzso and zzso anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amygdala, brain zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso A subset of these zzso zzso was engaged in the central processing of fullness zzso zzso and zzso were not activated during the zzso zzso In conclusion, the constellation of zzso structures activated by zzso zzso zzso the pain zzso induced zzso pain, with the exception of the absence of zzso or zzso zzso This may account for the vague nature of visceral zzso Our data also confirms that the zzso and zzso may act as the central role in visceral zzso as well as in the proposed zzso model of learning and memory of zzso
