zzso iron zzso zzso used as magnetic resonance zzso contrast agents undergo specific zzso by zzso The purpose of this study was first to determine the mechanism of zzso zzso for zzso by using competition experiments with specific zzso of scavenger receptors zzso zzso and second, to evaluate and compare the zzso of 2 different contrast agents, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso iron zzso using zzso obtained by chemical zzso of human zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso are 2 MR contrast agents, composed of zzso iron oxide zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was studied using competition experiments on mouse zzso zzso in the presence of specific zzso of scavenger receptors zzso zzso I and zzso zzso acid and zzso In zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso cells activated into zzso were performed in the presence of the 2 zzso zzso The cellular zzso was determined by measuring the iron content using zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso and by zzso blue zzso 

In the presence of zzso acid or zzso the zzso of zzso by mouse zzso zzso was zzso This zzso was obtained using 10 zzso of scavenger zzso zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso relationship was zzso Without zzso the percentage of zzso of zzso by mouse zzso zzso ranged between 3 and zzso On the human activated zzso zzso cell zzso zzso underwent a higher zzso zzso (between zzso and zzso compared with zzso (between zzso and zzso This difference is attributed to the larger size of zzso zzso 

Competition experiments indicate that the cellular zzso of zzso involves scavenger zzso zzso zzso The comparison between zzso and zzso confirms that zzso zzso of iron oxide zzso depends mainly on the size of these contrast zzso
