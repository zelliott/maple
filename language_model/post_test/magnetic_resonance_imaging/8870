In zzso studies, test items are followed by an instruction either to zzso or to zzso zzso Many zzso zzso stimuli are not retrieved at the recognition zzso However, some subjects are able to correctly zzso a high number of zzso zzso We examined whether this ability is reflected in the structure of brain regions involved in memory and the control of retrieval zzso In subjects with high recognition rates for zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed increased gray matter zzso volume in the left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and the right zzso zzso zzso volume in these regions correlated positively with the zzso recognition zzso No significant differences were detected in subjects who forgot many zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the right H and left zzso are of particular relevance in releasing zzso items from zzso caused by the F zzso
