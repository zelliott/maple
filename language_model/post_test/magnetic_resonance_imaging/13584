zzso individuals may develop zzso or zzso leading to losses of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso 

We compared the ability of a zzso formula for total zzso tissue zzso to estimate change in SAT with the use of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a criterion zzso 

We analyzed data from 2 clinical zzso a prospective zzso trial of protein supplements, progressive resistance training, or combined treatment in 29 zzso zzso women, and a prospective zzso trial of zzso human growth hormone in 25 zzso subjects with visceral zzso tissue zzso zzso Changes in fat by the zzso formula and in SAT, zzso and zzso by zzso were compared by linear regression, and zzso analyses were used to assess the agreement between the prediction and criterion zzso The zzso of the zzso measurement was evaluated in 14 zzso healthy adults studied twice within 1 zzso 

At zzso zzso fat was significantly associated with SAT zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not with zzso Change in zzso fat was significantly associated with change in SAT zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not in zzso The limits of agreement for the zzso zzso of change in SAT were zzso to zzso zzso and the SEE was zzso zzso The SEE for repeated measures of SAT in healthy control subjects was zzso 

The zzso formula can be used to predict change in zzso The limits of agreement and the SEE for predicting change in SAT by zzso are approximately twice as great as the error of repeated zzso measures in control zzso
