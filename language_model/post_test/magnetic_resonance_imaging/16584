zzso of simple zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso is a well-known zzso The purpose of this report is to introduce the similar occurrence of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the knee region, describe the associated magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings, and identify risk zzso There was zzso evidence of zzso in 20 of 38 zzso cases zzso mainly in the region of the zzso head and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and simple zzso share these zzso findings: zzso zzso fluid within surrounding zzso zzso planes and enhancement with intravenous contrast consistent with zzso The mean zzso diameter of the zzso zzso zzso was statistically significantly smaller than that of the zzso zzso The authors believe that zzso zzso of an zzso zzso is due to increased zzso pressures transmitted within the zzso and/or elevated zzso pressure delivered to the cyst, such as by zzso akin to the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso
