Previous work from our team and others has shown that manual acupuncture at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso brain network, and at the same time activates zzso regions of the zzso The objective of the present study was to explore the specificity and zzso of the brain response to manual acupuncture at zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are located on different zzso and are used to treat pain zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to monitor the brain responses to acupuncture at three different zzso we examined 46 healthy subjects who, according to their zzso responses, experienced zzso sensation during zzso Brain responses to stimulation at each of the zzso were displayed in conjunction with one another to show the spatial zzso We found clusters of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showing significant convergence of two or all three of the zzso The largest regions showing common responses to all three zzso were the right zzso zzso right zzso cingulate, right zzso of the zzso zzso and right zzso We also noted differences in major sections of the zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso formation, zzso zzso in the zzso cingulate, and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that although these zzso are commonly used for zzso and zzso effects, they may mobilize the same intrinsic global networks, with substantial overlap of common brain regions to mediate their zzso Our findings showing preferential response of certain zzso structures suggests zzso may also exhibit relative zzso
