We aimed to assess the impact of surgical pulmonary valve replacement zzso for severe pulmonary zzso zzso on zzso function and its effect on exercise zzso 

zzso patients zzso age zzso years, 47 zzso underwent surgical zzso for zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging to assess zzso size and function, and a zzso exercise test were performed before, and zzso zzso Median New York Heart Association class improved from 2 to 1 but peak oxygen zzso zzso did not zzso Left zzso zzso cardiac output increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso However, this was not associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or increased heart rate zzso zzso zzso rapid right zzso zzso filling increased significantly, whereas early zzso zzso zzso in RV wall decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso zzso RV and zzso late zzso zzso and their ratio to early zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with zzso and/or zzso peak zzso No correlations were found between indexes of zzso function and peak zzso either before or after zzso zzso evidence of restrictive RV physiology resolved after elimination of zzso 

zzso zzso for zzso improves RV filling and increases left zzso stroke volume, however, this could not be demonstrated by conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso function was associated with exercise zzso Because of its load dependency, zzso ratio failed in assessing zzso zzso zzso flow in pulmonary trunk in presence of severe zzso does not determine intrinsic zzso zzso
