zzso involvement in spinal tuberculosis zzso the zzso zzso formation, severity of zzso body, and disc collapse were evaluated from magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso 

To study the zzso involvement in spine zzso in relation to the degree of zzso body and disc collapse, zzso zzso collection, and degree of zzso and to correlate the occurrence of zzso involvement and the degree of spinal zzso 

There are a few reports describing the zzso element involvement in spinal zzso Typically, the infection resides in the anterior part of the zzso body zzso and rarely involved the zzso 

There were 31 patients, who had been diagnosed and treated for spinal zzso from 2003 to 2007 at our zzso Critical evaluation of each patient's zzso was carried out for the zzso involvement, zzso zzso formation, severity of zzso body, and disc zzso 

Spinal zzso mostly involved the zzso level zzso zzso involvement was noted in zzso of patients, and the highest involvement was at zzso zzso The mean zzso body, disc collapse, zzso zzso and zzso were more severe in zzso involved zzso 

The zzso spinal element, specifically the zzso is not uncommonly involved in spinal zzso zzso involvement is part of the disease process and usually associated with relatively severe zzso body and disc destruction, wide zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso involvement can be detected early from zzso and need to be documented as it may influence the treatment zzso
