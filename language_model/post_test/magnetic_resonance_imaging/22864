zzso resonance zzso imaging is useful for the diagnosis of brain zzso and zzso zzso We have developed a method of automated zzso to evaluate the degree of brain zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso MR images with thin slices without gaps are required for zzso and zzso However, obtaining such images requires that the patient remain at rest for a prolonged period, thereby reducing the zzso of MR imaging zzso zzso a method is needed for the reconstruction of zzso three-dimensional zzso data using routine zzso zzso and zzso MR images with zzso gaps and measurement of brain zzso The method of reconstructing zzso data consists of four zzso 1) zzso of the brain region on zzso zzso and zzso MR images using the zzso zzso 2) setting data to a zzso zzso 3) registration by manual zzso and 4) zzso between the data based on linear zzso In clinical MR images, the differences between this method and the conventional technique were less than zzso These results demonstrate that this technique is able to construct zzso data from zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso
