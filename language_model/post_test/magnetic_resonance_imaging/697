The ability to make direct comparisons between adult and child zzso data is important to the study of the neural basis of cognitive zzso Recent zzso studies in adults have used mixed zzso designs to extract activity consistent with zzso zzso zzso processes and zzso zzso zzso Because brain regions with different time courses of activity may have different roles in cognitive processing, the ability to distinguish between sustained and transient signals would contribute to understanding the functional roles of regions involved in cognitive zzso The zzso profile of such activity would give insight into how cognitive processing develops over zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of the mixed design to detect and zzso sustained and transient activity in children, and to determine if the time courses or zzso of the extracted signals differ from those extracted from zzso An zzso experiment was performed on 10 adults and 10 children zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso stimuli that produced zzso zzso and a combination of sustained and transient responses in visual zzso zzso were performed using the general linear model zzso assuming a shape for sustained effects, but not for transient zzso In visual cortex, neither transient nor sustained effects showed significant zzso zzso For both groups, zzso zzso stimuli produced robust responses in visual zzso zzso but not zzso to the zzso zzso extend the feasibility of direct statistical comparison of adults and children; mixed designs provide a means to examine neural activity in both adults and children related to zzso zzso zzso likely related to zzso zzso
