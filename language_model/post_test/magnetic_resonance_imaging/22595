To determine the range of normal and abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Using a zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso 2 observers evaluated zzso zzso zzso fast spin zzso zzso images of 71 persons zzso zzso volunteers and 35 patients with zzso rotator cuff tears zzso for the 1) zzso thickness of the zzso zzso 2) zzso extent of zzso from the zzso joint zzso and 3) because patients were zzso whether fluid was in the zzso quarter, middle quarter, anterior quarter, or zzso quarter of the zzso 

The range of zzso thickness was 0 to 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso median zzso 2 zzso in normal zzso and 0 to 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso median zzso 3 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Only 2 volunteers exceeded 3 zzso in zzso zzso In volunteers, zzso had no fluid present, zzso had a small amount of fluid lateral to the zzso and 1 had fluid directly beneath the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso patients, 37% had fluid directly under the zzso or zzso to the zzso Only 1 patient with an zzso had no zzso zzso In volunteers, most fluid was in the zzso quarter zzso or middle quarter zzso of the zzso whereas in zzso patients, most fluid was located in the anterior quarter of the zzso or anterior to the zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso fluid is rarely thicker than 2 zzso and tends to be located zzso An abnormal amount of fluid is present when the thickness exceeds 3 zzso fluid is present zzso to the zzso and fluid is seen in the part of the zzso anterior to the zzso
