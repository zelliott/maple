This prospective study was designed to zzso the advantages and pitfalls of zzso PET in detecting locally zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso 

We recruited zzso patients from two ongoing prospective zzso One is being performed to evaluate suspected local recurrence zzso zzso and the other to assess local treatment response 3 months after therapy zzso zzso Both groups received zzso PET and head and neck zzso The gold standard was zzso or zzso zzso An optimal zzso zzso zzso value zzso was zzso zzso 

From January 2002 to August 2004, 146 patients were zzso Thirty-four were from group A and 112 from group zzso In all, 26 had locally zzso zzso zzso in detection rate between zzso PET and zzso were not statistically significant in either zzso However, zzso PET showed significantly higher specificity than zzso in detecting residual zzso among patients with initial T4 disease zzso In contrast, the specificity of zzso PET for patients with an initial zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than that for patients not treated by zzso zzso vs zzso zzso At an zzso zzso of zzso PET showed an equal and a higher accuracy compared with zzso in groups A and B, zzso 

zzso PET is superior to zzso in identifying locally residual zzso among patients with initial T4 disease but demonstrates limitations in assessing treatment response in patients with initial zzso disease after zzso A zzso zzso is a useful index for aiding in the visual detection of locally zzso zzso
