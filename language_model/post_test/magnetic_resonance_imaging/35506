To demonstrate that zzso assessment of abdominal zzso tissue distribution by magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be improved by zzso automatic correction of signal zzso 

Twenty subjects zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso underwent abdominal (32 zzso MR imaging with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Many images were affected by relevant intensity zzso zzso zzso of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso was performed by a previously validated zzso exploiting standard fuzzy zzso zzso Images were also processed by an improved version of the software, including automatic correction of intensity zzso To assess the effectiveness of the two methods SAT and zzso volumes were compared with manual analysis performed by a trained zzso 

zzso of variation between manual and zzso analysis was significantly improved by zzso correction in SAT zzso zzso zzso of SAT was also zzso A less important performance improvement was found in zzso zzso 

The results of this study suggest that the compensation of signal zzso greatly improves the effectiveness of the zzso assessment of abdominal zzso Correction of intensity zzso is important in SAT evaluation and less significant in zzso zzso
