zzso addiction is associated with altered zzso functional connectivity among regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso regional brain activity and associated behavior in cocaine zzso however, the neural zzso effects of zzso in this population have not yet been zzso 

To use zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine changes in zzso connectivity with zzso and how connectivity of affected pathways relates to severity of cocaine zzso 

zzso zzso zzso crossover zzso 

Clinical research zzso 

zzso zzso individuals with cocaine use zzso 

Single doses of oral zzso (20 zzso or zzso were administered at each of 2 study zzso At each session, resting scans were acquired twice: immediately after drug administration zzso the onset of effects zzso and 120 minutes later zzso the window of peak zzso 

zzso connectivity strength was evaluated using a seed zzso correlation zzso Changes in this measure were examined to characterize the neural zzso effects of zzso severity of cocaine addiction was assessed by interview and zzso 

zzso zzso administration reduced an zzso strong connectivity of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower connectivity between these regions during zzso administration uniquely correlated with less severe zzso In contrast, zzso strengthened several zzso and zzso zzso 

These findings help zzso the neural zzso effects of zzso and suggest that short-term zzso can, at least zzso zzso abnormal zzso relevant to the zzso characteristics of cocaine zzso In particular, the effects of zzso within zzso and cortical pathways constitute a potentially viable mechanism by which zzso could facilitate control of behavior in cocaine zzso
