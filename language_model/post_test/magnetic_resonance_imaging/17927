To evaluate the utility of zzso zzso in suspected cerebral pathology in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso scans from 29 zzso individuals (29 brain scans, 22 zzso zzso who presented with neurological symptoms and signs were zzso reviewed and compared with subsequent clinical zzso 

The majority of patients zzso were referred to differentiate infection from zzso causes of cerebral zzso Ten of the 11 patients with an eventual diagnosis of zzso infection were correctly diagnosed by zzso zzso showing zzso zzso less than that of normal brain zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso - zzso All five patients with a final diagnosis of primary central nervous system zzso zzso were correctly diagnosed by zzso zzso showing zzso zzso greater than that of normal brain zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso - zzso Four of the five patients with zzso zzso features suggesting a zzso process had zzso confirmed as the final zzso Three patients showed variable zzso in multiple cerebral zzso (including final diagnoses of tuberculosis and zzso from lung cancer in two zzso and there were four other zzso zzso In 12 patients zzso were performed at sites guided by PET zzso (7 brain, 5 zzso zzso confirming or excluding significant disease in zzso 

zzso zzso is particularly useful for zzso between infection and zzso in zzso patients with a cerebral zzso on zzso or zzso zzso zzso was also a helpful tool in the diagnostic zzso of patients with other zzso cerebral zzso Additional advantages of zzso zzso are the abilities to assess zzso increased zzso metabolism in the body and to identify potential sites for zzso
