The neural bases of the association between negative zzso and zzso remain unknown in healthy zzso Building on the role of the cortical zzso structures zzso in self-referential processing, we hypothesized that negative zzso in healthy subjects would be associated with an increased zzso of the zzso during self-referential zzso We presented positive and negative pictures to 45 healthy subjects during zzso and asked them to judge whether the pictures were related to themselves or not zzso zzso or whether the pictures were positive or negative zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by the level of harm avoidance zzso with the zzso and Character zzso zzso processing activated the zzso including the zzso and zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso A higher zzso score was associated with a greater zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso during self-referential processing, this greater zzso being more pronounced for negative pictures in the zzso zzso This increased zzso of the zzso may embody the association between negative zzso and zzso in healthy subjects, as previously observed in major zzso Within the zzso the zzso zzso may play a key role in negative zzso zzso an increased attention to negative stimuli with an increased attention to the zzso
