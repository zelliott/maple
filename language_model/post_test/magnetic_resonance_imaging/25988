In the diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso after zzso zzso can be identified by zzso whereas zzso and zzso can only be suspected in a routine clinical zzso The present pilot study was undertaken to investigate the diagnostic role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the differentiation of zzso zzso and zzso in women with zzso zzso zzso Thirteen women zzso age 61, zzso zzso 7 zzso with zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso S 15, zzso A median zzso image series was obtained with a zzso zzso fast field zzso both at rest and during zzso zzso zzso allowed the identification of zzso zzso and zzso and differentiation between zzso and zzso in cases with zzso clinical zzso These findings make dissection more reliable and improve the outcome of zzso zzso No additional diagnostic information is obtained with zzso compared to ultrasound in the assessment of zzso
