Memory is thought to be constructive in nature, where features processed in different cortical regions are zzso during zzso In an effort to support this constructive memory zzso the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study assessed whether memory for color zzso color processing zzso During zzso participants were presented with colored and gray abstract zzso During zzso old and new shapes were presented in gray and participants responded zzso zzso or zzso Within color perception regions, color memory related activity was observed in the left zzso zzso adjacent to the collateral zzso A zzso mapping analysis indicated this activity occurred within color processing region zzso The present feature specific evidence provides compelling support for a constructive view of zzso
