Enhancement characteristics of breast zzso are regarded as a major criterion for their differential diagnosis in dynamic breast zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in zzso zzso exhibits a highly zzso enhancement pattern when kinetic analysis is performed conventionally by manual placement of region of interest zzso and therefore its diagnosis remains zzso 

To compare enhancement characteristics of zzso zzso on dynamic zzso using manual zzso placement with zzso analysis and to evaluate whether the latter might increase the detection rate of kinetic features suspicious for zzso 

The enhancement patterns of 47 zzso verified pure zzso zzso were evaluated on zzso images using manual zzso placement as well as a commercially available computer analysis zzso The latter is able to automatically assess enhancement characteristics of a whole zzso zzso zzso features evaluated included zzso of zzso enhancement pattern into zzso plateau or persistent curve zzso A zzso and plateau enhancement pattern are regarded as suggestive for zzso 

zzso zzso revealed zzso enhancement in 2 zzso mass enhancement in 11, and zzso enhancement in zzso Manual placement of zzso demonstrated a suspicious enhancement pattern in zzso of the zzso zzso which could not be significantly increased using zzso zzso Of the mass and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, demonstrated suspicious kinetic zzso After application of the automated analysis software, the detection rate of suspicious enhancement patterns was unchanged in mass zzso zzso and increased to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the increase in the detection of zzso zzso alone was significant zzso In all, zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated a suspicious curve type with manual zzso Computer analysis increased the detection of suspicious enhancement patterns in a zzso manner to zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The detection of suspicious enhancement zzso could not be significantly increased in zzso zzso when using zzso analysis despite a significantly higher detection rate of zzso zzso zzso
