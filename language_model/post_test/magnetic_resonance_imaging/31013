zzso is a zzso symptom that affects up to zzso of the population for whom no satisfactory treatment zzso The authors present a novel surgical approach for the treatment of intractable zzso based on cortical stimulation of the auditory zzso zzso can be considered an auditory phantom phenomenon similar to zzso pain, which is observed in the zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by a change in the zzso map of the auditory zzso Furthermore, there is a highly positive association between the zzso intensity of the zzso and the amount of shift in zzso frequency in the auditory cortex, that is, the amount of cortical zzso This cortical reorganization can be demonstrated by functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso is a zzso method of zzso or zzso focal areas of the human zzso Linked to a navigation system that is guided by zzso images of the auditory system, zzso can suppress areas of cortical zzso If it is successful in suppressing a patient's zzso this focal and temporary effect can be zzso by zzso a cortical zzso A zzso auditory zzso zzso zzso session was performed in a patient who suffered from zzso due to a cochlear nerve zzso Complete suppression of the zzso was zzso At a later time an zzso zzso was implanted with the guidance of auditory zzso imaging zzso zzso the patient's zzso disappeared and remains absent 10 months zzso zzso zzso electrical stimulation of the primary auditory zzso at the area of cortical plasticity is capable of suppressing zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic stimulation may be an ideal method for zzso studies of surgical candidates in whom stimulating zzso might be implanted for zzso zzso
