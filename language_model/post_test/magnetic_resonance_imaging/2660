zzso zzso is associated with a significant inflammatory response, which can be zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso into tissue during zzso producing zzso enhancement on magnetic resonance zzso This study determines zzso whether zzso enhancement occurs during deep zzso zzso zzso and zzso whether this enhancement changes with time and can therefore establish the age of zzso 

Patients with a diagnosis of zzso zzso by duplex ultrasound who were referred for zzso to document central zzso extent were zzso zzso weighted images were obtained before and after zzso injection zzso zzso repeat scans were obtained up to 3 months zzso At the level of maximum zzso zzso of signal intensity were made at the periphery zzso and the center of the zzso zzso as well as the zzso normal zzso on images after zzso zzso zzso vein signal intensity ratios were then calculated and zzso 

A total of 39 scans were obtained in 14 patients zzso men, six zzso The zzso veins were zzso with a peripheral rim of enhancement zzso zzso The zzso ratio for zzso veins zzso zzso zzso was different from that of normal veins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso For all acute studies zzso or zzso 14 zzso the zzso ratio was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 31), whereas for all chronic studies zzso 14 zzso the zzso ratio was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Among patients who underwent both early and late studies, the zzso ratio dropped significantly, from zzso zzso zzso acutely to zzso zzso zzso in chronic studies zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso One patient with active zzso had a zzso increase in zzso ratio over time and a clinical recurrence of symptoms, suggesting active zzso 

We conclude that zzso a pattern of peripheral zzso enhancement zzso zzso is seen around acutely zzso veins on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the ratio of signal intensity at the rim versus the center of the zzso vein may be a good zzso of acute compared with chronic zzso which may help direct zzso
