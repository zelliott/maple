To report our experience with magnetic resonance imaging zzso in fetal heart zzso 

Two zzso examined 31 zzso of fetuses with no ultrasound zzso evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were acquired for zzso zzso fast imaging with zzso free zzso zzso and zzso sequences with real-time zzso free zzso oriented like standard fetal zzso projections were acquired for the characterization of cardiovascular zzso and zzso 

In every case, zzso assessed the zzso zzso The zzso view and the zzso view of the left zzso were obtained in all zzso the zzso view of the zzso arch in 28, the zzso view of the zzso zzso in 17, the zzso view in 12, the zzso of the left zzso in 9, the zzso view in 7, the zzso view in 3, and the zzso view of the zzso arch and the zzso view of the arch and the zzso zzso simultaneously in 2 zzso 

Our preliminary experience demonstrates the feasibility to zzso the fetal heart with routine fetal zzso protocols in particular, by means of acquisition of zzso imaging zzso zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso potentially making zzso a zzso tool to add to fetal zzso in the prenatal study of zzso cardiac zzso
