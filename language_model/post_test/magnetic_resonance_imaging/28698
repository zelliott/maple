We investigated the findings in diffusion weighted image zzso of super acute zzso examined within 6 hours after onset by questionnaire zzso The magnitude of magnetic field of MR machine, method of diffusion weighted imaging, the total number of cases, the number of cases with high signal intensity area on zzso and the number of decrease or disappearance of signal intensity were zzso Answers were obtained from 16 zzso zzso zzso 232 cases of super acute zzso examined within 6 hours after onset were zzso by zzso High signal intensity area were detected in 189 cases zzso of all, which disappeared or decreased in 10 cases zzso Follow up zzso revealed a decrease in the area of high signal intensity in 5 zzso of 28 cases who underwent zzso by zzso zzso However, 6 zzso or 28 cases resulted in zzso zzso We must recognize the diffusion zzso apparent diffusion zzso and b value in reading the zzso In conclusion, high signal intensity area on zzso include not only irreversible zzso but also the zzso zzso
