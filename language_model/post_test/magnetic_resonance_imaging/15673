To describe the magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of zzso zzso and to suggest a role for zzso in its zzso 

Twenty-five patients with primary zzso zzso treated at our institution between 1996 and 2005 were included in the zzso The zzso examinations were reviewed and zzso dimensions, signal characteristics and involvement of pelvic structures were zzso as were sites of enlarged zzso zzso and zzso Details of patient treatment and outcome were obtained from the clinical zzso 

The median patient age was 54 years zzso zzso zzso zzso maximum diameter ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Most zzso were of zzso signal to muscle on zzso images and zzso to muscle on zzso zzso zzso percent of patients had zzso extending beyond the zzso and zzso of patients had zzso stage III or above zzso Sixteen patients were treated with zzso zzso with zzso five with surgery and four with supportive zzso Ten patients zzso died of their disease during the study zzso The zzso stage of the zzso correlated with zzso 

zzso identified over zzso of primary zzso zzso in the present study, enabled zzso staging, which correlated with outcome, and provided information of use in treatment zzso
