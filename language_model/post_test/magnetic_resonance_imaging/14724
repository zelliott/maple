zzso zzso for primary systemic tumors have limited access to brain zzso because of the zzso barrier zzso The aim of this study was to develop a strategy for specifically zzso the zzso at sites of cerebral zzso 

zzso mice were injected zzso to induce brain zzso After zzso zzso either tumor necrosis factor zzso or zzso zzso was administered zzso and 2 to 24 hours later zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso zzso zzso was assessed in zzso using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and confirmed zzso Brain zzso of zzso was determined using in zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso receptors was determined zzso in both mouse and human brain tissue containing zzso Group differences were analyzed with one-way analysis of zzso followed by post hoc tests, zzso signed rank test, and zzso with zzso multiple comparison zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso expression of zzso zzso 1 zzso was evident on the vascular zzso associated with brain zzso Administration of zzso or zzso zzso the zzso to zzso zzso selectively at sites of brain zzso with peak effect at 6 zzso zzso zzso ratio of zzso was also demonstrated after systemic zzso administration vs control zzso vs zzso Human brain zzso displayed a similar zzso zzso profile compared with the mouse model, with predominantly vascular zzso zzso 

These findings describe a new approach to selectively zzso the zzso at sites of brain zzso to aid in detection of zzso and facilitate zzso access of zzso zzso We zzso that this zzso works primarily though zzso zzso and has the potential for clinical zzso
