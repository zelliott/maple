zzso zzso and zzso zzso are associated with poor outcome of very zzso zzso while the role of more subtle cerebral zzso as detected by zzso zzso is less zzso 

In this study, we related zzso zzso and signs of brain zzso to zzso outcome at 3 y of zzso 

All zzso infants born in 1997 in our institution with a zzso age zzso zzso or zzso zzso g were subjected to repeated standardized zzso ultrasound examinations until zzso zzso were examined at 3 y of age employing the zzso zzso of zzso Development zzso 

zzso infants were enrolled zzso zzso g zzso 1200 zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso were detected in 42 infants zzso in 12 cases zzso zzso zzso in 30 cases zzso zzso At zzso 18 infants zzso had signs of brain zzso zzso outcome was assessed in 64 zzso zzso with signs of brain zzso scored significantly lower on zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso zzso than infants without zzso zzso zzso were not related to zzso 

Our data show that infants with zzso signs of brain zzso at discharge achieve lower scores in zzso testing at 3 zzso
