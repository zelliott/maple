The purpose of this study was to assess the distribution of zzso zzso inside a zzso phantom of the human head and torso and compare the results with the zzso temperature rise at the tip of a straight zzso zzso specifically examining the dependence of the temperature rise on the position of the implant inside the zzso zzso experiments were performed in two different zzso MR systems of the same zzso zzso distribution inside the liquid was assessed using a custom measurement zzso The temperature rise at the implant tip was measured in various implant positions and zzso using zzso zzso The results show that local zzso strength in the direction of the implant is a critical factor in zzso tissue zzso The actual zzso distribution, which is dependent on zzso properties and the zzso zzso must be considered when assessing the effects of zzso power deposition in implant safety zzso
