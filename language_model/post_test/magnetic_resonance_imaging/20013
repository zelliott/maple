To validate the provisional findings of a number of smaller studies and explore additional zzso of characteristic diagnostic investigation results across the entire clinical spectrum of sporadic zzso disease zzso an international collaborative study was undertaken zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso zzso We assessed the influence of age at disease zzso illness zzso prion protein gene zzso zzso 129 zzso zzso zzso or zzso and molecular zzso on the diagnostic sensitivity of zzso cerebral zzso and the zzso zzso zzso For zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso we also assessed the influence of the time point in a patient's illness at which the investigation was performed on the likelihood of a typical or positive zzso Analysis included a large subset of patients zzso zzso zzso in whom molecular zzso had been performed using a combination of the zzso zzso 129 zzso and the form of zzso resistant prion protein zzso 1 or 2 according to zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso Brown zzso zzso W, zzso O, zzso I, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso Julien J, Vital C, zzso B, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of sporadic zzso disease based on molecular and zzso analysis of 300 zzso Ann zzso zzso zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso for the whole group paralleled the subset with molecular zzso data available, showing that age at disease onset and disease duration were independent zzso of typical changes on zzso while illness duration significantly influenced positive zzso zzso protein zzso changes on brain zzso were not influenced by either of these clinical zzso but overall, imaging data were less complete and consequently conclusions are more zzso In addition to age at disease onset and illness zzso molecular zzso was zzso as an important independent zzso of investigation zzso In zzso analyses that included molecular zzso time point of the investigation during a patient's illness was found not to influence the occurrence of a typical or positive zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso A typical zzso was most often seen in zzso patients and was significantly less likely in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso patients had an increased likelihood of a typical brain zzso Overall, the zzso zzso zzso was the most frequently positive investigation zzso but performed significantly less well in the very uncommon zzso and zzso zzso Our findings confirm a number of zzso of principal investigation results in sporadic zzso and underscore the importance of recognizing these zzso limitations before accepting the diagnosis excluded or zzso zzso of investigations offer the best chance of zzso especially for the less common molecular zzso such as zzso and zzso
