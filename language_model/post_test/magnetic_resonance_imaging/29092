zzso zzso triggered or gated magnetic resonance methods are used in many imaging zzso zzso a reliable trigger signal derived from to the zzso of the zzso is essential, especially in cardiac zzso However, currently available methods often fail mainly due to the artifacts in the zzso generated by the MR scanner itself, such as the zzso effect and zzso switching zzso The purpose this study was to characterize the accuracy of selected zzso detection zzso in an MR environment, and to develop novel approaches to eliminate imprecise zzso zzso zzso in 12 healthy volunteers exposed to zzso T magnetic field were digitized and used as a reference data set including manually corrected zzso of zzso To define the zzso effect, the zzso were characterized in time, frequency, and spatial zzso The selected real-time zzso detection zzso and a new zzso zzso zzso were applied either to standard surface leads calculated from the recorded zzso or to the zzso zzso The flow related artifact was higher in zzso than the zzso in zzso of the investigated zzso which yielded up to zzso positive detected zzso complexes for traditional zzso The zzso zzso detection zzso yielded a score of zzso for detection with zzso false zzso and was superior to all the other selected zzso Thus, the zzso of subjects exposed to a strong magnetic field can be use to separate the zzso artifact and the actual zzso and markedly improves the trigger accuracy in gated magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
