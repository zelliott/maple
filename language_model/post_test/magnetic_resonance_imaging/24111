A novel zzso approach for correcting intensity zzso in magnetic resonance zzso images is zzso This approach is based solely on the assumption that the various sources of zzso in MR imaging give rise to smooth variations in image intensity, and that these variations can be extracted and corrected zzso The advantage of this zzso fast method is that it can be applied early in quantitative analysis while being independent of pulse sequence and is insensitive to pathological zzso This zzso has been tested on both simulated and real zzso Application to tissue zzso and functional MR imaging has shown a marked improvement in quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
