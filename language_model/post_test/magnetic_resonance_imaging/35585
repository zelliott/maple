The zzso analysis of brain zzso during the execution of easy zzso zzso and difficult zzso zzso tasks was investigated using zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso showed that reasoning tasks zzso zzso zzso a more negative zzso zzso zzso than did the baseline task zzso between 500 and 1000 zzso zzso source analysis of difference waves zzso and zzso indicated that the negative components were both localized near the left thalamus, possibly associated with the retrieval of alphabetical zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso a more positive zzso component zzso than did zzso in the same time zzso Two generators of zzso were located in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and the left frontal zzso zzso which was possibly involved in zzso information in zzso zzso In the stage of zzso zzso a greater zzso zzso in the reasoning tasks as compared to zzso was found over zzso scalp zzso A generator of this effect was located in the left zzso zzso and was possibly related to zzso memory and zzso of zzso Then, a greater zzso in the reasoning tasks, in comparison to zzso task, developed between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso source analysis zzso localized the generator of zzso in the left prefrontal zzso zzso 10) which was possibly related to mapping the zzso to the target problem, and the generator of zzso in the left prefrontal zzso zzso 9) which was possibly related to deciding whether a conclusion correctly follows from the zzso
