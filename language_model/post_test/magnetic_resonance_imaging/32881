The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneous bilateral hip imaging at 7 zzso zzso joint zzso becomes clinically critical since recent advances have made hip zzso an zzso approach to treat a variety of early hip zzso The success of these treatments requires a reliable and accurate diagnosis of zzso abnormalities at an early zzso zzso cartilage assessment is especially important to guide surgical decisions but is difficult to achieve with current MR zzso Because of gains in tissue contrast and spatial resolution reported at ultra high magnetic fields, there are strong expectations that imaging the hip joint at 7 zzso will improve diagnostic zzso Furthermore, there is growing evidence that the majority of these hip abnormalities occur zzso emphasizing the need for bilateral zzso However, obtaining high quality images in the human zzso in particular of both hips zzso must overcome a major challenge arising from the zzso traveling wave zzso of zzso waves at 7 zzso that leads to severe zzso in transmit B1 zzso zzso ) phase and zzso typically resulting in areas of low signal and contrast, and consequently zzso use for clinical zzso To overcome this problem, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used, together with a B1 zzso zzso aiming at maximizing zzso zzso in six regions of interest over the hips that were identified on zzso scout zzso Our successful results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces zzso observed before B1 zzso and provides high joint tissue contrast in both hips while reducing the required zzso zzso Critical to this success was a fast small flip angle zzso zzso zzso scan that permitted the zzso of zzso B1 zzso solutions, a necessary step to account for large spatial variations in zzso zzso phase observed in different zzso
