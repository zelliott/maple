We have previously demonstrated that zzso but not zzso volumes are associated with poor outcome in patients with chronic zzso Present zzso study was designed to investigate progressive differences in zzso volumes among chronic schizophrenia patients with different outcomes and healthy zzso 

zzso zzso scans were acquired at baseline and at follow-up four years later to evaluate zzso changes in 26 zzso schizophrenia patients, 23 zzso patients and 16 healthy zzso 

zzso patients with different outcomes entered the study with similar volumes of the zzso nucleus and zzso The rate of decline in volumes of the zzso was greater in patients with poor outcome than in the zzso group, so that their zzso but not zzso volumes were significantly smaller at the time of zzso There were no differences in baseline and follow-up volumes of the zzso or in the rate of their progression among patients with schizophrenia and healthy comparison zzso The zzso volumes were lower in schizophrenia patients than healthy subjects at baseline and zzso but showed no differential patterns of progression between the zzso 

Volumes of the zzso may represent a zzso marker of treatment responsiveness and outcome in patients with chronic zzso
