The neural zzso of anxiety associated with obsessive-compulsive zzso provocation in normal volunteers are zzso 

Ten healthy volunteers participated in four functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso were scanned while viewing alternating blocks of emotional zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and neutral pictures, and imagining scenarios related to the content of each picture zzso zzso brain mapping analyses were zzso 

In response to the provocative pictures in all experiments, increases in zzso anxiety and zzso in bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and visual regions were zzso zzso related to different symptom dimensions was associated with different patterns of zzso provocation of zzso anxiety predominantly activated zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso anxiety predominantly activated zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso anxiety predominantly activated zzso prefrontal regions and the left zzso 

Our findings support a zzso model of obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso zzso 1) the brain systems implicated in the mediation of anxiety in response to zzso material in normal subjects are similar to those identified in zzso patients during symptom zzso and 2) anxiety associated with different symptom dimensions is associated with differential patterns of zzso of these neural zzso Further investigation of the neural basis of zzso symptom dimensions is zzso
