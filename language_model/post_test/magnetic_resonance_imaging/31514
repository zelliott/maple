The aim of this study was to explore whether there is a relationship between the degree of zzso inflammation using ultra small zzso iron oxide zzso zzso and zzso stress using finite element analysis zzso techniques, in carotid zzso zzso 

18 patients with zzso proven carotid zzso underwent zzso MR imaging before and 36 h after zzso zzso zzso weighted images were manually segmented into zzso and the signal change in each zzso zzso to adjacent muscle was calculated after zzso zzso zzso geometry was obtained from the rest of the zzso zzso and used within a zzso model to predict zzso stress concentration within each zzso zzso a new statistical model was developed to explicitly investigate the form of the relationship between zzso stress and signal zzso The zzso rank correlation zzso for zzso enhanced signal change and zzso zzso stress was zzso zzso 

There is an association between zzso stress and zzso enhanced zzso inflammation within carotid zzso both known risk factors for plaque zzso This zzso the complex interaction between zzso processes and zzso mechanisms in the development of carotid zzso However, this is preliminary data that will need validation in a larger cohort of zzso
