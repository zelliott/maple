zzso techniques represent a powerful tool for shoulder joint zzso zzso However, the restricted field of view may prevent the acquisition of complete zzso and zzso bone models and hence limiting the zzso of standardized anatomical coordinate system zzso zzso The aim of this study was to propose zzso definitions for both zzso and zzso which can be implemented when limited portions of the relevant bones are zzso zzso resonance zzso images of zzso right zzso and zzso were zzso The proposed zzso were assessed in terms of zzso sensitivity to bone zzso variation, zzso zzso - and zzso - operator zzso and zzso consistency with the anatomical zzso zzso A comparison with alternative zzso definitions was also zzso Overall, our zzso zzso proposal and that presented in zzso and zzso zzso were found to be the least sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso angular absolute zzso lower than zzso and they were characterized by a high zzso - and zzso - operator zzso zzso angular absolute zzso lower than zzso The zzso zzso proposal showed a zzso zzso similar to zzso et zzso zzso zzso angular absolute zzso lower than zzso but a higher zzso The zzso and zzso zzso mean angular zzso from the reference anatomical zzso directions were smaller than zzso and zzso zzso The proposed zzso and zzso zzso definitions are therefore suitable to be applied when a limited portion of the zzso joint is available as it may occur in standard shoulder clinical zzso
