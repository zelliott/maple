To evaluate the usefulness of zzso before and after zzso administration, in diagnosing zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

One hundred and eight patients with suspected pancreatic disease, underwent dynamic magnetic resonance zzso zzso before and after zzso administration zzso zzso images were evaluated for zzso of zzso zzso zzso size of the main pancreatic duct and of the zzso The onset of zzso filling was calculated on dynamic zzso zzso zzso findings were compared to zzso retrograde zzso zzso ones zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso patients zzso at zzso and in zzso patients zzso at zzso zzso confirmed the diagnosis in zzso patients, with 1 false zzso 3 patients did not undergo zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso patients at zzso and in additional zzso zzso patients at zzso only in patients with zzso zzso were confirmed in zzso patients at zzso in zzso patient zzso was zzso The duct of zzso was significantly larger zzso zzso in the pancreatic head, in patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared to those with zzso only zzso zzso A significant reduction in size of the pancreatic duct zzso and of the zzso zzso was observed after zzso The onset of zzso filling was significantly delayed in patients with zzso zzso vs zzso zzso 

zzso helps to identify patients with zzso zzso and zzso a known cause of zzso pancreatic zzso which benefits from zzso zzso
