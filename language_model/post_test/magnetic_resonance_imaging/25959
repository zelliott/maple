An zzso for the automatic alignment of zzso volumes of the human brain was developed, based on techniques adopted from the computer vision literature for image motion zzso Most image registration techniques rely on the assumption that corresponding zzso in the two volumes have equal intensity, which is not true for zzso volumes acquired with different coils and/or pulse zzso zzso zzso and contrast zzso were used to minimize the differences between the zzso of the two zzso However, these zzso steps do not correct perfectly for the image differences when using different coils and/or pulse zzso zzso the alignment zzso relies on robust zzso which automatically ignores zzso where the zzso are sufficiently different in the two zzso A zzso pyramid zzso enables the zzso to estimate large zzso The resulting zzso is used routinely to align zzso volumes acquired using different protocols zzso zzso and zzso fast spin zzso and different coils zzso and zzso to zzso accuracy zzso than 1 zzso
