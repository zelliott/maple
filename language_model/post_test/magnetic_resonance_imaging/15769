zzso and zzso are two fundamental dimensions of human personality that influence cognitive functioning in healthy zzso Little is known about personality changes that may occur in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso nor about, in particular, their zzso zzso The aim of this study is to determine the impact of personality characteristics on brain activity in patients with zzso zzso patients with clinically zzso zzso zzso without any evidence of psychiatric or cognitive disorders and thirteen healthy controls matched for age, gender and education were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during the execution of an zzso zzso No differences were detected on the behavioral tests between the two groups, although the zzso patients had lower total zzso and showed a trend towards higher zzso and zzso scores than did the zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso scores were positively associated with brain activity in the zzso network including the superior zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso in both groups during the high load condition of the zzso zzso Given the overlapping neural systems found in the two groups, we suggest that the neural activity associated with specific personality dimension is a zzso characteristic preserved in patients with zzso at an early stage in the course of their zzso
