zzso resonance imaging zzso techniques have been zzso to zzso measure the zzso profile of zzso zzso as a function of flow rate, particle zzso and particle zzso The experimental zzso profiles in tube flow were described by a power law zzso the power law zzso decreased as flow rate, particle zzso and particle size zzso This work is relevant to zzso processing of particulate zzso
