We present a case of giant zzso zzso with special reference to a new operative approach in cases of zzso tumor in the anterior zzso zzso Our new approach is characterized as zzso zzso of the bilateral zzso roof and frontal zzso en zzso following zzso conventional zzso zzso zzso of the frontal lobe is minimized and it is possible to zzso with ease, a good operative field extending to the region adjacent to the zzso zzso Using this technique combined with the zzso approach, even in the case of marked zzso downward extension of a zzso zzso it should be possible to remove the tumor zzso This approach should open a way to a wide range of zzso
