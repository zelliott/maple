The prevalence of zzso syndrome zzso parallels the rise in childhood zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso in adults, but this is thought to be a long-term effect of poor zzso It would be important to ascertain whether these brain complications are also present among adolescents with zzso a group without clinically manifest vascular disease and relatively short duration of poor zzso 

zzso adolescents with and 62 without zzso matched on age, socioeconomic status, school grade, zzso and ethnicity, received zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso showed significantly lower zzso zzso attention, and mental flexibility and a trend for lower overall zzso They also had, in a zzso fashion, smaller zzso volumes, increased brain zzso fluid, and reductions of zzso integrity in major white matter zzso 

We document lower cognitive performance and reductions in brain structural integrity among adolescents with zzso thus suggesting that even relatively short-term zzso in zzso in the absence of clinically manifest vascular disease, may give rise to brain zzso In view of these alarming results, it is plausible that zzso zzso disease, short of type 2 diabetes zzso may be mechanistically linked to lower the academic and professional potential of zzso Although obesity may not be enough to stir clinicians or even parents into action, these results in adolescents strongly argue for an early and comprehensive zzso We propose that brain function be introduced among the parameters that need to be evaluated when considering early treatment of childhood zzso
