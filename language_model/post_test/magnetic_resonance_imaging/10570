To assess zzso the incremental value of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and combined zzso MR zzso zzso imaging to the staging zzso for predicting zzso prostate cancer zzso 

The institutional review board approved this zzso study and issued a waiver of informed consent for review of the MR reports and clinical zzso Between November 1, 1999, and November 1, 2004, 229 patients underwent zzso MR imaging and zzso underwent combined zzso MR zzso zzso imaging before radical zzso Mean patient age was 58 years zzso zzso zzso MR studies were interpreted zzso by 12 zzso who were informed of patients' clinical zzso On the basis of the MR reports, the risks of zzso extension, seminal zzso invasion, and zzso zzso zzso were scored zzso from 1 to zzso the highest score was zzso from 6 to determine a score (from 1 to 5) for the likelihood of zzso on MR zzso The staging zzso were used to calculate the likelihood of zzso on the basis of serum zzso zzso level, zzso grade at zzso and clinical zzso zzso findings constituted the reference zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate the multivariable relations between zzso and MR zzso The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was calculated for each zzso The zzso method was used for bias zzso 

MR findings contributed significant incremental value zzso zzso zzso to the zzso in the overall study zzso The contribution of MR findings was significant in all risk groups but was greatest in the zzso and high-risk groups zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso in the prediction of zzso with MR was higher when MR zzso imaging was used, but the difference was not zzso 

zzso MR imaging and combined zzso MR zzso zzso imaging contribute significant incremental value to the staging zzso in predicting zzso
