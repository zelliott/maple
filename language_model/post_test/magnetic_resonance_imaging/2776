zzso echoes are widely used for imaging functional tissue parameters such as diffusion zzso zzso and flow zzso They are potentially interesting for the assessment of various cardiac zzso However, severe limitations of the zzso echo acquisition mode occur, which are related to the special dynamic properties of the beating heart and flowing zzso To the well-known signal zzso due to zzso relaxation and zzso motion between the preparation and the zzso period of the zzso zzso additional signal loss is often zzso As the prepared zzso is fixed with respect to the zzso this signal loss is caused by the tissue deformation during the cardiac cycle, which leads to a modification of the zzso frequency of the zzso These effects are theoretically derived and zzso by phantom and in zzso zzso
