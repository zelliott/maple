zzso interference zzso which is formed through repetition of certain behavior and lasts for a while, needs to be inhibited in order for subsequent behavior to prevail over the zzso zzso Although the zzso mechanisms in the zzso have been reported that are recruited long after one behavior is updated to another, very little is known about the zzso mechanisms that are recruited immediately after the zzso The zzso was modified in the present zzso study such that zzso of zzso could be examined both immediately after and long after update of zzso Use of zzso stimuli allowed us to compare two types of trials where zzso of zzso was and was not required zzso and release trials, zzso zzso zzso was observed in the left zzso during control versus release zzso The zzso zzso was selective to zzso zzso required immediately after update of behavior, which exhibited marked contrast to the left anterior prefrontal zzso selective to zzso zzso required long after the zzso These results reveal zzso zzso mechanisms in these two regions that are recruited in the different zzso contexts of the zzso demands imposed during performance of the zzso
