zzso magnetic resonance zzso images taken after acoustic zzso surgery were analyzed to evaluate the pattern and timing of zzso contrast enhancement in 22 patients who underwent acoustic zzso removal via the zzso zzso zzso The opened internal auditory canal zzso was covered with a muscle piece in nine patients and with zzso glue in zzso A total of 56 MR imaging examinations were obtained between days 1 and zzso after zzso MR imaging showed linear enhancement at the zzso within the first 2 days after surgery, and revealed zzso enhancement on day 3 or later in patients with a muscle zzso MR imaging tended to show linear enhancement at the zzso irrespective of the timing of the examination in the patients with zzso zzso zzso MR imaging on day 3 or later showed the zzso of zzso enhancement in patients with muscle was significantly higher than in patients with zzso zzso The results illustrate the difficulty in zzso zzso enhancement on a muscle piece from tumor by a single zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso glue is generally advocated as a packing material of the zzso because it rarely shows zzso enhancement on zzso MR zzso When a muscle piece is used in patients at high risk for zzso zzso fluid zzso MR imaging should be obtained within the first 2 days after surgery, since benign enhancement of muscle will not occur and obscure the precise extent of tumor zzso
