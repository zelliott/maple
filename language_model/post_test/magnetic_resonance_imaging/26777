We investigated the effects of cervical disc zzso on zzso of adjacent zzso motion by evaluating 407 patients using kinetic zzso For each patient, zzso for zzso motion zzso angular variation zzso and disc height zzso were obtained at each segment from zzso through zzso The results show that the spinal levels above the disc zzso zzso on average, a zzso decrease in zzso motion per zzso of disc zzso zzso but no significant change in angular zzso Spinal levels below the zzso experienced a zzso decrease in angular motion per zzso of disc zzso zzso without significant change in zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant impact on disc height at adjacent levels, although disc zzso at the level of zzso correlated with decreased disc height above and increased disc height zzso This study indicates that although disc zzso zzso motion and angular variation are significantly affected at the level of a disc zzso no significant changes are apparent within the adjacent zzso zzso discs have no effect on the range of motion at adjacent levels regardless of the degree of disc zzso or the size of disc zzso The natural progression of disc zzso and adjacent segment disease within the cervical spine appear to be separate, unrelated zzso
