The aim of this study was to determine whether iron oxide particles targeted to zzso zzso image zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in zzso plaque progression and zzso Prior studies indicate that zzso zzso labeled with zzso zzso allow for in zzso detection of vulnerable plaques with magnetic resonance imaging zzso However, issues related to zzso of zzso might limit clinical zzso Iron zzso are recognized as safe and effective contrast agents for zzso Because the efficacy of passively targeted iron particles remains zzso it was hypothesized that iron particles targeted to zzso zzso might increase the utility of this zzso 

zzso zzso zzso iron particles zzso zzso zzso and zzso iron particles zzso zzso were zzso with zzso targeted to either zzso or oxidized zzso zzso All zzso were zzso and their in zzso efficacy evaluated in zzso E deficient mice 24 h after zzso administration of a zzso zzso dose with zzso In zzso imaging data were correlated with the presence of zzso zzso with zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso as zzso by signal loss, was observed after administration of targeted zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso and iron zzso Limited signal zzso was observed for zzso zzso Additionally, no significant zzso wall zzso was observed for targeted or zzso zzso zzso iron oxide zzso due to their limited ability to penetrate the vessel zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso targeted to zzso zzso image zzso zzso and suggests a clinically zzso platform for the detection of zzso zzso
