In the present randomized, zzso zzso zzso study, we examined the neural mechanisms underlying zzso control using a zzso paradigm in which zzso frequency was manipulated zzso across zzso As hypothesized, presenting stop signals less frequently was accompanied by a stronger set to respond to the go stimuli as subjects were faster in responding to go stimuli on no zzso trials and made more commission errors zzso were less successful in zzso the go zzso on zzso zzso When response zzso was successful, having to inhibit responses more frequently compared to less frequently was associated with greater zzso in zzso zzso This presumably reflects enhanced visual attention to the stop zzso When response zzso failed, greater activity was observed in bilateral zzso when stop signals were presented less compared to more zzso The zzso may thus play a role in processing the significance of zzso zzso
