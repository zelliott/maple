In order to further clarify the zzso and clinical significance of zzso white matter abnormalities in treated zzso zzso ten patients zzso type I zzso two type II and one type zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) in addition to conventional MR zzso imaging at zzso zzso Two patients with severe zzso abnormalities had repeat examinations during and after a 6- to zzso period of strict diet zzso The clinical evaluation included a detailed neurological zzso In nine out of ten patients visual evoked zzso zzso were obtained parallel to the MR zzso MR imaging demonstrated typical symmetrical areas of prolonged zzso relaxation time predominantly in the zzso zzso white matter in all but one of type I and II zzso There was no consistent relationship between zzso findings and time of zzso of therapy, zzso or visual evoked potential zzso zzso abnormalities tended to be more severe in patients with poor dietary control and high current plasma zzso levels, whereas a normal zzso was found only in patients with plasma zzso levels continuously below zzso zzso There was marked zzso of zzso abnormalities already after 3 months of strict diet zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso of zzso in the affected white matter, with a slow component of about zzso zzso indicating an increase in free zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed no signs of severe zzso zzso We zzso that the observed white matter changes in treated zzso probably represent zzso structural zzso changes rather than permanent zzso
