zzso dislocation is considered a severe injury but occurs rarely and studies generally refer to relatively small patient zzso We investigated the functional outcome in 22 cases to determine the long-term zzso Since associated foot injury is common, we compared the outcome for 12 cases of isolated zzso zzso with 10 cases of collateral fractures of the adjacent bones of the hind foot and zzso 19 cases of complex, partially open injuries after high energy trauma have got excluded because of the apparently poor long-term zzso The zzso zzso after mean follow up of zzso years indicated a significantly better outcome for isolated zzso Nearly 50 % of isolated zzso had a excellent outcome zzso zzso mean score zzso zzso with associated fractures had mainly good and fair results zzso zzso mean score zzso Analysis of the gait pattern by dynamic zzso pressure measurement demonstrated lower pressures in the isolated zzso group and higher pressures in the group with associated fractures in the lateral region of the zzso with shorter zzso of weight zzso
