zzso fatigue syndrome zzso is a disabling disorder, characterized by persistent or zzso zzso Recent studies have detected a decrease in cortical zzso matter volume in patients with zzso but it is unclear whether this cerebral zzso constitutes a cause or a consequence of the zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso is an effective zzso intervention for zzso which combines a zzso approach of a graded increase in physical activity with a psychological approach that addresses thoughts and beliefs about zzso which may impair zzso Here, we test the hypothesis that cerebral zzso may be a zzso state that can zzso with successful zzso We have zzso cerebral structural changes in 22 zzso patients that underwent zzso and 22 healthy control zzso At zzso zzso patients had significantly lower zzso matter volume than healthy control zzso zzso intervention led to a significant improvement in health status, physical activity and cognitive zzso zzso zzso patients showed a significant increase in zzso matter volume, localized in the lateral prefrontal zzso This change in cerebral volume was related to improvements in cognitive speed in the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the cerebral zzso associated with zzso is partially reversed after effective zzso This result provides an example of zzso cortical plasticity in the adult human brain, demonstrating a surprisingly dynamic relation between zzso state and cerebral zzso Furthermore, our results reveal a possible zzso zzso of zzso zzso
