zzso delivery of zzso cells to the injury zone is a prerequisite for any effect of zzso zzso zzso This key issue, however, has received far less attention than, for instance, a potential need for cell type selection or zzso expansion, the optimal timing of cell application or zzso functional evaluation after cellular zzso By combining zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso bone zzso zzso cells zzso we show in a zzso man with a large anterior zzso zzso that zzso applied cells (via the central zzso of an inflated zzso balloon positioned in the zzso implanted in primary zzso graft zzso to the zzso border zzso This is consistent with the idea that the area of zzso zzso injury zzso the zzso zone on zzso zzso or late enhancement zone on magnetic zzso remains largely zzso to zzso zzso thus other techniques need to be considered if the cell delivery is aimed at the zone of irreversible zzso The potency of such combined high-resolution zzso provides grounds for comparing the efficacy of different methods of cell delivery after a recent zzso zzso in zzso
