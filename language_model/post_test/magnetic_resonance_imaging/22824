zzso zzso sites, zzso zzso zzso zzso are sites of stress concentration at the region where zzso and ligaments attach to zzso zzso they are commonly subject to overuse injuries zzso that are well documented in a number of zzso In this review, we focus on the zzso correlations of zzso on both the hard and the soft tissue sides of the zzso zzso attention is paid to mechanical factors that influence form and function and thus to exploring the relationship between zzso and zzso The molecular parameters indicative of adaptation to mechanical stress are zzso and the basis on which zzso are classified is zzso The application of the zzso zzso concept (a collection of zzso adjacent to the zzso itself, which jointly serve the common function of stress zzso to understanding zzso is considered and novel roles of zzso tissue at zzso are zzso A distinction is made between different locations of fat at zzso and possible functions include zzso and zzso The basic zzso role of zzso is considered in detail and comparisons are explored between zzso and other biological zzso zzso The ability of zzso for zzso is emphasized and a range of zzso common in sport are reviewed zzso tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, zzso knee, zzso zzso and Achilles zzso zzso Attention is drawn to the zzso rather than zzso nature of most zzso in zzso The zzso factors contributing to the development of zzso are reviewed and the importance of considering the zzso unit as a whole is zzso zzso spur formation is assessed in relation to other changes at zzso which parallel those in zzso zzso zzso
