zzso is a visual disorder caused by an anomalous early visual zzso It has been suggested that suppression of the visual input from the weaker eye might be a primary underlying mechanism of the zzso zzso However, it is still an unresolved question to what extent neural responses to the visual information coming from the zzso eye are suppressed during zzso zzso To address this question we measured zzso zzso zzso to zzso face stimuli in zzso patients, both in zzso and zzso viewing zzso The results revealed no difference in the zzso and zzso of early components of the zzso responses between the zzso and fellow eye zzso On the other hand, early zzso components were reduced and delayed in the case of zzso stimulation of the zzso eye as compared to the fellow eye stimulation or to zzso zzso The magnitude of the zzso effect measured on the zzso zzso was comparable to that found on the zzso responses in the zzso face area using the same face stimuli and task zzso Our findings showing that the zzso effects present on the early zzso components in the case of zzso stimulation are not zzso in the zzso responses during zzso viewing suggest that input from the zzso eye is completely suppressed already at the earliest stages of visual cortical processing when stimuli are viewed by both zzso
