Working memory zzso is a fundamental cognitive process that serves as a building block for higher order cognitive zzso While studies have shown that children and adolescents zzso similar brain regions during verbal zzso there have been few studies that evaluate the zzso differences in brain zzso Our goal was to study the development of brain connectivity related to verbal zzso in typically developing children and zzso Thirty-five healthy children and zzso divided into three groups: 9-12 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 17-19 zzso zzso years, were included in this functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The verbal zzso task involved a modified zzso item recognition paradigm using three different zzso Brain connectivity analysis was performed using independent component analyses and zzso the components with the design zzso to determine zzso zzso zzso analyses resulted in four components associated solely with zzso four solely with recognition and two with zzso Two networks demonstrated age-related differences with respect to load, zzso the left motor area and right zzso and 2) the left prefrontal cortex, left zzso zzso and right zzso Post hoc analyses revealed that the first network showed significant effects of age between children and the two older zzso There was increasing connectivity with increasing load for zzso The second network demonstrated age-related differences between children and older zzso Children have higher zzso connectivity at lower zzso but they tend to zzso with the adolescents with higher zzso Finally, a zzso related network involving the zzso frontal and anterior zzso zzso showed less connectivity in zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso zzso 2012 zzso zzso zzso
