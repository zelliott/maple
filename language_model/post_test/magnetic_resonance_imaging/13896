zzso has been used increasingly in the recent past for the guidance and monitoring of minimally invasive zzso procedures, using typically zzso zzso and laser energy, zzso and zzso zzso zzso energy has been used over the last 30 years for the zzso of zzso Its use in conjunction with zzso for monitoring is zzso however, because of the electronic noise produced by the zzso zzso which can significantly deteriorate image zzso The objective of this work was to devise methods by which this noise can be reduced to an acceptable level to allow simultaneous acquisition of MR images for monitoring purposes with the application of zzso zzso Three different methods of noise reduction were investigated in a zzso T MR zzso zzso using external hardware circuitry, MR scanner zzso zzso and zzso The last two methods were unable by themselves to suppress the noise to an acceptable zzso Hardware zzso however, provides excellent suppression of zzso noise and is able to withstand up to 12 W of zzso zzso When all the three approaches are combined, significant reduction of zzso noise is zzso The feasibility of creating an zzso zzso of about zzso zzso diameter in zzso in a zzso model simultaneously with zzso zzso with adequate noise suppression is zzso
