A novel zzso pulse designed to perform a zzso zzso zzso for surface coils zzso is proposed in which zzso zzso is modulated in concert with zzso frequency zzso Within the selected zzso the principles of zzso zzso are employed to obtain zzso zzso and zzso spin rotation of arbitrary flip angles despite the presence of high B1 zzso produced by surface zzso Outside the zzso advantage is taken of the B1 field to zzso equilibrium zzso to achieve slice selection or zzso zzso This scheme should be useful for many zzso zzso zzso analysis of the overall zzso of the proposed pulse and zzso simulations using Bloch equations are zzso The pulse is tested zzso on a phantom zzso
