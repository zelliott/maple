We studied the zzso angle and spatial relationships of zzso zzso lobe zzso structures, using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as landmarks, and measured zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso at zzso level in 41 normal, aged zzso Mean zzso angle was 29 degrees zzso zzso degrees ) zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The slice at the zzso parallel to the long axis of the zzso best revealed a zzso view of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of participants, compared to only zzso when slices were 20 degrees zzso to zzso line zzso an accepted technique used to examine zzso zzso in previous CT zzso The zzso zzso measured midway and at its thinnest between the zzso borders of the zzso was highly zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso using these new zzso These simple decision rules, individualized orientation along the zzso and using a standardized landmark like the zzso make these measures more comparable across subjects, and hence more useful in detecting and monitoring zzso zzso in zzso
