This paper studied PET intrinsic spatial resolution and contrast recovery improvement for zzso dual zzso zzso A zzso Carlo simulation tool was developed to study zzso diffusion in zzso with and without a magnetic field for six commonly used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso process was implemented to investigate PET intrinsic spatial resolution, taking into account three factors: zzso diffusion range, zzso zzso zzso and finite detector element zzso The resolution improvement was studied zzso as a function of magnetic field strength for three PET system zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When the magnetic field strength increases up to 10 zzso the system spatial resolution in directions zzso to the field for zzso zzso and zzso is comparable to that of zzso without the magnetic zzso Beyond 10 zzso no significant improvement of spatial resolution was zzso In addition, the zzso transfer function was studied to predict the intrinsic contrast recovery improvement for several existing and promising zzso zzso
