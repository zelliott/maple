The occurrence of fetal zzso zzso before labor has been repeatedly zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso appearance of fetal zzso zzso in relation to its zzso zzso zzso factors were also zzso 

Five consecutive cases of fetal zzso zzso were identified at a single ultrasound unit between 1996 and zzso In zzso magnetic resonance imaging was also performed in four of these zzso zzso was performed after pregnancy termination or zzso fetal death (one case of each), and neurological follow-up was initiated in the three surviving zzso 

zzso was the zzso zzso finding associated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso provided the correct diagnosis in the former zzso zzso whereas magnetic resonance imaging was necessary in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was depicted as an irregular zzso mass, whereas zzso zzso had a zzso zzso History of minor maternal physical trauma without maternal or zzso injury was zzso in all zzso zzso examinations performed before or shortly after the trauma were available in all cases and showed normal fetal zzso 

The zzso appearance of fetal zzso zzso is zzso depending on its zzso Even though zzso detected an zzso anomaly in all cases, magnetic resonance imaging was necessary to establish the zzso nature of isolated zzso and zzso zzso The similarity of histories involving minor maternal physical trauma in all cases, together with the absence of any known factor zzso to fetal zzso may suggest that trauma is at least a contributing factor to the zzso of fetal zzso zzso
