We studied 6 patients with idiopathic zzso zzso zzso after a mean follow-up period of 12 zzso No evidence of multiple sclerosis zzso was found on clinical zzso nor by magnetic resonance imaging zzso or evoked zzso zzso of spontaneous zzso serum zzso zzso and zzso zzso locus II zzso were similar in ON and in 6 patients with progressive zzso but different in healthy zzso This suggests that similar zzso conditions in zzso prevail after an idiopathic ON and in zzso A normal zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso proliferation but a low zzso zzso and zzso locus II zzso expression were zzso This suggests that an ON and zzso zzso is expressed after an zzso zzso zzso but before zzso zzso Our findings also suggest that zzso factors do not explain the zzso confinement of the zzso in ON but the protective influence may rather be exerted by some as yet undefined genetic influence or may be explained by the different zzso of ON and zzso
