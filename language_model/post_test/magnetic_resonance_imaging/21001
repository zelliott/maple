zzso is a troublesome symptom of zzso Despite growing evidence suggesting that zzso in zzso may be associated with cognitive dysfunction, the relationship between regional brain zzso and zzso has been poorly zzso 

zzso zzso was applied to zzso brain MR images of 24 patients with zzso and 12 zzso Patients were classified as either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso based on their responses to a validated zzso zzso and clinical zzso All patients with zzso also underwent a detailed zzso zzso 

The zzso analysis in patients with zzso showed a reduced zzso volume in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with both patients with zzso and zzso We did not detect any significant change of zzso volume when comparing HC versus all patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso clinical severity was significantly correlated with zzso loss in zzso cortical zzso Finally, patients with zzso scored lower on tests of frontal lobe zzso 

Our findings provide the first evidence that the development of zzso in patients with zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso which may play a role in the complex zzso of this disabling zzso
