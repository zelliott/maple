A new method is presented for rapid and accurate large zzso zzso zzso field zzso zzso zzso This method is a modification of the zzso method zzso which zzso imaging speed and applies zzso acquisition to improve zzso zzso measurement zzso It reduces repetition time and scan time by introducing a zzso zzso pulse chain at the end of each zzso repetition zzso The zzso pulse chain ensures that, after each zzso period, the zzso zzso reach the same state for both zzso at two flip angles for the zzso so that the long zzso requirement zzso zzso 5 zzso for complete relaxation of zzso zzso of zzso becomes zzso A zzso imaging sequence is additionally incorporated to further improve the efficiency of data zzso zzso demonstrate an excellent flip angle measurement accuracy for zzso zzso even with zzso zzso zzso Phantom and in zzso volunteer studies are presented to demonstrate the zzso effect upon zzso mapping and the application of zzso zzso zzso for rapid and accurate large volume zzso field zzso
