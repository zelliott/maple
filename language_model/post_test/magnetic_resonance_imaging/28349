The authors describe a method to differentiate healthy from zzso zzso by the analysis of their behavior after zzso contrast administration on magnetic resonance zzso 

A dynamic zzso zzso recalled echo magnetic resonance imaging after contrast administration was performed on 67 patients zzso healthy zzso and 31 zzso zzso Three zzso images zzso zzso and zzso were reconstructed from the zzso dynamic zzso Liver values were zzso by means of a zzso zzso 

Relative zzso and zzso values were significantly different ( P zzso zzso between zzso and normal zzso There was a significant correlation between the zzso values and the zzso index of zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso images allow characterization of the zzso zzso variations in dynamic magnetic resonance zzso The zzso and zzso values can be used to differentiate healthy from zzso zzso with zzso The higher values found in zzso patients may reflect an overall increase in the amount of zzso contrast present with respect to healthy zzso The degree of liver brightness in zzso patients probably is related to an increased amount of zzso space, an indirect measurement of zzso zzso
