The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso has been associated with zzso spectrum disorders zzso A smaller zzso volume has been reported in healthy male zzso carriers than in male zzso zzso and in patients with zzso than in healthy zzso These findings prompt the hypothesis that male AA zzso may have weaker zzso functional connectivity when compared to male zzso zzso We calculated local functional connectivity density zzso using a zzso zzso approach based on zzso functional zzso data in zzso young healthy zzso Both the main effect of zzso and the zzso interaction were zzso Of the whole brain, only the local zzso of the zzso exhibited the main effect of zzso zzso testing revealed significantly lower local zzso in male AA zzso compared to male zzso carriers although there was only a trend of significance in the zzso zzso We further analyzed the zzso functional connectivity zzso of the zzso region that demonstrating significant zzso differences in local zzso We found a significant zzso interaction in zzso between the zzso region and the left zzso prefrontal cortex, but no significant main effect of zzso was zzso zzso testing revealed that this zzso was significantly weaker in male AA zzso compared to male zzso zzso Our findings identify zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso gene variation zzso the functional connectivity of the zzso in healthy individuals and suggest that these mechanisms are important for understanding zzso
