zzso the zzso zzso zzso is challenging due to lateral border discrimination from the zzso zzso From a sample of 39 zzso older adults who completed zzso image scans and verbal memory zzso we examined reliability and zzso concerns for three zzso protocols with different lateral boundary guidelines zzso zzso Dickerson, zzso & zzso 2001; zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso We used three novice zzso to assess zzso reliability on a subset of scans zzso total zzso with the entire zzso measured by one zzso with strong zzso reliability on each technique zzso total zzso We found moderate to strong zzso reliability for two techniques with consistent zzso lateral boundary zzso zzso zzso with negligible to moderate reliability for the technique requiring consideration of collateral zzso depth zzso Left zzso and story memory associations were moderate and positive for two techniques designed to exclude the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso technique continuing to explain zzso of memory score zzso after additionally controlling for depression symptom zzso Right zzso memory associations were nonexistent after excluding an zzso Researchers are encouraged to consider challenges of zzso training for zzso techniques and how lateral boundary zzso may impact zzso zzso
