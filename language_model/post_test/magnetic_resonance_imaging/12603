Grey matter zzso maturation has not been previously studied in healthy zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the age dependency of zzso development in 116 zzso areas in zzso zzso Sixty one zzso infants zzso age: zzso months, zzso age: zzso weeks) with normal structural appearance on zzso were included in the zzso Using a zzso high resolution zzso zzso zzso echo zzso volumes of 116 zzso areas were calculated after their zzso using the zzso Based zzso zzso and the Individual Brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso software zzso zzso linear zzso analysis assessed age dependency of volume data for every zzso area using the zzso function zzso All zzso zzso areas followed the zzso function model reasonably zzso zzso structures had a poor goodness of zzso Volume increase of the individual zzso areas followed an inferior to superior and a zzso to anterior zzso The zzso thalamus, and zzso nucleus reached zzso of the final volume earlier than most cortical zzso zzso The visual zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso matured earlier than the zzso frontal and zzso zzso The zzso asymmetry or zzso seen in adults was observed in the zzso zzso the left zzso areas reached maturation earlier than the right, while the right prefrontal and frontal areas matured earlier than the zzso To zzso zzso development zzso in a zzso manner coinciding with functional, zzso and regional white matter zzso zzso
