zzso magnetic resonance images zzso from 20 patients who had zzso persistent or zzso low back pain were reviewed to study the zzso zzso diameter at zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso diameter was measured in three sites: the maximum zzso diameter at the zzso site, and the zzso and zzso levels to the zzso zzso A comparison between the zzso zzso zzso diameter at zzso sites and the average diameter of both the zzso and zzso levels was then zzso Based on the zzso the diameters of the zzso zzso were divided into three zzso Patients in group A (5 zzso had a zzso (the zzso zzso zzso diameter at the zzso site was less than the average diameter of both the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Patients in group B (12 zzso had an expansion (the zzso zzso zzso diameter at the zzso site was more than the average diameter of both the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Patients in group C (3 zzso demonstrated no zzso This study suggests that there was no correlation between the zzso zzso zzso diameter at zzso site and zzso low back zzso
