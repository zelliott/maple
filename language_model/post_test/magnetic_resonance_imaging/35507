To assess the efficacy of a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence in improving contrast on zzso high-resolution carotid plaque imaging by implementing zzso contrast zzso 

We used a standard zzso double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence modified with the addition of an extra zzso (90 degrees ) radio frequency zzso pulse placed immediately after the zzso zzso zzso the repetition time to a fixed value of 400 zzso A total of 10 patients with zzso disease were included in the zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso were performed on each patient for the standard and the modified zzso 

zzso zzso contrast was zzso zzso zzso with the standard zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the modified zzso sequence zzso showing a significant contrast enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso without significant image quality zzso 

The addition of a zzso pulse to the standard zzso zzso zzso sequence increased zzso contrast without increasing sequence acquisition zzso Furthermore, it appeared to be a robust technique, easy to implement on clinical zzso
