Early and delayed zzso zzso studies were performed on 13 patients with zzso zzso which were classified in three groups according to their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transitional and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso types zzso zzso zzso The early zzso zzso zzso ratios of average zzso in the zzso to those of the zzso area on early zzso were relatively high in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transitional and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no statistical differences in relation to zzso zzso The delayed zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the delayed zzso of zzso zzso were lower than those of zzso types zzso zzso zzso The retention zzso zzso ratios of delayed to early zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso type were also statistically lower than those of the other two groups zzso zzso zzso There were no statistically significant differences between transitional plus zzso types and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso exhibits early high zzso in all types of zzso but its retention rates probably differ according to zzso types, and a high retention index is zzso of the zzso potential in a zzso
