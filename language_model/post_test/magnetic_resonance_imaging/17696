The aim of this study was to investigate the relevance of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso of migraine by assessing the abnormal volume and zzso networks of the zzso in migraine patients without aura zzso The volume of the zzso in the zzso was compared between 40 zzso and 40 zzso and zzso healthy zzso The zzso functional connectivity of zzso zzso with abnormal volume was also zzso zzso volume in the left zzso and the right nucleus zzso zzso was detected in the migraine group compared with healthy zzso meanwhile, increased functional connectivity between the zzso and several brain regions within zzso and zzso processing pathways was zzso zzso analysis revealed significant correlations between the volume of the bilateral zzso and right zzso and disease zzso In addition, an increased monthly frequency of migraine attack was associated with increased functional connectivity between the bilateral zzso and left zzso and longer disease duration was correlated with increased functional connectivity between the right zzso and bilateral anterior zzso zzso Our results revealed abnormal volume of zzso and dysfunctional dynamics during zzso resting state within pain pathways of the zzso in zzso which validated the association between the zzso and zzso 

Our findings revealed the presence of reduced volume in zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso dysfunctional dynamics within zzso networks in zzso The abnormal structure and function within the zzso pathways of the zzso were possibly associated with impaired pain processing and zzso processes in zzso
