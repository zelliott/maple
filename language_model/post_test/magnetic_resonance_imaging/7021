zzso made in response to sensory cues require the brain to transform sensory information into an appropriate motor zzso zzso zzso used in daily life range from direct or zzso to highly zzso In zzso zzso tasks, the visual stimulus guiding an action is often not the target of the zzso A common example of such a zzso mapping is the use of a computer mouse on a horizontal surface to guide an object visible on a vertical zzso The present study used zzso zzso zzso to examine how patterns of brain activity vary as zzso zzso become progressively more zzso We observed significantly different patterns of cortical activity depending on the level of zzso between a sensory input and a required motor zzso Our results suggest the presence of a functional network generally involved in performing the type of zzso zzso tasks zzso This putative network includes regions of the primary motor cortex, zzso motor areas, the superior zzso zzso zzso and the lateral zzso zzso The extent of activity in active areas varied depending on the characteristics of the particular zzso mapping used in performing a zzso Furthermore, in addition to this putative network, specific zzso areas of activity were zzso
