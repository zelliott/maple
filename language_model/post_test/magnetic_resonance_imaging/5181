To assess the zzso size of the cochlear nerve zzso and facial nerve zzso in zzso ears and to determine whether nerve size varies with zzso 

zzso 

We included 169 ears with normal hearing between 2005 and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso area zzso of the zzso and zzso in the middle of the internal auditory canal were measured on zzso zzso images of zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso were compared by zzso Young subjects were divided into three age groups, zzso zzso and 11-15 zzso zzso over age 40 years were divided into groups at 10-year zzso 

Mean age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso had significantly greater vertical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and horizontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diameters than the zzso The zzso of the zzso was larger than that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Except for the zzso vertical diameter, there were no significant differences between right and left zzso Sex did not affect the nerve zzso Although the zzso was not affected by age, the zzso vertical diameter and zzso of children zzso years were significantly smaller than those of children aged zzso zzso The size of the two nerves did not differ among groups over age 40 zzso 

The zzso is not affected by age in zzso zzso The zzso vertical diameter and zzso of children zzso years are smaller than those of older zzso
