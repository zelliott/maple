Early zzso studies often failed to obtain evidence of zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso during episodic zzso or zzso but a growing number of studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have provided such zzso We review data from zzso studies that zzso on the conclusion that zzso zzso is associated with episodic zzso too few zzso studies of retrieval have reported zzso zzso to allow firm conclusions about their exact zzso We then turn to a recent zzso of PET studies zzso et zzso zzso zzso that appears to contradict the zzso zzso zzso Based on their analysis of the zzso distribution of zzso reported during episodic zzso or zzso zzso et zzso zzso concluded that anterior zzso is strongly associated with episodic zzso whereas zzso zzso is strongly associated with episodic zzso After considering the evidence reviewed by zzso et zzso zzso along with additional studies, we conclude that PET studies of zzso reveal both anterior and zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that the contradiction between zzso and PET studies of zzso was more apparent than zzso However, PET studies have reported anterior zzso zzso zzso more frequently than have zzso zzso We consider possible sources of these zzso
