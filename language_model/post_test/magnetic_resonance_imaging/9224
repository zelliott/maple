The California sea zzso zzso zzso has been a focal point for zzso communication, zzso and neurological disease studies in marine zzso However, as a scientific community, we lack a zzso approach to investigate the anatomy and size of brain structures in this species and other zzso live marine zzso In this article, we provide the first zzso labeled, magnetic resonance zzso zzso derived from a live marine zzso the California sea zzso The brain of the California seal zzso contained more secondary zzso and zzso than the brains of zzso zzso The zzso bulb was present but zzso The zzso of the California sea zzso was found mostly in the zzso position with very little extension zzso quite unlike the zzso and the zzso in which the zzso is present in the zzso position but extends zzso above the zzso In contrast to the zzso and the zzso the zzso zzso of the California sea zzso was zzso zzso In addition, we report three-dimensional reconstructions and volumes of zzso fluid, cerebral zzso total white matter zzso total gray matter zzso cerebral zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso combined zzso and zzso and zzso structures all derived from magnetic resonance zzso These zzso are the first to be determined for any zzso zzso In California sea zzso this approach can be used not only to relate cognitive and sensory capabilities to brain size but also to investigate the neurological effects of exposure to zzso such as zzso zzso
