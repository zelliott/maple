To test the hypothesis that zzso of circulating zzso into the brain decreases with age, because zzso in metabolism of zzso may be a factor contributing to age-related degenerative changes in the zzso 

zzso comparison in younger and older zzso 

zzso were chosen zzso from lists of healthy volunteers screened by medical and psychiatric interviews and laboratory zzso Younger adults zzso zzso zzso were between the ages of 20 and 40 years zzso age, 32 zzso and older adults zzso zzso zzso were between the ages of 60 and 85 years zzso age, 73 zzso 

After zzso overnight, subjects received zzso as the zzso to yield free zzso equal to 50 zzso of body zzso Blood was drawn for determination of plasma zzso concentration by zzso liquid zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso was performed to determine the relative concentration of zzso zzso compounds in the brain at baseline and after zzso of zzso 

Plasma zzso and zzso zzso compounds in the brain, estimated as the ratio of the zzso resonance to the zzso resonance on zzso scans of the zzso zzso were compared following blinded analyses of data from subject zzso studied at baseline and 3 hours after zzso zzso 

zzso of plasma zzso and zzso zzso compounds in brain were similar at baseline in younger and older zzso Following zzso of zzso plasma zzso concentration increased by similar proportions zzso and zzso in both younger and older zzso Brain zzso zzso compounds increased substantially in younger subjects zzso increase, zzso P zzso zzso vs zzso Older subjects showed a much smaller increase in brain zzso compounds zzso zzso P zzso zzso vs the increase in younger zzso 

zzso of circulating zzso into the brain decreases with zzso Given the key role of zzso in zzso structure and function, this change may be a contributing factor in onset in late life of zzso particularly zzso illnesses in which zzso zzso show particular zzso to zzso
