zzso are a class of stable free zzso that have several biomedical applications including zzso and zzso assessment of tissue zzso zzso For both of these applications, it is necessary to understand the in zzso zzso and reduction of zzso In this study, magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare tissue zzso zzso and reduction of two commonly studied zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso was reduced 3 to 11 times slower zzso on the zzso than zzso in zzso and that maximum tissue concentration varies substantially between zzso zzso For a given zzso the maximum concentration usually did not vary between the two zzso Furthermore, using electron zzso resonance zzso we showed that the zzso reduction rate depends only zzso on cellular zzso in the oxygen range expected in zzso These zzso taken with the marked variation in zzso reduction rates observed between zzso suggest that tissue zzso is not a major zzso of the zzso reduction rate in zzso For the purpose of zzso imaging, zzso was shown to be an optimal choice based on the achievable zzso and zzso observed in zzso
