The lateral zzso approach for safely and completely removing zzso groove zzso was zzso 

Between September 1997 and June 2008, a total of 656 zzso were operated on by the senior author zzso at the Department of zzso Helsinki University Central zzso 66 were zzso zzso We zzso analyze the clinical data, zzso findings, surgical treatment, zzso and outcome of all the zzso groove zzso patients and discuss the operative techniques zzso 

zzso patients were operated on by the lateral zzso zzso The median zzso zzso Performance zzso score was 80 zzso zzso Three patients were redo cases in which the primary operation had been performed zzso Seemingly complete tumor removal was achieved in 60 patients zzso there was no surgical zzso zzso 6 patients zzso had zzso fluid zzso 5 zzso had new visual deficits, 4 zzso had wound infections, 4 zzso had cotton zzso and 1 zzso had a zzso zzso The median zzso score at discharge was 80 zzso zzso Six patients had zzso zzso 3 underwent zzso after an average of 21 months zzso zzso zzso 1 was treated with zzso and 2 were only zzso During the median follow-up time of 45 months zzso zzso zzso there were 4 zzso zzso diagnosed on average 32 months zzso zzso zzso after zzso 

The lateral zzso approach can be used safely for zzso groove zzso of all sizes with no mortality and relatively low zzso zzso results and tumor recurrence with this fast and simple approach are similar to those obtained with more extensive, complex, and time-consuming zzso
