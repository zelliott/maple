To characterize the brain pathology in relation to long-term outcome after pediatric head injury, 55 children were studied by magnetic resonance imaging zzso at least 3 months after sustaining moderate to severe closed head injury zzso Thirty-nine of the patients had abnormal signal intensity consistent with residual brain zzso including 28 children with zzso involving the frontal zzso The clinical features of children with frontal zzso zzso zzso and diffuse injury were zzso The analysis disclosed that children with frontal lobe zzso were more frequently disabled than children who sustained diffuse zzso Our zzso findings indicate that residual brain zzso are more common after moderate to severe zzso in children than previously thought and that the frontal zzso are most frequently zzso Further investigation is indicated to zzso whether distinctive cognitive and behavioral zzso are associated with frontal lobe zzso in zzso
