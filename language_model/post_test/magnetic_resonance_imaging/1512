zzso nerve stimulation limits the use of zzso zzso systems capable of slew rates zzso 80 zzso and zzso strengths zzso 25 zzso The stimulation threshold depends mainly on the zzso of the induced electric field in the patient's body, and thus can be influenced by changing the total magnetic flux of the zzso zzso A zzso system was built which allows continuous variation of the field characteristics in order to permit the use of full zzso performance without stimulation zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The system consists of a modular zzso zzso zzso designed with a modified target field method, two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso It is demonstrated that two coils on one zzso axis can be driven by two amplifiers in zzso without significant changes in image zzso Scaling of the field properties and stimulation threshold according to the current polarity and ratio of both zzso sets was verified in both phantom and volunteer zzso
