To report the findings of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in two cases of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

The authors describe the zzso findings for two males who presented with pain of sudden onset in the zzso Both patients were examined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and one underwent bone zzso 

On zzso images, signal intensity was decreased in both the zzso and the body adjacent to it; however, the signal intensity on zzso images was zzso These findings are consistent with zzso fracture of the zzso 

The zzso findings in these cases may support the previously suggested hypothesis that zzso zzso with characteristic zzso changes over time is caused by zzso fracture of the zzso zzso The relation between the characteristic zzso features and the structural changes associated with fracture in this condition is zzso
