The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a new needle zzso method zzso instead of zzso in reducing attendant tissue zzso This can be useful in applications where tissue motion due to needle zzso is problematic such as zzso zzso prostate zzso and breast zzso In this study we will focus on prostate motion due to needle zzso 

zzso motion due to needle zzso was measured in 30 patients, who were zzso implanted with zzso gold markers for position zzso in prostate intensity modulated zzso In total 32 needles were manually pushed into the prostate and 29 were tapped with a zzso robotic zzso The prostate motion in the zzso direction was measured on the video record of the ultrasound zzso zzso in prostate motion between the two needle zzso methods were zzso making use of zzso 

The mean prostate motion was zzso zzso zzso when the needle was pushed and zzso zzso zzso zzso when the needle was tapped into the prostate zzso 

zzso motion was significantly less when the needle was tapped into the prostate compared to when the needle was zzso This result is important for the development of a zzso zzso prostate implant robotic zzso
