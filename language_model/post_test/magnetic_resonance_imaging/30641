We compared neural zzso of two-dimensional shape processing in human and nonhuman primates using functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging in awake zzso The comparison of MR activity evoked by viewing intact and scrambled images of objects revealed zzso regions in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both humans and zzso zzso zzso in monkeys was relatively more two-dimensional shape sensitive than that of zzso In both species, there was an interaction between scrambling and type of stimuli zzso images and zzso but the effect of stimulus type was much stronger in monkeys than in zzso zzso and zzso regions overlapped to some zzso However, this overlap was much more marked in humans than in zzso The zzso regions can be used to zzso the zzso of monkey to human zzso and suggest a large expansion of lateral zzso and superior zzso zzso in humans compared with zzso
