zzso ultrasound has become the best available method for local staging of primary zzso cancer and diagnosing zzso local zzso The aim of this study is to compare the value of zzso ultrasound zzso to magnetic resonance imaging with an zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients (11 women, 10 men, mean age 63 years, range zzso with primary zzso cancer zzso zzso 6) or follow-up examinations for zzso local disease zzso zzso zzso were investigated by zzso using an echo zzso zzso 20, zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso MR system zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso images were zzso The results of zzso examinations were compared to zzso findings regarding the T staging, with special focus on the zzso tumor zzso 

zzso identified all tumors, whereas one tumor was missed by zzso zzso was superior to zzso in T staging zzso zzso due to the better differentiation between zzso and zzso tumors, as the zzso zzso could not differentiate between stage zzso and stage zzso The accuracy of zzso in assessing zzso zzso was zzso compared to zzso with zzso Local tumor recurrence was found in six of 15 patients, without zzso signs of zzso disease in four of zzso All were detected by zzso Only one recurrence was missed by zzso zzso and positive and negative zzso values in follow-up examinations for zzso disease for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso and for both the zzso and zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso they were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso ultrasound and zzso zzso zzso are comparable methods in the zzso staging and early diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso The advantages of zzso are the small diameter of the zzso zzso and lower zzso In contrast, zzso is zzso and may become important for combined local and distant staging and follow-up examination in zzso cancer, if zzso imaging can improve the sensitivity for liver zzso
