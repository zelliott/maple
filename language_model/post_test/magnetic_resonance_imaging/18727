Previous studies have shown that selection for zzso report is often limited to one object at a time, with elements being selected together if they belong to part of the same zzso zzso Here we used the zzso phenomenon of extinction in human patients with zzso zzso to show that selection is influenced also by action relations between zzso Performance was better for objects that were positioned zzso so that they could be used together, relative to objects that were positioned inappropriately for their combined zzso The action relation was critical, as performance for pictures did not improve if the items were only verbally zzso We found the opposite result with zzso zzso of action relations emerged even on trials where only one object could be reported, showing implicit coding of zzso units for zzso The effects of verbal associations may instead reflect zzso between zzso zzso
