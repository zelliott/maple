We investigated the relationship between zzso zzso volume and treatment response to the zzso antipsychotic medication zzso in zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso volumes included the bilateral zzso zzso and zzso and were measured using the zzso automated zzso pipeline in 23 zzso Also, baseline symptom severity, duration of illness, age, zzso time off medication, and exposure to previous antipsychotic were zzso Treatment response was significantly correlated with all three regions of the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso baseline symptom severity, duration of illness, and age but not zzso time off antipsychotic medication, or exposure to previous antipsychotic zzso The zzso volume was the zzso zzso region that demonstrated the strongest correlation with treatment response and was significantly zzso correlated with patient zzso zzso volume was not significantly correlated with any other zzso We demonstrated a novel finding that the zzso volume explains a significant amount of the zzso in treatment response over the course of 6 weeks of zzso zzso even when controlling for baseline symptom severity and duration of zzso
