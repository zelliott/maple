This study was conducted to compare the zzso of zzso anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso with normal controls using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Case control zzso 

zzso zzso from 30 patients with a reconstructed zzso graft and from 30 individuals with an intact zzso were zzso zzso patients were operated on with a zzso technique using a zzso zzso zzso These selected patients had a normal or nearly normal zzso score with a 3 zzso or less anterior zzso translation on zzso zzso testing compared with the intact zzso zzso showed a continuous and homogeneous graft without evidence of roof zzso zzso of the grafted zzso was determined on each lateral zzso by measuring the intersection of the graft line with the zzso plateau zzso These figures were compared with data similarly obtained from 30 individuals with a stable knee and an intact zzso determined by history and physical zzso 

zzso zzso in reconstructed patients averaged 67 degrees with a range between 55 degrees and 81 zzso In normal controls, intact zzso zzso averaged 51 degrees with a range between 45 degrees and 55 zzso The difference between the two groups was statistically significant zzso zzso 

zzso of patients with an appropriate zzso tunnel placement in order to avoid notch zzso showed a continuous and homogeneous graft similar to the native zzso but with a more vertical graft that does not recreate the normal zzso zzso However, according to zzso testing, these more vertical zzso can control anterior zzso knee zzso
