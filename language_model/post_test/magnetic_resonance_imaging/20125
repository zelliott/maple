In the auditory zzso music and speech have high informational and emotional value for human zzso However, the degree of the functional specialization of the cortical and zzso areas in zzso music and speech sounds is not yet zzso We investigated the functional specialization of the human auditory system in processing music and speech by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso During recordings, the subjects were presented with saxophone sounds and zzso zzso with comparable zzso zzso Our data show that areas zzso music and speech sounds differ in the zzso and frontal zzso Moreover, slight variations in sound pitch and duration activated zzso structures zzso However, this was the case with speech sounds only while no such effect was evidenced with music zzso Thus, our data reveal the existence of a functional specialization of the human brain in accurately representing sound information at both cortical and zzso zzso They indicate that not only the sound category zzso but also the sound zzso zzso can be selectively zzso
