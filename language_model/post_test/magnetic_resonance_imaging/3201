zzso zzso can demonstrate decreases of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of brain tissue water shortly after the onset of zzso To further zzso underlying mechanisms, this study extended diffusion assessment to zzso zzso in rat brain in zzso before, zzso and after zzso 

Changes in molecular mobility were studied in a rat model of global zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, 20-minute zzso zzso zzso with the use of zzso localized zzso MR zzso During zzso and early zzso the time course of zzso changes was monitored by strongly zzso zzso zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated from series of differently zzso zzso before zzso 90 minutes after zzso and 60 minutes zzso 

Parallel to a rise in zzso water signal zzso zzso zzso pertinent zzso of all brain zzso increased during zzso Changes were most pronounced for zzso zzso zzso zzso and smallest for zzso (12 zzso zzso During zzso water zzso values returned to zzso values, whereas zzso zzso values were decreased by zzso (after 40 zzso zzso zzso values (after 60 minutes) were reduced by zzso for water and 38% for zzso 

The present findings indicate that water zzso changes during zzso stroke are accompanied by significant zzso in zzso mobility in both zzso and zzso cell populations as reflected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values during zzso are consistent with irreversible tissue damage in this model and offer new means to assess circulatory and zzso zzso
