The surgical management of soft tissue zzso zzso in elderly patients has only been addressed in a few zzso The objective of the current study was to assess surgical outcomes in patients with zzso aged 70 years and older and the association of older age with the survival after complete zzso 

A retrospective analysis was conducted in 158 elderly patients with localized zzso who visited 11 institutions participating in Japanese zzso Oncology Group between 1995 and 2006 and were treated by surgical zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed to identify zzso zzso 

Median follow-up period was 38 zzso zzso high-grade tumors were detected in zzso of the zzso Wide zzso with adequate margins was performed in zzso of the zzso zzso chemotherapy was performed in only 5 zzso zzso analysis identified zzso grade and gender as statistically significant zzso factors for zzso zzso zzso analysis did not identify significant zzso factors for zzso survival, although high grade zzso emerged as a potentially significant zzso factor zzso zzso zzso Local recurrence was detected in zzso of the zzso zzso analysis of local recurrence-free survival showed that tumor site and surgical margins were statistically significant zzso zzso 

Older age was not identified as a zzso factor for zzso survival, which is not consistent with the findings of previous studies showing that older age was associated with decreased zzso zzso Complete zzso should be indicated and can lead to optimal treatment outcome for properly selected elderly zzso
