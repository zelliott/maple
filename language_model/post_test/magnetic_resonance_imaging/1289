The zzso fat suppression zzso pulse zzso which is a phase sensitive zzso of the Dixon fat suppression method and the spin echo zzso pulse zzso was used in the evaluation of zzso structures of the normal knee using 48 sets of imaging sequences in six volunteers using a repetition zzso time combination of zzso 60 zzso A demonstration of the zzso technique in 10 patients with suspected knee pathology is also zzso A zzso grading scale was established to rate zzso zzso and used to compare zzso and zzso pulse sequence zzso The results in normal subjects demonstrate that zzso cartilage is significantly better zzso by fat suppression pulse sequence than by conventional zzso pulse sequence in the zzso and zzso planes of imaging zzso less than zzso The preliminary results from patients studies suggest that zzso imaging may be useful in the evaluation of zzso tears, in the differentiation of zzso cartilage from joint fluid, and in the detection of both soft tissue and bone zzso
