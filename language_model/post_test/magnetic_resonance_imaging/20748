Before 2000, breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso was considered a relatively poor imaging tool for zzso zzso in zzso zzso as a high percentage of zzso magnetic resonance examinations were cases of zzso Three specific shifts in breast zzso occurred, which changed this zzso 1) a shift from high zzso to high spatial imaging, revealing specific zzso features on zzso suspicious for zzso 2) a shift from diagnostic studies of patients with zzso identified on zzso to screening studies of high-risk patients, allowing more accurate comparisons of zzso vs zzso in detecting the full spectrum of breast zzso regardless of appearance on zzso and 3) a shift from emphasis on masses to improved understanding of features of zzso zzso zzso distinct from benign background zzso enhancement zzso Over the last decade, research has confirmed that of all imaging tools, zzso has the highest sensitivity in detection of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso Future studies are needed to clarify how best to use this tool for improved patient zzso
