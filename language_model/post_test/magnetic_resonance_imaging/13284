In functional magnetic resonance imaging, the zzso response to experimental manipulation is almost always assumed to be independent of zzso zzso To test this, we addressed the possible interaction between cognitive task performance and zzso zzso zzso in an experiment designed to answer two questions: 1) Does performance of a cognitively zzso task significantly change zzso zzso properties of zzso time series compared to their values before task zzso 2) If so, can we relate the extent of zzso zzso to the difficulty of the zzso 

Using a novel continuous acquisition zzso design, we found that zzso dynamics tended to recover their zzso zzso values relatively slowly, over the course of several minutes, following completion of one of two versions of the zzso working memory task and that the rate of recovery was slower following completion of the more demanding zzso zzso 2) version of the zzso 

This result supports the model that zzso low frequency zzso dynamics are relevant to the zzso response to zzso zzso Moreover, it suggests that large-scale zzso systems measured using zzso like the heart and other zzso systems subjected to external demands for enhanced performance, can take a considerable period of time to return to a stable baseline zzso
