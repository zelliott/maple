To evaluate the frequency of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the hip and to compare the MR findings with those from zzso 

All patients gave written permission for zzso use of their medical data for scientific purposes before the imaging zzso The study was submitted to the institutional review board, and the need to obtain additional approval was zzso A medical student, a zzso zzso and two senior zzso reviewed zzso consecutive MR zzso for the presence of an accessory zzso zzso in the roof of the zzso or zzso zzso was classified into two zzso type 1, which was filled with contrast material on MR zzso and type 2, which was filled with zzso The zzso of the zzso was measured on zzso and zzso MR zzso MR zzso showing zzso were evaluated for zzso zzso zzso at MR zzso were compared with those from zzso in four hip zzso with zzso type 1 and 13 with zzso type zzso 

Sixteen of the zzso hip zzso zzso four female and 12 male zzso mean age, zzso zzso had zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hip zzso zzso 43 female and 46 male zzso mean age, zzso zzso had zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso changes were found around the zzso No cartilage zzso was seen at the site of the zzso at zzso 

The high frequency of zzso on MR zzso zzso the absence of zzso reaction, and the absence of cartilage defects at zzso indicate that the zzso of the zzso likely represents a zzso
