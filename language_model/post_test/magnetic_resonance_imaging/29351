The purpose of this study was to illustrate the spectrum of abnormalities found at zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in patients with zzso zzso patients aged between 23 and 71 years zzso age 41 zzso presenting with zzso underwent evaluation with zzso zzso MR imaging at zzso zzso zzso of zzso ranged between 5 days and 4 years zzso 15 zzso MR examination protocol included zzso zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso MR images obtained in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed on zzso MR images in 49 of 90 patients zzso Blood within the seminal zzso or the zzso duct was recognized in 23 of 90 patients zzso zzso of the seminal zzso or the zzso duct was observed in 31 of 90 patients zzso Cystic zzso were identified in 14 cases, eight of which involved the zzso and six the zzso zzso zzso within the seminal zzso were depicted in seven zzso No zzso disease was zzso In conclusion, despite the evidence that zzso is most often a benign and zzso condition, we found that zzso zzso MR imaging can detect abnormal findings in more than half of the patients, and may be helpful in assessing the level at which zzso occurred and in defining the cause of the zzso
