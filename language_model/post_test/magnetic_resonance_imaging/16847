A major concern with carotid artery zzso zzso is the potential for cerebral zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether virtual zzso zzso ultrasound zzso can predict the risk of a silent zzso zzso after zzso 

We performed zzso in 45 patients with carotid zzso Before zzso we assessed plaque characteristics by zzso We also performed zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the brain before and after zzso to detect newly appearing zzso silent zzso zzso zzso 

In the patient group that was positive for zzso zzso group: zzso zzso zzso the relative zzso zzso area identified by zzso in 5 zzso including the most zzso zzso was significantly larger than that in areas of the zzso group (N group: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The relative zzso area was significantly lower in the P group than in the N group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There were no differences in the relative dense calcium and zzso core areas between the P and N zzso From the analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves, most reliable zzso values for predicting zzso were a relative zzso area of zzso in the most zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso analysis, the relative zzso area was an independent predictor of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso tissue characterization of zzso zzso of carotid arteries using zzso was useful to predict zzso after zzso However, the positive zzso value determined by zzso was not superior to that determined by a zzso zzso
