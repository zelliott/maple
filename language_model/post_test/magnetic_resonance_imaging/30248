We reviewed the outcome of surgical treatment on 44 consecutive children and adolescents with 47 surgically treated zzso zzso involving the face and the head were zzso 

Eleven zzso were surgically treated before the age of 5 years, 20 zzso between the ages of 5 and 12 years, and 16 zzso were treated after the age of 12 zzso Eleven zzso had zzso zzso 33 zzso underwent marginal zzso 2 zzso were managed with wide zzso and 1 zzso underwent radical zzso The overall recurrence rate was zzso
