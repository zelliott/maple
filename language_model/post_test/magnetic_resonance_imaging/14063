This study investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of language zzso obtained with zzso Nine healthy subjects performed the same set of three different language tasks during two zzso sessions on separate days zzso generation, zzso generation, and picture zzso A fourth task analysis was added in which the three tasks were analyzed zzso zzso task analysis, zzso The zzso targets brain areas that are commonly used in different language tasks, aiming more selectively at zzso zzso The number of active zzso zzso zzso and calculated zzso index zzso were compared across sessions, tasks, subjects, and two a zzso defined volumes of interest zzso language regions versus whole zzso for a wide range of statistical zzso zzso and reliability strongly varied between task zzso The zzso was a robust detector of zzso brain activity, in contrast to the single task zzso The zzso and verb generation task allowed for reliable calculation of the zzso Higher thresholds yielded a clear increase in left zzso which was largest when calculated from active zzso in classical language zzso
