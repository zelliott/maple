One approach to treatment of internal zzso of the zzso joint zzso is surgical zzso and repositioning of the disk and its zzso Nine zzso exhibiting disk zzso (four zzso series and five magnetic resonance imagining zzso series) were studied to analyze the geometrical and mechanical implications of surgical zzso In the central zzso plane, for example, these cases would have required repositioning the disk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso removing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of remodeled zzso zzso and trimming zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso This suggests that from gross geometric considerations alone, there is not sufficient viable joint tissue to recommend disk repositioning as a routine zzso
