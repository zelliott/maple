zzso resonance imaging of the lower zzso was performed with a low field system in 51 patients representing three different categories of zzso primary skeletal muscle zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso distribution of abnormal signal intensity and the grade of involvement of individual muscles were zzso Large differences in the degree of pathological signal intensity between individual muscles were found in all zzso In the muscular zzso and zzso patients, the overall involvement was significantly more severe than in patients with zzso zzso zzso patterns of selective involvement were zzso zzso evidence of selective muscle sparing was zzso the zzso muscle was significantly less affected than the other muscles in all three disease zzso Other muscles with significant sparing include the zzso zzso and zzso muscles of the thigh and the zzso zzso muscle of the zzso Common anatomical and functional characteristics of muscles may be related to the distribution of muscular zzso
