zzso zzso zzso the electrical stability of the left zzso zzso during zzso Thus, abnormal zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso patients with primary zzso zzso zzso can account for their zzso zzso We evaluated zzso zzso zzso density (B zzso after zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso or without zzso zzso zzso zzso primary zzso 

The B zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso and the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso in 23 patients 39 zzso 19 days zzso and 10 zzso zzso damage was zzso by delayed zzso magnetic resonance zzso Three zzso slices per subject were analyzed and six zzso zzso per slice were fitted to a zzso zzso zzso The B zzso in remote regions of the 23 patients zzso zzso 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher than in normal regions of volunteers zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso density in remote regions was similarly zzso in zzso zzso zzso 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In damaged regions, the B zzso was reduced in both patient groups (44 zzso zzso zzso 

Chronically zzso patients with or without primary zzso share similar patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso in remote zzso zzso
