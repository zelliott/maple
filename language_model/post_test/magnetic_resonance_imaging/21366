To evaluate the technical success of total zzso clearance at open zzso for massive and/or multiple symptomatic zzso using MR imaging zzso as the imaging zzso 

The study group comprised 27 women zzso age zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso who underwent open zzso for the treatment of zzso symptomatic zzso at our institution between January 2009 and April zzso zzso was performed with the intention of achieving complete zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed to assess changes in zzso volume and zzso zzso zzso data (including blood loss and zzso and relief of clinical symptoms at follow-up were also zzso 

The mean time to zzso and clinical follow-up was 10 months zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso volume zzso was zzso zzso 580 zzso and zzso was 123 zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean percentage reduction in zzso volume was zzso % zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso zzso zzso women with residual zzso at zzso 7 patients had zzso measuring up to 1 zzso in volume, 3 patients had zzso measuring up to 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso The clinical success rates of zzso amongst the zzso zzso zzso zzso were: 73 % for zzso 64 % for pain, and zzso % for zzso zzso 

Using zzso we have confirmed that open zzso can achieve total or zzso zzso clearance in the majority of patients with massive and/or multiple zzso
