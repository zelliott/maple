When evaluating zzso spikes using zzso source analysis it is important to account for multiple sources and the overlapping background zzso zzso of spike zzso may be modeling only zzso zzso zzso filtering of averaged spike data and multiple source analysis can provide useful information about the onset of zzso zzso A forward zzso filter can help to enhance the initial spike activity during onset over the zzso zzso These points are illustrated with examples of a zzso a zzso and a frontal averaged zzso Multiple source analysis was applied using a genetic zzso and a sequential strategy, in one case including a model of background alpha zzso Multiple source analysis could model sources describing the onset activity that were distinct in location and orientation from the zzso zzso In all cases, the prominent peak on the scalp was dominated by the contribution of zzso zzso Clinical interpretation benefits from an approach that combines the zzso evolution of zzso scalp topography and multiple source activities with the information from zzso and orientation of equivalent zzso sources to identify the cortical generators underlying the earliest phase of zzso zzso
