zzso random field zzso methods are commonly used for statistical zzso and to control the zzso error rate zzso in zzso They require that the error fields are reasonable lattice approximations to an underlying continuous zzso zzso random field and have zzso and zzso spatial zzso zzso zzso test estimates the distribution of the test statistic from the data and adjusts automatically for the zzso Here we present a new analysis zzso the cluster mass zzso test with contextual enhancement zzso and compare it to zzso In zzso the data are first zzso to remove zzso zzso The zzso rates, the cluster detection probability and zzso accuracy of zzso and zzso were compared using measured zzso data and zzso data containing simulated zzso We also applied both methods to an zzso experiment where tactile zzso stimulation into the right hand was zzso When analyzing the zzso using zzso data, both zzso and zzso gave significantly higher zzso zzso up to zzso zzso up to zzso than the nominal significance level zzso indicating that the zzso motion correction or zzso filtering partially zzso In the simulated zzso data, zzso gave less falsely classified zzso for the same cluster detection probability level than zzso The zzso cluster detection probability was on the other hand higher in the zzso zzso Both methods gave zzso similar results in the tactile zzso zzso zzso seems to be a promising zzso analysis method, especially if high zzso accuracy is zzso
