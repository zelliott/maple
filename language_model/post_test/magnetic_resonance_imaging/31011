The zzso nucleus zzso is a target in surgery for Parkinson disease, but its location according to brain zzso compared with its position on an individual patient's magnetic resonance zzso images is incompletely zzso In this study both the size and location of the zzso based on MR images were compared with those on the zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

The position of the zzso relative to the zzso point was evaluated on 18 zzso MR images zzso zzso Of 35 zzso zzso the most zzso zzso zzso and lateral borders were determined from zzso images, zzso and zzso borders from zzso zzso These methods were validated using zzso zzso in one case in which a zzso examination was zzso The mean length of the anterior zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso nucleus borders derived from MR imaging were highly zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso to 10 zzso behind the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso below the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso below the zzso zzso The position of the anterior border on MR images was more zzso and the zzso border more zzso than its position in the brain zzso The zzso was smaller on MR images compared with its size in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (5 zzso zzso 

The size and position of the zzso are highly zzso appearing to be smaller and situated more zzso and lateral on MR images than in zzso Care must be taken in relying on coordinates relative to the zzso for targeting of the zzso
