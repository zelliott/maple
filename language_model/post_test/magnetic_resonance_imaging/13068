zzso zzso zzso is increasingly accepted in clinical settings for diagnostic imaging of focal liver zzso zzso This study aimed to assess the efficacy of zzso in the characterization of zzso in comparison with final diagnosis based on gold standard zzso 

The study was approved by the local ethics committee and participating patients provided written informed zzso A total of 148 patients with zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed using fundamental and harmonic imaging, zzso zzso enhancement was assessed during the zzso portal and late vascular zzso after intravenous administration of contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity and diagnostic accuracy of US and zzso were compared in identifying the zzso as benign, zzso or indeterminate and its actual tumor zzso Final diagnosis was established by biopsy zzso MR imaging zzso or medical history zzso 

When compared to the gold standard, the number of indeterminate diagnoses was reduced from zzso zzso as assessed by fundamental imaging to zzso zzso after zzso enhanced US zzso zzso and specificity improved from zzso and zzso at baseline US to zzso and zzso with zzso respectively zzso zzso accuracy of zzso was zzso in contrast to zzso of baseline zzso 

zzso enhanced US improves the characterization of zzso and may limit the need for further zzso
