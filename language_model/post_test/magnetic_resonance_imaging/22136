zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is useful to minimize operative time and reduce patient zzso This investigation compared the sensitivity of zzso imaging with zzso zzso with that of zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging in patients with zzso 

Twenty-six patients with primary zzso zzso 7) or secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso ultrasound and MR imaging of the neck and zzso to zzso the zzso The presence of zzso was identified by an intact zzso hormone in zzso zzso The zzso zzso tissue activity ratio was calculated for all patients with evidence of an zzso on zzso zzso zzso findings were compared with the results of imaging in 18 of the 26 patients who underwent zzso 

zzso zzso scans demonstrated focal zzso in 46 zzso of 26 zzso The zzso was zzso as slight in zzso zzso and intense zzso zzso tissue activity ratio, zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and MR imaging identified 44 and 47 zzso respectively, in these zzso Eleven of the 18 patients who underwent zzso within 1 zzso after zzso imaging had zzso zzso while 7 had zzso zzso zzso imaging successfully localized 7 of 7 zzso zzso and 27 of 37 zzso zzso zzso The sensitivities of each technique for zzso abnormal zzso zzso were zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for MR zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio in the 18 patients with surgical exploration was not zzso to several zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso imaging may be useful for zzso abnormal zzso in patients with primary and secondary zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso imaging was high as compared to zzso or MR zzso The prolonged retention of zzso may not depend on the number of zzso zzso zzso
