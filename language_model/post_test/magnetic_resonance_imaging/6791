To assess the mechanisms that may be involved in the evolution of right and left zzso dysfunction in patients with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso 

zzso resonance imaging was used in 11 control patients zzso zzso and 27 patients with zzso who were divided into 2 groups, zzso and zzso according to the presence or absence of right zzso dysfunction, zzso zzso zzso was used for assessing the degree of pulmonary zzso 

The right zzso diameter was similar in the 3 groups, zzso zzso and C zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso Right zzso zzso was observed only in the COPD groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso The percentage of zzso right zzso lateral wall zzso zzso in the 3 groups were as zzso zzso vs zzso vs zzso zzso Different left zzso ejection zzso were observed in the groups as zzso zzso vs zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso A positive and significant linear correlation was observed between the left zzso zzso zzso diameter and the zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No correlation was observed between the pulmonary volumes, zzso blood gas analysis, and zzso zzso 

No correlation was observed between the severity of pulmonary function and the degree of zzso function zzso Whether a preserved zzso means the possibility of zzso of right zzso function remains to be zzso However, the presence of the phenomenon of zzso zzso was zzso
