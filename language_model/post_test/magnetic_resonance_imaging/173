To present the clinical and molecular features of a fetus with confined zzso 16 zzso with maternal zzso zzso zzso using various prenatal diagnostic zzso 

zzso zzso was performed on samples of zzso zzso zzso fluid cells, zzso zzso zzso cord, fetal skin, and zzso from a fetus with elevated zzso zzso zzso short tandem repeat markers and zzso single zzso zzso zzso mapping chips were used for molecular zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso Short tandem repeat markers on zzso 16 suggested maternal zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping chips were used to simultaneously confirm the difference in zzso between the zzso and zzso and to diagnose zzso for zzso zzso Fetal zzso and magnetic resonance imaging identified severe zzso growth restriction zzso zzso revealed zzso incomplete zzso of bilateral zzso and zzso of the zzso The zzso of zzso cord, fetal skin and zzso membrane were zzso and the zzso 16 zzso appeared to be confined to the zzso 

zzso should be investigated as a possible zzso in all cases of unexplained zzso zzso zzso can be useful for confirming this zzso
