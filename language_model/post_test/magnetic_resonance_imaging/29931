Patients with Parkinson's disease zzso exhibit zzso in several cognitive functions similar to those observed in patients with prefrontal zzso zzso zzso The zzso origins of these cognitive deficits are not well zzso Two mechanisms have been zzso disruptions in zzso circuits or a zzso in frontal zzso We previously used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in young healthy subjects to separate patterns of zzso and zzso activity during distinct zzso of performance of the Wisconsin zzso zzso zzso a zzso task that reveals deficits in patients with zzso Here, the same zzso protocol was used in zzso patients and matched zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso group compared with the matched control group in the zzso zzso when receiving negative feedback and the zzso zzso when matching after negative zzso In controls, these prefrontal regions specifically zzso with the zzso during those stages of task zzso In contrast, greater zzso was found in the zzso group compared with the matched control group in prefrontal regions, such as the zzso and the zzso zzso when receiving positive or negative feedback, that were not zzso with the zzso in zzso These results suggest that both zzso zzso depletion and zzso zzso zzso may play a role in cognitive deficits in zzso depending on the involvement of the zzso in the task at zzso
