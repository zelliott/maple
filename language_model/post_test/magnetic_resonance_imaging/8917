The investigation of zzso which consists of observation and later reproduction of voluntary actions, promises insights into the complex processes of human zzso Although several aspects concerning the component neural processes necessary for action execution are known, our current understanding of the neural networks underlying these remains zzso The present study applies independent component analysis zzso to functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data acquired during zzso of abstract gestures and zzso zzso This enables identification of neural networks underlying the production of these zzso The zzso approach of zzso is zzso by an analysis of time courses from the zzso of each zzso Four independent networks were active during delayed zzso These can be assigned to the aspects of zzso action perception, zzso motor preparation and action execution, zzso zzso and retrieval into and from working memory, as well as zzso the dynamic integration of object zzso into the zzso At least two of these networks participate in action preparation, one contains areas involved with motor working memory and one includes areas which are connected to the true action zzso The fourth network only shows activity shortly before an zzso action is zzso This indicates a late integration of object zzso into the movement as the time course of activity in this network zzso to action rather than perception of the zzso
