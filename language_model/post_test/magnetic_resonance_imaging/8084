The brain response to zzso frequency zzso variation has already been reported, but with no study for different zzso with respect to various spatial zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed with a zzso zzso General Electric system in 14 volunteers during zzso reversal zzso visual stimulation with different zzso zzso of 4, 6, 8 and 10 zzso in two states of low zzso of zzso and high zzso of 8 zzso zzso The zzso map was created using the data obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso whose Z value was above a threshold of zzso at a significance level P zzso zzso were considered zzso The results demonstrated that the percentage zzso signal change in response to different zzso was the maximum value at 6 zzso for a high zzso of 8 zzso whereas it was the maximum at zzso of 8 zzso for a low zzso of zzso zzso The results of this study agree with the results of animal invasive zzso studies showing spatial and zzso frequency selectivity of zzso in visual cortical zzso These results can be useful for vision therapy (such as the treatment of zzso and selecting a visual task in zzso zzso
