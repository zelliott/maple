To assess the changes of the volume and dimensions of the zzso and the zzso following zzso zzso zzso 

26 eyes from 26 patients received successful zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso retinal detachment from July 2002 to December zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso topography and zzso were performed preoperatively and at the first week zzso The volume of the zzso and the dimensions along the three zzso axes from 13 zzso were measured with zzso MR imaging zzso 

The measurement of zzso for the 13 eyes operated with the zzso zzso zzso revealed that the volume of the zzso was decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and volume of zzso was decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso in the comparison with volume before zzso zzso and vertical dimensions of zzso were decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The length of circumference was decreased to zzso zzso zzso zzso the percentage of the decrease was zzso zzso zzso The average high of the buckle zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso with the average zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso part and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

The length of the circumference at the site of zzso is zzso and the volume of the zzso was decreased after the zzso The technique of zzso has an important role in the measurement and analysis of the volume and the dimension of the zzso
