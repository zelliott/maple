A zzso zzso model was proposed to zzso describe the distribution of the contrast agent zzso zzso in an experimental spinal zzso injury zzso Concentration of zzso was measured in different compartments with in zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the acute phase of zzso The concentration data for each rat was fitted to the model to estimate transfer rates between different zzso The results zzso 1) lack of zzso of zzso in normal zzso zzso 2) rapid exchange of zzso between plasma and zzso fluid in both normal and injured zzso zzso and 3) slower zzso of zzso in injured zzso With this approach, it is possible to zzso the integrity of the zzso zzso barrier zzso in zzso evaluate the zzso of injured cord, assess the efficacy of interventions, and monitor the progression of injury with zzso zzso
