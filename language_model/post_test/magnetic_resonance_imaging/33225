Group differences in brain structure between zzso and healthy research participants have been reported, but findings in the literature present zzso Although most zzso individuals also smoke zzso the effects of smoking on brain structure have not been distinguished from those of zzso Changes with zzso from methamphetamine have also been relatively zzso This study, therefore, attempted to account for effects of smoking and brief zzso from methamphetamine on zzso measures in zzso research zzso 

Gray matter was measured using zzso zzso in three groups: 18 control nonsmokers, 25 control smokers, and 39 zzso smokers zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and control participants zzso were scanned twice to determine change in gray matter over the first month of methamphetamine zzso 

Compared with Control zzso Control Smokers and zzso Smokers had smaller zzso volume in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Smokers also had smaller zzso volumes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso than Control zzso or zzso and smaller zzso volume in zzso than control zzso zzso assessment revealed gray matter increases in cortical regions zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not control zzso the zzso showed a zzso 

zzso volume deficits in the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso individuals may be in part attributable to cigarette smoking or zzso zzso zzso in gray matter with methamphetamine zzso suggests that some zzso deficits are partially attributable to methamphetamine zzso
