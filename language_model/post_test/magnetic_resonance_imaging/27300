To compare the image quality of volume zzso zzso spin echo acquisition zzso imaging method with that of the three-dimensional zzso zzso fast field echo zzso imaging method applied for ankle joint zzso 

MR imaging of the zzso of 10 healthy volunteers was performed with zzso and zzso zzso sequences by using a zzso T zzso Two zzso zzso assessed the tissue contrast between fluid and cartilage zzso and fluid and the Achilles zzso zzso with use of a 4-point zzso For a quantitative analysis, zzso ratio zzso was obtained by imaging zzso and the contrast ratios zzso were calculated between zzso and zzso zzso analyses for differences in grades of tissue contrast and zzso were zzso 

zzso had significantly superior grades in tissue contrast of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso had superior grades in tissue contrast of zzso but these result were not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly superior zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had superior zzso in F-C zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was higher than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrates superior tissue contrast between fluid and the zzso zzso in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis, while zzso zzso shows superior tissue contrast between fluid and cartilage in terms of quantitative zzso
