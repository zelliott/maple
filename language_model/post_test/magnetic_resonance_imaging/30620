zzso disorder zzso is zzso by abnormalities in mood and emotional processing, but the neural zzso of these, their relationship to depressive symptoms, and the similarities with deficits in major depressive disorder zzso remain zzso We compared responses within zzso and prefrontal cortical regions to emotionally salient material in patients with zzso and zzso using functional magnetic resonance zzso 

We measured neural responses to mild and intense expressions of fear, happiness, and sadness in zzso and depressed BD patients, healthy control subjects, and depressed zzso zzso 

zzso disorder patients demonstrated increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal cortical responses particularly to mild and intense fear, mild happy, and mild sad zzso Healthy control subjects demonstrated increased zzso responses to intense happy and mild fear, and increased zzso prefrontal cortical responses to intense sad zzso Overall, zzso patients showed diminished neural responses to all emotional expressions except mild zzso Depression severity correlated positively with zzso response to mild sadness in both patient zzso 

Compared with healthy controls and zzso patients, BD patients demonstrated increased zzso and zzso prefrontal cortical responses to both positive and negative emotional zzso
