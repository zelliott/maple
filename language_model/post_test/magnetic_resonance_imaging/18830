To study zzso the enhancement features of small zzso zzso zzso with zzso scanning of dynamic zzso and spiral CT, and discuss the superiority of dynamic zzso to spiral zzso 

zzso dynamic contrast scanning of high field zzso and spiral CT were performed in 53 patients with zzso The zzso phase, portal zzso phase and delayed phase scanning of spiral CT was done after the zzso scanning of the entire zzso zzso was performed with zzso sequence and fast zzso zzso zzso sequence dynamic zzso contrast zzso 

zzso zzso were found in all 53 zzso zzso and 54 of the 76 zzso enhanced obviously in zzso and spiral CT zzso phase scanning zzso The typical enhancement patterns of zzso in the zzso phase, portal zzso phase and delayed phase scanning of zzso and spiral CT were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhancement patterns were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Both zzso and spiral CT zzso dynamic zzso scanning could demonstrate the enhancement features of zzso and zzso phase scan of zzso was superior to spiral CT in reflecting the zzso characterization of zzso In addition, zzso was better than spiral CT in characterization of zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso
