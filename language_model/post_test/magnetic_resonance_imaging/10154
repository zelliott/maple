There have been only a few structural zzso studies, with varied findings, of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is suitable for studying whole zzso structural brain changes in zzso zzso 

The objective of the current study is to explore gray matter density in zzso zzso 

Gray matter density in 63 zzso subjects and 46 zzso and zzso healthy comparison subjects was compared using zzso 

Relative to healthy comparison subjects, zzso subjects exhibited decreased gray matter density in bilateral prefrontal zzso zzso areas zzso 8, 9, 10, 11, and zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso bilateral superior zzso zzso zzso 21 and zzso left zzso zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso 

This study reports that zzso subjects have gray matter density decreases in prefrontal and zzso cortex, which may be associated with behavioral and zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso
