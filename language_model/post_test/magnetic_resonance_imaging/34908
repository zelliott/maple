To determine the accuracy of zzso in the zzso diagnosis of central nervous system zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso studied 75 cases of zzso zzso or magnetic resonance zzso brain zzso performed with zzso zzso and a zzso biopsy zzso over the course of five zzso zzso samples were sent for both frozen section and immediate zzso zzso zzso preparations zzso and zzso zzso were used for zzso zzso There were 23 cases of progressive zzso zzso zzso 8 of zzso zzso 3 of zzso zzso virus, 26 of lymphoma, 3 of zzso encephalitis, 1 of melanoma, 1 of zzso and 10 of zzso changes zzso zzso 

Using permanent zzso and zzso zzso sections as the zzso zzso frozen section had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso while zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso Most of the false negative cases in zzso and frozen section were due to the predominance of necrosis and/or zzso present in six cases of zzso Two of the false positive cases in frozen section zzso as zzso showed zzso while two false positive cases in zzso zzso as zzso showed only zzso with negative zzso zzso for zzso in the permanent zzso 

First, zzso had higher sensitivity that frozen zzso Second, zzso provided faster results in most instances, primarily due to the nature of zzso zzso Third, most zzso occurred in infectious diseases, especially zzso this should therefore be kept in mind when zzso changes with an zzso zzso zzso are zzso Fourth, zzso can be an alternative to frozen section for the zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Another advantage of zzso is elimination of the need for cutting potentially infectious fresh zzso
