The zzso response to visual zzso was studied as a function of spatial resolution at a field of zzso zzso The results showed that the increase in absolute zzso upon zzso was as large as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the highest resolution zzso zzso while it was as small as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the lowest resolution zzso zzso In addition, upon increasing resolution, the zzso signal zzso as a function of echo time changed from zzso to zzso These data indicate that, when using the standard resolution for zzso studies at zzso zzso the effects of zzso changes in the draining veins are of major contribution to the total blood zzso zzso zzso signal changes measured in zzso encompassing the activated brain zzso The data can be zzso accounted for using a model based on the zzso origin of the zzso effect including both zzso and zzso zzso zzso theories for the zzso zzso effect based on diffusion through field zzso predict negligible zzso effects inside the large vessels and are therefore incompatible with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
