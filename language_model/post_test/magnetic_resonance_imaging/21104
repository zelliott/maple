The aim of this work is to investigate the facial distortion zzso experienced by patients with zzso zzso zzso and to analyze the zzso with the previously described zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso examination and brain zzso in three patients who suffered from small zzso zzso zzso due to zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso They all complained of distortion and shrinkage of their zzso face zzso to the brain zzso The phenomenon appeared some seconds after steady fixation on the zzso nose and was evident with both left and right zzso zzso The patients did not notice a gap in the area corresponding to the zzso and objects other than faces were perceived zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can lead to focal displacement of facial features towards the center of the field zzso with resulting distortion of the face on the affected zzso This so-called zzso makes faces appear regionally zzso than they are in reality and may be induced even by visual field defects that remain zzso by conventional zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for faces is probably associated with the superior location of zzso or specific impairment of face processing abilities related to the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is most probably associated with cortical zzso and spatial zzso and can hence be regarded as a special entity of the zzso zzso zzso
