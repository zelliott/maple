The authors present the use of cortical zzso segmented from magnetic resonance zzso imaging, and functional data from functional zzso imaging and zzso zzso in the zzso surgical management of zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso 

In an initial set of 11 patients, zzso near zzso were automatically segmented from MR imaging data sets, then zzso and zzso imaging examinations were zzso zzso functional information was preoperatively interpreted and selected from zzso and zzso imaging and subsequently transferred to the navigation system for selected zzso A zzso system consisting of a surgical microscope with enhanced reality overlay display was zzso Data were displayed as contours on the zzso images of a zzso zzso and as contours on the overlay screen of the zzso display within the optical path of the right zzso of the surgical zzso 

This method, in which both zzso and functional mapping are used for surgery planning and zzso provides helpful zzso It is a promising procedure for the treatment of patients who harbor zzso in areas around the eloquent zzso
