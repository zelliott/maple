zzso exposure to a single direction of motion alters perception of subsequent zzso or dynamic stimuli and zzso substantial changes in behaviors of zzso zzso but the origin of neural adaptation and neural zzso of zzso consequences of motion adaptation in human brain remain zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured motion adaptation tuning zzso in a fine scale by probing changes in cortical activity after adaptation for a range of directions relative to the adapted zzso We found a clear zzso in tuning curve zzso cortical responses in zzso visual areas reduced at around both the adapted and opposite direction, resulting in a zzso tuning curve, whereas response reduction in zzso areas occurred only at around the adapted direction, resulting in a zzso tuning zzso We also found that the zzso measured adaptation tuning zzso were zzso and best matched the cortical adaptation tuning zzso in the middle zzso area zzso and the zzso superior zzso area zzso Our findings are compatible with, but not limited to, an interpretation in which direct impacts of motion adaptation occur in both zzso and zzso units in early visual areas, but the zzso consequences of motion adaptation are zzso in the population activity in zzso and zzso which may inherit those direct impacts of adaptation from the zzso selective zzso
