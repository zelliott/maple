To evaluate long-term zzso outcomes in children with zzso zzso isolated zzso of the corpus zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed data for 20 children born between January 1991 and November 2003 in the zzso region of France with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated zzso We collected data on zzso zzso zzso findings, clinical features at birth and zzso zzso 

zzso ranged from 3 to 16 zzso zzso was complete in 11 patients zzso partial in 2 zzso zzso in 3 zzso and associated with an zzso zzso in 4 zzso zzso outcome was normal in 11 zzso patients, including 8 with complete zzso moderate disability was present in 5 zzso patients and severe disability in 4 zzso zzso In 3 of the 4 patients with severe zzso zzso cerebral magnetic resonance imaging zzso showed additional major cerebral zzso 

zzso outcome was good in most of our patients with isolated zzso with zzso of patients having normal outcomes or moderate zzso A prenatal diagnosis of isolated zzso may not warrant termination of zzso A carefully interpreted prenatal cerebral zzso is crucial to detect associated cerebral zzso a longer follow-up is necessary to look for moderate zzso
