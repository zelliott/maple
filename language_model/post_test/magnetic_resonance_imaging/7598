In planning for a potentially zzso zzso of the zzso zone in patients with pediatric zzso invasive monitoring with zzso zzso is often used to zzso the seizure onset zone and eloquent zzso A precise understanding of the location of zzso strip and grid zzso on the brain surface, and of depth zzso in the brain in relationship to eloquent areas is expected to facilitate zzso zzso 

We developed a novel zzso for the alignment of zzso electrodes, extracted from zzso CT, with zzso zzso Our goal was to develop a method of achieving highly accurate zzso of zzso and depth electrodes, in order to facilitate surgical zzso Specifically, we created a zzso zzso geometric model of the cortical surface from automatic zzso of a zzso zzso automatically segmented zzso from zzso CT, and projected each set of zzso onto the brain surface after alignment of the CT to the zzso Also, we produced critical zzso of anatomical landmarks, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or eloquent cortical areas, which enables the zzso surgery team to accurately estimate the distance between the zzso and the anatomical landmarks, which might help for better assessment of risks and benefits of surgical zzso 

zzso zzso accuracy was measured using knowledge of the position of placement from zzso zzso photographs in ten consecutive subjects who underwent zzso zzso for pediatric zzso Average spatial accuracy of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for all 385 visible zzso in the zzso 

In comparison with previously reported approaches, our zzso is able to achieve more accurate alignment of strip and grid zzso with minimal user zzso Unlike manual alignment procedures, our zzso achieves excellent alignment without time-consuming and difficult zzso from an zzso
