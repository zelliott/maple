This study was designed to assess whether functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso following zzso administration zzso is sufficiently sensitive to detect differences in patterns of zzso between zzso of the same zzso Healthy adult males zzso participated in a randomized, zzso zzso trial with three medication periods during which they received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso for 2 zzso All participants had high expression zzso zzso zzso An zzso scan that included passive viewing of overt and covert affective faces and affective words was performed after each medication zzso zzso in response to overt faces was greater following zzso than following zzso in the right zzso thalamus, and zzso when the faces were compared with a fixation zzso For the rapid covert zzso a greater response was observed in the left middle zzso zzso in the happy versus fearful contrast following zzso than following zzso Thus, the combination of zzso and zzso was successful in discriminating between two very similar zzso However, the pattern of zzso observed suggests that further studies are indicated to understand how to zzso combine the two zzso
