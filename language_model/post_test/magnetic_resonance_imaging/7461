zzso zzso zzso zzso are being detected with increased zzso The aims of this study were to determine the zzso of zzso and develop an zzso system for prediction of zzso in zzso 

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients zzso years of age with confirmed zzso from January 2005 to December 2010 in a community-based integrated care setting in Southern zzso Patients with history of acute or chronic zzso were zzso zzso diagnosed within 3 months of zzso diagnosis was considered as zzso zzso zzso of zzso during surveillance was calculated based on zzso at zzso zzso and zzso standardized zzso ratio zzso was calculated with the zzso reference zzso zzso zzso was used to develop a risk prediction model based on zzso imaging zzso 

We identified 1,815 patients with confirmed zzso A total of 53 zzso of patients were diagnosed with zzso zzso during the study zzso The surveillance cohort consisted of zzso patients with median follow-up of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso per year during zzso The overall zzso and zzso zzso for pancreatic zzso was zzso zzso confidence level zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we zzso patients into low zzso intermediate zzso and high zzso risk of harboring zzso zzso based on four zzso imaging features: size, pancreatic duct zzso zzso with zzso as well as zzso Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for the prediction model was zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of pancreatic zzso was lower than previous reports from surgical series but was still significantly higher than the reference zzso A risk zzso system based on established imaging criteria may help guide future management decisions for patients with zzso
