Our objective was to characterize the CT and MR imaging findings of zzso zzso 

We reviewed the CT and MR imaging findings in six women with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were round, zzso zzso in diameter, and located in the zzso pelvic zzso in four patients and adjacent to the kidney in two zzso CT findings of the tumors were zzso round masses showing prominent zzso changes and oriented in a somewhat zzso zzso zzso and heavily zzso MR images showed high-intensity zzso areas and zzso areas of various signal zzso 

CT findings of a round mass with prominent zzso zzso along with certain MR imaging zzso may be helpful in the zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso
