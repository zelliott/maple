Between September 1998 and June 1999, there was an outbreak of severe viral encephalitis due to zzso virus, a newly discovered zzso in zzso 

We studied the clinical features of the patients with zzso virus encephalitis who were admitted to a medical center in zzso zzso The case definition was based on zzso clinical, zzso fluid, and zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso virus infection were seen from February to June 1999 zzso age, 37 years; ratio of male patients to female patients, zzso to zzso zzso percent had had direct contact with zzso usually in the two weeks before the onset of illness, suggesting that there was direct viral transmission from pigs to humans and a short incubation zzso The main presenting features were fever, headache, zzso and zzso zzso patients (55 percent) had a reduced level of consciousness and prominent zzso zzso zzso clinical signs included zzso zzso zzso and zzso hypertension, and zzso and thus suggest the involvement of the brain stem and the upper cervical spinal zzso The initial zzso fluid findings were abnormal in 75 percent of zzso zzso against zzso virus were detected in serum or zzso fluid in 76 percent of 83 patients zzso Thirty patients (32 percent) died after rapid deterioration in their zzso An abnormal zzso zzso and zzso were factors associated with a poor zzso Death was probably due to severe zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred after initially mild disease in three zzso Fifty patients zzso percent) recovered fully, and 14 (15 percent) had persistent zzso zzso 

zzso virus causes a zzso rapidly progressive encephalitis with a high mortality rate and features that suggest involvement of the brain zzso The infection is associated with recent contact with zzso
