There is a general consensus in the literature that schizophrenia causes difficulties with facial emotion perception and zzso zzso brain imaging studies have observed reduced zzso activity during facial emotion perception but few studies have examined the relation to flat affect zzso 

A total of 26 people with schizophrenia and 26 healthy controls took part in this zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso happy and neutral faces were presented in a zzso order and participants indicated the gender of the face zzso Manual zzso of the zzso was performed on a structural zzso zzso 

Both the schizophrenia group and the healthy control group rated the emotional zzso of facial expressions zzso Both groups exhibited increased brain activity during the perception of emotional faces relative to neutral ones in multiple brain regions, including multiple prefrontal regions zzso the right amygdala, right zzso zzso and zzso Group zzso however, revealed increased activity in the healthy group in the anterior cingulate, right zzso zzso and multiple visual zzso In zzso the severity of flat affect correlated significantly with neural activity in several brain areas including the zzso and zzso region zzso 

These results suggest that many of the brain regions involved in emotional face perception, including the amygdala, are equally recruited in both schizophrenia and controls, but flat affect can also moderate activity in some other brain regions, notably in the left zzso and zzso zzso zzso There were no significant group differences in the volume of the zzso
