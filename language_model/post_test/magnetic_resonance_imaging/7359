To investigate the improvement in dose distribution in zzso breast zzso using a zzso zzso magnetic field that maintains the same direction of zzso force between two zzso The investigation has a potential application in future zzso zzso 

zzso zzso images of four patients and magnetic fields of zzso zzso zzso were used for zzso Carlo zzso Two patients had intact breast while the other two had zzso zzso of planning and chest wall zzso were similar to the actual clinical zzso The direction of zzso magnetic field for the zzso treatment beam was reversed for the lateral zzso 

For the zzso lung and heart mean doses were reduced by a mean zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, depending on various treatment plan zzso The mean zzso for zzso lung was reduced by zzso zzso In addition acceptable results were shown after simulation of zzso T magnetic field demonstrated in zzso reductions of the heart, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso a zzso magnetic field during breast zzso not only reduces the dose to the lung and heart but also produces a sharp drop dose volume zzso for planning target volume, because of zzso of the path of secondary charged particles toward the chest wall by the zzso zzso The simulations have shown that use of the magnetic field at zzso T is not feasible for clinical applications due to the increase of zzso chest wall skin dose in comparison to the conventional planning while zzso T is suitable for all patients due to dose reduction to the chest wall zzso
