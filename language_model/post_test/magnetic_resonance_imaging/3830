Brain images acquired at zzso often display central brightening with zzso varying tissue contrast, caused by zzso in the transmit zzso fields used for zzso zzso zzso zzso can provide zzso of zzso field zzso but previous designs have been zzso for zzso imaging in rapid pulse zzso This article presents a zzso pulse design based on a short (1 zzso zzso spiral zzso trajectory that covers low spatial zzso The resulting zzso are zzso to produce a uniform zzso within a specified volume of interest covering the whole zzso B1 mapping and pulse calculation times were reduced by zzso in only five slices within the zzso The method has been tested with both single and parallel zzso in phantom experiments, zzso zzso error in zzso was zzso for single and zzso for parallel zzso The corresponding results in zzso were zzso and zzso zzso A pilot brain imaging study using the proposed zzso for zzso within the Alzheimer's disease zzso initiative zzso prepared rapid zzso echo zzso zzso yielded excellent image quality with improved signal to noise ratio in peripheral brain regions and enhanced uniformity of contrast compared with standard zzso Greatest performance enhancement was achieved using parallel transmission, but single channel transmission offers significant improvement over standard zzso zzso
