To investigate whether rates of cartilage loss differ in knees with frequent baseline pain versus those without pain, after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

One knee in each of zzso zzso Initiative participants was zzso 310 with calculated zzso zzso grade 2, 299 with calculated zzso grade 3, and 109 with calculated zzso grade zzso zzso change in zzso cartilage thickness was assessed by magnetic resonance zzso Change in cartilage thickness in the central zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and ordered value 1 zzso were selected as primary end zzso zzso knee symptoms were defined as pain, zzso or zzso on most days of at least 1 month during the previous zzso 

The mean 12-month rate of change in cartilage thickness in the central zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso response mean zzso zzso in knees without pain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in those with zzso pain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in those with frequent pain zzso zzso zzso Rates differed significantly between frequently painful knees and pain-free knees after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and calculated zzso grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partial zzso for frequent pain zzso zzso Similar results were found in zzso samples of calculated zzso grade zzso zzso grade 3 knees, and in analyses restricted to knees with consistent pain frequency between baseline and zzso zzso results showed similar trends but were not zzso 

zzso with frequent pain display greater rates of zzso cartilage loss zzso than knees without pain, with or without adjustment or zzso for zzso disease zzso Enrollment of participants with frequent knee pain in clinical trials can increase the observed rate of structural progression zzso cartilage zzso and sensitivity to zzso
