zzso changes and zzso differences in body shape and size can confound zzso studies of muscle zzso zzso muscle mass to height squared is often suggested as a solution for zzso We zzso that zzso of muscle volume to zzso volume may be a better way of determining the extent of muscle lost with zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscle volumes were measured from serial magnetic resonance imaging sections in 20 zzso active young men zzso age zzso zzso 25 older men zzso zzso 18 young women zzso zzso and 28 older women zzso zzso There were no age-related differences in zzso zzso The relationship between thigh muscle volume and zzso volume (R zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso P zzso zzso was stronger than that with height (R zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso P zzso zzso in young zzso For young subjects, the mean zzso ratios were zzso and zzso for men and women, zzso For older men and women, the mean ratios were zzso and zzso zzso The Z score for the thigh zzso volume ratio relative to young subjects was zzso zzso zzso for older men and zzso zzso zzso for older zzso The extent of zzso judged by the zzso ratio was approximately twice that determined when zzso to height zzso These data suggest that the zzso ratio captures the zzso loss of muscle mass during zzso and that the age-related loss of muscle mass may be underestimated when zzso to height zzso The zzso seems relatively more affected by zzso than other thigh zzso
