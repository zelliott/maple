To investigate the incorporation of data from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso into zzso zzso zzso planning for zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

Seven scenarios were simulated that represent cases of zzso with significant functional lung zzso Two independent zzso plans were produced for each zzso one to zzso total lung volume receiving zzso zzso and the other to zzso only the functional lung volume receiving zzso zzso zzso characteristics and a plan quality index related to planning target volume coverage by the zzso zzso zzso were compared between anatomical and functional plans using the zzso signed ranks zzso 

Compared to anatomical zzso plans, functional planning reduced zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso and total lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a small reduction in mean functional lung dose zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences in target volume coverage or zzso zzso Plan quality index was improved for functional plans zzso increase zzso range zzso zzso 

zzso significant reductions in zzso zzso and mean functional lung dose are possible when zzso planning is supplemented by functional information derived from zzso or zzso
