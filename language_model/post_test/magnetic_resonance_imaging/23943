The parameters that govern water zzso magnetic relaxation zzso water exchange rates, and zzso and electronic correlation zzso of representatives of two classes of zzso complexes have been estimated, using two different approaches and the results compared with those derived for known zzso The complexes studied are: zzso the zzso zzso zzso a typical zzso zzso MR agent, and zzso the zzso zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso a zzso MR blood pool agent, which binds to serum zzso in zzso through zzso zzso zzso An zzso study of zzso gives a water exchange rate constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identical to that for the zzso analog zzso Both approaches yield longer zzso correlation times for zzso consistent with its higher molecular zzso An zzso study of zzso gives a water exchange rate constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identical to that for zzso The water exchange rate on zzso did not decrease considerably when bound to zzso the lowest limit is zzso zzso zzso Both approaches yield identical zzso correlation times for zzso however, it was difficult to derive a consistent zzso constant for the zzso zzso using the different approaches zzso ranged between zzso and zzso zzso
