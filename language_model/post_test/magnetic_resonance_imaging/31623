Acute zzso zzso zzso research relies increasingly on small animal models and zzso imaging methods such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a direct comparison among these techniques for characterization of zzso zzso and zzso size is zzso zzso were studied within zzso zzso post zzso by zzso zzso zzso and subsequently zzso zzso post zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso contrast agent was used to detect zzso and a fast low angle shot zzso sequence was used to acquire late enhancement and functional images zzso zzso regions showed late enhancement, whereas corresponding zzso images had reduced zzso zzso zzso most accurately depicted zzso showing the closest correlation and agreement with zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso In some animals a mismatch of reduced zzso in normal zzso and relatively increased zzso zzso in the zzso border zone precluded conventional quantitative zzso We performed the first quantitative comparison of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso imaging in a small animal zzso zzso was superior to the other zzso due to its greater spatial resolution and ability to detect zzso zzso zzso The observed zzso mismatch likely represents variable zzso conditions between stunned zzso in the zzso border zone and normal zzso and supports the use of a standardized zzso load or zzso clamp technique for PET imaging of zzso zzso in small zzso
