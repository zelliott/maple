Children affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso have an internal rotation zzso of the shoulder and a zzso zzso zzso In 2003, Pearl proposed doing an zzso release of the shoulder to restore external rotation and allow the zzso joint to zzso The goal of the current study was to evaluate the active and passive shoulder external rotation range of motion and zzso joint zzso in children treated with zzso zzso 

Between 2004 and 2010, 18 children with passive external rotation under zzso were treated with shoulder zzso to release the anterior capsule and ligaments and perform a zzso zzso no zzso transfer was zzso The average age was 4 years, 2 zzso Nine children had an injury at zzso four had an injury at zzso and five had a complete zzso The average follow-up was zzso zzso The clinical evaluation consisted of active and passive external rotation zzso with elbow at the side, active internal zzso and the modified zzso zzso One child who required an external rotation zzso of the zzso zzso was excluded from the clinical zzso An zzso was performed on both shoulders to assess zzso zzso zzso type, degree of zzso zzso zzso by the percentage of zzso head anterior to the middle zzso zzso and zzso head zzso 

At the latest zzso passive zzso was zzso on average and active zzso was zzso Eleven children had regained more than zzso of active zzso The average internal rotation had decreased after the zzso The zzso assessment showed that the zzso joint had zzso in zzso of zzso the zzso type had improved, the zzso zzso had diminished and the zzso head was zzso zzso head zzso was found in zzso of zzso 

zzso release of the shoulder results in more external rotation and allows for zzso joint zzso zzso transfer is not always necessary to restore active external zzso
