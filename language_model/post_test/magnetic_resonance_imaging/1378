zzso zzso size was calculated in 10 zzso and 8 normal control subjects by summing the zzso areas of zzso zzso tissue measured on zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso The areas of two zzso zzso regions zzso I through V and zzso VI through zzso were also measured using the zzso zzso Our cumulative slice area measure of zzso zzso size was significantly smaller in the zzso subjects than in the control zzso The cumulative slice area correlated positively with the area of zzso zzso VI through zzso only in the zzso zzso Our results indicated that the decreased size of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso VI through zzso was associated with zzso
