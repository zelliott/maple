This study aimed to assess the surgical morbidity and mortality of zzso zzso repair zzso as compared with open surgical repair zzso for isolated descending zzso zzso zzso 

From January 1, 2006 through May 31, 2010, a total of 68 patients with isolated descending zzso zzso disease were zzso reviewed for the presence of zzso complication, 30-day zzso and clinical zzso The patients were divided into two groups zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso group 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso and these groups were compared for major variables and late zzso 

The mean age was 58 years zzso I zzso 54 zzso group II zzso 63 years, p zzso zzso zzso zzso complications occurred in 12 zzso 8 zzso in group I and 4 zzso in group II zzso zzso zzso There were five 30 day zzso of which 4 occurred in group I and 1 in group II zzso zzso zzso Clinical success zzso zzso zzso and complete false zzso obliteration or zzso was achieved in 20 patients zzso Mean zzso survival rate at 1 year was similar for both groups zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso group 2 zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso zzso repair for isolated zzso zzso disease shows comparable results to zzso However, the potential for zzso or zzso remains a challenge that needs to be addressed in the zzso zzso close follow-up study is needed for the evaluation of satisfactory long-term zzso
