The study of cerebral variables associated with response to zzso holds interest from both theoretical and clinical points of zzso To date, no studies have aimed to identify zzso of response to zzso based on cerebral zzso Here, we used magnetic resonance to assess the relationship between volumes of the prefrontal zzso and zzso and zzso zzso lobe and zzso cortical regions and zzso and, on the other hand, the response to zzso in 16 schizophrenic zzso Data from 42 healthy controls were used to calculate volume zzso in the patients, defined as zzso from the expected values, given individual age and zzso zzso zzso thus represent the effect of illness on regional zzso The association between clinical change and those zzso was calculated separately for the positive, negative and total scores from the Positive and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a significant direct association between the degree of zzso zzso and the improvement of positive symptoms with zzso No zzso were found for change in the negative zzso A trend was found for patients with larger zzso to show a greater global decrease in total zzso zzso Neither age nor duration of illness explained a significant proportion of the symptom zzso This result, together with others from the literature, supports the idea that zzso zzso may offer some benefit to patients with significant regional zzso and this may have implications for the choice of antipsychotic in clinical zzso
