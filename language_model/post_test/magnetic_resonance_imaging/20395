zzso shape discrimination involves frontal other than zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2005 zzso but it is unclear if this frontal activity is related to exploratory zzso In this study, we investigated topographical details of zzso zzso and zzso areas during passive tactile recognition of zzso geometrical shapes in conditions avoiding exploratory zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed while the same wooden zzso geometrical shapes were blindly pressed on subjects' passive right palm in three zzso In the zzso condition, shapes were pressed while subjects were asked to attend to the stimuli but were not trained to recognize zzso After a brief training, in the SHAPE condition subjects were asked to covertly recognize zzso In the zzso condition, they were asked to overtly recognize shapes, using response buttons with their opposite zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and left zzso was active in all conditions, confirming its importance in processing tactile zzso In the zzso zzso SHAPE contrast, bilateral zzso zzso insular, zzso zzso and (left) zzso areas were more active in the zzso In the zzso zzso of (left) zzso area correlated with correct zzso These results suggest that, even without exploratory movements, passive recognition of tactile geometrical shapes involves prefrontal and zzso as well as zzso zzso In this zzso zzso area might be involved in a successful selection and/or execution of the correct zzso
