It has been suggested that the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso is involved in free selection zzso the process by which subjects themselves decide what action to zzso Evidence for this proposal has been provided by imaging studies showing zzso of the zzso when subjects randomly generate zzso However, these response selection tasks have a hidden working memory element and it has been widely reported that the zzso is activated when subjects perform tasks which involve working zzso The primary aim of this experiment was to establish if the zzso is genuinely involved in response zzso We used repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to investigate whether temporary interference of the zzso could disrupt performance of a response selection task that had no working memory zzso zzso performed tasks in which they made zzso sequences of eight zzso finger zzso In the zzso task, subjects chose their movements at random while a computer monitor displayed these zzso This visual feedback zzso the need for subjects to maintain their previous moves zzso No selection was required for the two control tasks as responses were cued by the visual zzso The zzso demands of the control tasks zzso In the high load zzso version, subjects had to maintain their attention throughout the zzso but this requirement was absent in the low load zzso zzso zzso over the zzso slowed response times on the zzso task and at the end of the sequence on the zzso task, but had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso over the zzso frontal zzso zzso slowed response times on the zzso task but had no effect on the zzso zzso This suggests that a response selection task without a working memory load will depend on the zzso and the zzso The difference appears to be that the zzso is important when selecting between competing responses or when concentrating if there is a high zzso demand, but that the zzso is only important during the response selection zzso
