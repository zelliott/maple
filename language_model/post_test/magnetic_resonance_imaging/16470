In recent research, many zzso and zzso approaches have been proposed to improve automatic zzso of various zzso syndromes using imaging zzso Some of these methods do not provide the possibility to integrate possible zzso variables like age into the statistical zzso A similar problem sometimes exists in clinical studies, as it is not always possible to match different clinical groups to each other in all zzso zzso like for example, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso Here, we propose a simple method to control for possible effects of zzso variables such as age prior to statistical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging zzso data using support zzso machine zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso We compare zzso results for the zzso of 80 zzso patients and 79 healthy control subjects based on zzso data with and without prior age zzso Additionally, we compare zzso results for the comparison of three different groups of zzso patients differing in age with the same group of control subjects obtained without including age as zzso with age as zzso or with prior age correction using the proposed zzso zzso zzso using the proposed method resulted in higher zzso zzso accuracy compared to zzso zzso Further, applying the proposed age correction substantially improved zzso detection of zzso zzso matter zzso using zzso in zzso patients differing in age from control zzso The results suggest that the approach proposed in this work is generally suited to control for zzso variables such as age in zzso or zzso zzso zzso the approach might improve and extend the application of these methods in clinical zzso
