zzso integration and interaction occur when zzso stimuli are presented as either zzso zzso or zzso but temporally zzso We investigated whether zzso cues interact with auditory attention to one of two sound sources in zzso The zzso task was to attend to either the left or right speaker and to respond to occasional zzso targets via a zzso We recorded zzso zzso in three experimental conditions: the participants either held the speakers in their hands zzso reached out close to them zzso or had their hands in their lap zzso In the last two conditions, the auditory zzso zzso zzso revealed a prominent zzso around 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso over zzso areas, which is a reliable index of further processing of spatial stimulus features in zzso The zzso wave was markedly attenuated in the zzso condition, which suggests that zzso cues apparently solidify spatial information zzso by the auditory system, in so doing alleviating the need for further processing of spatial coordinates solely based on auditory zzso
