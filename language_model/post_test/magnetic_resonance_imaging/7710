Motor imagery zzso is often used in combination with zzso techniques to study the cognitive control of zzso However, imagery ability zzso varies widely across individuals, potentially influencing the pattern of cerebral recruitment during zzso The aim of the current study was to investigate this effect of zzso on the neural zzso of gait control using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Twenty healthy young subjects were subdivided into a good and bad zzso group, on the basis of their performance on two mental zzso zzso For the whole group, zzso activated a bilateral network of areas highly consistent with previous studies, encompassing primary motor zzso zzso zzso supplementary motor area, and other frontal and zzso areas, anterior zzso and zzso Compared to bad zzso good zzso showed higher zzso in the right BA 4, left prefrontal zzso zzso 10), right thalamus, and bilateral zzso Good zzso thus appear better able to recruit motor areas during zzso but also activate a prefrontal executive area zzso 10), which zzso information from the body and the environment and zzso in zzso gait zzso These differences were found even though the two groups did not differ in other imagery abilities according to a standard questionnaire for zzso of motor and visual zzso Future studies on zzso should take into account these effects, and control for zzso when comparing different zzso using appropriate zzso A better understanding of the neural mechanisms that zzso zzso ability is crucial to accurately evaluate locomotor skills in clinical measures and zzso zzso
