zzso syndrome zzso is a rare zzso zzso disorder characterized by diabetes zzso zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and deafness caused by zzso in zzso gene zzso which encodes an zzso zzso zzso called zzso We describe the case of an infant who presented zzso and severe zzso of the left zzso with zzso of visual evoked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and high plasma zzso suggested zzso confirmed by a normal urine concentration after zzso zzso Treatment with zzso allowed a zzso of sodium levels and urine zzso Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed absence of the zzso zzso zzso normal zzso and zzso tracts zzso The zzso presence of zzso and zzso even in the absence of zzso and deafness, prompted the suspicion of zzso and complete genetic analysis was zzso zzso DNA sequencing of zzso showed no zzso zzso described to date, but suggested a structural zzso as markers zzso revealed a zzso paternal zzso involving the upstream regulatory region zzso and zzso zzso sequencing revealed the coexistence of the zzso transcript and two zzso zzso one zzso probably benign, is known in literature and the other one causes the loss of zzso 2, containing the translation initiation zzso Western zzso confirmed a marked protein zzso During the clinical follow-up child's condition remained stable and zzso metabolism is still in the zzso In conclusion, the zzso associated with this structural zzso which substantially reduces the synthesis of zzso confirms a zzso pattern of expression of zzso suggests the presence of a different protein dosage sensitivity in different zzso and could be zzso of zzso and zzso in our zzso The zzso zzso here zzso usually absent in typical zzso cases, is explained by the residual zzso expression that would preserve other zzso zzso pancreatic zzso A careful zzso clinical follow-up will assess any changes in the zzso zzso in our zzso
