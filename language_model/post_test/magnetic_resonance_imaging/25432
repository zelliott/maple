The cortical zzso involved in conscious cognitive processes and the zzso zzso involved in fear responses have been extensively studied with zzso but their interactions remain largely zzso A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study demonstrated that the engagement of the right prefrontal zzso during the cognitive evaluation of angry and fearful facial expressions is associated with an zzso of the response of the zzso to these same zzso providing evidence for a functional neural network for emotional zzso 

In the current study, we have explored the zzso of this functional network by using threatening and fearful zzso stimuli derived from the International zzso Picture System zzso as well as the influence of this network on peripheral zzso zzso 

Similar to the earlier findings with facial expressions, blood oxygen level dependent zzso revealed that whereas zzso processing of zzso stimuli was associated with a bilateral zzso response, cognitive evaluation of these same stimuli was associated with zzso of this zzso response and a correlated increase in response of the right prefrontal zzso and the anterior zzso zzso Moreover, this pattern was reflected in changes in skin zzso 

The current results further zzso the importance of zzso regions, including the prefrontal and anterior zzso zzso in regulating emotional responses zzso by the zzso through conscious evaluation and zzso
