The massive cuff zzso zzso is known to be a strong zzso suitable for rotator cuff zzso We modified this technique for massive cuff tears by employing a horizontal zzso mattress zzso from an anchor as well as a vertically crossing zzso zzso 

We included 42 patients with massive cuff tears suitable for zzso 22 were treated with the modified zzso zzso group), and 20 with a simple zzso zzso zzso zzso The range of motion zzso muscle strength, visual analog scale, and the Japanese zzso Association zzso scores were evaluated zzso and 12 and 24 months zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was examined at least 1 year zzso using zzso zzso 

The zzso muscle strength, degree of pain, and the zzso scores were much improved after surgery in both groups, and there was no significant intergroup difference throughout the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso revealed a significantly lower zzso rate in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The techniques tested were comparable in terms of functional outcome after surgical repair of massive cuff zzso however, the modified zzso repair technique produced superior structural outcomes with a significantly lower zzso zzso
