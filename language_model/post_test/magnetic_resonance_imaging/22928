zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso mainly in the cardiac zzso in response to volume expansion and pressure zzso The aim of this study was to assess plasma zzso zzso zzso changes in acute zzso stroke zzso 

The study group consisted of 57 zzso women aged 64 zzso 12 zzso patients who had their first zzso and no history or signs of cardiovascular zzso An zzso control group was also included zzso zzso 57, 36 women aged 61 zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso were zzso A thorough cardiovascular and neurological investigation, including imaging techniques and zzso size determination, was also zzso 

The log zzso peak levels, zzso and zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 57 zzso 37 vs 13 zzso 4 zzso P zzso zzso zzso The log zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and heart rate zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso with left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Patients with signs of marked zzso zzso and patients with insular zzso involvement had even higher zzso zzso After adjustment for relevant factors, the relation between the log zzso and zzso as well as insular zzso involvement was observed to be insignificant zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

Our results show that zzso plasma levels are significantly elevated in zzso and might be of clinical importance as a supplementary tool for the assessment of cardiovascular function in patients with zzso
