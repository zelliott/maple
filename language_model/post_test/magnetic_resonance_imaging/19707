To evaluate very long-term results of zzso zzso zzso of acoustic zzso zzso 

From January 1986 to January 2004, zzso was performed in 45 consecutive patients zzso zzso zzso were as zzso poor general condition zzso surgery, hearing preservation in bilateral zzso partial zzso zzso zzso A zzso to zzso technique with zzso beams was zzso A mean total dose of 51 zzso was given zzso zzso The median tumor diameter was 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso The median follow-up from zzso was 80 months zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of our series consists of a very long-term follow-up of zzso given to selected zzso zzso patients died, two with progressive disease, and 17 from zzso zzso A serviceable level of hearing was preserved in zzso hearing zzso No patient had facial or zzso zzso zzso shrinkage was observed in 27 zzso and stable disease in 16 zzso zzso progression occurred in three patients, 12 to 15 months after zzso Two additional tumors recurred after shrinkage 20 and 216 months after treatment and were operated zzso zzso local tumor control rates at 5 and 15 years were zzso For the patient who had a tumor recurrence at 216 months, zzso examination documented transformation to a zzso zzso peripheral nerve sheath zzso 

Very long-term efficacy of zzso is well documented in this zzso However, our results suggest that zzso transformation can occur many years after zzso so we advocate caution when using this treatment for young zzso
