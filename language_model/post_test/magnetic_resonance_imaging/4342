Brain zzso patterns associated with three motor tasks, differing in the mode of movement selection, were studied in seven right-handed subjects, using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The tasks consisted of sequences of finger movements in which the next finger was selected zzso according to a fixed sequence zzso zzso in response to an external sensory cue zzso or zzso on the basis of free, internal selection zzso zzso of hand relaxation zzso alternating with the tasks served as a zzso zzso maps resulting from comparison of the motor tasks with zzso reveal zzso in primary zzso cortex, zzso and lateral zzso areas, zzso cortex, and zzso zzso The task zzso level, defined as the percentage MR signal increase for each task relative to zzso and the differential zzso defined as the percentage MR signal increase for RAND and zzso relative to zzso were calculated in each zzso All areas showed a higher zzso level for RAND and zzso than for zzso A significant difference in zzso level or differential zzso between zzso and RAND was found in the zzso part of the superior frontal zzso in a part of the zzso zzso on the lateral brain surface, in the anterior zzso motor cortex, and in the zzso part of the superior zzso zzso The high-resolution and zzso approach, provided by zzso allowed the distinguishing of multiple zzso in zzso frontal areas, zzso cortex, and zzso cortex, reflecting the functional zzso of these areas suggested by previous zzso
