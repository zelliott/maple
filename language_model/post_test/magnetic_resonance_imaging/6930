The following study included 5 Wilson's disease zzso patients showing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and addressed the question of whether the primary motor zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso zzso we investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in a sustained zzso posture of the zzso zzso Data were analyzed using dynamic imaging of coherent sources zzso revealing zzso zzso between zzso and cerebral zzso zzso sources were superimposed on individual high-resolution zzso magnetic resonance images zzso Phase lags between zzso and cerebral areas showing strongest zzso were determined by means of a zzso transform of both zzso In all patients, zzso zzso was associated with strong zzso between zzso zzso and activity in zzso primary zzso zzso zzso at zzso or double zzso zzso Phase lag values between zzso activity and zzso revealed zzso and zzso components in the zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso in zzso is zzso through a pathological zzso drive from the primary motor zzso
