To determine the usefulness of zzso MR imaging in assessing the zzso grade of cerebral zzso 

In order to determine relative cerebral blood volume zzso 22 patients with zzso proven zzso (9 zzso 9 zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso underwent dynamic zzso zzso and conventional zzso and zzso zzso zzso maps were obtained by fitting a zzso function to the contrast material concentration versus time zzso zzso ratios between tumor and normal white matter zzso zzso of tumor zzso zzso of zzso white zzso were calculated and compared between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Mean zzso ratios were zzso degrees zzso zzso for zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso degrees zzso for zzso zzso and were thus significantly zzso p zzso between zzso and zzso zzso p zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso value which permitted discrimination between high-grade zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and the sensitivity and specificity of this value were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging is a useful and reliable technique for zzso the zzso grade of zzso
