zzso resonance imaging zzso is useful in the quantitative evaluation of brain zzso because the superior contrast resolution zzso separation of the gray and white zzso zzso assessment of brain zzso has mainly been performed by manual zzso which requires considerable time and effort to determine the brain zzso zzso zzso quantitative measurement methods for the diagnosis of brain zzso are zzso We have developed a method of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso lobe simultaneously on MR images obtained in a single zzso It is important to measure the volume of not only these regions but also the frontal lobe in clinical zzso However, for zzso the frontal zzso it is necessary to identify the zzso zzso and the central zzso which represent zzso Here, we developed a method of identifying the central zzso from MR images obtained with a zzso T zzso zzso The brain and the zzso fluid zzso regions were segmented using zzso zzso method on MR zzso The central zzso shows an zzso line from the inside to the outside on the zzso zzso The almost straight appearance of the central zzso was used for zzso of the central zzso from the segmented zzso zzso The central zzso was identified with this technique in zzso of the images obtained by all zzso This technique for identifying the central zzso is very important not only for zzso but also for clinical zzso
