The interpretation of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies based on blood zzso dependent zzso contrast generally relies on the assumption of a linear relationship between evoked zzso activity and zzso zzso While zzso in this relationship have been suggested by a number of studies, it remains unclear to what extent they relate to the zzso response and are therefore inherent to zzso zzso Full characterization of potential vascular zzso is required for accurate zzso about the zzso system under zzso To investigate the extent of vascular zzso evoked activity was studied in humans with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly repeated (1 zzso visual stimuli were delivered using a stimulation paradigm that minimized zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso experiments showed substantial remaining zzso The smallest stimulus separation zzso zzso resulted in significant response broadening zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso duration zzso with respect to a linear zzso The substantial slowing and widening of the response in the presence of preceding stimuli suggest a vascular rather than zzso origin to the observed zzso This was confirmed by the zzso data, which showed no significant zzso zzso interactions between stimuli as little as 200 zzso zzso The presence of substantial vascular zzso has important implications for rapid zzso studies by zzso and other imaging zzso that zzso zzso activity from zzso zzso
