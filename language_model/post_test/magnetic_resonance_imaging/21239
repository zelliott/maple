zzso is the most common zzso primitive zzso tumor found in zzso It has a tendency to recur at a primary or distant zzso The mechanism underlying the regulation of the recurrence of zzso remains largely zzso Recently, several reports have described that cancer zzso cells zzso can be identified and isolated in zzso The authors therefore attempted to demonstrate the correlation between the biological features of zzso zzso and its zzso 

The data used were obtained in five consecutive patients with zzso who subsequently experienced tumor recurrence from 2004 to zzso The authors performed the zzso zzso to analyze the expression of zzso zzso proliferation features, and zzso status of zzso in primary and zzso zzso 

Of the five patients, two had recurrence at the primary site and three had a distant zzso zzso markers such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed regardless of primary or zzso zzso All the five tumor specimens had a high proliferation index zzso The zzso was even higher in the group of patients after recurrence at a distant site zzso while the zzso remained almost the same after primary zzso The zzso zzso and zzso cells were significantly increased in zzso zzso at both the primary and distant sites, whereas zzso in primary zzso showed much lower zzso features zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso of zzso and their recurrence might be related to zzso More zzso zzso in zzso zzso worse zzso
