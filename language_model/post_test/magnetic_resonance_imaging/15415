This study was designed to test whether zzso zzso zzso supplementation has zzso effect in aged, zzso zzso precursor protein zzso 1 zzso single transgenic zzso and zzso mice exposed to zzso injury of the zzso Forty-eight mice (12 each of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Half of each zzso groups zzso per zzso was treated with zzso zzso zzso after zzso injury and the other half with zzso zzso resonance zzso images were used to measure the volume of induced zzso zzso as well as the volume of the zzso and zzso zzso greater volumes of zzso and lesser volumes of zzso on the zzso side were observed in zzso and zzso mice than in zzso and zzso zzso This is consistent with amplification of the effect of zzso in zzso zzso After 28 days of zzso treatment, zzso or zzso zzso have smaller zzso volumes, while the volumes of zzso and zzso on the zzso side were larger than those treated with zzso No differences between zzso and zzso groups in volumes of zzso zzso and zzso were observed in zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso has a protective effect on the brain from zzso and zzso induced by zzso injury in aged and susceptible transgenic zzso
