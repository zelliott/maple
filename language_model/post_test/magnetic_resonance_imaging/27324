zzso functional connectivity in the maturing brains of zzso deletion syndrome zzso may contribute to the expression of early psychotic symptoms commonly reported by these zzso This study's objective was to examine functional connectivity in cerebral networks at rest zzso Networks; zzso and their relationship to symptomatic and zzso characteristics putting them at very high risk factor for developing zzso zzso adolescents with zzso and 33 typically developing control adolescents matched for age, gender and zzso underwent an zzso resting state functional zzso zzso zzso identification procedure employed Independent zzso Analysis zzso We tested for potential group differences in functional connectivity zzso Then, we examined relationships between network connectivity and zzso characteristics in the zzso zzso A total of nine zzso networks were zzso zzso differences suggested both increased and decreased functional connectivity in the zzso group, involving the zzso zzso zzso and high level visual zzso Finally, zzso connectivity in the zzso network, specifically within the left superior frontal zzso region, correlated with zzso symptom intensity and zzso performances in the zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso functional connectivity may sustain both increased vulnerability to psychosis and characteristic cognitive zzso in zzso
