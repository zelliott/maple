We sought to assess the impact of zzso zzso burden zzso on the association between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mortality in patients with zzso zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we sought to determine the impact of gender on survival benefit with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

Single US zzso care zzso 

zzso patients with significant ICM who underwent delayed zzso between 2002 and zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso mortality and cardiac zzso 

zzso of 450 consecutive patients, over a mean of zzso years, identified 186 zzso Cox zzso hazard zzso was used to evaluate associations among zzso gender and zzso with respect to zzso death as the primary zzso zzso were implanted in zzso zzso zzso On multivariable analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso Gender zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were independent zzso of mortality after adjusting for multiple zzso An interaction between zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated significant differential survival with zzso based on zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that men with larger zzso had significant survival benefit with zzso but men with smaller zzso derived limited benefit with zzso zzso However, the inverse relationship was found in zzso 

zzso is a powerful independent predictor of mortality in patients with and without zzso zzso In addition, zzso may predict zzso significant differences in survival benefit from zzso in patients with severe zzso
