An zzso using zzso regions of interest zzso to detect differences between sessions in Blood zzso zzso zzso signal is proposed and results from a zzso study are reported zzso It is important to know whether tests for change have the desired statistical properties, zzso low zzso between sessions and unbiased zzso rates, under zzso conditions so one is confident in any conclusions based on the metric and test zzso This study examined three cognitive tasks: zzso response zzso zzso digits, and a zzso finger tapping task, in 20 healthy zzso Each subject had two zzso sessions, one week zzso A series of zzso zzso was constructed by choosing different proportions of zzso from the zzso and calculating the mean of zzso values for the selected zzso The choice of zzso was based on the magnitude of the zzso values, selecting the maximum value, then the top zzso and so on until all zzso in the zzso were zzso No zzso were found to have significant differences between sessions based on paired comparison zzso zzso Generally, the observed zzso rates were near the expected rates for all zzso and tasks, although the zzso and Response zzso tasks did have higher zzso rates when zzso zzso for some zzso zzso This study indicates results are zzso and also have the desired statistical properties under zzso zzso
