If the thickness and zzso area of the zzso muscle group are related in children with cerebral zzso zzso of muscle thickness may be used to monitor changes in muscle size due to training or zzso in these zzso We assessed the zzso and reliability of zzso of zzso zzso using the zzso area of the muscle group as the zzso zzso zzso Muscle thickness was measured using zzso and zzso area using zzso in nine children with zzso cerebral zzso zzso with zzso zzso reliability of the zzso zzso was assessed in six healthy zzso All zzso were made on both legs at zzso lower leg zzso In the children with cerebral zzso zzso zzso and zzso area were well correlated zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the reliability of the zzso zzso was high in the healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso standard error of measurement zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso less in the affected compared to the zzso leg in children with zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso area was zzso less in the affected compared to the zzso leg zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso can be reliably zzso and they reflect zzso zzso area in children with cerebral zzso
