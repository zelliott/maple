McArdle disease is a zzso zzso that classically zzso with zzso pain from zzso zzso weakness may occur from the fifth decade and is typically mild and located around the shoulder zzso 

We describe a zzso man with zzso pain from a young age and a zzso history of weight loss and an elevated zzso zzso level up to zzso zzso On examination, he was severely zzso and weak in his shoulder zzso and the entire zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging confirmed that the zzso zzso was completely converted to zzso A muscle biopsy zzso was zzso with a lack of zzso and multiple large zzso with zzso A zzso zzso test demonstrated a lack of increase in zzso together with an exaggerated ammonium zzso zzso testing verified the suspicion of McArdle zzso 

This is a highly zzso presentation of McArdle disease with severe zzso wasting and zzso We suspect that this is related to the unusual amount of zzso zzso and stress the importance of including McArdle disease in the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso
