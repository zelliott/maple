The temperature responses of five different zzso zzso designs were modeled using simplified engineering equations and zzso The model predicts that the zzso temperature approaches a maximum as an inverse zzso where the maximum temperature is governed by two zzso a local power density and a cooling zzso The power density term is a function of position and is highest where the current paths have minimum zzso and are closely zzso The cooling zzso consists of zzso zzso and zzso components which can be controlled by zzso providing forced zzso zzso having a zzso former with high zzso zzso and thin walls, and zzso varying the zzso of the zzso zzso For a given zzso strength, the average temperature rise is minimized by designing a zzso with a small radius and thick zzso The model predicted the local temperature rise, which is also dependent on the current density, to within 5 degrees C of measured zzso
