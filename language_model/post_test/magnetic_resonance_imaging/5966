The nature of zzso zzso has been one of the central problems in philosophy and more recently in zzso This raises various questions: zzso Can we attribute a self to zzso zzso Do animals and humans share certain aspects of their core zzso yielding a zzso concept of zzso zzso What are the neural processes that zzso a possible zzso concept of zzso zzso What are the zzso aspects and do they result in various levels of zzso Drawing on recent literature from both human and animal research, we suggest a zzso concept of self that is based upon what has been called a zzso which can be described by zzso processing zzso as a specific mode of interaction between zzso and zzso When we refer to specific neural networks, we will here refer to the underlying system as the zzso The zzso provides primordial neural coordinates that represent organisms as living zzso the lowest level this zzso zzso states along with raw emotional feelings zzso the intentions in action of a primordial zzso while higher zzso cortical levels facilitate zzso integration zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allows stimuli from the environment to be related and linked to zzso needs, signaled and processed within zzso structures within zzso zzso structures zzso that provide the foundation for zzso emergence of ecologically framed, higher zzso forms of zzso across different individuals within a zzso These functions ultimately operate as a coordinated zzso We zzso that core zzso operates automatically, is deeply zzso and is zzso and zzso connected to zzso and higher cognitive zzso This zzso is zzso by zzso embedded in visceral and zzso representations of the body that are well integrated with basic zzso emotional and motivational functions that are apparently shared between humans, zzso zzso and perhaps in a zzso form, other zzso Such a zzso concept of zzso zzso is thoroughly biological and affective at the lowest levels of a complex neural network, and culturally and ecologically molded at higher levels of neural zzso It allows organisms to selectively adapt to and integrate with physical and social zzso Such a zzso universal, but environmentally zzso concept may promote novel zzso studies of the zzso across zzso zzso
