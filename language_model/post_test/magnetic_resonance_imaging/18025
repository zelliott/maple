This retrospective study was designed to analyze the relationships between zzso joint zzso disk displacement and skeletal zzso in zzso zzso zzso consisted of 460 adult zzso Before treatment, lateral zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso were zzso zzso were divided into six groups based on zzso zzso according to increasing severity of zzso disk zzso in the following order: bilateral normal zzso unilateral disk displacement with reduction zzso and zzso normal, bilateral zzso unilateral disk displacement without reduction zzso and zzso normal, unilateral zzso and zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso were subdivided zzso into skeletal Class I, II, and III zzso based on the zzso zzso A, zzso point zzso angle and subdivided vertically into zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on the facial height zzso Linear trends between severity of zzso disk displacement and zzso or vertical zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso The severity of zzso disk displacement increased as the zzso skeletal zzso changed from skeletal Class III to skeletal Class II and the vertical skeletal zzso changed from zzso to zzso There were no significant differences in the linear trend of zzso disk displacement severity between the sexes according to the skeletal zzso This study suggests that subjects with skeletal Class II and/or zzso zzso have a high possibility of severe zzso disk zzso regardless of zzso
