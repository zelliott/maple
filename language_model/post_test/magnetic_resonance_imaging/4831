zzso aging zzso and mild cognitive impairment zzso are zzso groups of zzso To explore the zzso the functional connectivity was studied in these zzso 

The present study zzso functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate default mode network zzso in 8 healthy subjects of zzso 8 subjects of usual aging zzso and 8 zzso patients during verbal zzso tests zzso zzso connectivity (based seeds) of different groups was analyzed by using statistical zzso 

Compared with zzso and zzso groups, zzso subjects exhibited decreased functional connectivity in the zzso regions, including the inferior zzso zzso and left angular zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Compared with zzso and zzso groups, the zzso elderly exhibited increased functional connectivity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

These findings suggested that abnormalities of functional connectivity in zzso might be related with semantic memory impairment in zzso Left angular zzso and zzso might be the potential zzso zzso for distinguishing zzso process of zzso
