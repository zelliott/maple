The blood zzso dependent zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso has been zzso simulated by calculating single zzso zzso However, the observation on single zzso signals cannot provide information regarding the spatial distribution of the zzso Specifically, a single zzso zzso signal simulation cannot answer the fundamental question: is the magnetic resonance zzso image a replica of its zzso magnetic zzso zzso In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a zzso zzso zzso zzso simulation model and a zzso expression formula for linear zzso zzso process, that allow us to examine the zzso zzso procedure from zzso zzso to MR image zzso 

Since zzso technology only senses the zzso property, we represent a linear zzso zzso state by a magnetic zzso expression formula, which accounts for the parameters of cortical zzso zzso blood zzso level, and local zzso Upon the zzso expression of a zzso state, we carry out zzso zzso zzso simulation by calculating the zzso zzso by zzso zzso and the complex zzso MR image (by zzso zzso Given the zzso zzso source and the calculated complex MR image, we compare the MR magnitude zzso zzso image with the zzso zzso source (the calculated zzso by spatial zzso 

The spatial correlation between the MR magnitude image and the magnetic zzso source is about zzso for the settings of TE zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso size zzso 100 zzso vessel radius zzso 3 zzso and blood volume fraction zzso zzso Using these parameters value, the spatial correlation between the MR phase image and the zzso zzso is close to zzso 

Our simulation results show that the MR magnitude image is not an exact replica of the magnetic zzso source zzso correlation zzso zzso and that the MR phase image zzso closely with the zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso
