zzso of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso disease zzso is now possible by heavily zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso obtained 4 hours after intravenous zzso administration of single dose zzso contrast medium zzso Although maximum enhancement has been reported 4 hours after contrast administration in healthy volunteers, the timing of optimal enhancement in patients with MD is not zzso We investigated if that optimal timing is earlier or later than 4 zzso 

We evaluated 10 consecutive patients with suspected MD whom we randomly divided into 2 zzso We obtained zzso before zzso administration and 10 zzso zzso hours, and 4 hours after zzso administration in Group A and before and 10 zzso 4 hours, and zzso hours after zzso administration in Group zzso We compared signal intensity ratio zzso values of the zzso and zzso between zzso and 4 hours in Group A and between 4 and zzso hours in Group B and evaluated grades of zzso at zzso and 4 hours in Group A and at 4 and zzso hours in Group zzso 

zzso values did not differ significantly between zzso and 4 hours in Group A and between 4 and zzso hours in Group zzso However, zzso values at 4 hours were significantly higher in Group A than Group zzso zzso of zzso agreed between zzso and 4 hours in Group A and between 4 and zzso hours in Group zzso 

The optimal timing of contrast enhancement in patients with suspected MD remains zzso but evaluation of zzso may be possible from zzso to zzso hours after contrast zzso
