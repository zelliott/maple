The zzso pressure zzso is a zzso important zzso for diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making in patients with zzso 

So far there is no standard method to zzso assess the zzso Various approaches to obtain the zzso zzso or zzso are discussed and the clinical application of a magnetic resonance imaging zzso method to estimate zzso zzso is demonstrated in a group of pediatric patients with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso drainage and zzso zzso fluid zzso flow were zzso using zzso imaging to derive the zzso 

A total of zzso with zzso zzso treated with shunt placement or zzso underwent zzso on a zzso scanner applying zzso zzso phase contrast zzso Of the patients six had clinical symptoms indicating increased zzso (age zzso mean zzso and nine patients had no clinical signs of elevated zzso (age zzso mean zzso all treated with shunt or zzso Median zzso in symptomatic patients was zzso zzso zzso zzso 75th zzso zzso Median zzso in patients without acute signs of increased zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso 75th zzso zzso Group differences were significant zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso technique is a promising zzso tool for zzso zzso 

Further studies in larger patient zzso are warranted to investigate its application in children with zzso
