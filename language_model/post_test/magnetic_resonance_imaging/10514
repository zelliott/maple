The zzso is often active in imaging studies of verbal working memory, consistent with a putative role in zzso zzso While patients with zzso damage occasionally exhibit a mild impairment on standard zzso tests of working memory, these tests are not diagnostic for exploring these processes in zzso The current study was designed to determine whether damage to the zzso is associated with zzso on a range of verbal working memory tasks, and if so, under what zzso Moreover, we assessed the hypothesis that these zzso are related to impaired rehearsal zzso Patients with damage to the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a selective deficit in verbal working memory: spatial forward and backward spans were normal, but forward and backward verbal spans were lower than zzso While the differences were zzso zzso spans were relatively zzso especially in comparison to the dramatic reductions typically observed in classic zzso zzso patients with zzso brain zzso The patients tended to be more impaired on a verbal version compared to a spatial version of a working memory task with a long delay and this impairment was correlated with overall symptom and zzso zzso These results are consistent with a contribution of the zzso to rehearsal and suggest that inclusion of a delay before recall is especially zzso in individuals with zzso zzso However, when we examined markers of rehearsal zzso zzso and zzso suppression zzso in an immediate serial recall task, we found that qualitative aspects of the patients' rehearsal strategies were zzso We propose that the zzso may contribute to verbal working memory during the initial zzso zzso and/or by strengthening memory traces rather than by fundamentally zzso covert zzso zzso
