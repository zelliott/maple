Loss of zzso control zzso zzso is common in zzso the cause is usually zzso zzso imaging has revealed the brain network controlling responses to zzso zzso zzso changes in this network might zzso to urge zzso We sought such changes in 10 continent, healthy women aged zzso years who underwent zzso while fluid zzso 20 zzso was repeatedly infused into and withdrawn from the zzso Data were collected in 4 measurement blocks with progressively increasing zzso volumes and were analyzed by zzso using the contrast zzso to zzso response to zzso zzso zzso connectivity was examined by zzso interaction zzso see interpretation in zzso zzso with right zzso zzso and zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso as seed zzso zzso on age and zzso volume zzso block zzso was zzso zzso infusion evoked expected zzso zzso decreased with age in bilateral zzso and zzso zzso revealed connectivity with zzso and zzso in regions that included bilateral zzso and R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to increase with age in regions including L zzso L zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a special role in maintaining zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso showed a trend to zzso on zzso infusion that became more prominent in old age, and a trend to negative interaction zzso that weakened significantly with zzso Thus, with increasing age, weaker signals in the zzso control network as a whole and/or changes in zzso function or connecting pathways may be responsible for the development of urge zzso
