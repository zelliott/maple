zzso with a family history of alcoholism zzso are at risk for developing an alcohol use disorder zzso and some studies indicate that zzso individuals show deficits in executive zzso The ability to make zzso decisions is one aspect of successful executive functioning that is often measured during risk-taking zzso however, this behavior has not been examined in zzso zzso As impaired decision-making could zzso zzso youth to make poor choices related to alcohol use, the current study examined the neural zzso of risk-taking in zzso adolescents and their family history negative zzso zzso 

Thirty-one (18 zzso 13 zzso youth between 13 and 15 years old were included in this zzso All youth had used little to no alcohol prior to study zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine the neural zzso of risk-taking during the zzso of Fortune zzso decision-making task zzso et zzso 2004) in zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso youth did not differ from zzso youth in risk-taking behavior, but showed less brain response during risky decision-making in right zzso prefrontal zzso and right zzso regions compared with zzso zzso 

Despite no behavioral differences on the zzso decision-making task, zzso youth exhibited zzso neural response during risk-taking compared with zzso zzso zzso brain activity, in regions implicated in executive functioning could lead to reduced cognitive control, which may result in risky choices regarding alcohol zzso This could help explain the higher rates of zzso seen in zzso zzso Further examination of risky behavior and associated brain response over the course of adolescence is necessary to characterize the vulnerabilities of zzso youth in the absence of alcohol zzso
