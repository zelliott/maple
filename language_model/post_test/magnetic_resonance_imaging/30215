zzso zzso zzso is a neurological disease characterized by increased zzso fluid volume and pressure that is often associated with impaired cognitive zzso By and large, zzso is a complex and zzso zzso fluid zzso disorder where the exact site of brain insult is zzso Several mechanisms including neural zzso fiber stretch, and local or global zzso have been implicated in the underlying zzso of zzso Specifically, the zzso which plays a significant role in memory processing and is in direct contact with expanding zzso zzso may be zzso Using our model of chronic zzso we zzso the density of vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and blood vessels in zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell populations were estimated for zzso animals zzso weeks zzso zzso weeks) and surgical controls zzso Overall, we found approximately zzso to zzso increase in the cellular density of zzso and more than double blood vessel density zzso in the zzso of zzso compared with zzso There were no significant regional differences in zzso cellular and zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly related to changes in zzso volume zzso and not zzso pressure zzso The zzso was significantly greater in zzso than SC zzso and was significantly correlated with zzso zzso These results showed that zzso zzso a profound increase in zzso in zzso that corresponded to increased zzso It was unclear whether increased zzso and blood vessel expression was related to focal zzso alone or in combination with global zzso conditions as previously zzso These findings suggest that zzso may play an zzso role in zzso after zzso zzso zzso of vascular zzso growth zzso may be important in developing treatments for hypoxic conditions including zzso and other forms of cerebral zzso
