We developed and tested a novel zzso zzso zzso technique to reduce zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso for secondary zzso zzso exploits the proximity of the coronary zzso to the zzso zzso but is limited by zzso zzso and coronary artery zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso is guided by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso fused with live zzso A coronary zzso zzso zzso a short segment of the zzso zzso zzso to re-enter the right heart where it is exchanged for a zzso zzso is applied zzso during imaging and secured with a zzso zzso 

We found 2 feasible zzso pathways from the great cardiac vein across the zzso zzso to create zzso Right zzso zzso re-entry required shorter zzso times than right zzso zzso which entailed a longer zzso zzso but did not cross the zzso zzso zzso tension progressively reduced zzso zzso diameter, but not zzso zzso or regional zzso zzso A simple zzso device protected zzso coronary arteries from zzso even during zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso fraction (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso by slice tracking zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso size but preserved zzso zzso zzso also displaced the zzso zzso toward the zzso zzso zzso introduced zzso constraint to the left zzso zzso tract and zzso zzso that enhanced leaflet zzso A sample of human coronary zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggested that most have suitable zzso anatomy for zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso acutely reduces zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso coronary arteries can be zzso zzso provided insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso
