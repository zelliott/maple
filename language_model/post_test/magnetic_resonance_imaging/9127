To determine regional and global left zzso zzso functional parameters and to perform zzso wall thickness zzso and motion zzso analysis of zzso CT zzso with zzso zzso resolution versus zzso 

30 patients with known or suspected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso and cardiac zzso underwent zzso and zzso The zzso and MR images were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes, stroke volume zzso ejection fraction zzso and zzso mass zzso as well as zzso wall zzso and zzso zzso applying the zzso model were obtained and statistically zzso 

The mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated zzso zzso Altman analysis revealed little systematic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and little zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso reconstruction time points correlated well zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso The zzso wall thickness obtained by zzso and zzso showed close correlation in all segments zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso In 413 segments zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were equally zzso whereas zzso tended to underestimate the degree of wall motion zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso resolution enables regional and global zzso function analysis as well as zzso zzso analysis in good correlation with zzso However, the degree of zzso impairment is slightly underestimated by zzso
