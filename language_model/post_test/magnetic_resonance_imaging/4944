zzso functional connectivity zzso zzso analyses have identified intrinsic neural networks supporting zzso cognitive functions including language, attention, executive control and zzso The brain, however, also has a zzso organization, including regions that contribute to zzso and knowing about others (the zzso zzso or zzso objects designed to perform specific functions (the zzso zzso These zzso and zzso systems, however, might not constitute intrinsic neural networks per se, but rather only come online as needed to support retrieval of zzso information during zzso or zzso cognitive zzso To address this issue, we functionally localized two regions in lateral zzso zzso activated when subjects perform zzso and tool conceptual zzso We then compared the strength of the correlations with these seed regions during zzso Here, we show that the zzso and zzso neural networks are maintained even when subjects are not engaged in zzso and zzso information processing, and so constitute intrinsic zzso neural zzso
