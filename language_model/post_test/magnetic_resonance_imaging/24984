To assess the potential advantages of using a zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso for magnetic resonance zzso brain zzso zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers were enrolled in an zzso controlled, zzso crossover comparison zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso were randomly injected during two separate treatment zzso For zzso comparison of effectiveness zzso zzso zzso brain zzso MR imaging was performed under identical conditions for both zzso zzso and qualitative evaluations were zzso zzso between the two zzso zzso were evaluated at analysis of zzso and tested for statistical significance zzso zzso with a zzso zzso 

Use of zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significantly smaller zzso zzso at half maximum signal intensity decrease, a smaller mean peak time, a higher contrast and zzso ratio between gray and white matter, and significant increases in both maximum change in zzso relaxation rate zzso and differences in peak enhancement in gray matter among all volunteers zzso zzso In white matter, increases in zzso zzso zzso and in differences in peak enhancement zzso zzso were smaller and not significant zzso zzso zzso map analysis revealed improved quality and superior contrast in relative regional cerebral blood flow zzso zzso and mean transit time zzso zzso The lack of difference regarding relative regional cerebral blood volume maps was consistent with the use of the same dose of each zzso zzso 

Brain zzso images obtained with zzso zzso zzso were superior to those obtained with zzso zzso zzso in healthy volunteers examined with the described MR imaging zzso
