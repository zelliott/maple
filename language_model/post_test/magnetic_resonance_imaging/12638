zzso functional imaging of the human Superior zzso zzso has often been regarded as difficult because of the small size of the SC and its proximity to sources of zzso zzso zzso An zzso approach to functional imaging of the SC with zzso is zzso based upon the novel finding that zzso zzso responses in the SC are zzso different from responses in both cortical zzso and zzso zzso comparison zzso An zzso model with a zzso Response zzso zzso which zzso early zzso zzso and then falls rapidly is shown to be best suited for revealing SC responses, while a model zzso at 6 s and falling more slowly was most sensitive in the two comparison zzso Additionally, a method of correcting for the noise characteristics of zzso responses proposed recently by de zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso van zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated noise in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 59, zzso is modified for use in the zzso and shown to be highly effective at further improving the statistical zzso of responses by zzso out zzso Together these methods represent a significant advance over previous approaches to functional imaging of the human zzso They permit the routine detection of strong SC activity in single subjects at standard spatial zzso
