To define the zzso levels of zzso fractures by using magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso analysis in experimental zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were evaluated with MR imaging in 28 zzso zzso and 28 zzso zzso of 22 immature zzso The zzso zzso level of injury was graded as zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zone or zone of provisional zzso zzso sections from 23 specimens were studied to assess zzso We assessed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In all MR studies, the injury was visible as a zzso of signal intensity lower than the signal intensity of the zzso zzso zzso extension, seen in 18 zzso of 28 fractures, was more frequent in the undulating central part of the zzso zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In 20 of 23 zzso MR imaging and zzso findings had excellent correlation for the detection of fracture level and zzso 

The course and level of injury within the cartilage in zzso zzso can be defined with MR zzso Extension into the zzso zzso a potential risk factor for growth arrest, is zzso with MR zzso MR imaging and zzso findings correlate zzso
