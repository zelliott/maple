zzso zzso exposed to large pressure zzso zzso or zzso 90 zzso zzso and low frequency zzso or zzso 500 zzso zzso noise for long term periods zzso zzso can develop zzso disease zzso One of the earliest complaints of zzso patients deals with memory and attention zzso On the other hand, in over 50% of these patients, magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso revealed cortical zzso and zzso of the zzso spaces, and small zzso zzso in zzso of the cerebral white matter, zzso zzso and zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is any relationship between these zzso changes and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Sixty zzso workers with more than 10 zzso of zzso noise exposure were studied using brain zzso and zzso zzso A careful neurological examination had been previously performed on all of zzso 

The neurological examination revealed abnormalities in zzso the most common finding being the archaic zzso zzso Some 37 subjects had zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso and zzso white matter, the zzso zzso and the zzso Comparing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso values, zzso and topography, obtained in these 37 subjects with the data from the 23 who did not have any zzso changes in zzso we found a strong correlation between the brain zzso zzso and the zzso changes zzso zzso zzso 

These results are important for understanding the zzso of the cognitive impairment found in zzso zzso
