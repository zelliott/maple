Early protection of zzso cartilage, before degenerative changes appear on zzso should result in better long-term results, but scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of zzso transplantation is zzso 

To assess the zzso effects of a new zzso zzso transplantation animal model and evaluate a magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso in zzso cartilage after zzso and zzso zzso 

Controlled laboratory zzso 

zzso zzso mature sheep were placed into 3 surgical groups: lateral zzso zzso zzso 24), zzso zzso transplant zzso zzso 17), and sham zzso zzso zzso Animals were sacrificed at 2, 4, or 12 zzso zzso was assessed by gross inspection, magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso zzso testing, and zzso zzso zzso 

There were no differences between the sham operation and zzso control zzso Compared with control zzso zzso resulted in significant increases in cartilage zzso by all objective criteria zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso transplantation resulted in significant decreases in cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso There were significant correlations between zzso data and all other traditional outcomes measures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso control zzso zzso transplants demonstrated no significant differences at 2 months in any category, except magnetic resonance imaging zzso By 4 months, zzso control limbs demonstrated significantly less wear compared to zzso limbs in all categories except modified zzso zzso 

This model demonstrated significant zzso compared with zzso but demonstrated more cartilage wear at 4 months compared to control zzso A high degree of zzso cell viability and vascular zzso was seen in zzso zzso zzso mapping may provide an accurate zzso measure of early cartilage zzso after zzso as well as cartilage protection after zzso zzso zzso 

This study establishes a reliable animal model for zzso zzso transplantation and provides evidence for the utility of zzso mapping at clinically relevant magnetic resonance imaging field strengths for evaluation of early cartilage zzso
