zzso brain imaging and zzso studies have suggested differential involvement of expressive zzso cortical regions based on the zzso versus semantic characteristics of verbal zzso The aims of this study were: 1) to zzso the relative timing of the activity of inferior frontal and anterior insular versus motor and supplementary motor zzso during a zzso task and 2) to assess potential differences in the location or timing of activity in anterior and zzso language areas based on letter versus category zzso Using magnetic source imaging zzso we found significantly earlier onset zzso and a greater number of activity sources in motor and supplementary motor compared with inferior frontal and anterior insular zzso We also observed greater left versus right zzso asymmetry of zzso for letter compared with category zzso This study provides new insights into zzso interactions during expressive language zzso
