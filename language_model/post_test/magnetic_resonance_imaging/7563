Ewing zzso and zzso represent the two most common primary bone zzso in childhood and adolescence, with bone zzso being the most adverse zzso zzso In prostate cancer, zzso zzso poses a major clinical zzso We developed a zzso zzso model of Ewing zzso reflecting the biology of the zzso interactions in human disease and allowing in zzso monitoring of disease zzso and compared this with models of zzso and prostate zzso Human zzso cell lines were transplanted into non-obese zzso combined zzso zzso and zzso mice by zzso zzso For Ewing zzso minimal cell numbers zzso injected in small volumes were able to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso progression was studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso and their interactions with bones were examined by zzso Each zzso induced bone destruction and outgrowth of zzso zzso masses, together with characteristic changes in bone that were well zzso by zzso zzso which correlated with zzso zzso Ewing zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso cells induced prominent zzso new bone zzso zzso cells produced zzso and zzso zzso bone within the zzso mass zzso zzso of prostate zzso cells led to zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging of Ewing zzso zzso allowed easy and rapid monitoring of zzso growth and detection of zzso dissemination to zzso liver and zzso zzso resonance imaging proved useful for monitoring soft tissue zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be of limited use in this zzso Overall, we have developed an zzso in zzso model for Ewing zzso and other primary and secondary human bone zzso which resemble the human zzso We have shown the utility of small animal zzso for tracking disease zzso making this model a useful zzso for zzso drug zzso
