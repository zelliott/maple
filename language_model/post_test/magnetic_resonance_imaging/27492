This work demonstrates the first whole brain zzso spatial zzso zzso MR zzso imaging in bipolar disorder zzso The in zzso zzso is validated by a phantom containing 5 zzso zzso salt using the identical zzso sequence and imaging zzso This study is the first demonstration of the zzso distribution in the brain of bipolar disorder patients on zzso therapy using a zzso MR zzso imaging zzso The results show that brain zzso level is strongly correlated with serum zzso zzso The zzso zzso ratios for the average brain and the local maximum were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso distribution is found to be zzso throughout the brain for all patients, which is somewhat unexpected and highly zzso This uneven distribution is more evident in subjects at a higher therapeutic serum zzso zzso This finding may suggest that zzso targets specific brain zzso and/or certain zzso and zzso sites that are associated with therapeutic zzso Further investigations of bipolar disorder patients on zzso therapy using zzso zzso MR zzso imaging are zzso
