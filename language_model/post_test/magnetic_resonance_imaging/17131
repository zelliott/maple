The purpose of this article is to present the zzso features of zzso zzso of the breast, thus enabling zzso to better determine zzso zzso of biopsy results and appropriate patient zzso 

A retrospective review of zzso records between 2003 and 2009 identified 123 zzso zzso with the zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso Of these, 83 cases were excluded either because zzso zzso was not the primary zzso diagnosis, or because there were associated zzso abnormalities that may have contributed to contrast zzso The remaining 40 zzso with a primary zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso were included in our zzso Their zzso and zzso features were examined and zzso 

The zzso included five zzso 23 masses, and 12 areas of zzso zzso The prevalent features of the masses were size smaller than 1 zzso zzso zzso round or oval shape zzso zzso irregular or zzso margins zzso zzso rapid or medium rate of initial contrast zzso zzso zzso and plateau or zzso zzso zzso zzso Most zzso zzso showed zzso enhancement zzso and linear distribution zzso Many of these features were suggestive of zzso zzso of 40 cases zzso had zzso confirmation by zzso or zzso confirmation of zzso No zzso cases have been identified to zzso zzso correlation showed the presence of zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso vascular channels in zzso of cases, which may lead to increased contrast enhancement on zzso 

zzso zzso has widely variable zzso features, often mimicking breast zzso It may represent an acceptable benign zzso diagnosis on zzso zzso needle biopsy for the described zzso zzso
