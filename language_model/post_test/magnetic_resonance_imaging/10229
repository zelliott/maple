The association of zzso and spinal zzso such as zzso zzso partial zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been described in the zzso zzso cases, however, are mainly zzso or zzso with an extremely rare presentation of zzso zzso 

A case of zzso zzso with an zzso extension and zzso component and the clinical outcome following surgical treatment are zzso 

To our knowledge, among the reported zzso cases with an zzso extension and zzso zzso our case has a distinguishing feature regarding the involvement of the zzso zzso It is also the first case, showing no neurological deficit during the zzso zzso 

A zzso female infant presented with a 30 zzso 30 zzso 10 zzso zzso mass covered with normal zzso The mass contained an zzso zzso hard and mobile material accompanying zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed a total closure zzso of the first and second zzso zzso and a subcutaneous mass with zzso zzso The zzso was found to penetrate the zzso zzso through an extended exposure from zzso to zzso There was no firm attachment of the zzso zzso component of the zzso Total removal of the tumor was zzso 

The patient was discharged on day 7 without any neurological deficit or sign of zzso The pathological examination showed a benign zzso containing mature cartilage, muscle, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 2 years showed no recurrence or neurological deficit and a normal zzso zzso zzso evaluation was within normal zzso 

Accompanying a spinal zzso state, the mature zzso in our case may support the idea of a tumor actually arising from a zzso and growing outward to produce the zzso
