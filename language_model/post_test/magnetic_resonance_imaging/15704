To evaluate if different patient characteristics influence performance of zzso tagging (a new MR zzso zzso technique to label stool to avoid zzso zzso and, zzso MR image zzso 

A total of zzso patients zzso age zzso 61 zzso underwent zzso with zzso zzso Four segments of the large zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed as for the presence of zzso stool zzso which can impede an assessment of the zzso zzso Ratings were correlated with patients' characteristics including patient age zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and acceptance levels for zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using a zzso zzso 

A total of zzso zzso segments were zzso Among them, zzso segments zzso did not contain any visible stool zzso zzso reduced image quality was found in 61 segments zzso Best image quality was found in the zzso colon zzso value zzso zzso while image quality of the ascending colon turned out to be worst zzso value zzso zzso zzso tagging effectiveness showed a reverse correlation with patient zzso However, all other characteristics did not have a statistically significant influence on zzso tagging zzso 

zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso tagging led to diagnostic image quality in zzso of all zzso zzso Since tagging results were significantly decreased in patients zzso or zzso years, tagging protocols should to be modified in this group, zzso by increasing the time zzso of tagging zzso
