zzso zzso by magnetic resonance imaging can guide the timing for zzso in minimally symptomatic or zzso patients with pulmonary zzso after corrected zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a marker of zzso dysfunction and wall stress, and levels may complement magnetic resonance imaging in cardiac assessment before and after pulmonary valve zzso 

Between May 2004 and October 2005, 23 consecutive patients with corrected zzso severe pulmonary zzso and right zzso zzso volume index greater than 150 zzso underwent zzso pulmonary valve zzso Plasma zzso levels and magnetic resonance imaging were obtained before and 6 months after pulmonary valve zzso 

There was no surgical mortality or zzso zzso right zzso zzso volume index correlated with pulmonary zzso and zzso so with left zzso ejection zzso reflecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 6 months zzso zzso zzso zzso log zzso was zzso correlated with right zzso ejection zzso Mean zzso zzso levels, right zzso zzso volume index, and pulmonary zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso diminished 6 months after pulmonary valve replacement zzso versus 114 zzso 184 versus 109 zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso is elevated in patients with corrected zzso severe pulmonary zzso and right zzso zzso and it significantly diminishes 6 months after pulmonary valve replacement, mirroring magnetic resonance zzso better right zzso ejection fraction and smaller right zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging for cardiac assessment in patients requiring pulmonary valve zzso Future validation of zzso levels are required to establish zzso as a useful diagnostic and follow-up tool in patients with chronic pulmonary zzso and failing right zzso
