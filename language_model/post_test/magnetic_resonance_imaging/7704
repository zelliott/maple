To evaluate zzso zzso zzso volume and zzso analysis on magnetic resonance imaging zzso compared with diameter zzso 

zzso zzso was undertaken in 44 patients, 20 of whom were followed by zzso after zzso All patients underwent zzso inversion recovery zzso acquisitions and dynamic contrast zzso zzso diameters in three zzso directions were measured to obtain the largest and mean zzso zzso reconstruction of zzso was generated from two zzso STIR sequences and fused with acquisitions after contrast medium zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso of diameter and volume zzso was zzso zzso size variations in diameter and volume after zzso and contrast enhancement before zzso were compared in patients with clinical success or zzso 

zzso zzso were similar for diameter and volume zzso at baseline and follow-up zzso zzso Higher percentages of size reduction after zzso were observed with volume zzso than with diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement values were estimated at zzso and zzso in patients with clinical failure and success respectively zzso 

zzso zzso volume was as zzso as diameter measurement and more sensitive in detecting therapeutic zzso Patients with better clinical outcome tend to have stronger zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resonance imaging readily demonstrates diameters and volumes of zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter calculations are zzso in zzso the size of zzso zzso zzso But zzso models of zzso are more sensitive in detecting therapeutic response zzso Dynamic enhancement is also better assessed with automated zzso software zzso zzso analysis of zzso offers promise to guide therapy and assess zzso
