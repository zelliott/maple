Dynamic cerebral zzso zzso is impaired following zzso However, the relationship between zzso brain zzso and functional outcomes following stroke remains zzso In this study, we aimed to determine whether impairment of zzso is associated with zzso in specific regions or globally, thereby affecting daily functions in stroke zzso performed a retrospective analysis of 33 subjects with chronic zzso in the middle cerebral artery territory, and 109 zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed via the phase relationship between zzso blood pressure and cerebral blood flow zzso Brain tissue volumes were zzso from zzso zzso status was assessed by gait speed, instrumental activities of daily living zzso modified Rankin zzso and zzso Stroke zzso to the zzso group, stroke subjects showed zzso zzso zzso and showed gray matter zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso In stroke subjects, better zzso was associated with less zzso lobe gray matter zzso on the zzso side zzso see zzso faster gait speed zzso see zzso and lower zzso score zzso see zzso Our results indicate that better dynamic cerebral zzso regulation is associated with less zzso and better long-term functional status in older adults with chronic zzso zzso
