The majority of previous zzso studies have demonstrated both structural and zzso functional abnormalities in adolescents with online gaming addiction zzso However, few functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies focused on the regional intensity of spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygen zzso zzso during the resting state and fewer studies investigated the relationship between the abnormal zzso properties and the impaired cognitive control zzso In the present study, we employed the zzso of low frequency fluctuation zzso method to explore the local features of spontaneous brain activity in adolescents with zzso and healthy controls during zzso zzso adolescents with zzso and 18 zzso zzso and zzso healthy volunteers participated in this zzso Compared with healthy controls, adolescents with zzso showed a significant increase in zzso values in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso the left zzso the left supplementary motor area zzso the right zzso zzso zzso and the bilateral middle zzso zzso zzso The abnormalities of these regions were also detected in previous addiction zzso More importantly, we found that zzso values of the left zzso zzso and left zzso were positively correlated with the duration of zzso in adolescents with zzso The zzso values of the left zzso zzso were also correlated with the zzso zzso test zzso Our results suggested that the abnormal spontaneous zzso activity of these regions may be implicated in the underlying zzso of zzso
