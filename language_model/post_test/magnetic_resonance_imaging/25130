This prospective study was aimed at evaluating the clinical impact of magnetic resonance imaging zzso vs conventional zzso in the early diagnosis of acute wrist zzso The influence of zzso on the period of being unable to work was zzso 

zzso was performed within a mean of zzso days after initial zzso in 54 patients zzso zzso with clinical suspicion of wrist fractures and normal plain or zzso zzso zzso findings were read without knowledge of the initial zzso 

In 31 of 56 zzso zzso findings resulted in a change of zzso There was a false positive diagnosis on plain zzso in nearly one-half ( zzso of the zzso only six cases had false negative zzso In 28 cases zzso allowed the detection of additional injuries of soft zzso In 35 of 56 cases zzso follow-up was no longer zzso In 22 of 54 patients the period of zzso could be shortened or treatment discontinued ( zzso The period of being unable to work was shortened in 16 of 54 patients, while in 7 of 54 patients this time span had to be prolonged for therapeutic zzso In 31 of 54 patients zzso therapeutic consequences had no influence on the period of being unable to zzso 

Our results show a high clinical impact of zzso in the detection of acute wrist zzso Early zzso is able to reduce economic costs due to efficient therapeutic treatment and shortened periods of being unable to zzso We recommend zzso immediately on the day of trauma in the presence of clinical suspicion and zzso plain zzso
