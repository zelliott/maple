zzso fourth zzso arch anomalies are uncommon entities, zzso described only in case reports, affecting primarily children, and typically presenting as a cervical inflammatory zzso The aim of the study was to collect appropriate data on the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of this condition and to suggest guidelines for its zzso 

We conducted a structured review of the literature for cases explicitly identified as zzso fourth zzso arch anomalies or meeting anatomical criteria for this zzso We zzso descriptive statistics and performed several post hoc zzso comparisons of zzso of zzso 

We located and critically evaluated 526 zzso Fourth arch anomalies were usually located on the left zzso and generally presented as acute zzso zzso zzso or zzso neck zzso zzso zzso swallow and direct zzso were the most useful diagnostic zzso Treatment options differed mainly in recurrence zzso incision and zzso zzso open neck surgery and tract zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tract zzso zzso and open neck surgery with partial zzso zzso zzso after surgery occurred primarily in children 8 years or zzso 

Fourth arch anomalies are more common than once zzso Treatment of these disorders with repeated incision and drainage yields high rates of zzso thus, complete zzso of the entire zzso tract during a zzso period appears zzso Combining this surgery with partial zzso may further decrease recurrence zzso zzso can likely be minimized by using zzso treatment of acute infections or zzso zzso in children 8 years or younger, and delaying open neck zzso
