The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between zzso disk zzso and bone zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed to evaluate zzso disk zzso according to Thompson's zzso zzso 1 and 2, normal zzso grades 3, 4, and 5, zzso zzso and bone mineral density zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was measured by zzso X-ray zzso for 90 women zzso years zzso The relationship between the grade of zzso disk zzso and the zzso ( Z zzso was analyzed in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso women, zzso was significantly higher at all measured sites in the zzso disk group judged at the zzso level than in the normal disk group ( P zzso zzso In zzso women, zzso was significantly higher at the zzso zzso lateral zzso and zzso in the zzso disk group judged at the zzso level than in the normal disk group ( P zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso was significantly higher in the zzso disk group judged at the zzso level than in the normal disk group ( P zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso of not only the zzso zzso but also the zzso and radius was mutually related to zzso zzso disk zzso from an early stage of zzso
