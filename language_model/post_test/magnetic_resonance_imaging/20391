Recently, the technique of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been developed to depict zzso artery zzso We aimed to compare the vessel wall properties between symptomatic and zzso zzso middle cerebral arteries zzso using zzso 

We studied 26 patients with symptomatic and 35 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso and zzso were performed on each zzso The zzso images of zzso wall on zzso were compared between the two zzso 

The degree of zzso zzso was similar between the two groups zzso vs zzso zzso On zzso eccentric plaques were observed in 26 zzso symptomatic and 28 zzso zzso zzso In the remaining seven zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Compared with the zzso group, symptomatic zzso zzso had a larger wall area zzso greater zzso ratio zzso higher prevalence of expansive zzso zzso expansion of the vessel wall) zzso and lower prevalence of zzso zzso zzso 

Different vessel wall properties on zzso were observed between symptomatic and zzso zzso zzso Further prospective studies are required to investigate whether zzso is a helpful tool in zzso stroke risk in patients with zzso zzso zzso
