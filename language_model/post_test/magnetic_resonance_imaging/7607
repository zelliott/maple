Mechanical forces play an important role in the zzso of vulnerable zzso This process is often associated with cardiovascular zzso such as heart attack and zzso In this study, magnetic resonance imaging zzso models were used to investigate the association between plaque wall stress zzso and coronary artery disease zzso zzso zzso zzso data of coronary plaques from 12 patients were used to construct 12 three-dimensional zzso zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso Six of the patients had died from zzso and six had died from zzso zzso zzso was assessed using all zzso points on the zzso surface of each zzso The maximum zzso from all possible vulnerable sites of each plaque was defined as the zzso critical plaque wall stress zzso Mean zzso zzso in the zzso group was zzso higher than that in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no statistically significant difference in global maximum plaque wall stress zzso between the two groups zzso There was also no statistically significant difference in plaque burden between the zzso group zzso and the zzso group zzso zzso The results indicate that plaques from patients who died from zzso were associated with higher zzso compared with those from patients who died from zzso zzso With further zzso analysis of zzso may prove to be an important component in assessment of plaque zzso
