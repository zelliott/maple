The study compared the results of three centrally zzso zzso zzso sequences for zzso imaging zzso The sequences were conventional zzso zzso with zzso of zzso effects, and zzso with correction for zzso effects during the imaging period zzso The relative merits were studied with respect to image quality and accuracy by computer simulation and by experimental validation on zzso and on in zzso rat zzso A zzso zzso of the diffusion zzso ranging from zzso zzso approximately 200 zzso to zzso zzso approximately 1 zzso was found to exist for the conventional zzso Image artifacts, caused by zzso relaxation during the imaging period, are reflected in calculated diffusion zzso When the correction sequence is used, the artifacts and the systematic errors are reduced but zzso relaxation during the delay between preparation and imaging periods remains large enough to induce significant errors zzso for zzso approximately 200 zzso to zzso for zzso approximately 1 zzso The zzso sequence eliminates the influence of zzso effects on the zzso but leads to identical artifacts for all zzso zzso
