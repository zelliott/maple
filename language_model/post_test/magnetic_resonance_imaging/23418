zzso cerebral zzso on zzso such as white matter zzso zzso zzso and zzso are commonly seen in older zzso We examined the role of a series of candidate genes involved in blood pressure regulation and zzso zzso 

The study was embedded in a zzso cohort sampled from a Dutch genetically isolated zzso We selected individuals between 55 and 75 years of age with hypertension zzso Volumes of zzso and presence of zzso and zzso were assessed with zzso We studied three genes involved in blood pressure regulation zzso zzso II type 1 zzso zzso and two genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso E zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso 

All participants had zzso zzso volume, zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso carrying two copies of the zzso zzso of four single zzso zzso zzso located at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly more often zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

The association of zzso with zzso suggests that the zzso cascade is involved in the zzso of zzso in populations with zzso
