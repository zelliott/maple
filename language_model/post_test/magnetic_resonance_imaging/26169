Dynamic zzso MR imaging may be used to zzso tissue fractional blood volume zzso and zzso zzso We tested this technique in patients with brain tumors to assess whether these zzso correlate with tumor zzso zzso 

Twenty-two patients with newly diagnosed zzso underwent MR imaging followed by zzso Imaging consisted of one zzso and six dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition in the steady state data sets after administration of a single dose zzso zzso of contrast zzso Signal intensity changes in blood and tissue were zzso analyzed using a zzso zzso model, yielding estimates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso tumor specimens were scored on a zzso scale (1 zzso low grade, 4 zzso high zzso 

zzso examination revealed one grade 1, eight grade 2, seven grade 3, and six grade 4 zzso zzso values ranged from zzso to zzso zzso values ranged from zzso to zzso with a strong correlation zzso zzso zzso to tumor zzso Despite some overlap between the zzso values of specific tumors from different grades, differences in the mean were statistically zzso There was a weak correlation zzso zzso zzso between estimated zzso and tumor grade, and no statistically significant difference among zzso values in any of the zzso 

This relatively simple method of analysis provides quantitative estimates of zzso and zzso zzso in human brain tumors, with the zzso being zzso of zzso zzso The technique can be easily implemented on clinical scanners and may prove useful in the assessment of tumor biology and in therapeutic zzso
