The anterior zzso may appear to slope downward in a lateral direction on zzso magnetic resonance zzso images of the zzso We sought to determine the significance of this finding as a marker of rotator cuff zzso 

MR studies of 58 subjects zzso with zzso 32 with zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was compared to standardized zzso zzso made on MR zzso zzso zzso of the anterior zzso and distance of the zzso joint from the superior zzso and clinical zzso 

zzso zzso for lateral zzso was fair zzso zzso zzso One reader's assessment of lateral zzso of the zzso correlated with standardized MR zzso zzso lateral zzso of the zzso did not, however, correlate with zzso 

The zzso finding of a zzso zzso zzso on zzso MR images, while partially validated by standardized zzso is not zzso of zzso zzso
