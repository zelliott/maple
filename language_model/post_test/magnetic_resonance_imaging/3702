The feasibility of functional zzso zzso zzso to assess zzso functional connectivity zzso has already been zzso However the zzso of zzso zzso has rarely been zzso In the present study, zzso and zzso data were simultaneously acquired from 21 subjects during the resting zzso After the spatial correspondence was established between the two imaging zzso by transforming the zzso data into zzso zzso space, the index of zzso zzso of zzso was evaluated across multiple spatial zzso First, the zzso between the bilateral primary motor zzso was quite similar between zzso and zzso for all the subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Second, zzso zzso zzso maps zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso showed higher zzso similarity than zzso zzso maps zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso Finally, for the first time, we combined zzso and graph theory to investigate zzso properties of zzso brain zzso The zzso zzso zzso and characteristic path length zzso which are the most important network zzso zzso both showed high zzso similarities zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso In zzso the zzso results across all the spatial scales demonstrated that zzso is capable of providing comparable zzso measures to zzso and thus provide direct evidence for the zzso of the optical brain connectivity and the optical brain network approaches to functional brain integration during resting zzso
