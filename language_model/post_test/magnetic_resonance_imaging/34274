Fat suppression is commonly used in magnetic resonance zzso imaging to suppress the signal from zzso tissue or detect zzso zzso Fat suppression can be achieved with three zzso fat zzso zzso imaging, and zzso zzso zzso of a fat suppression technique should depend on the purpose of the fat suppression zzso enhancement vs tissue zzso and the amount of fat in the tissue being zzso Fat zzso is recommended for suppression of signal from large amounts of fat and reliable acquisition of contrast zzso zzso The main drawbacks of this technique are sensitivity to magnetic field zzso zzso artifacts, and zzso when used with zzso zzso zzso imaging allows homogeneous and global fat suppression and can be used with zzso zzso However, this technique is not specific for fat, and the signal intensity of tissue with a long zzso and tissue with a short zzso may be zzso zzso imaging is a fast and readily available zzso This method is recommended for demonstration of zzso that contain small amounts of zzso The main drawback of zzso imaging is zzso in the detection of small tumors embedded in fatty zzso
