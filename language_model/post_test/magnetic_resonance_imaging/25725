Fast spin echo zzso images were compared with conventional images in 46 patients with zzso spinal disease to determine their accuracy in the detection and zzso of zzso 

The images were interpreted by two zzso who read zzso A total of zzso blinded readings formed the basis for this zzso A gold standard for each patient was selected, based on the blinded readings of the conventional zzso 

In the zzso plane, the zzso sequences were found to have an accuracy of zzso and zzso for the first reader and zzso and zzso for the second zzso For the zzso plane, the corresponding figures were zzso and zzso for the first reader and zzso and zzso for the second zzso These figures compared favorably with conventional zzso Similar zzso of zzso was noted in zzso of zzso In the remaining cases, there were no significant zzso 

Because of these findings, zzso sequences appear as accurate as conventional zzso In this study, they were capable of supplanting conventional sequences in the evaluation of zzso pathology of the spine in the zzso plane, although conventional sequences were still preferred in the zzso zzso
