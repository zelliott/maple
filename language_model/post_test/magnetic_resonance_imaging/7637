The systematic investigation of zzso contrast in zzso is important to better interpret the influence of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso derived zzso zzso Recently, a novel zzso approach called the zzso zzso zzso zzso which enables the study of zzso contrast in zzso arising from arbitrary zzso zzso in zzso has been zzso However, the zzso has lower efficiency in simulating water diffusion especially for complex zzso In this work, an improved zzso approach that combines the zzso with a zzso finite difference method zzso which we call the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed in order to efficiently investigate the influence of vascular and zzso zzso features on zzso zzso zzso The current work provides a framework for better interpreting how zzso data depend on various phenomena, including contrast agent leakage in zzso zzso and water diffusion zzso In addition, we illustrate using simulated and zzso extracted tissue structures the improved zzso along with its potential applications and zzso
