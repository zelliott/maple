zzso to multiple sclerosis zzso after zzso zzso and zzso has been thoroughly zzso however, limited data are available regarding conversion to zzso after a clinically isolated syndrome of the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate conversion to zzso in patients with zzso 

Fifty-one patients with zzso were zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso determination of zzso bands zzso in the zzso fluid zzso and evoked zzso zzso were zzso Based on conversion to zzso at zzso the sensitivity, zzso accuracy and positive and negative zzso values of these tests were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso developed in 18 zzso patients after a mean follow-up of 37 zzso zzso zzso criteria showed a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso zzso criteria showed a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso zzso criteria showed a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso The presence of zzso in the zzso showed a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso No differences for zzso parameters were found between patients who did and those who did not convert to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso criteria and the presence of zzso in the zzso are associated with a higher risk of conversion to zzso in patients with zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso has the greatest sensitivity of all zzso zzso zzso criteria have greater specificity (although less than previously published for mixed zzso of clinically isolated zzso in predicting conversion to zzso for zzso than either zzso or zzso zzso
