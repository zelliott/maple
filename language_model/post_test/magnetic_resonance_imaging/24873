Recent research describes the use of a nerve root zzso sign to diagnose zzso spinal zzso zzso The lack of zzso of the nerve roots zzso zzso zzso to the zzso part of the zzso zzso is the characteristic feature of this new zzso zzso 

To demonstrate how the nerve root zzso sign compares with other more traditional zzso parameters in patients who have been operated for zzso 

A retrospective chart and image zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance images zzso were reviewed from 71 consecutive operative patients who presented with zzso and received spinal zzso surgery from 2006 to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were reviewed for each zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso levels from zzso to zzso were measured for: zzso sign, zzso area zzso and zzso zzso diameter of the zzso zzso thickness of the zzso zzso and zzso grade of facet zzso zzso zzso were made using zzso zzso software zzso zzso New York, NY, zzso zzso analyses were performed using the zzso zzso statistical software zzso zzso Chicago, zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated using zzso zzso tests and zzso zzso Study funding was zzso There were no zzso conflicts of zzso zzso 

A positive zzso sign was determined in 120 operated levels zzso whereas 14 levels zzso had no sign zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso and zzso diameter were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for the zzso zzso the mean zzso and zzso diameter were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for the zzso sign group zzso We found that zzso of levels with zzso Grade A facet zzso did not have a zzso sign, whereas zzso of levels with Grade B, zzso of levels with Grade C, and zzso of levels with Grade D did have a zzso sign zzso 

The zzso sign is a new measurement tool that can enable physicians to zzso assess and zzso spinal zzso The sign is most often present in patients who have clinically significant zzso zzso and require zzso
