The purpose of this research was to compare insulin sensitivity in zzso and zzso whites without a family history of diabetes to establish whether insulin resistance is a zzso zzso related to subjects of Mexican zzso 

In study A, we compared insulin sensitivity in 12 Mexican-American and 12 zzso white women with normal zzso tolerance and no family history of zzso In study B, we compared insulin sensitivity in two groups of normal zzso zzso nine with a positive zzso and nine with a negative zzso family history of zzso In both studies, the groups were closely matched for age, total body fat content, and fat zzso zzso sensitivity was assessed with the zzso insulin clamp (20 zzso surface zzso which was performed in combination with zzso zzso infusion and indirect zzso Total fat mass and zzso mass zzso were assessed by a zzso water dilution technique, and regional fat distribution was evaluated by zzso and magnetic resonance zzso 

During a zzso zzso insulin clamp zzso zzso rates zzso zzso of total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was suppressed similarly in both zzso During a zzso zzso insulin clamp zzso B), zzso with zzso had lower rates of zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso disposal than subjects with zzso suppression of zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar in both zzso 

These results indicate that in the absence of a family history of zzso diabetes zzso Mexican-American women are not less sensitive to insulin than zzso white zzso
