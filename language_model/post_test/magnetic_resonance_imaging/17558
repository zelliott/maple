zzso blood flow and zzso are important zzso parameters known to be affected by pathology and by zzso Limited data on the relationship between these parameters following head trauma is inconsistent with regard to whether these parameters are zzso Data on the relationship between these parameters in the healthy state is not readily available due to a lack of zzso means to measure these important zzso A recently developed zzso zzso method for simultaneous measurement of total cerebral blood flow and zzso pressure was applied to establish the relationship between zzso and zzso values in healthy zzso Seventy-one simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso were obtained from 23 healthy young zzso These results demonstrated that zzso values span over a much zzso range compared with zzso The relationship between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggest that in the healthy state and in rest these parameters are not zzso
