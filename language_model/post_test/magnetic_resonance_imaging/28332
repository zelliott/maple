zzso of porous limestone is a frequent problem observed when this kind of stone is used as floor zzso From a chemical point of view, this zzso originates from a reaction between zzso zzso and zzso released by the fresh mortar and absorbed by the stone and the organic elements always present in this kind of zzso Up to now, no other zzso of this phenomena has been zzso zzso and zzso showed that, in addition of the chemical zzso zzso by the zzso content of the stone, another factor had to be taken into zzso the drying process of the zzso A French limestone zzso zzso sample has been saturated by zzso and its drying has been monitored by zzso zzso zzso results were compared with the weight loss zzso The results have clearly shown the existence of two different stages in the drying zzso The first stage zzso to a constant drying rate period, and the second is zzso by a falling drying zzso zzso zzso led us to a better understanding of the physical meaning of these two zzso During the first one, evaporation occurs on the external faces of the zzso During the second one, evaporation occurs inside the zzso We concluded that the physical key factor in the problem of zzso was the amount of water evaporated during the first stage of zzso
