zzso resonance imaging zzso offers a zzso technique for studying neurodegenerative events in the rat brain, however, most of the studies are performed on small bore purpose dedicated MR scanners of limited availability and at high zzso The present study explored the feasibility of using a clinical whole body zzso to perform imaging in rat brain and specifically in models of Parkinson's zzso and zzso disease zzso For that purpose rats were placed into a specially designed zzso device equipped with a flexible surface zzso zzso spin echo sequences were acquired on a zzso zzso Vision at zzso zzso In the experimental protocols of zzso and zzso animals underwent zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso injections, respectively and were subsequently grafted with fetal zzso zzso images showed a small zzso area at the zzso zzso site and a diffuse zzso in the zzso with zzso zzso zzso were seen as a zzso area surrounded by a zzso rim on zzso zzso Moreover, disturbances of the zzso and its time of restoration could be zzso In conclusion, high-resolution in zzso imaging of small animals is feasible with clinical zzso and hence allows the study of various experimental zzso
