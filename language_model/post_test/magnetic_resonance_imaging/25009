We administered zzso zzso to adult, male cats to model Parkinson's disease zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso at a field strength of zzso T to identify zzso degenerative changes in the zzso in zzso zzso status and zzso zzso in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Nine cats were equally divided into three groups and treated daily for 10 days as zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso plus zzso The zzso cats displayed zzso head zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a diffuse increase of the zzso signal in the zzso of two zzso zzso Analysis of the MRS zzso indicated significantly lower zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratios than the control zzso Two zzso cats had low zzso zzso ratio, whereas a zzso peak was present in all zzso zzso In the zzso of the zzso zzso there was a significant decline of zzso zzso zzso and zzso evidence for a diffuse zzso zzso zzso with zzso attenuated the zzso clinical signs, zzso and MRS changes, and the zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is a sensitive, zzso measure of neural toxicity and zzso zzso of the zzso in a zzso model of zzso
