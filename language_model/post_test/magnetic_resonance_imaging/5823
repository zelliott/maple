To identify the maximum tolerated dose and zzso toxicity of zzso zzso in patients with relapsed or resistant zzso zzso who are facing imminent zzso 

For this phase I study, a starting dose of zzso zzso of zzso zzso administered through a zzso needle was given with zzso escalation at a rate of zzso zzso according to zzso up to a maximum dose of 2 zzso Two courses separated by 2 weeks were zzso Plasma levels of zzso were measured by zzso liquid zzso in patients with available intravenous zzso 

Seven eyes of five patients were treated with a total of 14 courses of zzso zzso Only mild zzso zzso occurred, and grade 1 vomiting developed in the first patient that was controlled with zzso for the following zzso zzso toxicity was not reached and the maximum tolerated dose was set at the target dose of 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso systemic exposure was lower than 55 zzso zzso h and it correlated zzso with dose in this small zzso Even though the study was not designed to assess response, one eye was preserved after a partial response, but the remaining six were zzso either after a short period of disease stabilization followed by further therapy with other agents in five patients or by rapidly progressive disease in zzso 

The dose limiting toxicity was not zzso Up to 2 zzso of zzso zzso could be given zzso but further studies are necessary to determine its effect on zzso zzso number, zzso
