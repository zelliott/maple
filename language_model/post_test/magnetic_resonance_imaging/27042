We present a zzso zzso robotic assistant system for zzso zzso valve replacement under zzso guidance in a beating zzso This is a minimally invasive procedure that is currently performed manually inside the zzso zzso A robotic assistance system that zzso an interactive real-time zzso system, a robotic arm with a newly developed robotic valve delivery zzso as well as user zzso for the physician to plan the procedure and manipulate the robot, would be advantageous for the zzso An zzso arm with hands-on cooperative interface was used as a device zzso A compact zzso compatible robotic delivery module was developed for delivering both zzso and zzso zzso A compact zzso that can be placed close to the volume of interest and requires a single image plane was used for zzso robot zzso The system provides different user zzso at various stages of the zzso We present the development and evaluation of the components and the system in zzso zzso
