zzso complexes have unique chemical characteristics compared with typical organic complexes, and have recently attracted much interest because of the expanding need for new zzso zzso For example, magnetic resonance imaging zzso permits zzso three-dimensional imaging inside opaque organisms, and zzso zzso zzso complexes have become important tools as zzso contrast zzso However, most of them are zzso and report solely on zzso zzso responsive zzso contrast agents, so-called zzso zzso contrast agents whose ability to relax water zzso is greatly enhanced by recognition of a particular zzso have great potential for zzso biological zzso On the other hand, zzso complexes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes have excellent zzso properties for biological applications, zzso long zzso lifetime of the order of milliseconds and a large zzso shift of zzso zzso Their zzso zzso is especially suitable for zzso zzso because the interference from short-lived background zzso and scattered light rapidly zzso to a negligible level after a pulse of zzso light is applied, and the zzso light can be collected after an appropriate delay zzso These zzso zzso complexes have already found commercial use as highly sensitive zzso zzso in zzso and homogeneous zzso This paper reviews our research on the design and synthesis of responsive zzso zzso and zzso zzso for advanced zzso
