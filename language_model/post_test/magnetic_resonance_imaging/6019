Neck remnants and aneurysm zzso are marked limitations of zzso treatment of cerebral artery zzso We compared the evolution of neck remnants of experimental zzso rat zzso after treatment with either zzso or zzso zzso 

We created 20 standard-size zzso in the abdominal zzso of male zzso zzso zzso were zzso with either zzso coils or platinum zzso with care taken to leave a neck zzso Neck remnant size and shape was closely monitored to detect progressive enlargement or zzso Using a zzso T MR zzso we acquired high-resolution MR images 6 times during the zzso zzso For quantitative zzso we used a high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso were verified by zzso and zzso 

zzso treated with zzso coils zzso on average, a zzso reduction of neck remnant size zzso zzso zzso and significant disappearance of dog zzso the zzso spaces between coils and aneurysm zzso The zzso treated with platinum coils lacked these zzso In zzso zzso was found to cover both zzso and platinum coils but was more often incomplete or translucent in the platinum zzso In zzso zzso organization and inflammatory cell zzso were higher with zzso 

Use of zzso coils was followed by a moderate progressive reduction of the neck remnant size and a better zzso outcome, seen as disappearance of dog ears during zzso The rat model proved to be suitable for comparison of different zzso zzso
