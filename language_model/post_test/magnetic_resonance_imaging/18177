zzso is associated with insulin resistance zzso and zzso zzso the link between zzso and zzso could be relevant to chronic clinical zzso The objective of this study was to zzso assess zzso deposition zzso zzso mass, zzso and composition zzso of zzso zzso zzso and mean chain zzso zzso in zzso of zzso mice, a genetic model of obesity and mild diabetes, and zzso zzso control animals in a zzso manner using zzso zzso at zzso For accurate zzso intensity values were corrected for differences in zzso values while zzso effects were considered minimal due to the long zzso values zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were derived from zzso zzso signal zzso of lipids and water zzso zzso zzso signals were compared with zzso plasma insulin, zzso and zzso zzso zzso significant correlations between zzso and zzso plasma zzso levels were found in adolescent zzso zzso A similar correlation was found between zzso and zzso plasma insulin zzso however, the correlation between zzso and zzso plasma zzso levels was less obvious in adolescent zzso zzso These correlations were lost in adult zzso zzso The study showed that in adolescent zzso mice, there was an obvious link between zzso zzso in the liver and plasma zzso zzso This correlation was lost in adult animals, probably due to the limited zzso storage capacity of the zzso
