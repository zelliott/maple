zzso tumors represent an independent entity among zzso zzso These tumors affect the kidney zzso zzso tumor of zzso and central nervous system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but may also be found in peripheral soft zzso zzso features include zzso characteristics and zzso of the putative tumor zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso Several familial cases have been published and summarized under the term zzso tumor predisposition zzso In all of the published familial cases, zzso of zzso was detected in tumor zzso 

We report on a family with three children, two of which were affected by zzso tumors, one zzso the other an zzso While both children demonstrated typical zzso and clinical features neither the zzso nor the zzso showed evidence for zzso of zzso in molecular studies including zzso and array zzso zzso gene dosage analysis by zzso and zzso zzso for zzso showed normal expression within the zzso of tumor zzso Furthermore, both children inherited different paternal and maternal zzso zzso evidenced by zzso zzso Conventional zzso zzso and zzso analyses lacked evidence for zzso aberrations or gross zzso changes in the zzso 

We thus demonstrate a family with zzso tumor predisposition syndrome without linkage to zzso This finding indicates that other zzso than zzso below the resolution of array zzso are involved in the origin of these zzso Our data impact on the clinical counseling of affected families and warrant further studies in the molecular biology of these enigmatic zzso
