zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso magnetic stimulation zzso are well-established tools for investigating the human motor system zzso We here studied the relationship between zzso zzso signal changes in the primary motor zzso zzso and zzso properties of the hand motor area assessed with zzso zzso in 17 healthy zzso The zzso showing the highest zzso zzso response in the left hand motor area during right hand movements was identified for each individual zzso This zzso peak zzso in zzso served as spatial target for zzso positioning during zzso zzso We performed correlation analyses between zzso zzso zzso signal estimates and effective connectivity parameters of zzso assessed with dynamic zzso modeling zzso The results showed a negative correlation between the zzso zzso signal in left zzso and resting as well as active motor threshold zzso obtained for left zzso The zzso analysis revealed that higher zzso of left zzso was associated with a stronger zzso between left supplementary motor area zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso activity in left zzso correlated with zzso silent period zzso zzso the stronger the zzso zzso response in left zzso the higher zzso zzso effects targeting right zzso zzso analyses revealed a positive correlation between the zzso of left zzso with left zzso and the duration of zzso The data show that zzso parameters assessed for the hand area of zzso do not only reflect the intrinsic properties at the stimulation site but also interactions with remote areas in the human motor zzso
