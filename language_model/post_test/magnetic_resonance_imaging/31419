The zzso joint is an example of an zzso articulation commonly affected by zzso zzso The relationship between zzso zzso angle and the development and progression of zzso zzso is zzso The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the zzso zzso angle at baseline and zzso cartilage volume at baseline and at zzso follow-up among community based adults with established knee zzso 

One hundred subjects had magnetic resonance imaging of their symptomatic knee at baseline and at zzso zzso From these images, zzso cartilage volume was zzso zzso skyline views of the zzso joint were taken at baseline to measure the zzso zzso zzso 

For every 1 degrees increase in the zzso zzso angle zzso as the zzso angle became more zzso there was an associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso cartilage volume at baseline zzso There was a similar trend that approached statistical significance between the zzso zzso angle and the lateral zzso facet cartilage volume at baseline zzso There was no association between the zzso zzso angle at baseline and the change in zzso cartilage volume over 2 years in either zzso zzso 

These results zzso that the zzso zzso angle is a zzso zzso of the amount of zzso cartilage, but is not a major zzso of the annual change of zzso cartilage volume among people with knee zzso These data suggest that a zzso zzso in the context of established zzso may be an advantageous anatomical zzso Further zzso studies are required to determine the role of the zzso zzso angle in zzso
