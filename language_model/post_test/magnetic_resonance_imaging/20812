The measurement of zzso tissue zzso zzso in zzso requires expensive imaging methods not accessible to most clinicians and zzso The study aim was to derive mathematical models to predict total AT zzso and zzso from total body fat derived from a zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso 

Models were developed to predict magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso subcutaneous zzso visceral zzso and zzso AT from zzso total body fat zzso using zzso data zzso 0 zzso and validated results using 1 zzso and 2 zzso y follow-up zzso zzso were 176 multiethnic healthy children ages zzso y at zzso Twenty-two were measured at zzso and zzso zzso was compared with zzso 

At zzso zzso was greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso that varied by zzso zzso mean zzso were not different from measured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso relationship was not influenced by race or zzso 

In general, the prediction equations for zzso and zzso were consistent with the measured values using zzso and zzso zzso
