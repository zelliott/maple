To investigate the relationship between the peak zzso of the characteristic zzso peak of 2 zzso zzso zzso and the degree of zzso zzso in magnetic resonance imaging zzso after zzso or intravenous zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso 

An academic university zzso 

One hundred zzso ears in which zzso zzso was performed and zzso space size was evaluated by zzso zzso patients were examined zzso and 38 patients were examined zzso 

zzso space size was evaluated by zzso after zzso or intravenous zzso zzso 

zzso space size was classified into three groups: none, mild, and significant in the zzso and in the zzso The relationship between the degree of zzso zzso and peak zzso of 2 zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

The peak zzso in 94 ears in which significant zzso zzso was observed on zzso in the zzso and/or the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The peak zzso in 21 ears in which mild but not significant zzso zzso was observed on zzso in the zzso and/or the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The peak zzso in 13 ears with no zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The peak zzso in ears with significant zzso zzso was larger than that observed in ears with no zzso zzso However, the peak zzso was not significantly different between cases of mild and absent zzso zzso 

Large peak zzso in zzso zzso was associated with significant zzso zzso
