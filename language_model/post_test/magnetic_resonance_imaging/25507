The zzso zzso wall has been assumed to be stationary during zzso The present study examines this assumption in order to assess whether zzso zzso in the zzso region can be zzso from zzso of the anterior zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance images and X-ray images were examined to determine whether the zzso zzso wall from the upper zzso to the upper zzso shows anterior movement that can be attributed to variables in speech: vowel quality in both English and zzso zzso versus consonants as classes of speech zzso sustained versus zzso produced zzso and isolated words versus zzso zzso were made of the distance between the anterior portion of the zzso body and the zzso zzso The first measurement was on a line zzso the junction between the zzso and the body of the second cervical vertebra zzso The next three zzso were on lines at the inferior borders of the bodies of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso showed very little movement of the zzso zzso wall, none of it attributable to speech zzso zzso the position of the zzso zzso wall in this region can be eliminated as a zzso and the anterior portion of the zzso alone can be used to estimate vocal zzso
