We wanted to assess the MR imaging findings of zzso zzso and zzso and we wanted to find clues for making the differential diagnosis between zzso 

The MR images of 12 zzso proven zzso and two zzso were zzso with a focus on the internal architecture, signal intensity and zzso 

All the tumors appeared as zzso zzso except for a single zzso zzso mass and a single solid zzso The previously reported characteristic MR findings of zzso (a zzso zzso mass with a zzso solid component containing small zzso zzso were found in only zzso of the tumors zzso zzso or partial zzso of the zzso wall with zzso signal intensity without a zzso solid component was as common as the previous reported findings zzso Two zzso showed more prominent solid portions with higher zzso zzso and stronger enhancement than did the zzso 

zzso or partial zzso of the zzso wall with zzso in zzso zzso masses may suggest zzso zzso and this type of appearance may be as common as the previously reported characteristic zzso A prominent solid component with a higher zzso intensity and strong enhancement are the typical findings of zzso
