To investigate the efficacy of the sole core zzso surgery for the treatment of zzso zzso head zzso 

The model was established by administration of steroids in combination with horse zzso The rabbits with bilateral zzso head zzso were randomly selected to do the one side of core zzso The other side was used as the zzso zzso zzso and western zzso techniques were used to measure the local expression of zzso and zzso Bone zzso from control and operation groups were zzso analyzed by zzso zzso The comparisons of the local expression of zzso and zzso and the bone zzso were further analyzed between different groups at each time zzso 

The expression of zzso in the zzso zzso head with or without zzso was significantly lower than that in normal zzso zzso expression both showed the decreasing trend with the increased zzso zzso No significant difference of zzso expression occurred between zzso head zzso with and without zzso The zzso expression in the zzso head zzso with and without core zzso both was significantly higher than that in zzso Its expression pattern showed a significantly increased trend with increased the zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference of zzso expression between the zzso head zzso with and without zzso at each time zzso zzso analysis revealed that new zzso bone and a large number of zzso were observed in the zzso zzso head zzso with lateral zzso at zzso after surgery, but there still existed zzso bone fractures and bone zzso 

Although zzso takes partial effect in promoting bone zzso in the early treatment of zzso head zzso such an effect does not significantly improve or reverse the pathological changes of zzso head zzso Thus, the long-term effect of core zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso head zzso is not zzso
