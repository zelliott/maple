zzso PET has not yet found a role in the clinical evaluation of the tumor extent of breast zzso zzso PET has been reported to be useful for evaluating the zzso of breast cancer patients with more accuracy than conventional imaging zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of zzso PET and zzso for the zzso assessment of the tumor extent of breast cancer, for evaluating the impact of zzso PET on systemic staging, and also for predicting the prognosis of patients who are candidates for zzso zzso 

The study was a prospective series of 23 breasts with breast cancer that underwent both zzso PET and zzso before zzso zzso staging with zzso PET was also zzso The correlation between the results of these examinations and zzso findings was thus zzso The maximum standardized zzso value zzso of the tumors was investigated in association with the patient zzso 

When evaluating the local tumor extent, the accuracy of zzso PET zzso was significantly lower than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of zzso PET regarding the zzso status were 60, 94, and zzso zzso No patients demonstrated any distant zzso whereas zzso PET gave a false positive in one zzso The mean follow-up period was 61 zzso The zzso value of the worse prognosis patient group was significantly higher than that of the good prognosis patient group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso PET is not a breast imaging zzso for evaluating the local tumor extent, but it is useful for predicting the zzso of patients who are candidates for zzso zzso
