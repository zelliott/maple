Complete motion artifact suppression is possible in abdominal MR imaging with the simple zzso of sequence zzso with no need for special zzso The authors have studied the influence of sequence parameters modification on the zzso relation and on the presence of motion zzso The tested parameters included zzso Time zzso 150 to 2000 zzso Echo Time zzso 20 to 120 zzso and the number of acquisitions, 2 to zzso In zzso zzso the major advantages were offered by the short zzso and short TE association, with many zzso zzso zzso relation and complete motion artifact suppression were thus zzso In zzso zzso TE values had to be changed according to the desired contrast enhancement, and the number of acquisitions could not be increased to more than 2 in order to keep the acquisition time zzso
