As a consequence of neural stimulation the blood zzso dependent zzso contrast in zzso zzso imaging zzso based functional zzso zzso leads to an increased MR signal in activated brain zzso Following this, a zzso signal zzso below baseline is generally observed with zzso The origin of this zzso has been the focus of many investigations using zzso and optical zzso but the underlying mechanisms remain zzso Here, we investigate the zzso zzso following visual stimulation by using a purely zzso zzso sequence at zzso and 3 zzso By taking advantage of the field strength dependency of the zzso zzso contrast and complete absence of zzso zzso effects due to the pure spin zzso one can draw conclusions about the origin of the zzso zzso and test the hypotheses in the zzso We observe a significant zzso at both field strengths, with constant zzso response zzso This provides strong evidence that the zzso is caused by zzso changes due to elevated zzso zzso concentration in the small zzso zzso vascular zzso as suggested by the well-known zzso and zzso models does not appear capable of explaining the zzso Our results also suggest that blood volume changes in zzso and zzso for which there is consistent evidence from optical imaging studies, cannot alone cause the zzso This has important implications for models of zzso response and provides further support for the decoupling of changes in the rate of oxygen metabolism and blood zzso In addition, we found that an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may provide a plausible explanation for the zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso
