People who have zzso from depression are at increased risk for zzso if they rate their relatives as being critical of them on a simple self-report measure of zzso Criticism zzso To explore neural mechanisms associated with this we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine how people with different levels of PC responded to hearing criticism from their own zzso To maximize zzso in affective zzso depressed, recovered depressed, and healthy control participants zzso zzso zzso were classified as high or low in PC based on a median zzso They were then exposed to zzso critical and praising comments from their zzso zzso Criticism levels were unrelated to depression status and to negative mood change after hearing zzso However, compared to low PC participants, those who scored high on PC showed differential zzso in a network of regions associated with emotion zzso and regulation, including increased zzso activity and decreased reactions in prefrontal regulatory regions when they heard zzso This was not the case for zzso Criticism may be a risk factor for zzso because it helps to zzso pathways characteristic of depressive information zzso The zzso Criticism measure may help identify people who are more susceptible to this zzso
