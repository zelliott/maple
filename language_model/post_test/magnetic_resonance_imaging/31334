In this paper, we describe zzso auditory processes that we believe are prerequisite to the linguistic analysis of zzso We discuss biological evidence for these processes and how they might relate to processes that are specific to human speech and zzso We begin with a brief review of zzso the anatomy of the auditory system and zzso the essential properties of speech zzso Section 4 describes the general auditory mechanisms that we believe are applied to all communication sounds, and how functional zzso is being used to map the brain networks associated with zzso auditory zzso Section 5 discusses recent zzso studies that explore where such general processes give way to those that are specific to human speech and zzso
