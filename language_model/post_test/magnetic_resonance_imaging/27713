What is the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso 

zzso displayed an accuracy of zzso in the zzso diagnosis of zzso involvement by deep zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is the best technique for zzso mapping of zzso This preliminary paper shows that zzso zzso is a valuable tool for the zzso evaluation of zzso involvement by zzso 

A retrospective study of an zzso database was used to identify examinations performed in women, who had a clinical suspicion of pelvic zzso zzso between 2005 and 2009 in a university medical zzso in zzso 

zzso criteria were previous surgery for DIE, incomplete surgical zzso repeat zzso examinations and incomplete MR zzso Only symptomatic patients who underwent surgery with a pathological correlation were included zzso An experienced zzso blind to the surgical and zzso findings, evaluated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR images obtained from the 83 zzso 

zzso statistics and Fisher exact test were zzso 

The prevalence of DIE and zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values, accuracy and positive and negative likelihood ratios for the diagnosis of zzso zzso of low signal intensity on zzso zzso pelvic wall involvement and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, with the patient as the unit of zzso zzso AND zzso The study design was retrospective, and thus prone to zzso Only one experienced reader performed the analysis, so no data are available on zzso or zzso zzso zzso At present, no consensus exists on the optimal MR protocol to be used for the evaluation of DIE, thus limiting the wider implications of this zzso 

No funding was obtained for this zzso The authors have no conflict of zzso
