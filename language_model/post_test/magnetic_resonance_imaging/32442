zzso contents empty from the stomach despite frequent changes in body zzso The mechanism that maintains gastric zzso independent of position is poorly zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effects of body position on gastric zzso and motor zzso 

Twelve volunteers were investigated in seated position zzso and upside-down position zzso after zzso of 300 zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging provided a zzso assessment of gastric zzso and volumes, zzso distribution and zzso zzso 

A marked difference in zzso zzso distribution between zzso and SP was present zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso zzso time was similar but zzso pattern was linear in zzso and exponential in zzso zzso was slower in zzso than SP zzso versus zzso zzso p zzso zzso but no correlation was found between zzso frequency and the rate of gastric zzso in either zzso zzso volume response zzso zzso was greater in zzso than SP zzso versus 250 zzso p zzso zzso A correlation was found between gastric relaxation and zzso time in SP zzso but not in zzso 

The stomach maintains the rate of gastric zzso despite radical changes in body position and zzso distribution of gastric zzso In SP, zzso pressure zzso by gastric zzso dictates the gastric zzso In zzso gastric zzso also appears to be zzso by continuous adaptation of gastric zzso These findings provide support for the hypothesis that the mechanism of gastric zzso resembles a zzso zzso rather than a zzso zzso
