There are relatively few studies that compare the use of zzso ultrasound zzso to magnetic resonance imaging zzso to estimate the prostate zzso In this study, we compared the prostate volumes measured with zzso and zzso with a surgical zzso zzso 

zzso patients underwent zzso examination of the prostate prior to radical zzso All specimens were weighed and measured when freshly zzso The corresponding volume zzso calculated using zzso and zzso were compared zzso with the measured volumes of freshly excised zzso 

The volume measured with zzso and zzso was zzso related to the radical zzso zzso The estimated increase in the prostate volumes measured with zzso and zzso per zzso volume was zzso and zzso by zzso analysis, zzso If the prostate volumes were zzso zzso the prostate volumes measured with zzso overestimated the zzso zzso If the prostate volumes were zzso zzso the prostate volumes measured with zzso underestimated the zzso zzso The classic zzso formula was adequate for determining the prostate zzso 

In this study, zzso and zzso gave different zzso zzso is more accurate than zzso for determining the prostate zzso However, because zzso is zzso zzso and almost as accurate as zzso it should be the preferred method for measuring the prostate zzso
