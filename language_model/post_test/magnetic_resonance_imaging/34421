Using zzso field zzso methods combined with magnetic resonance imaging, we calculated the apparent water diffusion zzso D in different zzso components to probe the zzso of normal and diseased arteries by characterizing molecular zzso D was equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in plaque zzso core, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cap, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso Water zzso zzso in the zzso core of the zzso suggesting the absence or destruction of zzso zzso The comparable diffusion zzso in zzso cap and normal media are consistent with similar zzso barriers in both zzso In zzso D varies with the aging processes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso old zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with the zzso of the zzso strands occurring in the early phase and the later zzso zzso Defining an indirect index of zzso zzso zzso zzso and aging, diffusion imaging provides a new nuclear magnetic resonance characterization of zzso
