zzso to recent advances in magnetic resonance zzso imaging, the role of zzso MR imaging has increased in cases in which the results of zzso are zzso Fast MR imaging zzso such as zzso fast zzso zzso zzso zzso fast SE, zzso zzso fast SE, and zzso imaging, have virtually eliminated the need for fetal zzso with a zzso improvement in image resolution and diminished zzso zzso related to maternal respiratory motion and fetal motion no longer limit the zzso detail that can be demonstrated with MR zzso With such advances in zzso MR imaging, knowledge of normal fetal anatomy at MR imaging is essential to detect disease in zzso MR imaging can demonstrate fetal anatomy in detail, especially the brain, zzso abdomen, zzso and zzso Major zzso structures of the zzso particularly the zzso nervous system, zzso and zzso zzso and major abdominal zzso can be adequately evaluated with targeted fast MR imaging as early as the beginning of the second zzso However, MR imaging of the heart remains zzso Fetal MR imaging during the first zzso remains controversial secondary to zzso issues and is limited due to diminutive fetal zzso
