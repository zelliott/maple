The aim of this study was to compare zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the differentiation of various zzso of the major zzso zzso Twenty-two patients underwent zzso zzso imaging, of whom 12 also had CT and 15 also had an zzso zzso The zzso ratio and retention index for zzso and zzso were calculated by drawing regions of interest on the involved and normal zzso Both CT and zzso were interpreted by two zzso All zzso zzso were detected by all three zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso however, zzso failed to differentiate zzso zzso from zzso zzso Of 13 other benign zzso zzso zzso correctly diagnosed zzso Of 16 zzso showing a cold zzso on the zzso images, zzso analysis with zzso gave an accuracy of zzso whereas CT gave an accuracy of zzso zzso was zzso accurate in zzso between benign zzso and zzso zzso We believe that zzso zzso imaging zzso and zzso together with zzso analysis, is the method of choice for zzso between various zzso of the major zzso zzso
