The performance of a zzso zzso zzso zzso for brain imaging at zzso zzso was investigated using a zzso zzso zzso Both the image zzso ratio zzso and the noise amplification zzso in zzso zzso parallel imaging applications were zzso zzso Furthermore, the performance was compared with that of hypothetical coils with one, two, four, and eight elements zzso by combining channels in software during image zzso As expected, both the zzso and zzso improved substantially with zzso Compared to an equivalent zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed a zzso average increase in brain zzso This was mainly due to an increase in zzso in the peripheral brain (an up to zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso increase in the center of the brain was zzso The incremental zzso gains became relatively small at large zzso with a zzso gain observed when zzso was increased from 8 to zzso Compared to the zzso product zzso head zzso zzso increased by close to a factor of 2 in the center, and by up to a factor of 6 in the periphery of the zzso For low zzso acceleration zzso zzso leveled off for zzso and improved only slightly zzso averaged over zzso going from zzso to zzso zzso in g for zzso were larger for higher acceleration rates, with the improvement for zzso averaging zzso
