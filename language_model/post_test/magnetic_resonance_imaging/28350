zzso zzso was evaluated in a rabbit liver zzso model and compared with zzso examining zzso zzso and zzso 

Five New Zealand White rabbits with a liver zzso were studied on a zzso zzso Vision magnetic resonance zzso The disease model was created by surgically zzso a gel capsule filled with zzso into the central or left lobe of the zzso For imaging, the animals were zzso using a Harvard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered to allow acquisition of zzso zzso zzso resonance scans were obtained in each animal on days 2 and 3 after zzso Every animal was studied twice, once after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and once after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The order of injection for the two agents was zzso with the two studies in each animal, separated by 24 hours to permit zzso Image acquisition was performed in each instance with zzso zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso and fast zzso zzso zzso scans were obtained zzso The zzso dimensions were 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging times were 23 seconds for the zzso scan and 26 seconds for the zzso zzso zzso scans, using zzso zzso technique, were obtained at 1, 3, 5, and 15 minutes after contrast injection, whether zzso or zzso was zzso Additional scans were obtained at 30, 45, and 60 minutes after zzso zzso At the completion of imaging on day 3, each animal was killed and the liver was removed and taken to a veterinary pathologist at the University's animal disease diagnostic lab for gross and zzso zzso 

The enhancement of normal liver zzso assessed by region of interest measurement and specifically as zzso - zzso zzso 100, peaked at 119 zzso 37% 1 minute after injection of zzso zzso zzso and at 126 zzso zzso 30 minutes after injection of zzso zzso zzso The difference in enhancement zzso comparing results at each time point, was statistically significant only at 1 and 3 minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso - zzso increased from 272 zzso 29 zzso to a maximum of zzso zzso 73 at 30 minutes zzso using a dose of zzso zzso zzso with the improvement statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso scan was 137 zzso , with the zzso scan markedly superior zzso zzso zzso On scans at 45 and 60 minutes after zzso administration, a progressive increase in signal intensity in the central zzso portion of the zzso was zzso This was most consistent with gradual diffusion of the agent from the adjacent liver into the zzso Using zzso at zzso zzso (three times the dose for zzso zzso zzso increase from zzso zzso 37 zzso to a maximum of zzso zzso 92 at 1 minute zzso with this difference also statistically significant zzso zzso zzso The zzso rim exhibited moderate contrast enhancement, greater than that of normal liver zzso on early zzso images with zzso 

The zzso of an early liver zzso is improved markedly on delayed imaging after administration of zzso zzso zzso Although a similar magnitude of zzso enhancement can be obtained after the administration of an zzso agent, such as zzso zzso dose zzso zzso and early dynamic imaging are zzso The appearance of a liver zzso on late scans zzso to 60 minutes) after zzso injection is distinct from that of zzso zzso with diffusion of the agent into the zzso zzso
