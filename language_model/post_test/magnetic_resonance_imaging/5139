Two crucial sources of information available to an zzso when moving through an environment are visual and zzso zzso zzso cortical area zzso processes visual motion, including cues to zzso arising from zzso flow and also receives information about zzso from the zzso zzso In humans, whether human zzso zzso receives zzso zzso is zzso We have combined 2 techniques, zzso zzso stimulation and functional zzso zzso to show that zzso is strongly activated by zzso stimulation in darkness, whereas adjacent area zzso is zzso The activity cannot be explained in terms of zzso stimulation at the zzso zzso zzso input appears to be confined to the anterior portion of zzso suggesting that zzso as conventionally defined may contain 2 zzso zzso activity was also seen in another area previously implicated in processing visual cues to zzso namely the zzso zzso visual area zzso but not in visual area zzso The results suggest that zzso convergence of cues to zzso occurs in both zzso and zzso
