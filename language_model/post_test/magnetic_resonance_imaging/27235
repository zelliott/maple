To develop and validate the functionality of a novel zzso visual presentation system with a horizontal and vertical zzso angle of zzso for zzso mapping by functional zzso zzso 

The zzso presentation system consisted of a zzso diameter optical zzso an entrance apparatus and a presentation zzso The terminal edge of the optical fiber at the entrance is flat, while the terminal edge on the presentation apparatus is a sphere of 60 zzso in zzso The subjects wore contact zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso to focus on the zzso and the visual field zzso angle could reach zzso The signal to noise ratio valuation experiment was performed to evaluate the clarity and quality of the zzso picture zzso zzso and random dot stimuli were used to prove that this system could be applied to zzso mapping by zzso 

The results of the experiment demonstrated that the system is safe in the zzso environment with minimal distortion and can be used for visual zzso mapping zzso zzso mapping areas zzso zzso were found in the human visual zzso Compared with previous studies, the zzso and zzso surface area approaches but does not fully cover the anatomical zzso Nonetheless, the area achieved using the new system is larger than those achievable in previous zzso zzso 

We developed a zzso low-cost system for presenting zzso visual stimuli in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso mapping results proved the viability of this zzso
