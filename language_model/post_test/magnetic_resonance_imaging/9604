Research has implicated an addictive process in the development and maintenance of zzso Although parallels in neural functioning between obesity and substance dependence have been found, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the neural zzso of zzso eating zzso 

To test the hypothesis that elevated zzso zzso scores are associated with similar patterns of neural zzso as substance zzso 

zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

A university zzso zzso 

Forty-eight healthy young women ranging from lean to obese recruited for a healthy weight maintenance zzso 

The relation between elevated food addiction scores and blood oxygen zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in response to zzso and anticipated zzso of palatable food (chocolate zzso 

Food addiction scores (N zzso zzso correlated with greater zzso in the anterior zzso cortex, zzso zzso cortex, and zzso in response to anticipated zzso of food zzso zzso zzso false discovery rate corrected for multiple comparisons in small zzso Participants with higher zzso zzso zzso vs lower zzso zzso zzso food addiction scores showed greater zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso and the zzso in response to anticipated zzso of food but less zzso in the lateral zzso zzso in response to zzso of food zzso discovery zzso P zzso zzso 

Similar patterns of neural zzso are implicated in zzso eating behavior and substance zzso elevated zzso in reward zzso in response to food cues and reduced zzso of zzso regions in response to food zzso
