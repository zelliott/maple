Various methods have been proposed to calculate a zzso index zzso on the basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Most of them are either based on the extent of the activated brain region zzso the number of zzso zzso or the magnitude of the zzso signal zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of various zzso of these approaches and to identify the one that yields the most robust and zzso zzso zzso was assessed by evaluating the dependence on arbitrary external zzso zzso was assessed by zzso correlation zzso zzso based on active zzso counts at one single fixed statistical threshold as well as zzso based on zzso signal intensity changes zzso based on all zzso in a region of interest) yielded neither robust nor zzso zzso zzso Instead, the zzso of a cognitive function was best described by zzso signal intensity changes where the activity measure was based on signal intensity changes in those zzso in a region of interest that exceeded a zzso zzso zzso However, not all other approaches should be discarded completely since they have their own specific application zzso First, zzso based on active zzso counts in the form of zzso zzso plots zzso can be used as a straightforward measure to describe zzso zzso Second, zzso based on active zzso counts at variable thresholds zzso by the total number of active zzso are a good alternative for big regions of interest since zzso based on signal intensity changes are restricted to small zzso
