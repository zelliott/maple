zzso zzso are highly vascular tumors that arise almost exclusively in the zzso region and produce symptoms that may mimic zzso zzso The purpose of our study was to define the typical MR features of zzso zzso and to determine the value of MR imaging in identifying the zzso establishing its extent, and defining its relationship to zzso zzso 

MR studies performed on 20 patients (13 men and seven zzso mean age, 35 zzso with 24 zzso proven zzso zzso were evaluated zzso for size and location of zzso expansion of the central spinal canal and neural zzso and MR signal characteristics and enhancement zzso zzso (16 zzso zzso zzso (15 zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso sequences were zzso 

In all patients, masses were detected on MR zzso MR imaging defined solitary masses in 17 patients and multiple zzso in zzso Of the 24 tumors, MR imaging characterized 21 as predominately zzso zzso two as zzso and zzso zzso and one as zzso zzso Two zzso had associated zzso zzso occurred most often at the level of the zzso zzso body, and no tumor extended above zzso zzso spanned an average of four zzso zzso MR imaging showed expansion of the spinal canal in five of eight tumors that extended over five or more zzso zzso Two tumors extended into the neural zzso The zzso signal of the tumor was zzso in 12 patients, zzso in three patients, and zzso in one zzso The zzso signal was always zzso All tumors zzso after administration of IV contrast material showed zzso 

MR imaging was valuable in identifying the extent of tumors and in defining their relationship to the zzso zzso Although the MR findings in zzso zzso are zzso the diagnosis can be suggested by a large, intensely zzso zzso zzso zzso mass that extends for several zzso zzso Imaging protocols should examine the entire zzso region and include IV zzso
