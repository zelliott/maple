Our objectives were to further characterize an artifact related to the localized failure of the zzso zzso fat suppression magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso We constructed two zzso simulating human zzso anatomy and zzso them on a zzso MR scanner using zzso and short zzso inversion recovery zzso techniques of fat zzso The first phantom resembled orbit structural zzso it was zzso in zzso and zzso planes and in varying zzso with respect to the main magnetic field zzso zzso to study the features of the artifact and to reproduce the asymmetry seen in clinical zzso We designed the second phantom to enable zzso of the change in artifact size with change in zzso We zzso the orbits of a normal human volunteer in similar planes and zzso and compared the results to clinical cases demonstrating the artifact and true zzso zzso The artifact identified with localized failure of zzso fat suppression zzso as regions of zzso zzso at zzso zzso with gradual fading of the increased signal with distance from the zzso The artifact was most prominent when the zzso were perpendicular to the axis of the main magnetic field zzso zzso The regions of increased brightness obscured normal zzso structures but were not associated with zzso in the geometry of these zzso Changes in orientation of the zzso with respect to the Z zzso both in the zzso and normal zzso reproduced the asymmetry of fat suppression failure seen in clinical zzso The relationship of size of the artifact to change in orientation was zzso The artifact was not seen on STIR zzso We concluded that failure of zzso fat suppression may mimic zzso disease, particularly if zzso As predicted by the Maxwell zzso zzso slight variations in orientation of the zzso interface to the Z axis may produce large zzso in fat suppression failure in the zzso Confirmation may require either comparison with additional pulse sequences zzso spin echo zzso zzso or zzso or repositioning the patient's head to check for persistence of the finding with varying zzso
