In this review, we analyzed clinical outcome measures used in multiple sclerosis zzso clinical trials in which the primary goal is to slow or arrest progression of zzso In addition, we examined rating scales that zzso symptomatic complications of zzso (for example, zzso and the current role of magnetic resonance imaging in zzso treatment zzso Each proposed scale has advantages and deficiencies, and none meets all the criteria for an ideal outcome zzso The zzso of trial design may be improved by using combinations of selected components of current scales as well as new instruments targeted to specific variables (such as motor zzso zzso rating scales are most appropriately used in trials of symptomatic therapeutic strategies for zzso Until serial magnetic resonance imaging changes are definitely known to predict long-term impairment and disability in patients with zzso clinical outcome measures will remain the primary means of assessing therapeutic efficacy in phase III clinical zzso
