zzso affect zzso is defined as episodes of zzso crying, laughing, or both in the absence of a matching zzso mood zzso This zzso syndrome can be found in a number of neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis zzso The aim of this study was to identify zzso zzso of zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso and without zzso zzso zzso zzso were matched on zzso disease course, and disability zzso zzso psychiatric disorders including depressive and anxiety disorders were zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes plus zzso of zzso were obtained and localized zzso according to zzso brain zzso zzso statistical comparisons were undertaken with alpha set at zzso for the primary zzso zzso differences in zzso volume were noted in six zzso zzso zzso zzso bilateral inferior zzso and zzso inferior frontal zzso zzso and right zzso superior frontal zzso zzso were all significantly higher in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso model identified four of these variables zzso zzso left inferior zzso zzso and left and right zzso inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso that accounted for zzso of the zzso when it came to explaining the presence of zzso In conclusion, zzso patients with zzso have a distinct distribution of brain zzso when compared to a matched zzso sample without zzso The zzso data support a zzso neural network involving zzso zzso and zzso regions in the zzso of zzso
