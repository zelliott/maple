Although recent studies suggest high accuracy of breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso in predicting residual tumor extent after zzso systemic treatment zzso its use is still zzso In this study, we aimed to identify zzso factors of zzso accuracy after zzso to determine a zzso of patients in whom the use of zzso provides best additional zzso 

zzso and molecular profiles of breast cancer patients were investigated and their relationships with zzso accuracy were zzso 

From January 2006 to February 2008, 195 patients received zzso and zzso zzso In overall, zzso predicted residual tumor extent with higher accuracy than zzso zzso zzso tumors showed highest correlation between zzso and zzso tumor size zzso zzso zzso when compared with other zzso zzso analysis showed age and zzso expression status as independent factors predicting zzso zzso When patients were classified based on their age and zzso status, relatively older patients zzso with zzso tumors showed highest zzso zzso This finding was further validated using an independent cohort of 63 consecutive zzso 

Age and zzso status independently affected zzso accuracy after zzso This observation may guide more tailored approach in using zzso in breast cancer patients undergoing zzso
