We considered the hypothesis that the richness of zzso zzso connections has a role in determining the degree of zzso zzso and zzso ability in zzso zzso zzso zzso as measured by zzso word zzso line zzso and turning bias tests correlated zzso with the zzso zzso area of the corpus zzso as seen on zzso The amount of dual task interference was strongly zzso correlated with the zzso area in both zzso and zzso zzso These relationships between normal variations in zzso area, and outcomes on tests both of zzso and zzso capacity in normal adults suggest that the corpus zzso assumes a zzso role when subjects perform these zzso
