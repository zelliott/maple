To compare zzso screw zzso against metal screw zzso primarily on adverse effects and zzso on clinical outcomes after zzso primary anterior cruciate ligament zzso 

Electronic searches were performed using search strategies meeting the mentioned zzso zzso articles were selected for zzso controlled trials zzso reporting at least zzso zzso Potential studies were selected under inclusion and exclusion zzso zzso of biases and data extraction was completed by two review zzso zzso were resolved through zzso Mean difference and risk ratio with 95 % confidence zzso zzso were used for continuous and zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed using I zzso zzso treatment effects with 95 % zzso were estimated using the zzso or zzso model where zzso 

Eleven zzso with zzso randomly allocated patients were included, and 711 patients zzso zzso with eligible follow-up time up to 8 years were zzso Comparing with the zzso group, zzso group using zzso hamstring graft showed evidence of larger tunnel widening on the zzso side measured from zzso or magnetic resonance imaging, though data could not be pooled because diverse measurement methods had been zzso zzso higher rates of zzso and screw zzso and fewer cases of complete tunnel healing were reported in the zzso zzso Nevertheless, functional and clinical results were not deteriorated by the presence of these adverse effects for both zzso and longer-term zzso 

This is the first systematic review focusing on adverse effects of the zzso such as larger tunnel widening and higher rates of other zzso With these effects, routine use of the zzso should be balanced with the advantages zzso zzso is another issue, and zzso zzso are needed to better validate the zzso
