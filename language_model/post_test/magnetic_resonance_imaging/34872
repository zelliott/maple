zzso zzso aims at efficiently presenting integrated information obtained from different zzso usually combining a functional zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso with an anatomical zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso This paper presents a technique for three-dimensional integrated zzso of zzso and magnetic resonance brain images, where zzso is used as a framework of reference for the display of the zzso zzso 

A novel technique for three-dimensional integrated zzso of functional and anatomical information, called normal fusion, is zzso With this technique, local functional information is projected onto an zzso zzso 

The normal fusion technique is applied to three cases of zzso zzso The results are zzso discussed and evaluated for clinical zzso 

The results for three-dimensional integrated display of zzso and MR brain images indicate that the normal fusion technique provides a potentially comprehensive and zzso valuable presentation of cerebral blood zzso in relation to the anatomy of the zzso
