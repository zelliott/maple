zzso zzso zzso are known to be indicative of zzso zzso and may predict incident zzso zzso However, there is controversy concerning the zzso relationship between the presence of zzso and zzso transformation zzso after zzso zzso 

Of the zzso patients with acute zzso stroke who were zzso admitted to our hospital, 377 patients with stroke due to zzso zzso or zzso were selected for participation in this zzso We examined the zzso using zzso zzso zzso performed within 24 hours after admission, and the zzso of zzso was assessed using follow-up brain zzso during the zzso zzso 

Of the 377 patients with stroke, 234 were male zzso and the mean age was zzso zzso zzso zzso were initially found in 109 patients zzso and newly incident zzso was noted during the zzso period in 74 patients zzso The presence of zzso was not increased in the patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso in the patients without zzso p zzso zzso In addition, the number of zzso was not higher in the patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso This lack of significance between zzso and zzso persisted after zzso by stroke zzso 

This study suggests that underlying zzso do not predict incident zzso after acute zzso zzso The clinical significance of zzso should be zzso evaluated according to the type of disease zzso zzso zzso zzso
