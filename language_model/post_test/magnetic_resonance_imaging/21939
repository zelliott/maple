To investigate abnormal fat deposition in the major zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso 

We analyzed the fat deposition in the zzso and zzso zzso of 33 patients with zzso syndrome by using zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso MR sequences and CT zzso 

All three in zzso techniques substantially confirmed premature deposition of fat in the major zzso zzso in association with zzso zzso Furthermore, this change was characteristic of zzso syndrome, and the severity of fat deposition correlated well with the impaired rates of zzso flow in these zzso 

Monitoring of fat deposition might be useful for diagnosing zzso syndrome and assessing its progress in patients whose clinical and zzso findings are suggestive of the zzso
