zzso of zzso coordination in which zzso muscles are simultaneously active are more stable than those in which zzso muscles are engaged in an alternating zzso This may be attributable to the stronger involvement of the dominant motor zzso in zzso hand movements via interaction with the zzso motor system, known as neural zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural representation of the zzso interaction during zzso mirror zzso Thirteen right-handed subjects completed four conditions: sequential finger tapping using the right and left index and middle fingers, zzso mirror and parallel finger zzso zzso cues (3 zzso were used to keep the tapping frequency zzso zzso zzso in the right primary motor zzso was significantly less prominent during mirror than zzso left-handed zzso This was zzso and zzso zzso parallel movements did not cause such a reduction, and the left primary motor zzso showed no such differential zzso across the zzso right, zzso mirror, and zzso parallel zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the left hand may increase the fraction of the force command to the left hand coming from the left primary motor cortex, enhancing the neural zzso
