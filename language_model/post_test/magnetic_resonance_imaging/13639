The aim of this study was to assess zzso imaging features and the value of CT and zzso in primary zzso of zzso In five patients with zzso proven primary zzso zzso CT and MR scans were evaluated zzso Both CT and zzso were available in four patients zzso In three patients both imaging techniques were zzso On CT primary zzso of bone presents as an expansive zzso zzso with bone destruction and zzso contrast zzso zzso resonance imaging depicts zzso zzso as zzso zzso on zzso images with intermediate signal intensity on zzso zzso zzso zzso structures of signal void in the tumor zzso on zzso images and corresponding zzso structures on zzso and on zzso short zzso inversion recovery images were present in three zzso Although zzso imaging findings are zzso they add to the diagnosis and provide valuable information about the extent of bone destruction and local tumor spread in patients with primary zzso zzso While CT demonstrates the extent of bone destruction best, zzso better zzso zzso and soft tissue extension of the zzso zzso signal abnormalities support the diagnosis of zzso of zzso This imaging pattern is best zzso on zzso or contrast enhanced zzso MR zzso
