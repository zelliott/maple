In the zzso brain energy is primarily supplied by the zzso of zzso However the zzso index zzso which is the ratio of zzso rates of oxygen to zzso zzso zzso from the theoretical value of 6 as activity is zzso In zzso zzso of brain zzso show its concentration to increase with zzso The decreasing zzso with stimulation had led to the suggestion that zzso unlike resting activity, is supported by zzso zzso To date a unifying concept that zzso zzso zzso at rest with zzso generation and zzso decrease during stimulation of brain is zzso Furthermore, zzso that change with increasing activity are not consistent with a zzso model that has been proposed from zzso MRS zzso That model, based upon in zzso MRS zzso and cellular studies by zzso and zzso showed that zzso neurotransmitter cycling was coupled to zzso zzso over a wide range of brain activities from rest down to deep zzso Here we reconcile these paradoxical observations by suggesting that zzso zzso consumption (which can provide energy zzso increases with zzso to meet the power requirements of zzso zzso zzso It is proposed, in zzso with our zzso model, that the extra zzso mobilized rapidly for zzso clearance of zzso is not needed for the zzso processes that are responsible for zzso firing and zzso release, and consequently it is zzso as zzso A zzso relation between zzso and zzso concentration is derived from the zzso model, showing that the enhanced zzso zzso during zzso is consistent with zzso activity being energetically supported by zzso zzso
