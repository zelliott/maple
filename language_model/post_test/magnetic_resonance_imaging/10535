zzso to white matter zzso resulting in zzso zzso may zzso age-related cognitive zzso 

Using diffusion zzso zzso zzso to investigate white matter damage, and magnetic resonance zzso zzso to look at its underlying zzso basis, the authors investigated the relationship between white matter structure and zzso in 106 healthy middle-aged and elderly zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso values, whole brain white matter zzso and regions of interest placed in the white matter of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso with executive function, working memory, and zzso speed were zzso 

There was a progressive reduction in zzso and increase in zzso with age in both region of interest zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and whole brain zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso values correlated with performance in all three cognitive zzso After controlling for age, zzso parameters correlated with working memory but not with the other two cognitive zzso MRS studies found a correlation of zzso zzso a zzso marker, with zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The results are consistent with white matter damage due to zzso loss, causing zzso related cognitive zzso Working memory may be particularly dependent on complex networks dependent on white matter zzso
