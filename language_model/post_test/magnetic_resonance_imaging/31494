zzso zzso zzso has been used zzso to identify infants suitable for zzso zzso following severe zzso zzso To determine whether an early zzso predicts short-term adverse outcome in infants with significant zzso zzso zzso evaluated for zzso zzso 

The zzso recordings were obtained within 6 h of birth in infants zzso zzso zzso age during evaluation for possible selective head or zzso zzso zzso were subsequently re-evaluated for both background pattern and zzso abnormalities by a certified reader masked to clinical history and zzso zzso All infants with moderate or severe zzso evaluated for zzso zzso also underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain at a median zzso age of 7 zzso The zzso value using the zzso for determining short-term zzso zzso defined as early death related to zzso or a characteristic pattern of abnormalities consistent with zzso injury on the zzso brain scans was zzso 

zzso infants with moderate or severe zzso were evaluated with zzso for zzso zzso 34 infants received selective head zzso 12 infants underwent total body cooling and 8 infants were not zzso zzso data, available for 46 of the 54 zzso revealed a poor correlation between the early zzso and short-term adverse zzso with a sensitivity of zzso and negative zzso value zzso of only zzso 

Because of the poor zzso of an early zzso for a short-term adverse outcome, its use as an zzso selection zzso for zzso zzso may not be zzso
