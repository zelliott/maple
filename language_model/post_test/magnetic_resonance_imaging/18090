We aimed to investigate the value of zzso magnetic resonance imaging in the differentiation of zzso diffuse zzso wall zzso zzso colon zzso and to discuss the diagnostic importance and potential use of apparent diffusion zzso zzso 

A total of 41 patients (32 zzso 9 zzso mean age, 57 zzso with diffuse zzso wall zzso diagnosed on zzso zzso were included in this zzso The magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a zzso T scanner zzso Changes in the signal intensity of the zzso were determined by their appearance in images at zzso zzso 2 , and apparent diffusion zzso values were also zzso zzso were classified in two groups according to the presence of zzso on zzso images and results of zzso zzso The differences in mean apparent diffusion zzso values between the two groups were compared with the zzso U test, and threshold values were determined with receiver operating characteristic curve zzso 

The difference between the mean apparent diffusion zzso values of benign and zzso groups was statistically zzso and the apparent diffusion zzso values of benign zzso were significantly higher than of zzso zzso zzso By using a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso apparent diffusion zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso and accuracy of zzso in the discrimination of zzso zzso zzso With the visual assessment of the diffusion weighted images and the measurement of apparent diffusion zzso values, zzso and benign zzso could be zzso with zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although some benign zzso were interpreted as zzso zzso zzso was determined as benign in the visual zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging and apparent diffusion zzso values together can successfully differentiate zzso from benign diffuse zzso wall zzso
