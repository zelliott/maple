zzso of zzso tracts that connect zzso to zzso areas is the classic mechanism of zzso zzso Later work has zzso cortical zzso 

To determine the distribution of language on dominant cortex, electrical cortical stimulation was performed using implanted zzso zzso during brain mapping before zzso zzso 

A zzso isolated deficit in repetition was zzso with stimulation of the zzso portion of the dominant superior zzso zzso 

This finding suggests that cortical dysfunction, not just white matter zzso can induce zzso zzso
