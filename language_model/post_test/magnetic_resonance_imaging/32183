In textbooks of human anatomy and zzso of spinal surgery, the zzso zzso ligaments are described and illustrated in various and often conflicting zzso Thirty-four zzso zzso columns (19 zzso 15 zzso range zzso years zzso sampled at autopsy, were studied by dissection and zzso zzso The orientation of the zzso zzso was evaluated in the zzso plane by tracing a reference line parallel to the zzso border of the zzso process, and the degree of bundle tilting with reference to this line was measured in the zzso middle and zzso parts of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies of the ligaments, on zzso zzso and zzso planes, were also carried zzso In zzso zzso validation was performed in 25 patients by MR and CT zzso zzso the zzso ligaments are consistently composed of zzso of zzso arranged in a characteristic zzso Together, they present an zzso orientation from anterior to zzso in a zzso zzso In their zzso part the zzso form a slight curve with a zzso zzso In the middle part, the zzso are thicker and arranged in an zzso S shape with a mean degree of tilting of 52 zzso 14, 21 zzso 12 and 50 zzso 17 in the zzso intermediate and zzso zzso of the zzso ligaments and of 32 zzso 14, 11 zzso 9 and 18 zzso 11 in the zzso intermediate and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso part consists of obliquely ascending zzso of zzso mostly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso these ligaments are mainly composed of collagen zzso whereas the elastic zzso are zzso although mostly concentrated in the zzso part, which is closely linked to the yellow zzso The zzso ligament is well supplied by small blood vessels and sensory nerves, the latter particularly in its zzso part and on its lateral zzso According to collected data, the structure of the zzso ligaments reflects their function, zzso the zzso zzso course of the zzso zzso represents an available reserve of length in a poorly elastic zzso
