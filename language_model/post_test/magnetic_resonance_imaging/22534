Previous zzso and zzso data on humans demonstrated that zzso and the level of brain activity vary according to whether participants reach towards and grasp a target object presented in isolation or flanked by a zzso zzso Here we seek to explore whether a differential zzso can be revealed by the mere observation of another person grasping an object in isolation or alongside a zzso To this end we used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to zzso neural activity related to action observation that was influenced by the presence of a zzso zzso We found that observing a human model zzso a three-dimensional target alongside a zzso elicits a differential level of zzso in a network of areas typically involved during action zzso the zzso sectors of the zzso zzso and the inferior frontal zzso Whereas our previous understanding of the human action observation system has been restricted to actions directed to single objects, we provide compelling evidence that areas within this network zzso with respect to the context in which the observed action takes zzso This may prove to be a fundamental process for our understanding of how others' actions can be represented at a neural zzso
