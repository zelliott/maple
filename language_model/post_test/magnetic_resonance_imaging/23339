The purpose of the present study was to zzso by zzso and zzso techniques, the diffusion and clearance abilities of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso coated with zzso zzso and gold zzso following their local infusions into the rat zzso In separate groups of zzso rats, the zzso and zzso were infused at zzso of zzso zzso 1 and 5 zzso zzso zzso and at the flow rate of zzso zzso zzso into the left and right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were performed at time intervals of 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 zzso and one, two and eight weeks after zzso Following infusion of zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso the zzso distribution volume was observed at about zzso h after zzso and two weeks later the zzso signals were zzso for the lower zzso On the other hand, zzso remained tightly localized in the closest vicinity of the infusion site as revealed by unchanged zzso signal zzso and strong zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the corresponding brain zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso reactions revealed that there were no marked differences in zzso zzso or zzso labeling observed between the zzso types, however the zzso reaction was more pronounced in rats receiving zzso compared to the control zzso zzso In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that the zzso zzso were able to diffuse freely through the zzso space of the brain being progressively cleared out from the infusion site within two zzso Thus, zzso could be zzso used in zzso diagnostic applications such as in experimental zzso or as labels and carriers for targeted drug delivery, whereas zzso could be used for labeling and tracking the transplanted stem cells in experimental zzso
