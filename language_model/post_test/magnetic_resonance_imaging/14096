A homogeneous zzso volume conductor is used as a model system for the purpose of calculating electric fields induced in the human head by zzso applied zzso magnetic zzso We present results for the case where magnetic field zzso zzso used in magnetic resonance imaging zzso form the magnetic field, and we use these data to put limits on the rates of zzso change with time needed to produce nerve zzso The electric field is calculated zzso for the case of ideal zzso and zzso linear field zzso We also show results from computer calculations yielding the electric field maps in a sphere when the field zzso are generated by a real zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the effect of shifting the sphere within each zzso zzso volume is zzso zzso analysis shows similar results when applied to a model human zzso
