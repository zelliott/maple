Carcinoma arising in zzso duct remnants is a zzso entity in the pathology and surgery literature, but it has little recognition in the zzso zzso zzso diagnosis may alter surgical management, although this diagnosis is rarely zzso This study was undertaken to determine the zzso features that might differentiate zzso from benign zzso duct zzso 

zzso cases of zzso zzso duct anomalies zzso at our institution during a 15-year period were reviewed zzso The images were assessed for zzso wall zzso enhancement, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Three additional cases of zzso duct zzso obtained from outside institutions were reviewed for these features zzso 

Six cases of zzso duct zzso were zzso All cases of zzso had solid zzso elements visible on CT scans or MR images, compared with three of 18 cases of benign zzso duct zzso The zzso component was seen as a small peripherally based mass in relation to a cyst, a solid mass in the expected course of the zzso zzso or a complex invasive mass also in the zzso of the zzso CT only revealed zzso in cases of zzso within either the primary zzso mass or a zzso zzso 

zzso duct zzso should be suspected in an adult patient in the presence of a solid zzso or invasive features in association with a zzso duct zzso visible on CT scans or MR zzso The presence of zzso which is seen best on CT scans, may be a specific marker for zzso
