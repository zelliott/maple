To accelerate the analysis of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso link is used between zzso zzso circuit and 3-D electromagnetic zzso simulation zzso In this zzso only one 3-D zzso simulation is required to investigate the zzso performance over a range of different zzso saving considerable zzso zzso For the purpose of 3-D zzso zzso the zzso feed networks and trim zzso are zzso by zzso zzso The entire zzso was tuned in the zzso circuit domain, and the zzso profiles of the electric and magnetic field components were then zzso together with the specific energy zzso ratio zzso maps in the 3-D zzso zzso
