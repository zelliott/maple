zzso zzso volume monitors have successfully been used in the diagnosis and treatment of various zzso zzso zzso zzso monitors have been developed but they have either been too bulky or too simple and zzso A new, zzso zzso zzso volume monitor has been designed for zzso zzso The instrument consists of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso arranged in a circular pattern to zzso detection of the zzso walls perpendicular to the abdominal zzso A Bluetooth radio link was used to transmit data to a laptop computer, where the main signal processing was zzso After detection of zzso surface points, a three-dimensional convex zzso representing the zzso was generated, and the volume was zzso zzso precision, drift over time, temperature dependency and dynamic performance were evaluated using ultrasound zzso Furthermore, the system was tested on one volunteer using magnetic resonance imaging zzso as zzso The apparatus showed no significant zzso systematic error or temperature zzso Percentage error during zzso volume zzso had a zzso central prediction zzso of zzso and mean absolute percentage error of zzso The dynamic performance analysis showed zzso in the zzso volume zzso The in zzso study showed a high degree of correlation zzso zzso between the volume measured using zzso and that measured with the zzso
