This study was conducted to determine the ability of zzso PET and conventional imaging zzso to predict the outcomes in breast cancer patients who have previously undergone primary zzso 

The study population consisted of 61 female patients zzso age, 54 zzso range, zzso zzso who were reevaluated with zzso PET and zzso after zzso The median zzso between the last treatment and PET was zzso y zzso zzso zzso PET was performed within 3 zzso of zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso range, zzso zzso To determine the independent impact of PET on outcome, PET images were zzso in a blind zzso zzso of clinical information after PET scanning (21 plus minus 12 zzso was required for study zzso Study zzso were clinical evidence of progression of disease or zzso 

Of 61 patients, 19 zzso had no clinical evidence and 38 zzso had evidence of residual or zzso disease by the end of zzso Four patients zzso had zzso The positive and negative zzso values zzso and zzso zzso of PET were zzso and zzso zzso zzso yielded a zzso of zzso and an zzso of zzso The zzso accuracy of single zzso PET was superior to that of multiple procedures with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso estimates of zzso survival in patients with negative PET findings compared with those with positive PET findings revealed a significant difference between the 2 zzso zzso test zzso zzso zzso estimates of zzso survival zzso by zzso results showed a marginally significant difference between zzso and zzso patients zzso test zzso zzso 

zzso PET can be used to improve prediction of the clinical outcome of previously treated breast cancer patients relative to what is achievable through zzso zzso
