Ten years follow-up of the first patients treated with zzso zzso 

zzso patients were zzso reviewed having undergone zzso in our zzso between 1989 and zzso Eight were treated for zzso eight for zzso zzso and two followed for zzso They all underwent clinical and zzso evaluation in 2007 zzso X-rays, CT scan and zzso These examinations were compared to prior baseline zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso characteristic of cement remained unchanged in the long term and there was no modification of anatomical structures in contact with zzso Even if the distribution of cement was zzso there was no fracture of the treated zzso at zzso zzso changes of discs facing the zzso were not more pronounced than for distant zzso We found no significant signal or density anomaly of disc in contact direct with zzso zzso % of the patients presented new fractures zzso zzso percent of the fractures were multiple and zzso In the long term, all patients reported improvement of pain after the zzso 

In our series, we found a good stability of treatment over zzso This study shows the long-term safety of zzso acrylic zzso in particular zzso of cement for bone and discs in zzso
