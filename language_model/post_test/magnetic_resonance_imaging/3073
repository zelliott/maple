zzso of apparent zzso zzso of water molecules is known to be an excellent means for zzso detailed information regarding zzso fiber direction and density in live subjects zzso Nevertheless, determination of zzso and zzso of the apparent diffusion zzso D zzso zzso the necessary process for the treatment of D zzso zzso in zzso is cumbersome and the quality of the reconstructed images based on estimated zzso values of D zzso zzso has often been zzso We present here a simple zzso which allows for the extraction of the zzso term zzso zzso from D zzso zzso in pictorial form, which in turn provides a novel color-coded contrast for magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso images constructed using this technique, three-dimensional zzso contrast zzso provided impressive zzso resolution of the zzso comparable to in zzso zzso zzso information of zzso expressed by hue of color clearly correlated to fiber direction, while magnitude of zzso expressed by intensity of color correlated to fiber zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso utilizing zzso technique possesses significant potential for various biological and clinical zzso
