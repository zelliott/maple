The purpose of this study was to define magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of normal brain zzso with the specific objective of investigating whether the size of the zzso is selectively correlated with age related memory performance in zzso individuals in their ninth and tenth decades of zzso 

zzso size was estimated using zzso based zzso and qualitative visual assessment in 102 community dwelling individuals aged between 81 and 94 zzso Participants were evaluated on a variety of clinical and experimental instruments, including a comprehensive zzso test zzso All participants underwent neurological examination, an extensive medical history was zzso and an informant confirmed details of each zzso functional zzso 

Both visual and zzso zzso measures were identified as robust zzso of memory performance, even when the influence of age related illnesses and zzso variables was accounted zzso When the sample was reduced to include the most cognitively healthy participants who were rated by an informant as showing no evidence of cognitive decline, the left zzso measures remained significant zzso of delayed retention of verbal zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso volumes are selectively correlated with memory functioning in both normal and successful zzso
