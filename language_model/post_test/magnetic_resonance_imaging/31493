zzso success of treatment of cerebral diseases must be assessed in terms of functional zzso In experimental stroke studies, this has been limited to behavioral studies combined with zzso evaluations and single time point functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso but lacking the access to understanding underlying mechanisms for zzso in brain zzso Using a recently developed blood zzso zzso zzso protocol to study zzso and zzso profiles of functional brain zzso in the zzso system, we have demonstrated zzso zzso in the original representation field as the basic principle of functional recovery from experimental zzso No plastic reorganization has been observed at any time point during 7 weeks after stroke zzso zzso combined recording of zzso and zzso evoked zzso we observed a tight zzso of electrical brain activity and zzso response at all times, indicating persistent preservation of zzso zzso Identification of functional brain recovery mechanisms has important implications for the understanding of brain plasticity after cerebral zzso whereas preservation of zzso zzso is important for the clinical translation of zzso
