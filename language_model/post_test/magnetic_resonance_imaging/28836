To assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the breast in patients with zzso zzso zzso and unknown primary zzso 

Between October 1993 and December 1997, 38 women with zzso zzso zzso and negative zzso and physical examination findings underwent contrast zzso MR zzso Sixteen patients were excluded due to zzso tail cancer zzso zzso zzso lack of follow-up zzso zzso zzso second primary zzso zzso zzso zzso or chemotherapy before MR imaging zzso zzso zzso The study population comprised the remaining 22 zzso zzso findings were available in 20 zzso follow-up MR imaging findings were available in two zzso 

MR imaging depicted a primary breast cancer in 19 patients zzso identified at zzso biopsy or mastectomy in 17, resolved on follow-up MR images during treatment in zzso MR imaging depicted zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso which correlated closely with zzso zzso Two patients zzso had zzso findings: zzso One had a zzso invasive zzso zzso and zzso one had zzso and zzso invasive zzso zzso Of the 19 patients, 11 underwent mastectomy, seven underwent zzso therapy, and one did not undergo a surgical zzso 

MR imaging is very sensitive for the detection of zzso and clinically zzso breast cancer in patients with zzso zzso zzso In these patients, MR imaging offers potential not only for cancer detection but also for staging the cancer within the breast, which may be useful for treatment zzso
