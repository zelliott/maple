zzso brain zzso decrease accuracy in zzso zzso zzso to zzso these zzso based on 3-D reconstruction of zzso surfaces have been described and have shown promising results regarding the zzso to the whole brain volume using additional prior knowledge or sparse volume zzso zzso of brain zzso from surface measurement requires the registration of surfaces at different times along the surgical zzso with different challenges according to the patient and surgical zzso In this paper, we propose a new flexible surface registration approach for any zzso point cloud zzso by zzso or laser range zzso This method includes three terms: the first term is related to image zzso the second to zzso distance, and the third to anatomical landmarks automatically extracted and continuously tracked in the zzso video zzso Performance evaluation was performed on both phantom and clinical zzso The global method, including zzso point cloud zzso had accuracy within 2 zzso which is the usual rigid registration error of zzso systems before zzso Its main advantage is to consider all the available data, including the microscope video flow with higher zzso resolution than previously published zzso
