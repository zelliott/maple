zzso zzso muscle zzso after open shoulder stabilization procedures represents an zzso zzso 

zzso and revision open shoulder stabilization using the zzso L-shaped zzso approach zzso zzso muscle recovery and affects final clinical zzso 

zzso study; Level of evidence, zzso 

Twenty-five patients who underwent primary zzso 1: zzso zzso 13; mean age, zzso years; zzso 48 zzso or revision zzso zzso zzso zzso 12; mean age, zzso years; zzso 52 zzso open shoulder stabilization procedures were followed up clinically zzso zzso tests and signs, zzso score, and Rowe zzso and by magnetic resonance imaging zzso integrity, defined muscle zzso and signal intensity analysis zzso zzso zzso muscle and zzso zzso zzso A third group zzso zzso of 12 healthy volunteers served as a zzso 

Clinical signs for zzso muscle zzso were present in zzso of cases in group 1 and zzso of cases in group zzso There were no significant differences between groups with regard to zzso and Rowe scores zzso zzso zzso On magnetic resonance imaging, no complete zzso zzso were zzso The mean vertical diameter of the zzso muscle and the mean zzso diameter of the upper zzso muscle portion were significantly greater in group 0 than in group 1 and greater in group 1 than in group 2 zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso diameter of the lower zzso muscle was comparable in all groups zzso zzso zzso The signal intensity analysis revealed the zzso zzso muscle ratio was greater in group 0 than in group 1 and greater in group 1 than in group 2 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso muscle ratio was lower in group 0 than in groups 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso 

Open shoulder stabilization using an zzso L-shaped zzso approach may lead to zzso and fatty zzso particularly of the upper part of the zzso muscle, resulting in zzso zzso muscle zzso Revision procedures using the same approach may further compromise clinical zzso muscle function and zzso The lower portion of the zzso muscle seems to have a zzso effect that may, in addition to a meticulous zzso zzso account for the uncompromised overall clinical zzso
