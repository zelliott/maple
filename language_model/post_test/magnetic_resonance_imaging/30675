The greater fluctuations in motor output that are often exhibited by old adults can be reduced with strength zzso The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of strength and zzso training by old adults on fluctuations in force and position during voluntary zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Healthy old adults zzso zzso completed 16 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strength training, zzso zzso training zzso zzso zzso or no training zzso zzso zzso zzso training required subjects to match the angular displacement about the knee joint to a zzso zzso The zzso group experienced a zzso increase in muscle volume, a zzso increase in zzso voluntary contraction force, and a zzso increase in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso Steady group experienced increases of zzso 31, and zzso zzso The zzso zzso signal of zzso zzso increased by 51% in the two training zzso The zzso of variation zzso for force during zzso zzso zzso did not change with training for any zzso Although both training groups also experienced a reduction in zzso for force during zzso zzso with a 50% zzso load, the standard zzso of position did not change with time for any zzso The zzso Steady group also experienced a reduction in zzso for force during the training zzso performed with the zzso zzso zzso Thus strength training reduced the force fluctuations of the zzso zzso muscles during zzso zzso but not during zzso zzso
