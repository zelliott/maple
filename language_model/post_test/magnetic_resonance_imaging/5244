zzso effects of zzso zzso have been well documented in tissue cultures and animal models, whereas human data continue to be zzso Previous studies investigating the association between Li treatment and brain zzso zzso a putative zzso marker, showed mixed results because of zzso zzso 

To investigate the effects of Li on prefrontal zzso zzso levels, we compared patients with bipolar disorder from specialized Li clinics in Berlin and Halifax with at least 2 years of ongoing Li treatment zzso group), patients with lifetime Li exposure of less than 3 months more than 2 years ago zzso zzso and healthy zzso Participants in both patient groups had at least 10 years of illness and 5 zzso We measured left prefrontal zzso levels using zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

We enrolled 27 participants in the Li, 16 in the zzso and 21 in the healthy control zzso The zzso group had lower prefrontal zzso levels than the Li group zzso zzso zzso corrected p zzso zzso or control participants zzso zzso zzso corrected p zzso zzso who did not differ from the Li group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The same pattern of prefrontal zzso differences was zzso in both zzso In addition, there was a negative correlation between prefrontal zzso and duration of illness in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not in the Li group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Study limitations include the zzso design and exposure to other zzso 

Whereas patients with bipolar disorder, substantial illness burden and limited lifetime Li exposure had significantly lower prefrontal zzso levels than controls, zzso patients with similar illness burden showed prefrontal zzso levels comparable to those of healthy zzso These findings provide indirect support for zzso effects of Li and for negative effects of illness burden on prefrontal zzso levels in patients with bipolar zzso
