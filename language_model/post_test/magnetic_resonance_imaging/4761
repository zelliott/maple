We zzso reviewed zzso zzso and 250 spinal zzso MR images of patients younger than 24 years to evaluate the bone zzso zzso The signal intensity of the bone zzso on zzso images was compared with that of fat and normal muscles in the zzso region and zzso The signal intensity of all zzso segments was as low as that of muscle, or inferior, in all patients younger than 3 months because of zzso tissue and probably greater amounts of zzso zzso The first zzso segments of zzso bone to become zzso were the zzso bone and zzso zzso followed by the zzso bone, zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso After 3 years of age, most patients demonstrated zzso of the zzso zzso We describe the most interesting changes in the developing spine, which occur in the first 2 years of zzso The zzso of the zzso bodies was zzso The zzso of the signal and the zzso of the disks were also zzso Regional patterns of bone zzso signal intensity and age-related differences should not be zzso as a zzso zzso
