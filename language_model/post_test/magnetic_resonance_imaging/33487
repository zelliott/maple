We determined the accuracy of zzso zzso (based on identification of unilateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso (based on zzso interpretations of zzso zzso zzso by three independent zzso for seizure focus zzso in 20 patients with zzso lobe zzso All patients became zzso or had rare zzso following zzso zzso Among the 20 patients, nine zzso met both zzso and zzso zzso criteria, six zzso met zzso zzso criteria alone, three zzso met zzso zzso criteria alone, and two patients zzso did not meet either zzso zzso In the 18 patients meeting zzso or zzso zzso criteria, the predicted zzso agreed with the side of zzso zzso These results suggest that a zzso approach combining zzso and zzso will correctly zzso the side of seizure onset in most patients with zzso lobe zzso
