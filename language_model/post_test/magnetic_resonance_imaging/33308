To assess the diagnostic performance of shoulder MR zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso for zzso zzso tears in comparison with zzso conventional sequences at zzso 

The study was zzso and approved by the institutional review board with a waiver of informed zzso zzso zzso confirmed patients who underwent zzso shoulder MR zzso with zzso sequences and zzso zzso were included in a consecutive fashion from March 2009 to February zzso Two zzso independently analyzed zzso sequences and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso agreement zzso were compared between zzso sequences and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso tears together and for zzso zzso zzso tears zzso 

There were 33 zzso tears and 28 zzso tears of zzso zzso For zzso and zzso zzso zzso tears together, the mean sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of both readers were 96, 92, and zzso on zzso sequences and 91, 84, and zzso on zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso tears alone, the mean sensitivity, zzso and accuracy were 95, 92, and zzso on zzso sequences and 84, 85, and zzso on zzso zzso There was no statistical difference between zzso sequences and zzso zzso zzso agreements were almost perfect on zzso conventional sequences and substantial on zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso conventional zzso MR zzso using zzso zzso was comparable for diagnosing zzso zzso tears despite limitations in detecting small zzso tears and in discriminating between zzso and deep zzso zzso
