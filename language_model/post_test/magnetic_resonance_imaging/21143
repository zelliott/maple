The purpose of this paper is to determine the early zzso of disc zzso generation adjacent to the zzso body of zzso fracture treated with zzso zzso or balloon zzso and whether adjacent disc zzso is accelerated by this two zzso 

182 patients with painful zzso zzso fractures were zzso A total of 97 patients were enrolled in this prospective zzso 97 patients with a mean age of zzso years were classified into control group and surgical treatment group of zzso 35 patients were in control group and 62 patients who were performed zzso zzso or balloon zzso in treatment zzso X-ray and zzso resonance imaging were done at the first and final zzso The grade of disc zzso above the fractured zzso was confirmed by evaluation of zzso zzso in the fat suppressed sequences and zzso image of magnetic resonance zzso The height of degenerative disc was measured on X-ray zzso 

All patients were followed up two years after the first visit and the follow-up rate was zzso zzso The zzso of zzso of adjacent disc above the fractured zzso was zzso zzso in control group and zzso zzso in treatment zzso It presented a statistically significant difference between two groups about the zzso of adjacent disc zzso zzso The percentage of adjacent disc height reduction in control group was zzso and zzso in treatment zzso zzso significant difference of zzso score and zzso was not found between the first evaluation zzso and the final follow-up in treatment group zzso 

zzso zzso adjacent to the fractured zzso is accelerated by VP and BK procedures in the early stage, but clinical outcomes has not been weakened even in the presence of accelerated disc zzso
