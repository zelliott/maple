zzso invasive zzso of zzso origin has been reported with a very high mortality due to a zzso zzso clinical zzso Early diagnosis based on clinical zzso imaging may have an impact on final clinical zzso This retrospective study focuses on characteristic MR imaging features of zzso (of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Medical records of patients were reviewed zzso during the period from 1991 to 2003 in the two zzso care zzso All the patients had zzso evidence of disease in the zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso of patients was assessed on clinical and zzso zzso zzso scans zzso were reviewed by both clinical zzso and zzso zzso zzso was done on zzso zzso scanners and both zzso and zzso weighted sequences were obtained followed zzso enhanced zzso Patients were zzso into three types based on their anatomical location on zzso zzso zzso being zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso invading orbit and/or skull base zzso All these patient had the epicenter of disease in the nose and/or zzso zzso as evident on MR zzso All patients underwent standard surgical intervention followed by zzso zzso Clinical outcome was assessed on zzso outcome scale with mean duration of clinical follow up of zzso zzso 

Mean age of patents zzso was zzso years with male preponderance zzso zzso scans showed evidence of disease in zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and complete filling of zzso zzso zzso images showed extremely zzso zzso mass zzso while zzso images had zzso signals zzso zzso images showed bright zzso contrast enhancement zzso and peripheral ring enhancement pattern zzso All patients underwent appropriated surgical procedures depending upon anatomical location followed by standard zzso zzso zzso diagnoses were established by zzso zzso and culture growth zzso zzso mortality remained 15 zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso origin has typical MR imaging zzso These features include a mass zzso producing zzso signals on zzso extremely low signals zzso on zzso images, with bright zzso enhancement on zzso zzso zzso These features in the clinical background may be helpful in early diagnosis and management of zzso of zzso origin in zzso zzso Prospective clinical study is required to make firm clinical therapeutic zzso
