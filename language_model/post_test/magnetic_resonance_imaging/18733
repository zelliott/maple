To compare patterns of brain zzso in zzso zzso zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso since zzso in individual areas may not be sufficiently specific as diagnostic zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso was measured from zzso of 10 zzso patients, 27 zzso and 27 zzso zzso zzso and asymmetry were zzso zzso 

zzso had mild zzso in the zzso zzso zzso severe in the frontal zzso and very severe in the zzso zzso zzso zzso had moderate zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and very mild frontal zzso zzso zzso was more zzso in zzso zzso more zzso than in zzso patients, particularly in the zzso zzso A zzso function including the asymmetry values of frontal and zzso regions could separate zzso from zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso is characterized by a specific pattern of zzso more useful than zzso of single regions in the differential zzso
