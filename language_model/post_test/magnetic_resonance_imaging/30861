zzso of this study is the integration of a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to perform zzso MR monitoring in real time to increase safety and effectiveness of heat zzso The positioning unit is mechanically coupled to the MR zzso from the back side and the body zzso is zzso for zzso For that purpose, the zzso antenna system zzso zzso zzso zzso and the MR receiver zzso zzso have to be zzso in terms of high frequency zzso and zzso zzso The processing of MR data sets is performed in a zzso planning zzso A simultaneous operation of zzso zzso and MR system is possible at clinically relevant power zzso MR imaging is used for zzso zzso spin echo zzso for zzso planning zzso zzso echo sequences in zzso and zzso zzso and for temperature zzso according to the zzso resonance frequency method zzso method, phase evaluation registration using a zzso echo sequence with long echo zzso In 33 patients with advanced pelvic and abdominal tumors we performed 150 heat sessions under MR zzso For zzso of these patients a zzso of temperature sensitive data during treatment was zzso The evaluated difference images represent a zzso of real temperature zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso approach renders development of part body zzso possible as an zzso intervention in zzso
