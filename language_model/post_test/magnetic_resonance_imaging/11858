The incorporation of multiple imaging zzso into zzso treatment planning offers the potential to improve identification of regions of zzso This work outlines and evaluates a methodology for registration of magnetic resonance images zzso and zzso images zzso to zzso zzso zzso images, and zzso of the zzso data on the treatment planning zzso zzso magnetic resonance images were acquired during an examination prior to the initiation of zzso Registration between these images and the treatment planning zzso zzso images was performed using an automated alignment routine, and was improved manually using an interactive registration zzso The parameters of the alignment were then used to transform the zzso images into the same reference zzso The zzso data were represented in terms of a statistical measure of zzso and embedded within the zzso data as zzso zzso These images were sent via zzso transfer to the treatment planning zzso An analysis of the zzso of the
