We investigated the effects of paired presentations of visual stimuli upon the evoked zzso response of visual zzso measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso were identical zzso zzso zzso patterns, presented zzso or with an zzso zzso zzso of 1, 2, 4, or 6 s zzso followed by an zzso zzso of zzso zzso Images were acquired at zzso zzso using a zzso zzso imaging sequence sensitive to zzso dependent zzso zzso Single zzso evoked a zzso response from visual zzso characterized by a rise at 3 zzso peak zzso at 5 zzso and return to baseline by 10 zzso We zzso subjects' zzso zzso response from their zzso responses to isolate the contribution of the second zzso If the zzso responses were fully zzso the residual should be a zzso replica of the single stimulus zzso However, the zzso of the zzso response to the second zzso was smaller, and the peak zzso was longer, than for the zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso was dependent upon zzso such that the response to the second stimulus at 1 s zzso was only zzso of that to a single zzso with recovery to zzso at a 6 s zzso Peak zzso was similarly dependent upon zzso with longer zzso observed for shorter zzso These results demonstrate an extended zzso period in the zzso response to visual stimuli consistent with that shown previously for zzso activity measured zzso
