The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between zzso zzso of the anterior cruciate ligament zzso and zzso change of the zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed the 105 patients with knee magnetic resonance imaging zzso with or without knee zzso zzso 1: patients with zzso zzso (N zzso zzso group zzso knee zzso demonstrating intact zzso (N zzso zzso and group zzso patients with normal knee zzso but no zzso (N zzso zzso Groups 2 and 3 served as an zzso and MR control group, zzso Two musculoskeletal zzso reviewed all MR zzso The zzso notch zzso notch index zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso notch angle zzso zzso notch angle zzso and notch area were recorded on zzso and zzso MR images at the zzso of zzso line which was identified on zzso zzso The diameter of the zzso was recorded on zzso MR images at the zzso end of zzso zzso 

The mean values of the zzso notch zzso notch index, zzso zzso notch area, and zzso diameter for the three groups were zzso zzso degrees zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso degrees zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso notch zzso notch index, zzso and notch area were smaller, and zzso diameter was thicker in group 1 compared with the other groups zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso zzso show a zzso zzso a steeper notch angle, and a smaller notch area than control zzso
