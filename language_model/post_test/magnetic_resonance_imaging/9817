It is not clear whether survival times of patients with zzso zzso zzso are associated with their response to zzso We analyzed the association between tumor response and survival times of patients with zzso who were treated with zzso therapies zzso zzso and zzso 

Patients received zzso over a zzso period zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso portal zzso zzso or who had received transplants were zzso 159 patients with zzso B7 or lower were zzso Response (based on European Association for the Study of the Liver zzso and World Health Organization zzso zzso was associated with survival times using the landmark, zzso and zzso zzso In a zzso survival times of zzso were compared with those of patients with stable disease and progressive zzso 

Based on zzso data, in landmark analysis, zzso survived longer than zzso (based on zzso but not WHO criteria: P zzso zzso and zzso The risk of death was also lower for zzso (based on zzso but not WHO criteria: P zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of 12-month data showed that zzso survived longer than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso and WHO criteria, zzso The risk of death was lower for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso and WHO criteria, zzso By the zzso method, zzso had longer survival than zzso based on zzso criteria zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with WHO zzso In the zzso zzso lived longer than patients with stable disease or progressive zzso 

zzso response to zzso predicts survival zzso zzso criteria for response more consistently predicted survival times than WHO zzso The goal of zzso should be to achieve a zzso response, rather than to stabilize zzso
