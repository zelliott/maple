Fifty patients with suspected internal zzso of the knee had zzso examinations after MR imaging with both a standard zzso zzso zzso sequence and a three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso This series permitted zzso evaluation of 100 zzso and 50 anterior cruciate zzso zzso tears were diagnosed when zzso signal communicated with the zzso zzso zzso for diagnosing anterior cruciate ligament disruption included absence or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso cruciate zzso zzso surgery confirmed the presence of 39 zzso tears and 11 anterior cruciate ligament tears in this zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the zzso sequence for the diagnosis of zzso tears were zzso and zzso zzso The 3-D zzso sequence had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso For disruption of the zzso the zzso technique had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso and the 3-D technique had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso Although these differences in sensitivity and specificity are not statistically significant at the p less than zzso level, probably because of the small sample size, the results show the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two imaging zzso These data suggest that because of the complementary results of the two MR techniques, both the zzso and the 3-D zzso sequences have a role in the diagnosis of knee zzso
