zzso is widely used for zzso zzso functional brain zzso In traditional spatial zzso however, zzso switching limits the zzso resolution, which makes it difficult to zzso identify possible fast zzso zzso In this paper we propose a novel reconstruction approach, called dynamic inverse imaging zzso that is capable of providing zzso zzso resolution when highly parallel detection is zzso To achieve an zzso zzso in generating zzso contrast estimates and dynamic statistical zzso maps zzso the spatial information is derived from an array of detectors rather than by time-consuming zzso zzso The zzso approach was inspired by zzso zzso and zzso zzso source zzso zzso Dynamic MR zzso was evaluated by means of zzso zzso zzso was also applied to measure zzso zzso time zzso at zzso zzso resolution in a visual stimulation experiment using a zzso head zzso zzso is expected to improve the time resolution of zzso and provide increased flexibility in the zzso between spatial and zzso resolution for studies of dynamic zzso patterns in the human zzso
