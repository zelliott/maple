We present the case of an 18-year-old man, previously healthy, who presented with acute zzso and respiratory zzso Physical examination was compatible with a high cervical anterior spinal zzso zzso 

We plan to evaluate the cause of such a neurological presentation in a healthy young zzso 

American University Medical Center, Beirut, zzso 

The patient underwent routine blood zzso and chemistry zzso zzso profile studies, genetic profile for zzso zzso studies of the brain and cervical cord, zzso analysis and extensive zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso of the brain, carotid and zzso vessels were zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso resonance imaging of the cervical zzso revealed zzso of the anterior segment of the cervical zzso between C2 and zzso zzso zzso profile studies were zzso zzso studies confirmed an isolated zzso of the descending zzso zzso DNA analysis revealed the presence of a zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that a zzso zzso zzso can cause anterior spinal artery zzso and anterior spinal zzso zzso with the zzso neurological deficits in otherwise healthy zzso
