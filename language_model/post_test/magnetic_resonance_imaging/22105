To correlate the imaging and zzso features of zzso zzso zzso zzso and account for the zzso between the solid appearance at ultrasound zzso and the almost zzso appearance at zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

The clinical, zzso and imaging findings in 28 patients (age range, zzso zzso with zzso proved zzso were zzso zzso All patients underwent at least one zzso imaging study to include CT (27 zzso US (21 zzso and MR imaging (six zzso zzso size, gross zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso features, and proportion of solid and zzso components were evaluated and correlated to the imaging zzso 

The mean zzso diameter of the tumors was 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso At gross examination, the tumors were predominantly solid zzso zzso of tumor zzso and zzso and US findings were zzso zzso CT scans showed low zzso zzso that of water) in zzso of the tumor volume and zzso MR images showed high signal intensity zzso equal to that of zzso zzso in zzso of the tumor zzso 

zzso shows a misleading zzso appearance at CT and MR imaging compared with US and zzso zzso In a child or young adult with a liver zzso this finding is useful in making a prospective diagnosis and avoiding misguided attempts at zzso
