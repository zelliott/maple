Data support greater sensitivity of MR imaging compared with zzso and ultrasound in high-risk zzso in particular zzso 1 and zzso 2 zzso zzso ultrasound improves cancer yield versus zzso alone in high-risk patients and in patients with dense breasts and is less zzso zzso include low positive zzso value, operator zzso and significant physician time zzso zzso such as refinement of automated zzso zzso new outcomes data from zzso masses in zzso 3 and zzso categories, and development of new MR imaging sequences that allow rapid zzso potentially without use of contrast, will likely reveal the most appropriate tool over zzso
