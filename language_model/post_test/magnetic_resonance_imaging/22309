It was hypothesized that a scanner simulator that replicates the magnetic resonance imaging zzso environment could be used to prepare pediatric subjects for successful completion of a zzso zzso examination without pharmacological zzso 

Sixteen healthy children, 6 to 17 years of age, were matched for age and sex with 16 zzso zzso children with obsessive-compulsive zzso zzso was measured throughout simulation and scanning procedures using heart rate and a self-report distress zzso Ten healthy children, 6 to 17 years of age, also underwent the same actual zzso scanning procedure but did not undergo the simulation scanning zzso 

zzso decreases in heart rate and zzso distress level were observed in all subjects during the simulator session that were maintained to the end of the actual scanner zzso All subjects successfully completed zzso examinations without chemical zzso zzso who were not trained in the simulator had higher heart rates and zzso distress levels in the actual scanner than did zzso zzso 

zzso without pharmacological sedation successfully prepared pediatric subjects in this pilot study for high-quality zzso zzso zzso preparation may be an alternative procedure to sedation for routine zzso examination in healthy and anxious children 6 years of age and zzso
