The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and limitations of gamma surgery zzso in the treatment of brain zzso from zzso 

Imaging and clinical outcomes in 45 patients treated for 92 brain zzso from melanoma between October 1989 and October 1999 were zzso zzso zzso imaging studies were available in 35 patients with 66 treated zzso zzso percent of the zzso disappeared, zzso zzso zzso remained zzso and zzso increased in zzso No undue zzso changes were observed in the surrounding zzso Clinical data were available in all zzso No deaths or neurological morbidity related to zzso was zzso The median survival time, calculated using the zzso method, was zzso months from the time of zzso In both zzso and zzso Cox zzso zzso a single brain zzso and lack of visceral zzso were statistically zzso of a better zzso Six of eight patients with solitary zzso zzso is, a single brain zzso with no primary visceral zzso were still alive at the close of the study, none of them with disease zzso with a follow-up period ranging between 14 and 82 zzso Sixteen patients in this series received zzso zzso radiation therapy, which had no impact on their survival time or local and distant control of the brain zzso 

zzso surgery is effective in treating melanoma zzso in the zzso It appears that the zzso of a single high dose overcomes the zzso barrier, yielding better results than zzso zzso
