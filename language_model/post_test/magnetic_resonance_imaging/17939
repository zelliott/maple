zzso contrast agents are known to enhance high intensity focused ultrasound zzso zzso but these zzso zzso are limited to the zzso have a short zzso in zzso and may result in unintended heating away from the target zzso zzso a zzso zzso dual zzso zzso zzso that is stable, is sufficiently small to zzso and is convertible to zzso bubbles upon acoustic zzso was zzso zzso and zzso were incorporated into zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso at zzso per zzso resulted in mean zzso volumes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, after zzso of continuous zzso zzso at a peak negative pressure of zzso compared to a zzso volume of zzso zzso in zzso control zzso zzso resonance zzso mapping during zzso confirmed zzso surface heating in zzso containing zzso whereas heating occurred at the acoustic focus of zzso containing the zzso zzso change in temperature at the target site was enhanced by zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso has the potential to reduce the time to zzso tumors by one-third during focused ultrasound surgery while also safely enhancing zzso deposition at the target zzso
