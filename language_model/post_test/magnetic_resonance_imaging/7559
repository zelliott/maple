To investigate zzso changes in zzso and spatial distribution of knee zzso cartilage magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso relaxation times, in individuals with and without zzso compartment cartilage zzso 

All subjects (at baseline zzso zzso years old) underwent zzso knee zzso at baseline and annually thereafter for 3 zzso The MR studies were evaluated for presence of cartilage defects zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso - zzso and quantitative zzso and zzso relaxation time zzso zzso were zzso into those with zzso zzso and without zzso zzso cartilage zzso at the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso at each time zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and spatial zzso level zzso zzso - zzso distribution of the zzso and zzso relaxation time maps were zzso Linear zzso models zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

Global zzso global zzso and zzso layer zzso relaxation times at the zzso and global and zzso layer zzso relaxation times at the zzso were higher in subjects with cartilage zzso compared to those without zzso At the zzso global zzso relaxation times were higher at each time point in subjects with zzso zzso zzso and zzso became progressively more zzso than control compartments over the course of the zzso 

zzso distribution of zzso and zzso relaxation time maps in zzso knee zzso using zzso technique may be a sensitive indicator of cartilage zzso in addition to zzso relaxation time zzso
