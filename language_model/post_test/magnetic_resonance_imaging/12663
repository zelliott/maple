zzso smooth zzso and zzso zzso zzso are three basic eye movements in our zzso motor repertoire that enable us to explore the visual zzso These eye movements are zzso controlled in different cortical eye fields, including the frontal eye fields zzso and zzso eye fields zzso as well as the zzso visual area zzso It is not known if this cortical control is organized in parallel zzso networks or in adjacent zzso of one zzso Nor do we know where the specific eye fields are exactly zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to investigate these open questions about the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the cortical network of zzso control were found in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso While the zzso pattern for zzso was not a combination of the patterns for zzso and smooth zzso the results suggest that cortical control of zzso occurs in a network parallel to that of zzso and smooth zzso Furthermore, a division of the zzso and the zzso into two parts was confirmed for the three zzso motor tasks, as well as a division within each of the three zzso zzso showed two partitions only for zzso but not for smooth pursuit or zzso
