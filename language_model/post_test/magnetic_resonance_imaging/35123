The purpose of this study was to compare the visibility of the normal zzso nucleus zzso between fast zzso zzso zzso zzso images and fast short inversion time zzso zzso images, and to assess the age-related changes of the zzso at zzso zzso 

We evaluated high-resolution zzso zzso and zzso images in 24 zzso normal zzso Using both zzso we assessed the visibility of the margins of the zzso and calculated the difference in signal intensity between the zzso and structures adjacent to the zzso Then, to assess the age-related changes of the zzso we calculated the zzso ratio between the zzso and the white matter, and measured the position, zzso and height of the zzso All data were statistically zzso 

The visibility of the lower margin of the zzso was significantly better on the zzso images than on the zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso while the visibility of other margins was significantly better on the zzso zzso images than on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference in signal intensity between the zzso and zzso zzso was significantly greater on the zzso images than on the zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso The distance from the zzso to the lateral border of the zzso increased with age zzso zzso zzso left r zzso zzso P zzso zzso right r zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The combined reading of both zzso zzso and zzso images at 3 T will improve the identification of the zzso The age-related zzso change of the zzso should be considered in target determination for deep brain stimulation zzso
