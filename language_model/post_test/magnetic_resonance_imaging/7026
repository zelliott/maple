zzso zzso matter zzso develops a substantial burden of pathology in multiple sclerosis zzso Previous zzso studies have suggested a relationship between measures of cortical zzso and zzso Our objective was to develop a method for automatically measuring the apparent zzso thickness as well as the integrity of the interface between zzso and zzso white matter zzso both globally and regionally on zzso zzso and use this method in a zzso investigation of how these measures differed between patients with stable zzso and patients with progressing zzso zzso were made over the whole brain and for zzso specified cortical regions, both zzso at baseline and zzso on two zzso scans performed on average 1 year zzso We found a higher average rate of apparent loss of zzso thickness across the whole brain in the group that progressed over the zzso zzso compared to the group that remained stable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stable zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This difference was detected with regional measures in zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, change in the zzso interface integrity did not show zzso regional differences, although the group of zzso patients whose disability progressed showed a significant decrease in zzso interface integrity compared to the stable group zzso zzso zzso Regional measures of apparent loss of zzso thickness enhance sensitivity to cortical pathological zzso A measure of integrity offers a new index of zzso cortical changes at the zzso zzso The results suggest that progression of disability in zzso is associated with the progression of zzso cortical zzso
