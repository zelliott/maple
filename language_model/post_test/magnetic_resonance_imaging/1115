zzso zzso imaging in acute stroke assists in determining the zzso and the severity of zzso Recent studies in zzso models and in healthy volunteers have shown that ultrasound zzso imaging based on zzso destruction can be used to assess tissue zzso We applied ultrasound zzso destruction imaging zzso to identify zzso deficits in patients with acute middle cerebral artery zzso territory zzso 

Fifteen acute zzso stroke patients with sufficient zzso bone windows were investigated with ultrasound zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed using power zzso contrast harmonic zzso Thirty seconds after a zzso injection of the echo contrast agent zzso zzso were destroyed using a series of zzso zzso Local zzso status was analyzed in selected regions of interest by destruction zzso and acoustic intensity differences zzso before and after zzso zzso Local zzso status was then compared with zzso compromise as identified on zzso 

The mean differences of acoustic intensity from the zzso zzso territory were significantly diminished compared with the normal zzso zzso versus zzso zzso resulting in lower slopes of zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso changes in the selected anatomical regions on zzso maps in all 15 zzso 

zzso is a qualitative method that can rapidly detect zzso changes in acute zzso When combined with other ultrasound techniques and zzso it may well be valuable in the care of stroke unit patients, zzso as a screening method and for follow-up assessments of zzso zzso
