Specialized demands within the aquatic environment for over some 60 million years have shaped unique zzso expressions in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso consideration of these features, particularly in the great zzso has often been constrained by difficulties in securing adequate specimens for zzso We had the opportunity to examine external heart zzso in a rarely obtained and prepared zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The external zzso and in zzso relations of a zzso heart were examined zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso injections assisted zzso of coronary zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to clarify heart positioning within the zzso cavity in two younger zzso and zzso intact zzso 

The heart was zzso in form, with a blunt zzso and wide zzso it was zzso broad relative to height yet considerably compressed between nearly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The heart constituted zzso of body mass in the zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso the heart zzso forward on its long zzso placing the great zzso vessels in the region of the zzso zzso The zzso extended forward from zzso in parallel with the pulmonary zzso arched sharply to the left, producing in succession the zzso zzso left common carotid artery, and the left zzso zzso zzso of the zzso trunk yielded the right common carotid and right zzso zzso The zzso portion of the zzso arch was linked to the pulmonary trunk via the zzso zzso The zzso then swung zzso over the heart base, descending beneath the bodies of the zzso zzso The ascending zzso featured three bulbous zzso immediately zzso to the three zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso along the zzso boundaries of the left and right zzso were the left and right coronary zzso The arteries were similar in size and, because each sent contributions along their respective coronary and zzso zzso the heart can be described as bilateral relative to zzso zzso zzso were common within and between the two zzso zzso return from the heart was comprised of the great, middle, and right cardiac zzso all three zzso in the coronary zzso The right cardiac vein also included tributaries that emptied directly into the right zzso 

External heart zzso in the fetal zzso whale examined was distinguished by a zzso broad zzso with significant zzso between its zzso and zzso zzso zzso bulb zzso in combination with an zzso zzso arch may support blood service to the heart during zzso zzso service to the heart featured a complex vessel network with extensive zzso and intravenous zzso that enable many alternate blood zzso pathways and may be zzso to zzso fluctuations experienced by a large diving zzso
