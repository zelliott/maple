Previous studies have failed to predict zzso analog response with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso studies have shown that the density of zzso receptors in zzso tumors might be critical for zzso zzso 

The density of zzso receptors was calculated in zzso combining the zzso index obtained from zzso zzso zzso and the tumor volume obtained by zzso The ratio of these two values, called density index zzso was established in 32 of 37 consecutive patients with zzso zzso (11 had growth zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and 17 zzso It was compared with hormonal response, assessed in 15 zzso zzso on growth hormone or zzso stimulating hormone suppression (which was considered significant when it reached at least 50% of zzso zzso and with tumor shrinkage (which was considered significant when zzso or zzso of zzso zzso in 12 zzso and 14 zzso zzso 

In agreement with previous reports, zzso index is not zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso predicts both hormonal suppression and tumor shrinkage zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso obtained with zzso zzso zzso sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were zzso each, and a positive correlation was found between zzso and the percentage of tumor shrinkage zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso data allows the zzso of a zzso for zzso receptors that points out patients who can profit from zzso analog zzso
