zzso zzso of zzso seizure outcome have been reported in children with zzso sclerosis complex zzso We analyzed a large surgical series of pediatric zzso patients in order to identify zzso factors crucial for selection of subjects for zzso zzso 

zzso children with zzso who underwent zzso zzso surgery at Miami Children's Hospital were zzso zzso A total of 29 clinical, zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and surgical variables were analyzed and related to seizure zzso zzso zzso exact test, zzso zzso test, and zzso statistical Cox's model were used to examine the significance of associations between the variables and seizure zzso 

zzso patients zzso have been zzso 2 years after zzso zzso zzso complications occurred in five subjects zzso Complete removal of zzso tissue detected by both zzso and zzso zzso regional scalp zzso zzso patterns, and agreement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were the most powerful zzso of zzso zzso Other significant zzso included occurrence of regional scalp zzso zzso patterns, fewer brain regions affected by zzso presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factors such as age at seizure zzso zzso of infantile spasms or other seizure types, duration of zzso seizure frequency, mental zzso as well as types and extent of zzso did not influence zzso 

zzso features rather than zzso variables are the most important zzso of zzso seizure outcome in patients with zzso Our findings may assist in the surgical management of these zzso
