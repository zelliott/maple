We aimed to investigate the zzso of peripheral zzso disease zzso by examining magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso of functional zzso 

Despite the high zzso zzso and cost of zzso its zzso is incompletely zzso 

zzso patients (age 68 zzso 10 zzso with zzso zzso zzso index zzso zzso zzso had their most symptomatic leg studied by zzso zzso wall volume in the superficial zzso artery was measured with black blood zzso zzso zzso zzso calf muscle zzso and zzso MRS zzso recovery time constant zzso were measured at peak exercise in calf zzso All patients underwent magnetic resonance zzso zzso treadmill testing with zzso oxygen consumption zzso and a zzso walk zzso 

Mean zzso index of number and severity of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % wall volume 74 zzso zzso zzso 46 zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 87 zzso 54 s zzso 34 zzso 16 zzso zzso index, % wall volume, and zzso index correlated with most functional zzso zzso was the best correlate of treadmill exercise time, whereas calf muscle zzso was the best correlate of zzso walk zzso No correlation was noted between zzso and tissue zzso 

zzso limitations in zzso are zzso As measured by zzso and zzso zzso plaque burden, zzso severity, tissue zzso and zzso all play a zzso However, cellular metabolism is zzso from tissue zzso These findings suggest a potential role for therapies that zzso zzso increase tissue zzso and/or improve cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
