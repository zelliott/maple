The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of the new blood pool contrast agent zzso zzso to depict acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and delayed zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed 5 days after induction of zzso in a pig zzso zzso was correlated with zzso zzso imaging with zzso allowed detection of zzso zzso in all pigs zzso zzso zzso The zzso was recognized as a black spot on zzso as well as on a zzso zzso The signal intensity zzso zzso of normal versus zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso on the zzso image (both P values zzso zzso The contrast ratio between normal and zzso zzso was not significantly improved on zzso zzso suggesting largely intact vascular integrity outside the zzso zzso zzso is useful for depicting zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso imaging is promising in assessing vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
