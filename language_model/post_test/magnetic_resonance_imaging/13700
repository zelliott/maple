The aim of this study was the assessment of detection rate on zzso and description of zzso findings in patients with medically intractable zzso zzso patients with medically intractable zzso between the ages of 0 and 68 years old were evaluated by zzso on three planes with zzso zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso inversion recovery zzso and, if necessary, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions with zzso and zzso in 8 patients, cerebral tumors in 5 patients, zzso sclerosis in 16 patients, zzso zzso in 1 patient, cortical zzso in 3 patients, zzso in 2 patients, zzso zzso in 2 patients, zzso in 3 patients, cerebral zzso in 2 patients, zzso sclerosis in 1 patient, zzso encephalitis in 2 patients, zzso encephalitis in 1 patient, vascular zzso in 5 patients, and no zzso in 22 patients were zzso zzso resonance imaging has a high success rate in detecting structural brain zzso of both zzso and zzso locations, associated with medically intractable zzso zzso So zzso plays a primary role in planning of the treatment, primarily surgical therapy, by detecting structural zzso zzso
