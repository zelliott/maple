zzso to threat occur via two known independent processing zzso We propose that early, reflexive processing is predominantly tuned to the detection of zzso combinations of facial cues that signal threat, whereas later, reflective processing is predominantly tuned to zzso combinations of zzso To test this zzso we examined responses to zzso expression pairs zzso versus fear expression by direct versus averted zzso We report on two functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies, one employing prolonged presentations zzso of zzso pairs to allow for reflective processing zzso 1), and one employing severely restricted zzso zzso backward masked presentations of zzso pairs to isolate reflexive neural responding zzso zzso Our findings offer initial support for the conclusion that early, reflexive responses to threat are predominantly tuned to zzso zzso pairings, whereas later reflective responses are predominantly tuned to ambiguous zzso zzso These findings highlight a distinct dual function in threat zzso
