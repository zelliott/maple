We examined the relationship between the response to treatment and prognosis of patients with aggressive zzso 

We reviewed 33 patients with aggressive zzso treated with chemotherapy consisting of the zzso regimen followed by zzso Twelve patients had Stage I, 13 had Stage II, 6 had Stage III and 2 had Stage IV zzso According to the International zzso Index zzso 13 had low, 15 had zzso 2 had zzso and 3 had high zzso After three to six cycles of chemotherapy, zzso zzso was zzso We evaluated the response to treatment by zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the time of completion of chemotherapy and at the time of completion of radiation zzso The median follow-up period was 48 months zzso 

The zzso zzso survival rates of the patients with zzso positive zzso and zzso negative zzso after completion of chemotherapy were 78 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, there were no statistically significant correlations between zzso survival and the response after completion of chemotherapy determined by CT zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The response to treatment at the time of completion of overall treatment was not useful for prediction of zzso 

zzso positive zzso at the completion of chemotherapy before zzso may be associated with poor zzso
