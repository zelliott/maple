About 1 in 5 patients with zzso cell zzso have zzso zzso extension at zzso Level of zzso extension within inferior zzso zzso determines surgical approach, with higher extension requiring zzso zzso zzso invasion of inferior zzso zzso wall is associated with poor zzso We evaluated accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in assessing level of zzso extension of zzso cell zzso and predicting vessel wall zzso 

zzso and surgical database were reviewed from January 1999 to December zzso zzso patients with suspected zzso extension of zzso cell zzso underwent zzso zzso underwent zzso or zzso surgery at our institution and were included in final zzso zzso scans were reviewed to determine zzso extension and zzso adherence to the vessel wall, as assessed by zzso flow around the zzso tumor and its mobility during different zzso of cardiac zzso zzso findings were correlated with surgical findings to assess zzso 

There was zzso agreement zzso zzso between zzso and surgical findings regarding level of zzso extension of zzso zzso was highly sensitive and specific zzso in assessing zzso extension zzso zzso value, zzso Depending on sign used, sensitivities and negative zzso values in assessing zzso adherence to vessel wall ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso is highly accurate in staging zzso and zzso extension, aiding in accurate zzso surgical zzso zzso may help determine prognosis of zzso cell zzso by accurately assessing zzso adherence to the vessel zzso
