Acute zzso nerve zzso cause a zzso signal on zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso at the nerve zzso site and zzso to zzso The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the zzso evolution and resolution of MR nerve signal changes following zzso and zzso and to relate these findings to zzso and zzso The zzso zzso nerve of adult rats was zzso by a tight zzso that was removed 1 week later to induce complete zzso and nerve zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso and motor nerve zzso studies were performed parallel to zzso at multiple points of zzso Moreover, zzso nerves were taken for quantitative zzso zzso Nerve zzso on zzso zzso was present zzso to the zzso at thigh level 24 h after zzso preceding the occurrence of spontaneous activity on zzso by 24 zzso After 48 zzso the entire zzso nerve and its branches showed an increased signal down to the level of the lower zzso The increased nerve signal zzso with a zzso zzso beginning from week 2 after onset of nerve zzso in the zzso On zzso the first zzso zzso were detected at that time at the respective zzso zzso muscle action potential zzso in the foot muscle fully recovered 12 weeks after onset of nerve zzso that is, 2 weeks after resolution of the zzso along the entire nerve on zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso in the acute phase and later nerve zzso parallel to the increased nerve signal on zzso MR signal zzso occur as early as 24 h after an zzso nerve zzso and correlate with nerve fiber zzso and later with nerve zzso on zzso MR findings in zzso and zzso parallel the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a promising diagnostic tool for the early detection of acute zzso nerve zzso and monitoring of nerve zzso
