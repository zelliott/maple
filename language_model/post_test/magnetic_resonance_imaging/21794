Initially, zzso surgery was developed to treat functional brain diseases zzso The zzso of targets was based on zzso zzso and zzso The introduction of computer based imaging techniques, such as CT and zzso have offered the possibility to zzso anomalies and to approach them zzso The working principle of such a procedure consists of three zzso It is assumed that brain tissue does not move with respect to the zzso zzso Acquisition of the images and their registration with the patient, usually based on a series of reference points zzso that belong to a zzso zzso attached to the base ring of the zzso frame, zzso planning and simulation of the surgical intervention, mostly based on two-dimensional zzso images zzso along arbitrary directions, and zzso zzso guidance of the instruments mounted onto the zzso zzso This procedure has continuously been updated by new image acquisition techniques, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been used in addition to zzso Moreover, such images of different zzso can automatically be fused without using a zzso frame or other artificial zzso zzso zzso images for surgery planning have become available, a feature that has proved to be very useful for the cerebral blood zzso zzso The zzso frame can be replaced by a robot arm or an optical guidance zzso Registration of the instruments with the patient is then performed by using markers in the zzso bone or on the zzso or by means of zzso images such as zzso or video zzso Recently the use of registered video images has resulted in a number of experiments with zzso zzso and zzso The same working principle has shown to be useful for bone and bone related zzso As in brain surgery, the zzso of rigidity and zzso with respect to a reference are zzso Because bone structures are rigid and can easily be outlined in CT images, zzso zzso as well as zzso representations can be produced for the purpose of planning and even for zzso Unfortunately, for most zzso or soft tissue the above conditions of zzso and fixed position with respect to a reference are not zzso Real time imaging, partly due to the introduction of the zzso MR zzso may offer a zzso It can be expected that zzso diagnostic imaging will become increasingly important in the future, also for zzso
