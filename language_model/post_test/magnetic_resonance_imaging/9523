Learning is the process of accumulating zzso zzso can make the process of retrieving information more zzso The mechanisms by which repetition zzso the retrieval process, however, are not yet zzso Here, we used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of repetition on cued zzso In this study, participants were asked to zzso visually presented zzso unrelated word zzso The word presented on the left side served as the zzso and the word presented on the right side was the zzso In the first test phase, participants were presented with the cue and asked to recall the associated word zzso from the study zzso The second test phase was performed 20 zzso later using the same zzso Participants responded orally during the zzso between image acquisitions, and no feedback was zzso zzso activity for identical stimuli and responses across the two tests were zzso As compared with the first test phase, the right zzso zzso bilateral inferior zzso and zzso regions showed greater activity and the left inferior frontal areas showed reduced activity during the second test zzso These shifts in neural activity that occurred with repetition may reflect the dynamics of the retrieval zzso
