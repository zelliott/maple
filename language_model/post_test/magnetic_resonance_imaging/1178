This article describes the use of zzso factors for comparing dynamic zzso models zzso zzso are used to make zzso about effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso These zzso however, are contingent upon assumptions about model structure, that is, the connectivity pattern between the regions included in the zzso Given the current lack of detailed knowledge on anatomical connectivity in the human brain, there are often considerable degrees of freedom when defining the zzso structure of zzso In addition, many plausible scientific hypotheses may exist about which connections are changed by experimental zzso and a formal procedure for directly comparing these competing hypotheses is highly zzso In this article, we show how zzso factors can be used to guide choices about model structure, both concerning the intrinsic connectivity pattern and the contextual zzso of individual zzso The combined use of zzso factors and zzso thus allows one to evaluate competing scientific theories about the architecture of large-scale neural networks and the zzso interactions that mediate perception and zzso
