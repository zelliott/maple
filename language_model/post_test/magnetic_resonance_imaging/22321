The zzso site on the zzso zzso zzso complex offers a therapeutic target for acute focal zzso potentially devoid of most side effects associated with competitive and zzso zzso zzso 

A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in 70 zzso rats using the zzso zzso model of permanent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso In the first experiment, 20 rats received an initial zzso of vehicle or 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 in each zzso 30 minutes after zzso followed by a continuous infusion of the same dose per hour for 4 zzso zzso zzso with zzso acquisition was used to generate maps of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of zzso In a second experiment, 50 rats were assigned to five groups: vehicle and 10, 5, zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 in each zzso with the same dosing protocol but no zzso In both experiments, zzso volume was determined by zzso zzso zzso 

In the first experiment, before therapy was begun, there was no significant difference in zzso zzso zzso volume between the two zzso Over time, the zzso zzso rats had a significant delayed regional recovery of reduced zzso values in the peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected zzso volume at 24 hours after zzso was significantly smaller in the group treated with 10 zzso zzso than in the vehicle group zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso a reduction of zzso In the second experiment, zzso corrected zzso volumes in rats receiving 10, 5, and zzso zzso zzso were significantly smaller than in those receiving vehicle, a reduction of zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso to zzso doses of zzso initiated 30 minutes after zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso mapping disclosed a delayed treatment effect of this zzso zzso in focal zzso confirmed by the zzso zzso
