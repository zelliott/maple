zzso zzso pulse sequences can improve the detection of musculoskeletal zzso We zzso compared zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images, zzso zzso fast zzso zzso images and inversion recovery zzso zzso images to determine if any of these three pulse sequences is superior for depicting bone zzso and soft tissue zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso after intravenous injection of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images were obtained with a zzso magnet system in 35 zzso The zzso zzso and extent of 37 bone zzso and 67 soft tissue zzso image zzso zzso and motion zzso were zzso zzso by four zzso The number and size of zzso zzso the mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso were also statistically zzso More bone and zzso zzso were detected on the zzso and zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso The zzso images were significantly better than the zzso zzso and zzso zzso images for bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were also more conspicuous on the zzso and zzso zzso images than on the zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso The zzso extent and image quality were similar on all three sequences while motion zzso were most severe on the zzso and least severe on the zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso Fat zzso was zzso on the zzso images, resulting in a significantly higher mean zzso of bone zzso zzso The mean zzso of zzso zzso was higher on the zzso zzso images although the differences were not zzso The zzso zzso and zzso sequences are superior to the zzso zzso zzso sequence for depicting musculoskeletal zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso is greater on the zzso images, with comparable scan time and image quality but more motion zzso
