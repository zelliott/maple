The known regional zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and its role in various neural circuits in mild cognitive impairment zzso has given prominence to its importance in studies on the zzso associated with zzso The purpose of the current study was to examine the zzso functional connectivity patterns during rest in zzso patients and the impact of regional zzso matter zzso zzso on the functional zzso zzso and functional zzso data were collected from 14 zzso patients and 14 age, zzso healthy zzso We found that both the bilateral zzso showed reduced functional connectivity with the inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso and zzso regions zzso thalamus, zzso in zzso patients when compared with healthy zzso Moreover, the zzso connectivity with the zzso and zzso significantly correlated with the cognitive performance of patients as measured by zzso state examination zzso clock drawing test zzso and California verbal learning test zzso zzso When taking zzso zzso as zzso these results were approximately consistent with those without zzso although there may be a decrease in the statistical zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso may be the zzso of cognitive zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we also found enhanced functional connectivity between the left zzso and the right prefrontal zzso in zzso zzso This is consistent with previous findings of zzso increased zzso during cognitive tasks, and may represent a zzso mechanism in zzso zzso Together, the present study demonstrated the coexistence of functional zzso and compensation in zzso patients using zzso functional connectivity analysis, and thus might provide insights into biological mechanism of the zzso
