zzso zzso is a safe and effective treatment for chronic zzso that is zzso to the zzso zzso application of zzso in patients with zzso or zzso zzso zzso and long-term effects of radiation zzso on zzso cartilage, zzso enhancement and thickness were assessed in a zzso clinical trial by zzso 

Thirteen patients zzso age zzso zzso were treated with a median activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso with favorable physical properties and a well-documented clinical safety and efficacy zzso zzso was performed on a zzso MR unit using a circular polarized knee zzso 

After a mean observation period of 13 zzso a marked reduction in zzso enhancement was observed in 10 zzso The mean reduction in baseline zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso about 1 y after treatment, zzso zzso 9 of 13 patients zzso exhibited persistent response to radiation zzso The local clinical score, as defined by the reduction in pain, zzso joint zzso and by the increase in the range of motion, improved significantly zzso zzso zzso from a median of 7 zzso zzso to a median of 2 zzso zzso One year after treatment, changes in the local clinical score were related to the decrease in zzso enhancement in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no persistent adverse effects, nor was there evidence for any severe zzso damage to the zzso zzso On later follow-up images, the structure of the zzso cartilage remained zzso in all but 3 patients, who had new, superficial zzso most likely attributed to an active disease with persistence of zzso 

This study suggests that radiation zzso with zzso hydroxide is effective in terms of reducing chronic zzso without causing zzso harm to the zzso cartilage, as shown by zzso
