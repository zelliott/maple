In a previous study from our group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso in zzso syndrome as monitored by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso 12 (1999) zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate changes in cerebral zzso in patients with zzso syndrome as compared to normal zzso Data recorded in the zzso zzso and zzso areas demonstrated statistically significant decreases of the zzso ratios in the frontal and zzso areas but not in the zzso area for zzso syndrome zzso No statistically significant changes in the zzso ratios were measured in any of the areas zzso In this follow-up study, MRS data are reported for ten patients after correction of zzso which demonstrate a statistically significant recovery of the zzso levels in the frontal and zzso zzso No variation in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratios relative to zzso could be zzso zzso are interpreted as an zzso of the zzso degrading zzso by zzso which disappears after correction of zzso
