Assessment of cartilage zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso joint in patients following lateral zzso dislocation using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

MR images of 129 knees zzso age zzso range zzso grouped as acute zzso zzso zzso and chronic zzso zzso were zzso regarding the prevalence and severity of zzso cartilage zzso zzso of zzso were assessed using modified zzso 

In groups A, B, and C the prevalence of cartilage zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most zzso were located on the central zzso in groups A and B zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso lateral zzso and zzso whereas group C revealed all regions affected zzso zzso and zzso Of group A, zzso had mild zzso and zzso of group zzso Group C showed mild zzso in zzso and moderate zzso in zzso zzso zzso size and prevalence of zzso was correlated with number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and early zzso are common after zzso dislocation and appear to increase with the frequency of zzso Both conditions should be considered when interpreting zzso in such patients, because of implications for zzso 

zzso zzso zzso are very common after zzso zzso zzso The severity of cartilage zzso increases with number of zzso zzso zzso is common after zzso zzso dislocation, even in young zzso zzso zzso cartilage zzso is important after zzso zzso
