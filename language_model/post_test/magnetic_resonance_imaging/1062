Human and zzso zzso data suggest that the structural integrity of zzso zzso zzso during normal aging, especially in the zzso association regions and may result in zzso of widely distributed neural zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to assess the zzso of this process and its impact on brain aging and Alzheimer's disease zzso by evaluating zzso and zzso regions of the corpus zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation rates zzso an indirect measure of white matter structural integrity for the zzso and zzso were zzso The relationship between age and zzso differed in the two zzso A zzso zzso zzso function with an accelerating rate of decline beginning at age 31 best represented the zzso pattern while the zzso decline was zzso smaller, zzso and zzso These data suggest that the severity of age-related zzso breakdown is regionally heterogeneous, consistent with the hypothesis that differences in zzso properties make zzso regions more susceptible to this zzso In zzso this process is globally zzso consistent with an zzso deleterious process such as zzso zzso zzso zzso measures such as zzso may be useful in primary prevention studies of zzso
