To define the imaging characteristics of zzso zzso of the zzso 

Twelve patients with zzso zzso in the knee were studied with routine MR imaging, zzso zzso MR imaging, and CT over a zzso zzso There were 11 men and one woman, zzso years of age zzso age 48 zzso Four patients did not have a documented history of zzso at the time of the MR zzso The diagnosis of zzso zzso was provided by zzso and zzso examination (5 zzso by microscopic study of joint fluid (5 zzso or by characteristic clinical, laboratory and imaging findings (2 zzso 

In 15 MR examinations the zzso were located purely zzso in 10 zzso In the remaining five MR studies, zzso soft zzso or bone, or both, were zzso All the zzso zzso zzso low to intermediate signal intensity on both zzso and zzso zzso All five zzso MR examinations demonstrated a zzso peripheral zzso All 10 CT scans showed varying degrees of stippled zzso within the zzso The nature of the zzso was confirmed on zzso examination in three zzso 

zzso clinical manifestations of zzso may relate to zzso zzso zzso Such deposits present as masses on MR images with low to intermediate signal intensity on both zzso and zzso images and a characteristic enhancement pattern following intravenous zzso zzso These features relate primarily to internal zzso which are most evident on CT zzso MR evaluation (including zzso zzso zzso in some cases, with CT scanning allows accurate diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso
