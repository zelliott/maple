Analysis of zzso expression in zzso currently requires destructive and invasive molecular zzso of tissue zzso zzso methodology for assessing the location, zzso and duration of zzso expression in zzso will facilitate zzso correlation of therapeutic outcomes with zzso expression and will be useful in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a microbial gene undergoing clinical trials in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso We hypothesized that in zzso magnetic resonance zzso could be used to measure CD zzso expression in genetically modified tumors by directly observing the zzso conversion of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso agent zzso zzso The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated in subcutaneous human zzso zzso zzso in nude mice by using zzso CD zzso A zzso model was used to analyze the zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso The rate zzso for zzso zzso conversion zzso zzso zzso from the zzso tumor volume zzso and formation of zzso fluorinated zzso from zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The best fits of the zzso concentration data assumed zzso zzso suggesting that zzso was not saturated in zzso in the presence of measured zzso zzso zzso well above the in zzso zzso These results demonstrate the feasibility of using magnetic resonance zzso to zzso monitor therapeutic zzso expression in zzso This capability provides an approach for measuring gene expression that will be useful in clinical gene therapy zzso
