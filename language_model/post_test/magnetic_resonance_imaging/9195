To investigate the ability of delayed zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging of cartilage zzso and zzso mapping to evaluate the quality of repair tissue after zzso 

Twelve knees from 12 zzso were zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso depth, zzso with zzso was created in the zzso aspect of both the zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso were zzso at 24 weeks zzso and 48 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and a zzso zzso measurement for zzso mapping were performed with a zzso MR imaging zzso MR imaging findings were compared with zzso and zzso zzso 

In native cartilage, significant correlations were observed between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso and the zzso concentration zzso In repair zzso a significant correlation was observed between zzso and the zzso concentration zzso but not between the zzso and the zzso zzso In both repair tissue and native cartilage, no correlation was observed between zzso and the water concentration or between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso A zzso variation of zzso and a clear dependence of zzso on the angles relative to zzso were observed in native cartilage, but not in repair zzso 

zzso with zzso measurement might be useful for the evaluation of the zzso concentration in repair tissue after zzso zzso mapping might be useful for the differentiation of repair tissue after zzso from native zzso however, its potential to assess the specific zzso markers in native cartilage as well as repair tissue may be zzso
