The observation of tools is known to elicit a distributed cortical network that reflects close-knit relations of semantic, zzso and zzso zzso The neural zzso underlying the critical knowledge of skilled tool use, however, remain to be zzso In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging in 14 volunteers compares neural zzso during the observation of familiar tools versus equally zzso unfamiliar tools of which the observers have little, if any, functional zzso In a second zzso the level of zzso is investigated by comparing the neural effects of observing frequently versus infrequently used familiar zzso Both familiar and unfamiliar tools activate the classic neural network associated with tool zzso zzso comparison of the zzso patterns during the observation of familiar and unfamiliar tools in a zzso determined regions of interest zzso zzso reveals zzso in the zzso zzso lateral zzso middle zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso left inferior zzso zzso and left zzso It is hypothesized that the zzso activity zzso zzso knowledge, with zzso zzso storing information about limb and hand positions, and zzso storing zzso information about zzso zzso As no frontal zzso survived this contrast, it appears that zzso activity is unrelated to experience based motor knowledge of tool zzso but rather, is zzso by any zzso zzso Confrontation with unfamiliar or infrequently used tools reveals an increase in inferior zzso and zzso and lateral zzso zzso predominantly in the left hemisphere, suggesting that these regions reflect visual feature processing for tool zzso
