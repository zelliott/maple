The emergence of zzso magnetic stimulation zzso as a tool for investigating the brain has been remarkable over the past zzso While many centers are now using zzso little has been done to automate the delivery of planned zzso stimulation for research and/or clinical zzso We report on an zzso zzso positioned zzso system zzso developed for this zzso zzso sites are selected from functional images zzso onto anatomical MR images, and the system zzso a treatment plan and zzso positions the zzso zzso following that zzso A new theory, stating that cortical response to zzso is highest when the induced zzso is oriented parallel to cortical zzso is used by the zzso system for planning the position and orientation of the zzso zzso This automated approach to zzso planning and delivery provides a consistent and zzso method for zzso stimulation of cortical regions of the zzso We evaluated the zzso accuracy and utility of the zzso system with a zzso zzso zzso Treatment plans were evaluated for sites widely distributed about a head phantom with zzso zzso The overall accuracy in positioning the planned site of the zzso zzso was approximately 2 zzso similar to that reported for the robot zzso The estimated maximum range of error in planned zzso delivered zzso strength was zzso suggesting a high degree of accuracy and zzso in the planned use of the zzso zzso
