zzso as intrinsic zzso cells of the central nervous system zzso play a very sensitive, crucial role in the response to almost any brain pathology where they are activated to a zzso zzso Based on the characteristic features of activated zzso we investigated whether these cells can be zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso using zzso zzso iron zzso zzso The hypothesis of this study was that MR zzso zzso could not only reveal the extent of the zzso but also allow for assessing the status of zzso zzso Using zzso in cell culture experiments and in a rat zzso model, we showed that zzso can be labeled zzso zzso zzso are detected by zzso zzso within and around tumors in a typical zzso zzso zzso in zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso amounts of zzso that are significantly higher than those incorporated by tumor cells and zzso zzso zzso can be detected and zzso with zzso in cell zzso and the extent of the tumor can be seen in zzso rats in zzso We conclude that magnetic labeling of zzso provides a potential tool for zzso of zzso which reflects tumor zzso zzso Furthermore, the results suggest that zzso may yield functional data on the zzso reaction of the zzso
