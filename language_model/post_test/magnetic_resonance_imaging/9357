The aim of the study was to assess whether zzso zzso could identify high-risk primary zzso of the zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed in 14 patients with zzso localized primary zzso of the zzso followed by radical zzso as a form of primary zzso within 14 d of in zzso zzso To allow accurate zzso of zzso zzso with in zzso imaging, additional ex zzso MR images of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso image zzso were used for registrations of zzso zzso and zzso Volumes of interest from tumor and benign tissue were defined on the basis of zzso and were transferred into zzso zzso zzso volumes to calculate the mean zzso and maximum zzso ratio of tumor to benign prostate zzso On the basis of zzso expression in tumor zzso represented on a tissue zzso we assessed whether zzso zzso correlated with local zzso score and tumor zzso 

zzso confirmed 42 tumor zzso with zzso scores between 3 + 2 and 4 + 4, with volumes ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios were significantly increased in zzso score zzso + 3) zzso versus 3 + 4 and lower disease but failed to distinguish between 3 + 4 disease versus 3 + 3 and zzso zzso and zzso ratios were significantly increased in tumors with an zzso labeling index greater than or equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

On the basis of our preliminary data using ratios of tumor to benign prostate background, zzso zzso identified aggressive primary prostate zzso
