zzso resonance imaging zzso has been shown to be superior to zzso zzso for assessing zzso zzso and bone erosion in zzso arthritis zzso particularly in clinical zzso However, relatively little has been reported on the ability of zzso to evaluate zzso cartilage loss, or zzso narrowing zzso in the hands and zzso In a previous study, we adapted the zzso zzso Sharp zzso score for use with zzso zzso In this study, we compare zzso with zzso by using images from two zzso clinical zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso MR images of one hand and wrist from each of 47 subjects with zzso enrolled in one of two zzso clinical trials were evaluated by using the zzso and zzso methods by a single zzso experienced in the two zzso zzso and MR images were read independently on different zzso 

In total, zzso of 611 zzso were compared (one zzso joint of the thumb and 35 zzso zzso zzso were outside the zzso field of view and could not be zzso The 22 zzso subjects showed zzso with both zzso and zzso and 25 zzso subjects showed no zzso with either zzso No subject showed zzso with only one or the other zzso zzso showed high agreement with zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso by using zzso as the gold standard, was zzso specificity was zzso accuracy was zzso positive zzso value was zzso and negative zzso value was zzso 

This validation exercise suggests that zzso zzso scoring may offer a viable alternative to zzso zzso scoring in zzso clinical trials of zzso However, the relative zzso sensitivity of zzso to change and the ability to discriminate therapeutic effect on zzso were not evaluated in this zzso
