zzso proliferation may be zzso for zzso progression and response to zzso therapy of zzso The purpose of the present work was to investigate whether the proliferation activity of solid tumors can be assessed in zzso from the zzso relaxation times, zzso and zzso zzso of four zzso human melanoma zzso lines were zzso Three parameters were used to represent tumor proliferation zzso the volume doubling time, zzso the potential doubling time, zzso and the fraction of cells in zzso zzso was determined from zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso fraction were determined by flow zzso analysis of tumor cells after zzso zzso incorporation in zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso in zzso using zzso pulse zzso The proliferation parameters and relaxation times differed considerably among the tumor zzso zzso correlations were found between the proliferation parameters and the relaxation times, regardless of whether zzso zzso or zzso fraction was zzso zzso with short zzso and zzso and high zzso fraction had long zzso and zzso compared to tumors with long zzso and zzso and low zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso of fast growing tumors were probably due to increased zzso and/or zzso water zzso The present results suggest that in zzso zzso zzso can be used to discriminate between tumors of high and low proliferation zzso
