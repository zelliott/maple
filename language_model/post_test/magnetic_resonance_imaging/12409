zzso is a disorder of the brain that can lead to acute crisis and temporary loss of brain zzso Surgery is used to remove focal zzso that remain resistant to zzso An accurate zzso of zzso zzso has a strong influence on the outcome of zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is clinically used for zzso detection and treatment planning, mainly through simple visual zzso However, visual inspection in zzso can be highly zzso and subtle zzso structural abnormalities are not always entirely removed during zzso In this paper, we introduce a zzso zzso score based on computerized comparison of the zzso texture properties between brain zzso in zzso zzso Overlapping cubic texture blocks extracted from zzso zzso regions of interest zzso are expressed in terms of energies of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso score is defined as the zzso distance between the zzso and its corresponding zzso region in the brain, both expressed as ensembles of blocks in the feature zzso A zzso based on the proposed score allowed an accuracy of zzso with 10 control subjects and 8 patients with zzso zzso The approach therefore constitutes a valuable tool for the objective zzso evaluation of patients undergoing zzso zzso
