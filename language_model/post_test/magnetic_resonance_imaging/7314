With zzso zzso like calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso assessment of tissue zzso is zzso This study describes a zzso agent zzso to simultaneously enhance both imaging and zzso properties of such a bone substitute zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso beads were produced containing an iron oxide core to enhance bone magnetic resonance zzso zzso The same beads were zzso with zzso zzso to zzso the zzso protein zzso and finally received a calcium zzso zzso before being embedded in the zzso Both in zzso and in zzso tests were zzso In zzso testing showed that the zzso beads did not interfere with essential material properties like cement zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso could be efficiently released from the zzso In zzso testing in a zzso zzso zzso rat model showed long-term MR contrast enhancement, as well as improved zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso was released during zzso degradation and was not incorporated into the newly formed zzso In conclusion, the described zzso was shown to be suitable for zzso material degradation and bone healing zzso
