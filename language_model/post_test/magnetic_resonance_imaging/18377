Different structural as well as functional imaging techniques are becoming increasingly important in the investigation of patients suffering from an zzso zzso Available imaging procedures usually provide complementary data, but the images can not easily be compared due to differences in patient zzso zzso and slice zzso We studied the value of spatial integration of images from different zzso in a patient with an zzso stroke and used skin markers to integrate the obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso were performed in a patient, presenting with a right sided zzso caused by an zzso zzso Combination of zzso with CT demonstrated that the zzso visible on CT and zzso corresponded in size and zzso Furthermore, structural and functional images could readily be zzso thus allowing us to obtain accurate information in this stroke zzso Different imaging zzso provide complementary information in the acute phase of cerebral zzso and zzso matching can be of great value for improvement of our understanding of the zzso and course of zzso zzso
