Experimental disc injections in subjects with no history of low back zzso 

To determine in an experimental setting the relative pain response and zzso behavior in selected subjects without a history of low back pain undergoing zzso zzso This study aimed to select a study population that more closely represented patients undergoing zzso in clinical zzso 

Previous work has shown that in young, healthy men with little degenerative disc disease and no history of low back problems, zzso injections usually did not cause significant zzso This group differed from the patients who usually undergo zzso evaluation in clinical zzso Most clinical patients are older, have significant degenerative disc disease, have behavioral changes associated with chronic pain, and often have zzso zzso zzso The authors undertook to study zzso in subjects without low back pain but with clinical profiles similar to patients undergoing zzso in clinical zzso 

Twenty-six individuals, mean age 43 years, with no history of low back pain had zzso zzso according to the strict protocol of Walsh et zzso Of these, 10 were zzso 10 had chronic neck and arm pain, but no low back zzso and 6 had primary zzso disorders without low back zzso 

zzso positive pain response and zzso behavior with zzso were found in zzso of the pain-free group, in zzso of the chronic cervical pain group, and in zzso of the zzso disorder group completing the zzso zzso subjects had negative control zzso zzso with zzso disruption were more likely to be painful on injection, particularly in those individuals with ongoing compensation issues, chronic pain, or abnormal psychological zzso 

If strict criteria are applied, the rate of zzso zzso may be low in subjects with normal zzso profiles and without chronic zzso zzso painful injections were very common in subjects with zzso disruption and chronic pain or abnormal zzso zzso
