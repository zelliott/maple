zzso zzso zzso power zzso is an index of cardiac function which measures the innate blood pumping ability, or zzso of the left zzso zzso and its zzso assessment could prove useful in a variety of zzso zzso is defined as the maximum instantaneous product of zzso pressure and the rate of change of zzso volume, divided by the end zzso volume zzso We have zzso zzso zzso in humans by pairing magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso volume zzso with zzso pressure estimated using zzso artery zzso and a frequency domain transfer zzso In healthy volunteers undergoing cardiac zzso we have tested the sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso with zzso and to cardiac loading with zzso a zzso We have found that zzso pressures can be reliably estimated using a transfer function, which we generated and validated in a group of patients undergoing cardiac zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso was unchanged by zzso yet sensitive to zzso with a zzso increase at zzso levels half that given during routine clinical cardiac stress tests for zzso In conclusion, we have shown that zzso zzso can be assessed independent of cardiac loading in patients during routine zzso cardiac imaging zzso
