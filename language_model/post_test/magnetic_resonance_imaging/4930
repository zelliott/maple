Studies of absence zzso zzso using zzso with zzso zzso show a consistent network with prominent zzso zzso and a variety of cortical zzso Despite evidence suggesting a role of frontal zzso in seizure generation, group studies have not detected consistent zzso changes in this zzso We hypothesized that only a zzso may show frontal cortical zzso 

We studied 13 subjects with AS during zzso to zzso the different individual patterns of frontal cortical zzso associated with zzso 

Based upon visual inspection of zzso zzso maps we identified 2 zzso that could be distinguished by the zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso One group of patients zzso zzso 7) showed a primarily positive signal change zzso whereas the other group zzso zzso 6) showed a primarily negative signal change zzso When the zzso group was compared to the zzso group, zzso analysis revealed a larger positive blood zzso zzso zzso following onset of the AS in cortical and zzso areas beyond the zzso This suggests a basic biological difference between these zzso 

These observations suggest that there may be at least 2 mechanisms underpinning AS in individuals with absence zzso This may have zzso and genetic implications for understanding zzso zzso
