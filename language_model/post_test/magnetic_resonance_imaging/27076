It has been suggested that several regions of the brain, including zzso of the zzso zzso lobe zzso and the zzso zzso cortex, contribute to source memory success in a zzso manner, with most models highlighting the importance of memory process rather than material zzso For the zzso in particular, however, increasing evidence suggests that zzso zzso may be specialized for processing different materials, raising the possibility that source zzso activity may be zzso Previous zzso studies have not directly compared source memory activity for different categories of zzso and it remains unclear whether source memory effects, in the zzso or elsewhere, are influenced by zzso To investigate this issue, young participants were scanned during study while they made semantic judgments about words, pictures of objects and scenes, and during test when they retrieved the context zzso in which these items were zzso Several regions, including the zzso zzso and lateral zzso cortex, exhibited source memory effects common to words, objects and scenes, at both study and zzso zzso source memory effects were also identified in the left zzso inferior frontal and left zzso zzso for words and objects, respectively, at study but not zzso These results offer direct support for the hypothesis that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso make zzso contributions to zzso These results also point to a zzso between zzso and retrieval with regard to the influence of material on the neural zzso of source memory zzso supporting the idea that a relatively small proportion of the activity zzso by a stimulus during zzso is incorporated into an episodic memory representation of the zzso
