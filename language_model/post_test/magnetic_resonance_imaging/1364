zzso resonance zzso mapping was used in 24 normal subjects to study two-dimensional zzso profiles in the zzso and zzso zzso and to zzso both forward and reverse zzso The zzso flow zzso were validated by comparison with left zzso stroke volume in all subjects and by comparison with pulmonary flow zzso in zzso zzso was good with standard errors of the estimate of zzso and zzso zzso and correlation zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were similar in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso with maximum early zzso flow along the left zzso zzso Toward the end of zzso and throughout zzso a channel of reverse flow developed in the same region in the zzso zzso but in the zzso zzso it split to enter the zzso of zzso predominantly the left and the right coronary zzso Mean percentage ratio of zzso flow was zzso with the majority of retrograde flow occurring in early zzso The findings suggest that the retrograde flow is related to coronary artery flow and it is possible that zzso disease, which is known to influence zzso flow patterns, may also influence coronary zzso
