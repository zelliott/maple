To compare conventional two-dimensional zzso images with registered three-dimensional volume and zzso images for detecting subtle changes in the brains of infants and zzso 

Twenty-six patients (24 with zzso zzso and one each with zzso infection and zzso disease were examined on two or more occasions with conventional zzso zzso and zzso sequences as well as with 3-D zzso volume zzso A registration program was used to match the volume images to zzso dimensions, and zzso images zzso volume set minus the zzso were zzso The zzso images were compared with the 3-D and zzso images and graded for detection of changes in a variety of brain zzso 

In zzso to zzso of comparisons of different structures, the zzso images and the 3-D registered and zzso images showed changes equally zzso The 3-D registered and zzso images were better than the zzso images in zzso to zzso of comparisons for detection of changes in the cerebral zzso zzso brain zzso zzso and in zzso zzso significant differences were found between the graded performance of the registered 3-D images and the conventional zzso images in detecting cerebral zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso In the late phase following zzso cerebral zzso (1 to 11 zzso the 3-D registered and zzso images revealed growth of the brain at the margins of the zzso 

zzso registration of serial MR images may be of value in detecting subtle changes in the brains of infants and zzso
