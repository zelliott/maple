To investigate the feasibility of one-stop examination of zzso pulse wave zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso and zzso artery zzso zzso zzso in healthy volunteers by means of zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

A total of 32 healthy volunteers zzso years old; mean age, 29 zzso underwent repeated high-resolution zzso to assess zzso zzso ascending zzso zzso zzso zzso descending zzso zzso zzso zzso descending zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso artery with an zzso of 1 to 2 zzso Pulse wave zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso phase contrast zzso zzso with a zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess zzso and zzso with a zzso to zzso zzso zzso The image quality of repeated scans was evaluated with 4-point scores, and the agreement between the 2 scans was tested with zzso zzso The zzso of the results from repeated zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was assessed with zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso The method of zzso plot was also used to assess the agreement between repeated zzso 

Each examination including zzso zzso and zzso were completed in approximately half an zzso The image quality between repeated scans showed good agreement zzso value, zzso with a mean score of zzso and zzso zzso zzso between repeated zzso was high for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Good agreement between repeated zzso was found for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

Comprehensive assessment of zzso compliance and zzso zzso function can be achieved in a single examination using zzso high-resolution zzso with good zzso and within a reasonable amount of zzso
