zzso zzso may be an important zzso mechanism for left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exists to as to whether zzso zzso occurs due to blood pressure zzso reduction alone or if zzso mechanisms play a zzso We planned to test the hypothesis that for a similar zzso reduction, zzso zzso would be greater using a drug combination selected specifically to reduce neuroendocrine activity compared with one that did zzso 

zzso patients with hypertension and cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso proven zzso were allocated to one of two zzso zzso regimens for 6 zzso zzso were chosen on the basis of opposing zzso actions on the zzso system zzso and the sympathetic nervous system zzso one arm zzso zzso and zzso the other neutral zzso and zzso The primary end point was absolute reduction in zzso left zzso mass zzso 

All zzso zzso were highly comparable at the start and end of the trial zzso between zzso zzso was reduced zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso group and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was comparable between the two groups at baseline and decreased significantly in both treatment groups zzso Reduction in zzso was significantly greater in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

The magnitude of zzso zzso achieved by zzso the zzso and zzso neuroendocrine pathways is greater than that produced by comparable zzso reduction zzso This supports the hypothesis that neuroendocrine mechanisms are important in the zzso of zzso
