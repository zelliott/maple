zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging often shows that a slice is composed of several zzso each of which can be assumed to have a zzso homogeneous magnetic resonance spectrum, zzso a limb composed of fat, muscle, bone zzso and zzso We show how to use structural information from such a zzso image in order to increase the efficiency of subsequent localized zzso zzso Specifically, knowledge of the boundaries of N compartments makes it possible to reconstruct zzso zzso from zzso signals from an entire cross section with N or more different degrees of phase zzso Experimental studies of a zzso phantom show that this method zzso can be used to derive regional hydrogen zzso of a single slice from signals with as few as 2 zzso steps, although zzso transform zzso imaging requires 64 steps to achieve a result of comparable zzso zzso required only 16 zzso steps to obtain accurate regional single slice zzso in a human limb with three zzso zzso of similar quality, obtained by zzso transform zzso imaging, required 256 to zzso zzso
