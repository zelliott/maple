A function of working memory is to remember the zzso sequence of events, often occurring across different sensory zzso To study the neural zzso of this function, we conducted an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiment with a zzso memory zzso zzso were required to recall auditory digits and visual locations either in mixed order zzso or in separate order zzso To identify the brain regions involved in the memory of zzso zzso order, we compared the blood zzso zzso zzso response between the mixed and the separate order zzso As a control, cortical areas sensitive to the memory load were mapped by comparing the zzso condition with the zzso condition in the separate order zzso zzso show that the bilateral zzso right zzso zzso junction zzso and left superior zzso zzso had significantly more zzso in the mixed task than in the separate zzso Some of these areas were also sensitive to the memory load, whereas the right prefrontal zzso and zzso were relatively more sensitive to the zzso order but not the memory zzso Our study provides potential neural zzso for the episodic zzso a key component of working memory as proposed previously zzso Trends zzso zzso zzso
