Progressive zzso zzso is a neurodegenerative disease with progressive brain zzso over zzso It is unknown which specific brain regions decline over time, whether regional volume loss occurs in a linear fashion, and whether regional zzso zzso with clinical decline over time in progressive zzso zzso zzso subjects meeting probable progressive zzso zzso criteria were zzso recruited and completed 96 zzso scans over 2 zzso zzso models were zzso to determine which regions had significant zzso over time and whether decline was linear or zzso We assessed 13 regions across the brain, as well as zzso and zzso zzso Regional zzso were also correlated with change in clinical measures of executive function and gait and zzso motor zzso A linear decline was observed in all frontal and zzso regions, the superior zzso zzso the thalamus, the zzso zzso and the zzso as well as in the whole zzso zzso expansion was also zzso zzso decline was observed for the zzso middle frontal lobe and zzso zzso Rates of change in the superior frontal zzso thalamus, and zzso were beyond those expected in normal zzso zzso in frontal lobe volume and the zzso area correlated best to decline in clinical zzso In progressive zzso zzso zzso is occurring in multiple brain regions, particularly in those that have previously been implicated in the zzso zzso is mainly linear but can be zzso for some zzso The frontal lobe and zzso seem to be playing the most significant roles in the progressive worsening of clinical signs in progressive zzso zzso
