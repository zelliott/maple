We report a case of zzso zzso in which magnetic resonance imaging was useful in establishing the zzso A zzso man had zzso asthma that was well controlled with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and with oral zzso A zzso mass was found in the right lower lung field on a chest zzso taken during a regular physical zzso A CT scan showed a well circumscribed zzso mass, which was attached to an zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging showed a zzso mass in the superior segment of the right lower zzso On a zzso image the mass was zzso and had a zzso zzso On a zzso image the mass was zzso and had some zzso zzso We therefore diagnosed zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 months later revealed a substantial decrease in the size of the mass, which supported the zzso As in this case, zzso zzso can be difficult to diagnose because of the lack of a history of injury and because of the slow zzso In this case, magnetic resonance imaging was useful in making the zzso
