zzso ultrasound scans and conventional and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging zzso were performed on 16 zzso who presented with zzso The zzso scores were normal and subsequently no zzso or zzso cause could be zzso The aim of the study was to evaluate the extent to which early sequential imaging can zzso the cause of zzso in apparently zzso normal zzso Fourteen of the infants had zzso or zzso zzso on zzso and these were detected by ultrasound scanning in zzso Early ultrasound scanning detected the zzso zzso but the zzso zzso were often not seen until the end of the first week of zzso Early zzso however, was able to detect all the zzso zzso The evolution of the insult could be timed by using serial ultrasound scans and a combination of diffusion weighted and conventional zzso during the first week of life, confirming a zzso insult even in the absence of fetal zzso Although the zzso of these zzso remains obscure, serial ultrasound scans will detect the presence of cerebral zzso in zzso presenting with isolated zzso but additional zzso sequences will give better definition on type, site, and extent of the zzso
