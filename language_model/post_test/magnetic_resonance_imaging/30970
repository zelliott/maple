Old zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso are indicative of zzso They may be a marker of increased risk of zzso zzso zzso following zzso However, data regarding this potential risk are zzso 

A retrospective analysis of zzso zzso zzso was performed in consecutive stroke patients who received intravenous tissue zzso zzso zzso We aimed to assess the impact of zzso on the risk of cerebral zzso The frequency and location of zzso were assessed and compared with the location of zzso after zzso 

zzso patients were zzso zzso were present on zzso zzso in 8 cases zzso At day 1, symptomatic zzso occurred in none of 8 patients with zzso versus 1 of 36 patients without zzso At day 1, zzso occurred in 3 of 8 patients with zzso versus 10 of 36 patients without zzso At day 7, symptomatic zzso occurred in 1 of 8 patients with zzso versus 2 of 36 patients without zzso At day 7, zzso occurred in 5 of 8 patients with zzso versus 12 of 36 patients without zzso No zzso occurred at the site of an zzso zzso occurred within the zzso area in all patients who zzso 

Our study suggests that stroke patients with a small number of zzso on zzso zzso could be treated safely with zzso zzso prospective studies are needed to address the zzso value of detection of zzso with regard to the risk of zzso zzso
