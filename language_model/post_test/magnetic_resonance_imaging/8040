A large zzso imaging zzso zzso of symptom onset was found to predict the development of zzso middle cerebral artery zzso with high zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value, but sensitivity was zzso 

We tested the hypothesis that sensitivity can be improved by adding information from clinical follow-up examination after zzso 

We analyzed data from a zzso zzso zzso cohort study of patients with acute zzso stroke and middle cerebral artery zzso studied by stroke magnetic resonance imaging zzso of symptom zzso We used the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso to assess severity of symptoms after zzso We used the zzso and zzso Trees analysis to define the optimal thresholds of zzso imaging zzso volume and the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso after zzso in patients developing zzso middle cerebral artery zzso We calculated sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value for two simple zzso models based on acute zzso imaging zzso volume alone and acute zzso imaging zzso volume together with the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso after zzso 

Of 135 patients, 27 zzso developed a zzso middle cerebral artery zzso The zzso and zzso Trees analysis identified acute zzso imaging zzso zzso and the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso score after zzso zzso as optimal zzso zzso of the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso score after zzso in a simple zzso decision tree increased sensitivity from zzso to zzso while zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value remained largely zzso 

Clinical follow-up examination after zzso helps identify patients at risk of zzso middle cerebral artery zzso that are missed by zzso zzso based on early zzso imaging zzso volume zzso
