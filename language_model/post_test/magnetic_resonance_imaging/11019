The mechanisms that maintain zzso across the day, in the face in increasing sleep drive, are largely zzso The goal of this pilot study was to examine regional relative brain zzso metabolism during morning and evening zzso in healthy zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were conducted during quiet zzso in the morning and in the zzso zzso zzso mapping was used to compare relative regional zzso metabolism during the 2 zzso zzso also completed zzso ratings of zzso 

University of Pittsburgh General Clinical Research Center and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Thirteen healthy adults (10 women, 3 zzso mean age, 37 zzso 

zzso 

Relative regional zzso metabolism was significantly higher in the evening than in the morning in a large cluster of zzso and zzso zzso Volumes of interest centered on the zzso zzso formation, zzso zzso formation, zzso zzso locus zzso and zzso zzso also showed higher relative metabolism in the evening than in the zzso Relative zzso metabolism was significantly lower in the evening than in the morning in clusters that included structures in the right zzso zzso and zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with increased relative metabolism in zzso and zzso zzso systems and decreased relative metabolism in zzso cortical zzso These patterns may reflect input from the zzso timing system to promote zzso and/or the effects of increasing zzso sleep zzso
