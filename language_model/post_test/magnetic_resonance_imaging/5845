To measure the zzso density zzso the zzso and zzso relaxation time, and zzso transfer zzso effects in human median nerve at 3 T and to compare them with the corresponding values in zzso 

zzso of the zzso and zzso relaxation time were performed with an inversion recovery and a zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso The zzso ratio was measured by acquiring two sets of zzso zzso zzso images, with and without a zzso zzso zzso 

The median nerve zzso was zzso zzso 70 zzso The zzso zzso consisted of two zzso with average zzso values of 26 zzso 2 zzso and 96 zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso of 78 zzso zzso and 22 zzso zzso zzso The dominant component is likely to reflect zzso water and zzso zzso and the less abundant component originates possibly from zzso water zzso The value of zzso density of zzso zzso in median nerve was 81 zzso zzso that of zzso The zzso ratio in median nerve zzso zzso zzso was smaller than in muscle zzso zzso zzso 

zzso properties, such as zzso zzso and zzso relaxation time, and zzso ratio were measured in human median nerve at 3 T and were in many respects similar to those of zzso
