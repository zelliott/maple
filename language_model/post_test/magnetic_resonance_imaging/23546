The specific advantages of zzso electromagnetic remote sensing zzso zzso make it a particularly attractive technique for biomedical zzso We partially review our activities in utilizing this novel approach for the benefit of high and zzso field magnetic resonance imaging zzso and other applications, zzso for intensive care medicine and biomedical zzso We could show that our approach is beneficial for applications like motion tracking for high resolution brain imaging due to the zzso acquisition of zzso head motions with high spatial resolution, navigation for cardiac zzso due to our interpretation of the detected zzso mechanical contraction of the heart muscle and for MR safety, since we have investigated the influence of high zzso magnetic fields on zzso zzso From our findings we could zzso that zzso radar can serve as a zzso technique for high and zzso field magnetic resonance imaging and can be beneficial preserving the high resolution capability of this imaging zzso zzso it can potentially be used to support standard zzso analysis by complementary information where sole zzso analysis zzso Further zzso investigations have proven the feasibility of this method for zzso zzso detection and the rendition of a zzso contrast agent based zzso zzso zzso these zzso approaches we have carried out zzso simulations of a complex arrangement mimicking the zzso of a human torso model incorporating the geometry of the antennas zzso
