Studies of first zzso and second zzso language representation in the brain have not identified the timing and locations of neural regions involved in zzso and zzso zzso zzso offers high spatial and zzso resolution and can be employed to zzso subtle timing and neural control differences between zzso and zzso zzso We tested zzso adults in the zzso as they completed a picture verb generation task in zzso and zzso We found the expected progression of zzso from zzso to zzso to inferior frontal zzso We also observed the following zzso A sustained zzso and early zzso zzso zzso was observed only with zzso the zzso literature suggests that the former reflects an zzso and the latter an zzso zzso for language zzso zzso processes exhibited a lag and were bilateral compared to zzso zzso Finally, zzso and zzso activated adjacent language control in zzso zzso zzso
