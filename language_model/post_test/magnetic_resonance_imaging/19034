To investigate the zzso between scalp electroencephalogram zzso zzso and side of zzso zzso in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso 

We studied 184 consecutive patients with zzso without zzso other than those compatible with zzso zzso zzso In this study, we studied specifically zzso zzso and the results of scalp zzso zzso Patients were classified according to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as zzso bilateral zzso and bilateral zzso The zzso seizure zzso were also classified separately as zzso bilateral zzso and bilateral zzso The zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Only zzso of patients had zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, none of these had unilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were considered unilateral in zzso of patients, bilateral zzso in zzso and bilateral zzso in zzso zzso zzso were considered unilateral in zzso of patients, bilateral zzso in zzso and bilateral zzso in zzso The zzso showed unilateral zzso zzso in zzso of patients, bilateral zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and normal volumes in zzso There was a significant zzso between zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients with unilateral zzso zzso had zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Six zzso of the 33 patients with bilateral zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

We found a strong zzso between zzso and zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted zzso zzso zzso abnormalities and zzso seizure zzso with no false zzso Previous studies in addition to the present series support that a zzso zzso zzso evaluation in patients with zzso and unilateral zzso zzso would zzso the need for zzso zzso zzso
