zzso zzso experimental allergic zzso was induced in a strain 13 guinea pig by zzso of zzso spinal zzso zzso The spinal zzso was obtained after zzso with zzso zzso and examined with nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo images zzso time: 3 zzso echo times: 20 and 60 zzso were obtained from intact, isolated spinal zzso in a zzso zzso 50 zzso bore zzso The slice thickness of the images was 380 zzso and the zzso resolution was 40 X 40 zzso The images showed superficial areas of low signal intensity in the zzso regions of the white matter, in some instances with a zzso of higher signal zzso zzso these abnormalities corresponded exactly to areas of zzso Control images did not show these zzso The present high resolution imaging allowed a correlation between zzso and abnormal zzso signals in a small laboratory animal with an inflammatory zzso zzso
