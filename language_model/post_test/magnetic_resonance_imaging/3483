zzso zzso zzso is an important cause of headaches and an underlying spinal zzso leak can be demonstrated in most zzso Whether zzso leaks at the level of the skull base can cause spontaneous zzso zzso remains a matter of zzso The zzso aim was to examine the frequency of skull base zzso leaks as the cause of spontaneous zzso zzso 

zzso clinical, and zzso data were collected from a consecutive group of patients evaluated for spontaneous zzso zzso during a zzso zzso 

Among 273 patients who met the diagnostic criteria for spontaneous zzso zzso and 42 who did not, not a single instance of zzso leak at the skull base was zzso Clear zzso drainage was reported by 41 patients, but a diagnosis of zzso zzso could not be zzso Four patients underwent exploratory surgery for presumed zzso zzso In addition, the authors treated 3 patients who had a zzso zzso leak at the skull base following the zzso of a zzso angle tumor and developed zzso zzso spinal imaging, however, demonstrated the presence of a spinal source of zzso leakage in all 3 zzso 

There is no evidence for an association between spontaneous zzso zzso and zzso leaks at the level of the skull zzso Moreover, the zzso study suggests that a spinal source for zzso leakage should even be suspected in patients with zzso headaches who have a documented skull base zzso zzso
