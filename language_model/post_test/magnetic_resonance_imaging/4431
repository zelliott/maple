A comprehensive review of the literature dealing with zzso zzso was zzso 

The purpose of the review was to generate a position statement addressing criticisms of zzso zzso identify indications for its use, and describe a technique for its zzso 

zzso zzso remains a controversial diagnostic zzso There are concerns about its safety and clinical value, although others support its use in specific zzso 

Articles dealing with zzso zzso were reviewed and summarized in this zzso 

Most of the recent literature supports the use of zzso in select zzso Although not to be taken zzso many of the serious and high complication rates were reported before 1970 and have decreased since because of improvement in injection technique, imaging, and contrast zzso 

Most of the current literature supports the use of zzso in select zzso zzso applications include patients with persistent pain in whom disc zzso is suspect, but zzso tests have not provided sufficient diagnostic information or the images need to be correlated with clinical zzso Another application is assessment of discs in patients in whom fusion is being zzso zzso role in such cases is to determine if discs within the proposed fusion segment are symptomatic and if the adjacent discs are zzso zzso appears to be helpful in patients who have previously undergone surgery but continue to experience significant zzso In such cases, it can be used to differentiate between zzso zzso and zzso disc zzso and to investigate the condition of a disc zzso or adjacent to, a fused spinal segment to better delineate the source of zzso When minimally invasive zzso is being considered, zzso can be used to confirm a contained disc zzso which is generally an indication for such surgical zzso zzso zzso should be performed by those well experienced with the procedure and in sterile conditions with a double needle technique and zzso imaging for proper needle zzso Information assessed and recorded should include the volume of contrast injected, pain response with particular emphasis on its location and similarity to clinical symptoms, and the pattern of dye zzso zzso zzso is followed by zzso zzso zzso scanning to obtain more information about the condition of the zzso
