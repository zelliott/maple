Free recall zzso is a ubiquitous zzso retrieval operation that zzso affects our day-to-day zzso The neural zzso of zzso however, are not sufficiently zzso partly due to the zzso challenges presented by its emerging property and zzso zzso Using zzso and performance measures, the zzso zzso of zzso were studied in 33 healthy participants who repeatedly zzso and retrieved zzso zzso was determined either overtly via verbal output zzso 1) or covertly via motor responses zzso zzso Brain zzso during zzso was characterized by two types of zzso zzso analyses of retrieval changes over zzso First was the zzso in zzso response time zzso assumed to represent the zzso of memory search over time, as increased effort was zzso Using a zzso of this zzso in whole brain analysis revealed the default mode network zzso longer zzso within zzso blocks correlated with less zzso of the zzso representing its greater zzso Second was the increased number of words retrieved in repeated zzso cycles, assumed to represent the learning zzso Using this zzso in whole brain analysis revealed increased zzso in the zzso zzso less zzso Together our results demonstrate the naturally occurring dynamics in the recruitment of the zzso during zzso of internally generated processes during zzso The contrasting effects of increased and decreased recruitment of the zzso following dynamics in memory search and learning, respectively, supports the idea that with learning zzso is less dependent on neural operations of zzso processes such as those initially needed for memory zzso
