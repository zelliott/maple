The human zzso plays a crucial role in processing affective information conveyed by sensory zzso zzso expressions of fear and anger, which both signal potential threat to an observer, result in significant increases in zzso activity, even when the faces are unattended or presented briefly and zzso It has been suggested that zzso signals from the zzso travel to the zzso via separate cortical and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso underlying unconscious zzso Here we exploited the phenomenon of zzso rivalry to induce complete suppression of affective face stimuli presented to one zzso Twelve participants viewed brief, zzso visual displays in which a fearful, happy, or neutral face was presented to one eye while a house was presented simultaneously to the zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study zzso in the zzso and zzso visual areas for consciously perceived versus suppressed face and house zzso zzso within the zzso and zzso zzso increased significantly for perceived versus suppressed faces and houses, zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in response to fearful versus neutral faces, regardless of whether the face was perceived consciously or suppressed because of zzso zzso zzso activity also increased significantly for happy versus neutral faces, but only when the face was zzso This zzso pattern suggests that the zzso has a limited capacity to differentiate between specific facial expressions when it must rely on information received via a zzso zzso We suggest that this limited capacity reflects a zzso between specificity and speed of zzso
