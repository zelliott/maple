Individual differences in brain response to emotional stimuli have previously been associated with gene variations within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We recently reported that these two genes exhibit an additive effect, based on recordings of zzso zzso zzso from individuals viewing emotional zzso The current study was designed to replicate and extent this initial report in an independent study sample, and use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to identify specific neural zzso that may mediate the zzso additive zzso Furthermore, we sought to obtain zzso evidence for a zzso additive effect by collecting zzso data from the same individuals engaged in two different zzso tasks, using emotional and neutral facial expressions and word zzso We found evidence for an additive effect of zzso zzso which was most robust in the zzso a region rich in both zzso and zzso zzso but was also observed in the zzso at a less stringent zzso and in other cortical zzso The additive effect was more robust effect for zzso than for verbal zzso and more robust for zzso than for positively zzso zzso These findings confirm and extend the additive effect of two critical genes in the zzso regulation of neural processing of affective zzso and identify the zzso as a critical site where is zzso regulation takes zzso
