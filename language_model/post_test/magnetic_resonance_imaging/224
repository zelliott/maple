The purpose of our study was to determine the statistical significance of thresholds of relative cerebral blood volume zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso ratios in grading cerebral zzso 

In this retrospective study, 51 patients with zzso confirmed primary cerebral zzso who had undergone conventional MR imaging, dynamic zzso zzso zzso MR imaging and diffusion MR imaging were zzso A retrospective blinded analysis of the imaging findings including the zzso and diffusion parameters was zzso The zzso zzso were obtained from regions of maximum zzso Minimum zzso values were obtained from the region of maximum zzso within the tumor and from the corresponding opposite white zzso zzso grade determined with the two methods were then compared with the zzso zzso zzso tests were performed to compare the zzso and zzso between tumor zzso zzso operating characteristic analyses were performed to determine optimum thresholds for tumor grading and also to calculate the sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso for identifying high-grade zzso 

zzso analysis demonstrated a threshold value of zzso for zzso to provide sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in determining high-grade zzso An zzso value of zzso zzso was defined as a threshold below which tumors were classified as high-grade zzso and a sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso of 90, zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso zzso differences were noted in the zzso ratios, zzso and zzso ratios between low- and high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Combining zzso and zzso with conventional MR imaging increases the accuracy of zzso imaging grading of zzso zzso The zzso zzso had the most superior diagnostic performance in predicting zzso zzso Absolute zzso values or zzso ratios were also helpful in zzso grading of zzso zzso values can be used in a clinical setting to evaluate tumors preoperatively for zzso grade and provide a means for guiding treatment and predicting zzso patient zzso
