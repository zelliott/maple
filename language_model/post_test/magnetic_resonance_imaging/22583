We used zzso to measure muscle sympathetic nerve activity zzso in 25 zzso subjects and correlated these results with the presence or absence of signs of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso were divided into 3 groups based on zzso findings: zzso no zzso evidence of zzso zzso zzso image showing artery in contact but not zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso image showing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were performed at rest, after a zzso zzso and during zzso zzso The zzso during rest in the zzso group was significantly higher than that in the zzso and zzso groups zzso versus zzso and zzso spikes per minute, zzso However, the blood pressure in the zzso group was slightly but not significantly higher than that in the other 2 groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The increases in zzso blood pressure, and heart rate during the cold zzso and zzso exercise tests were zzso Our results show that, although resting zzso is elevated in patients with true zzso of the zzso zzso patients without zzso or with zzso contact but not overt zzso of the zzso zzso have similar zzso These findings are important for zzso among zzso patients with zzso individuals who may have associated zzso zzso such as increased sympathetic zzso
