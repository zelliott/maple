The association of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso has drawn the attention of many pediatric surgeons and has become an important subject in clinical management, but the zzso and causes of this association are not well zzso 

During the last 14 years, we operated on 33 BA patients by zzso zzso Five patients could not be followed up over a zzso period, so the remaining 28 patients had their zzso structure investigated by periodic magnetic resonance imaging zzso and were confirmed at zzso The authors also reviewed the zzso conditions of these patients and the zzso changes in the liver biopsy and the zzso zzso specimens taken at zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in 6 of the 28 patients studied zzso Of 16 patients who were operated on after 1989 and are undergoing follow-up by zzso 4 zzso had zzso zzso Five of the 6 patients with zzso had episodes of zzso before or at the time of discovery of the zzso and 4 of them have had their zzso reappear since the discovery of the zzso zzso The zzso spaces zzso with zzso and the number of zzso ducts had increased in the group with zzso compared with those in the group without zzso zzso The zzso duct maximum size in the zzso zzso zzso was similar in the groups with and without zzso but a zzso of the zzso lining cells in the zzso and a zzso and inflammation around the duct had increased in the group with zzso compared with those in the group without zzso zzso zzso the zzso found in the zzso and the inflammation around the zzso duct found in the zzso were induced as a zzso factor affecting zzso zzso 

The association of zzso zzso zzso in BA after zzso is zzso The zzso change in the zzso and the inflammatory process around the zzso ducts might be potential causes of zzso zzso
