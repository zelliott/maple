Lung zzso remains one of the most difficult zzso to be zzso by means of magnetic resonance imaging zzso Several zzso techniques are routinely used for lung zzso However, zzso zzso zzso technique has not been associated with pulmonary zzso Here, we evaluated zzso zzso in the rat lung after a zzso zzso using a zzso T magnet with a zzso zzso echo time zzso Our data showed that the signal intensity was increased in lungs receiving a zzso solution compared with a control solution to the zzso MR signal enhancements above zzso were measured in lung zzso following 200 zzso zzso of a 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, may be a useful novel tool for enhancing signal intensity and image contrast in lung zzso
