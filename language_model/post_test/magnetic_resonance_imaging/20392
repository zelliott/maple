In zzso particularly increased zzso zzso but not total zzso zzso tissue mass is a major source of zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso more than zzso is associated with zzso dysfunction zzso which is an accepted risk factor for zzso zzso we hypothesized that during a lifestyle intervention specifically a decrease in zzso rather than zzso is associated with improved zzso and vascular zzso molecules in type 2 diabetes prone zzso 

zzso were done in 189 individuals zzso zzso zzso at increased risk of type 2 diabetes, who underwent a zzso lifestyle zzso zzso expressed as flow zzso zzso zzso of the zzso artery, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by magnetic resonance zzso was zzso 

There was a mean decrease in body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso increased zzso zzso The change in zzso was not associated with change in body weight zzso or zzso zzso but with a decrease in zzso zzso zzso In a post hoc analysis, the subjects were divided by the median change in zzso into zzso and zzso zzso increased only in the zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso Also zzso significantly decreased only in the zzso (from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

During a lifestyle intervention, not weight loss or decrease in zzso but decrease in zzso is associated with improved zzso in individuals prone to type 2 zzso zzso primary cardiovascular prevention should focus specifically on reducing zzso rather than body weight zzso
