zzso resonance imaging is an established diagnostic tool involving exposure to zzso magnetic fields zzso of patients and health personnel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maintenance zzso Occupational exposure to zzso will be governed by the rules of European Union zzso zzso covering health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to risks from electromagnetic zzso which must be incorporated into national law by each member state by 30 April zzso It applies to all employment sectors and addresses short-term adverse health effects on workers, but excludes possible long-term zzso This study aims to critically review the recent literature on the topic so as to propose guidelines on the need to provide information and training of workers and appropriate health zzso 

To identify the studies published after the review by the World Health Organization zzso in the series Environmental Health zzso a search was carried out on zzso The strategy defined for searching studies was based on the following zzso terms, which zzso addressed the problem: zzso zzso zzso Imaging, zzso zzso Fields, zzso zzso zzso effects, zzso Occupational zzso These terms were used to create appropriate search links to identify the studies according to the following criteria: zzso English language, zzso inclusion of review, zzso and cohort study, controlled trials, zzso abstract availability zzso human effects, mechanism of action, zzso or in zzso studies, zzso studies published after 1 January 2004 not considered in the WHO zzso zzso studies were available as zzso 

Although studies carried out at cellular level are valuable in investigating mechanisms of interaction, they did not show any specific effect as a consequence of exposure to zzso Experimental studies carried out on volunteers showed that short-term exposure to zzso zzso a variety of acute zzso zzso zzso zzso and a metallic taste in the mouth occur during body or head movement with zzso in T range and may result in a possible negative influence on the performance of workers during critical procedures, zzso changes in blood pressure and heart rate within the range of zzso zzso occur for zzso to zzso up to 8 T zzso induction of zzso heart beats and increased likelihood of zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso may occur in susceptible zzso zzso a decrease of working memory and zzso coordination are zzso for zzso to zzso T zzso and may affect the performance of workers executing intricate zzso The limitations of the available studies, however, do not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn about the effects of zzso on the described zzso 

According to zzso zzso the employer must ensure that workers exposed to risks from electromagnetic fields receive all necessary information about the potential risks and that appropriate health surveillance is carried out to prevent any adverse health zzso According to the reported data it will not be easy to proved information and training and the appropriate health surveillance for the exposed zzso In fact, information and training activities might be influenced by the uncertainties resulting from the available evidence, since ability will be needed to find a balance between few certainties and several doubts, while the same uncertainties might reflect on the preventive and zzso examinations aiming at preventing short-term adverse health zzso
