zzso sclerosis zzso is a zzso genetically inherited disease with variable zzso characterized by zzso and zzso affecting multiple zzso MR is the imaging method of choice to demonstrate structural brain zzso in zzso 

To compare MR sequences and determine which is most useful for the demonstration of each type of brain zzso in zzso zzso 

We reviewed MR scans of 18 zzso patients for the presence of cortical zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso giant cell zzso zzso on the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images before and after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence with an additional zzso transfer contrast medium pulse on resonance zzso zzso and zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were found in significantly zzso larger numbers and more conspicuously in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence was far superior to other methods in detecting white matter zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and after zzso zzso sequences in the detection of zzso zzso zzso sequence showed less sensitivity than the others in identifying the zzso zzso zzso sequences after zzso injection demonstrated better the limits of the zzso 

We demonstrated the importance of appropriate zzso sequences for diagnosis of the most frequent brain zzso in zzso Our study reinforces the fact that each sequence has a particular application according to the type of zzso zzso zzso injection might be useful in detecting zzso however, the parameters of size and location are also important for a zzso diagnosis of these zzso
