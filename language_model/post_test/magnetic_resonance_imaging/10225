Acute experimental zzso zzso zzso a cortical zzso pattern that differs from that typically seen during experimental zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso zzso to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow zzso in patients with clinical zzso Nine patients with peripheral nerve injury were scanned during rest, zzso zzso and brushing of normal zzso zzso PET data were analyzed for the whole group and for single zzso zzso stimulation activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in every zzso Whereas normal brushing activated most strongly the zzso insular cortex, zzso brushing produced an zzso zzso in this zzso Another important difference between normal and zzso brushing was the absence of a zzso primary zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso No zzso zzso was observed during zzso or control zzso Although no anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso could be demonstrated in the group analysis, single subject analysis revealed that four patients activated this region during zzso zzso A direct post hoc comparison of brush zzso zzso zzso changes showed that zzso was associated with significantly stronger zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso brushing more strongly activated zzso and BA zzso These findings indicate that activity in the cortical network involved in the zzso processing of zzso pain is zzso in zzso zzso Instead, there is an zzso of activity in the zzso and insular zzso which is probably due to the stronger emotional load of zzso pain and higher zzso demands of processing a mixed sensation of brush and zzso
