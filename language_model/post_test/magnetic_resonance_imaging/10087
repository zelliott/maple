The zzso zzso has a complex internal architecture, which suggests the contraction is not uniform within the zzso The zzso contraction may cause zzso changes of the zzso outer zzso This study aimed to zzso the outer shape changes of the whole zzso with zzso by zzso measurement of serial ultrasound zzso 

zzso zzso images zzso to the FH plane, 3 zzso zzso of the right zzso of five healthy men were obtained with a real-time zzso equipped with a 13 zzso zzso zzso To define the relationship between the zzso and zzso we used a zzso mechanical stage with a zzso zzso were made during muscle relaxation and zzso zzso The distance between the lateral and zzso outlines of the muscle was measured at intervals of zzso from the origin to zzso in each image as the thickness at the corresponding measured zzso 

The thickness of the relaxed and contracted muscle (R and zzso and its difference zzso varied among the measured zzso Muscle thickness at most measured sites increased with zzso whereas it decreased at several sites, mainly near the origin and zzso There were positive correlations in every subject both between R and C, and between C and zzso On the other hand, the correlation between R and Delta were negative or zzso 

Changes of thickness with zzso showed great disparity within the zzso which may result from the complexity of the contraction properties due to the zzso structure and functional zzso
