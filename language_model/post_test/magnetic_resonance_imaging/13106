zzso and environmental factors influence brain structure and function zzso The search for zzso anatomical features and their influencing genes would be accelerated with detailed zzso maps showing the degree to which brain zzso is genetically zzso As part of an zzso study that will scan zzso zzso we applied zzso zzso to zzso zzso differences in 23 pairs of identical twins and 23 pairs of same-sex fraternal twins zzso age: zzso zzso zzso All 92 zzso zzso brain zzso scans were zzso registered to a common space using a zzso zzso zzso approach to zzso zzso differences across zzso A zzso method was used to improve volume zzso zzso fields driving each zzso anatomy onto the common template were analyzed to create maps of local zzso excesses and deficits relative to the standard zzso Using a new structural equation modeling method, we zzso the zzso proportion of zzso in volumes attributable to additive zzso or dominant zzso genetic factors versus shared environmental zzso or unique environmental factors zzso The method was also applied to various anatomical regions of interest zzso As hypothesized, the overall volumes of the brain, zzso zzso thalamus, and each lobe were under strong genetic zzso local white matter volumes were mostly controlled by common zzso After adjusting for individual differences in overall brain scale, genetic influences were still relatively high in the corpus zzso and in zzso brain regions such as the zzso zzso while environmental influences were greater in frontal brain regions that have a more protracted zzso zzso
