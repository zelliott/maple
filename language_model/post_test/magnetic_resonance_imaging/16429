To determine the zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of zzso of the zzso zzso 

Six patients with zzso zzso in the zzso cavity were zzso zzso All six patients underwent CT and three patients also underwent zzso The following imaging features were zzso size, margin, CT zzso zzso signal intensity, and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso curve zzso of dynamic zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso were zzso in two zzso 

All zzso had zzso zzso The mean size was 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso CT, the zzso appeared zzso to cerebral zzso matter in four zzso and slightly zzso in two zzso zzso zzso appeared zzso On zzso imaging zzso and slightly zzso on zzso in three zzso The zzso showed moderate contrast zzso Two patients underwent zzso zzso and the zzso showed a rapidly enhancing and slow zzso zzso The mean apparent diffusion zzso zzso value were zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the two zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso masses without zzso erosion are typical features of zzso zzso rare, this entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of benign zzso in this zzso
