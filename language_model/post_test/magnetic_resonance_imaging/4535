zzso resonance imaging zzso is superior in zzso zzso and zzso information and has subsequently been married to the ability of magnetic resonance zzso zzso to provide insight into the zzso changes underlying zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso allows the zzso in zzso collection and measurement of chemical information from a selected volume of tissue zzso 

We conducted a prospective trial in 23 patients with brain mass zzso and 16 normal subjects using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso The zzso were analyzed for zzso zzso zzso compounds zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The ratios of the compounds in tumors were compared to zzso 

The tumors showed significant decreases in the mean peak height ratios of zzso zzso and significant increases in zzso when compared to tissue from normal zzso zzso was elevated in all of the zzso and zzso In benign tumors, zzso was usually elevated while in zzso zzso was often normal or zzso The four zzso tumors showed zzso zzso and zzso that were similar to zzso zzso varied with tumor type and was elevated in many zzso primary brain zzso 

zzso MRS is a powerful tool for safe, zzso analysis of tissue chemistry in zzso Analysis of zzso tumors reveals significant trends that might eventually be used in the zzso of tumor zzso and evaluation of the efficacy of tumor zzso
