zzso and combined ankle and zzso zzso MR zzso in zzso were used to evaluate the ligaments of the zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlation was zzso 

Ten zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso were initially zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR zzso followed by zzso and zzso analysis, was then performed to allow better assessment of the ligaments of the lateral and zzso zzso zzso 

In all subjects, MR zzso provided superior zzso of the zzso and zzso structures, as well as the zzso The lateral zzso and zzso zzso ligaments were best seen in the zzso and zzso planes, zzso The zzso plane was best for visualizing the zzso zzso and the zzso plane was best for evaluating the zzso zzso zzso The anterior and zzso zzso ligaments and the zzso zzso ligament zzso and deep zzso were best seen in the zzso zzso zzso analysis was correlated to zzso zzso and showed the attachment sites of these zzso 

Combined ankle and zzso zzso MR zzso enhances zzso of the ligaments attaching to the zzso and lateral zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso
