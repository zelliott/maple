A novel image processing scheme for zzso the zzso contours in zzso magnetic resonance data sets is zzso The scheme incorporates the method of active zzso models, a recently introduced paradigm for zzso zzso Its performance is nearly ideal for zzso zzso Although the performances for zzso images and zzso images drop slightly, zzso satisfactory extraction still can be obtained for zzso zzso Due to high degree of automation, the scheme should help speed up some image processing applications that require the zzso of the zzso zzso
