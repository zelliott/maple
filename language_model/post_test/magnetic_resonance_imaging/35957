zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the heart displays cardiac structures with excellent zzso This ability should be useful for assessment of cardiac physiology where acquisition of zzso and zzso images is zzso In this study, left zzso ejection fraction was determined in 50 patients from zzso long axis views of the left zzso using the area length zzso zzso views were obtained by electronic zzso zzso For comparison, all patients had zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso patients were also studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso determined by zzso and zzso were closely correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso was also acceptable zzso zzso zzso In addition to global left zzso function, MR images provide information about regional wall zzso In order to acquire a three-dimensional set of images at various zzso of the cardiac cycle, shorter imaging times are zzso A new imaging technique with potential for functional studies uses low flip angles, short repetition times and zzso refocused zzso Up to 40 images can be obtained within one cardiac zzso When displayed in a zzso fashion, visual assessment of cardiac motion, zzso blood flow, and zzso wall zzso is zzso Potential advantages of functional studies by zzso are the zzso acquisition of anatomical information and the three zzso frame of zzso
