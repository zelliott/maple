We present a fast zzso technique zzso to microscopic zzso zzso The method combines elements of zzso zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso with the acquisition of multiple zzso lines within a single zzso The sequence results in a much reduced imaging time as compared with conventional zzso zzso zzso The feasibility of the method is demonstrated for zzso zzso tracking in the cat brain using an imaging time of 153 zzso The relative cerebral blood volume maps created with this method are comparable with those obtained with conventional zzso
