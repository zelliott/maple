To assess the use of in zzso zzso MR zzso for characterization of zzso mass zzso and to ascertain its reliability in grading of zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with zzso masses were subjected to volume selective zzso using zzso echo acquisition mode zzso time, 20 and zzso zzso and spin echo zzso time, 135 zzso zzso The zzso zzso were grouped into zzso and zzso as judged with MR zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed in two samples each of brain zzso zzso cyst, and zzso using ex zzso high-resolution MR zzso 

The in zzso zzso appeared distinct compared with normal brain in all the zzso All high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso showed high zzso and low or absent zzso and zzso along with zzso and/or zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized by low zzso and zzso and high zzso and presence of only zzso zzso ratio was significantly lower and zzso ratio was significantly higher in high-grade zzso than in zzso zzso zzso of lipids suggested a higher grade of zzso All zzso zzso zzso 7) showed zzso and zzso whereas zzso was visible in only four zzso zzso showed zzso from zzso and an zzso resonance at zzso zzso zzso could be differentiated from zzso by the presence of zzso in the zzso Among the zzso masses, zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) showed zzso only from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed only zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso MR zzso helps in tissue characterization of zzso mass zzso zzso is a reliable technique for grading of zzso when zzso and zzso ratios and presence of lipids are used in zzso
