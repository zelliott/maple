To determine the effect of an imbalance in zzso pressure that may be involved in zzso dental compensation in the zzso and asymmetry of the dental arch in subjects with facial zzso 

We performed simultaneous measurement of the zzso pressure on the zzso right first zzso when subjects without facial asymmetry zzso shifted the zzso zzso zzso pressures in the rest position zzso zzso position zzso and zzso position zzso were zzso Moreover, zzso magnetic resonance images were obtained in zzso zzso and zzso 

Tongue pressure tended to decrease in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while cheek pressure tended to increase in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso pressure ratio tended to decrease in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were significant positive (in zzso and negative (in zzso correlations between displacement of the tongue and tongue zzso 

This imbalance in zzso pressures in the zzso zzso position may partly explain zzso dental compensation in the zzso and asymmetry of the dental arch in subjects with facial zzso
