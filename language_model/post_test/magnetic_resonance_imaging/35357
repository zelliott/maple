To evaluate whether fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso adds useful information to the one obtained by ultrasound in fetuses with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso findings were analyzed zzso in 38 fetuses with proven zzso zzso zzso Both techniques were performed on the same week at a mean zzso age of 33 weeks zzso The referral indications were maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso and ultrasound findings zzso zzso zzso The results were compared with the zzso examination in cases with fetal death or termination of pregnancy zzso or the zzso neurological zzso 

The 38 cases were classified into three groups, depending on ultrasound findings at zzso Group 1: no ultrasound features zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso features without cerebral abnormalities at ultrasound zzso zzso zzso group zzso presence of cerebral features at ultrasound zzso zzso zzso In group 1, zzso was always zzso In group 2, zzso revealed cerebral features in six cases zzso In group 3, zzso always confirmed the zzso seen at ultrasound and highlighted other cerebral zzso 

zzso can provide important additional information with regard to abnormal zzso zzso zzso or abnormal signal in white zzso It is certainly useful in the assessment of fetuses with zzso features without brain abnormalities detected with zzso If the fetal ultrasound is strictly normal in an infected zzso zzso may not detect brain zzso however, it seems difficult to not perform this zzso zzso
