zzso disorders are common in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease zzso In zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are typically found to be delayed or zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients may also be consistent with reduced zzso activity in the zzso zzso lobe following zzso zzso as demonstrated by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We analyzed zzso and zzso scans of zzso zzso patients zzso to gain further insight about the brain regions involved in generation of zzso zzso Patients were separated into two groups zzso per group), based on the zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso Central zzso during zzso stimulation was examined using zzso Both zzso and zzso patients showed activity in brain areas relevant to zzso processing, such as the amygdala, zzso regions, and zzso regions zzso 37, zzso zzso of both groups revealed higher zzso in zzso patients, especially in the amygdala, zzso cortex, inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso The relationship between the expression of zzso zzso and cortical zzso patterns seen during zzso stimulation in zzso in zzso patients supports the idea that zzso are a sensitive marker of zzso in zzso zzso In accordance with current zzso staging concepts, zzso zzso may be reflecting pathological changes in zzso regions, independent of the typically observed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of primary zzso areas in the zzso may reflect a severe disruption of zzso processing in these zzso
