The objective of our study was to compare the frequency of zzso and zzso abnormalities in patients presenting with hip pain after resurfacing zzso and after total hip zzso zzso correlate the zzso findings with zzso results, and determine which zzso findings are zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso examinations of patients with zzso hip zzso placed at resurfacing zzso zzso or zzso zzso were reviewed for zzso zzso zzso disease, zzso pattern, and mode of zzso into adjacent zzso Regional muscles and zzso were assessed for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and operative findings were reviewed in 19 patients (20 zzso who underwent revision zzso zzso tests were performed to detect differences between the resurfacing zzso and zzso zzso The zzso rank sum test was performed to detect differences in zzso findings in patients with and those without zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was detected in zzso of resurfacing zzso hips and zzso of zzso zzso zzso disease was present in zzso of resurfacing zzso hips and zzso of zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso of resurfacing zzso hips and zzso of zzso zzso There was no difference in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso disease zzso between the resurfacing zzso and zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso had higher volumes of zzso zzso than patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease and muscle zzso were seen only in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is common in patients with zzso hip zzso and occurs with a similar zzso after resurfacing zzso and after zzso zzso and zzso disease are zzso The zzso signs most suggestive of zzso zzso zzso zzso are high volumes of zzso zzso disease, and intramuscular zzso
