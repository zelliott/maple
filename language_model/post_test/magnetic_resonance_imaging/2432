To examine outcomes and delayed complications after the surgical zzso of zzso spinal zzso zzso cavernous zzso The association of these zzso with cryptic zzso zzso zzso at surgery also was zzso 

The records of 17 patients who underwent zzso of their zzso verified zzso cavernous zzso were zzso There were nine female and eight male patients zzso age, zzso zzso The locations of the cavernous zzso were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mean follow-up period was zzso zzso Immediate zzso and long-term neurological outcomes were zzso and delayed complications were zzso 

The patients presented with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), and zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso cavernous zzso were associated with cryptic zzso zzso Immediately after surgery, four zzso patients worsened zzso whereas one zzso zzso At long-term zzso however, 10 zzso patients had improved and only 1 zzso remained zzso Four zzso patients experienced delayed zzso Three had undergone incomplete zzso and experienced subsequent zzso zzso subsequent zzso Another patient developed zzso zzso of the zzso spinal zzso without clinical zzso Two of the three patients who had undergone subsequent zzso developed symptomatic zzso of the cervical spinal zzso In one of the two patients, the zzso was associated with an zzso zzso zzso zzso Both patients required surgical zzso 

The frequent coexistence of zzso cavernous zzso with cryptic zzso zzso in this series indicates a need for operative vigilance to preserve these zzso zzso Delayed complications were the result of incomplete zzso The zzso zzso required zzso which led to zzso of the spinal zzso Most patients who underwent zzso however, had improved zzso at long-term zzso
