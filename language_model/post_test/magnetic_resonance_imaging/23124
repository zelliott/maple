Based upon previous reports of zzso in white matter integrity and gray matter density in smokers, we examined these markers in a large, zzso sample of smokers and zzso We further investigated the effect of heavy cigarette exposure by using zzso and the effects of two relatively stable, highly zzso traits in smokers zzso Test of zzso zzso zzso a measure of severity of nicotine dependence and Toronto zzso zzso zzso a stable personality trait related to zzso Forty-eight zzso subjects and 48 matched controls were included in the zzso with smokers also subdivided into zzso dependence and zzso zzso zzso White matter integrity zzso zzso zzso and gray matter density zzso zzso zzso were measured and compared across zzso Gray matter density was lower in left prefrontal zzso zzso in high zzso smokers and was zzso related to zzso In contrast, left insular zzso gray matter density was higher in smokers and associated with zzso total score and with zzso zzso Further, the most highly dependent smokers showed lower prefrontal zzso which was zzso correlated with zzso There was no correlation between zzso and zzso in our smoker zzso These data suggest chronic tobacco use is correlated with prefrontal gray matter damage , while differences in zzso gray matter and zzso white matter appear to reflect stable and zzso differences between smokers and zzso
