The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of MR imaging for zzso the zzso of zzso tears of the zzso 

Fast zzso MR images obtained at zzso T from 110 patients who had zzso tears identified at zzso were zzso and independently classified by two zzso into five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging categorization was compared with zzso results as the standard of zzso Data were also analyzed with zzso and zzso tears combined because these usually are zzso and with zzso zzso and complex tears combined because these usually are not zzso zzso and zzso agreements were calculated using zzso zzso 

At zzso zzso tears were zzso as horizontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy of each reviewer for the zzso tears were zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso agreements were fair between reviewer 1 and the first and second interpretations of reviewer 2 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement was substantial zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

MR imaging was accurate for predicting zzso zzso tears and was sensitive for the determination of zzso zzso
