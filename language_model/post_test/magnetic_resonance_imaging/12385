Paper describes a study of language zzso of patients with brain tumors, measured by zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and comparison results with tumor zzso and profile of functional zzso 

During the study 21 patient underwent zzso zzso 15 patients had a tumor in the left and 6 in the right zzso zzso were localized mainly in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso diagnosis in 8 cases was zzso Grade IV, in 13 zzso zzso zzso study was zzso on scanner zzso zzso with a field strength of zzso As speech test zzso the months of the year in reverse order was zzso zzso scan results were compared with the profile of functional zzso which was received with the results of questionnaire Annette and zzso listening zzso 

zzso area was found in 7 cases in the left hemisphere, 6 had a tumor Grade zzso And one patient with zzso had a tumor of the right zzso zzso area in the right zzso was found in 3 patients (2 patients with left sided zzso and one with zzso zzso One patient with zzso tumor had mild motor zzso zzso zzso in both zzso of the brain was observed in 6 zzso All of them had tumor Grade zzso of the left zzso Signs of zzso were revealed only in half of these zzso zzso area was not found in 4 zzso All of them had large zzso tumors Grade zzso One patient couldn't handle program of the zzso 

zzso of zzso scans, questionnaire Annette and zzso listening test frequently were not the same, which is zzso zzso zzso in zzso may be a reflection of brain plasticity in cases of zzso zzso Thus it's important to consider the full range of clinical data in studying the problem of the dominant zzso for zzso
