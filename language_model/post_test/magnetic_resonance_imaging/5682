It is generally considered that patients with zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso at increased zzso risk should be placed in zzso positions throughout the recovery process; however, not all patients with zzso show zzso zzso The authors hypothesized that zzso differences exist in three-dimensional zzso soft tissue and zzso structures of the zzso airway between zzso and zzso zzso 

The subjects of the study were body mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) and zzso zzso zzso 10) Japanese zzso patients and body mass zzso Japanese control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso were performed during zzso 

The patients with zzso zzso had a smaller volume of the zzso lateral wall soft zzso larger zzso angle, and smaller lower facial height than the zzso zzso and the control zzso The patients with zzso zzso showed a significantly steeper zzso angle and smaller zzso volume than the control zzso There were no significant differences in tongue volume and zzso zzso anatomical balance between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso dependence showed that the dominant zzso was the volume of the lateral zzso wall, followed by lower facial height and zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso have wider airways in the lateral parts, lower facial zzso and more backward position of the lower zzso which may explain differences in the maintenance of zzso airway zzso in the lateral sleep zzso
