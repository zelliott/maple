zzso zzso are attractive platforms for biomedical applications including diagnosis and treatment of zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso enhanced the efficacy of the zzso zzso drug zzso zzso in zzso against zzso and drug-resistant human zzso cancer zzso In this zzso we report our findings on the efficacy of zzso loaded zzso in zzso using subcutaneous and zzso zzso zzso tumor models in nude zzso The zzso of the zzso in subcutaneous tumors following an intravenous zzso administration was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, and its distribution in the tumors was evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso blue zzso zzso delivered by zzso accumulated at much higher levels and distributed wider in the tumor tissue than zzso injected free zzso leading to significant reduction of tumor zzso The zzso zzso for in zzso zzso imaging was used to aid in therapy assessment of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso tumors formed by zzso zzso expressing human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced tumor growth, delayed tumor development, and extended the survival of zzso Thus, utilizing zzso as drug delivery vehicles constitutes a promising approach to tackle zzso expressing zzso zzso
