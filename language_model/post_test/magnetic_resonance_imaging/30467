zzso zzso zzso in cognitive performance shares systematic associations with zzso zzso brain injury, and neurodegenerative zzso However, little research has examined the neural zzso of zzso with no studies investigating brain zzso of zzso in relation to retrieval zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined links between zzso recognition memory performance, and blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso older adults zzso zzso were presented with 80 words at zzso with brain scans and response zzso obtained during subsequent zzso An index of zzso the zzso standard zzso zzso was zzso across successful zzso zzso zzso zzso were systematically associated with better recognition, faster zzso and increased zzso in the inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso links between less behavioral zzso and zzso zzso are consistent with the known importance of the zzso zzso for retrieval zzso In support of extant findings and theory from zzso zzso and cognitive aging, the present results suggest that behavioral zzso represents a proxy for neural zzso
