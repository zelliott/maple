In this study the authors evaluated disease zzso treatment, and outcome in patients with unusual zzso disc fragments simulating spinal tumors or another zzso zzso on zzso MR zzso 

The authors zzso reviewed data from the last zzso patients with a zzso diagnosis of disc zzso Patients with zzso MR imaging findings that simulated a spinal tumor or other zzso zzso were individually zzso 

In 11 patients zzso MR imaging findings of unusual zzso disc fragments were mistaken for another spinal zzso zzso In 8 cases, the fragments had migrated to the zzso spinal space; in 3 cases, into the zzso zzso In 3 patients, the fragments were distant from the original disc zzso A zzso mass was revealed with zzso or zzso signal on zzso MR images as well as low signal (4 zzso or high signal (7 zzso intensity on zzso images, relative to the spinal zzso A slight diffuse or peripheral zzso enhancement rim was observed in 7 zzso zzso fragments were located in the cervical (1 zzso zzso (2 zzso and zzso (8 zzso zzso All zzso were completely zzso zzso was required in 4 zzso A complete recovery occurred in 8 patients and a minor neurological deficit remained in zzso 

zzso located disc zzso should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with MR imaging data indicating spinal zzso zzso All of these zzso even those zzso located, can be completely zzso
