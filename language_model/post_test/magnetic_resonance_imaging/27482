zzso zzso based zzso mapping methods use zzso zzso to zzso quantitative zzso information into the signal zzso It was recently shown that the principle behind zzso zzso mapping can be expanded from spin echo zzso and zzso zzso based zzso zzso mapping to methods such as Carr, zzso zzso Gill zzso zzso echo zzso and zzso echo zzso zzso If zzso conditions are zzso zzso allows fast acquisition of the zzso information and zzso enables simultaneous mapping of zzso zzso and zzso To date, however, two separate zzso experiments must be performed to enable the calculation of zzso zzso This study investigated a modified zzso strategy for zzso zzso methods to overcome this zzso By applying a zzso zzso zzso pulse before the zzso pulse train, the needed phase information was able to be zzso into different echo images of one echo zzso Thus, this technique allowed simultaneous zzso and zzso mapping in a single zzso zzso To allow zzso zzso zzso this method was also applied to zzso echo zzso Furthermore, the presented modification zzso zzso zzso image artifacts in zzso zzso
