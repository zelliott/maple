The aim of this study was to define a system for scoring zzso zzso zzso based on MR findings, providing for objective evaluation of the degree of joint involvement and evolution after on-demand administration of zzso zzso therapy or zzso zzso A total of 133 MR examinations zzso zzso and 44 during zzso were performed in 25 zzso Patients were divided in two groups depending on the therapy received and the length of time that the disease had been evolving at the start of the zzso Group I was composed of 10 patients with secondary prophylaxis and group II was composed by 15 treated on zzso zzso and zzso images performed on a zzso unit were zzso zzso The joint involvement was established on a scale of 0 (no zzso I zzso amount of zzso II zzso amount of zzso and isolated zzso zzso III zzso destruction, bone zzso and zzso zzso to IV zzso internal joint zzso secondary zzso and/or zzso At zzso MR examination, patients of group I showed no abnormalities ( zzso zzso grade I ( zzso and grade II ( zzso of zzso Patients of group II corresponded to MR grades III ( zzso and IV ( zzso of zzso The MR follow-up showed improvement in three zzso of group I and worsening in 5 zzso in group I and 2 zzso in group zzso Early signs of zzso were detected in 10 zzso with MR imaging but were underestimated on plain zzso Advanced degrees of zzso were classified as severe under both imaging zzso zzso resonance is the preferred imaging technique to assess zzso The earliest signs of joint damage, detected by zzso are overlooked by plain zzso The MR scoring system can be used for evaluating zzso zzso MR should be performed to evaluate zzso or worsening of the zzso primarily in the case of patients with prophylaxis who usually suffer normal or early joint involvement not detected by other zzso
