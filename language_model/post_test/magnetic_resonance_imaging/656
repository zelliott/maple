To describe the zzso management of a patient with zzso on the entire left side of her body and magnetic resonance imaging zzso cervical spinal zzso deformation secondary to cervical spinal zzso 

A 70-year-old special education teacher had neck pain, zzso and burning zzso on the entire left side of her zzso These symptoms developed within hours of being injured in a zzso motor vehicle zzso Prior to her visit, she had been zzso with a cerebrovascular zzso
