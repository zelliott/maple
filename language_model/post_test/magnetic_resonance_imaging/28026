To assess the usefulness of zzso enhancement in disclosing zzso of the zzso zzso that had not been demonstrated by non enhanced zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

Six patients with zzso disease underwent zzso and post enhancement zzso scanning and the findings were correlated at surgery and confirmed by zzso and zzso studies of the surgical zzso 

In all cases post enhancement MR scans demonstrated circumscribed zzso zzso that corresponded well with the location and extension of the zzso tissue found at zzso Selective removal of the zzso failed to improve the clinical and laboratory abnormalities in two of the six zzso Such cases did not present residual zzso zzso in the zzso zzso enhanced zzso 

zzso suggest that zzso enhanced zzso is useful to detect zzso zzso however, the abnormalities of the zzso tissue may extend beyond the abnormal zzso
