The purpose of this study was to clarify the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging for zzso tumors in the oral and maxillofacial zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance images of 25 patients with zzso tumors of the oral and maxillofacial region were zzso zzso zzso scans were performed with intravenous contrast zzso A zzso zzso Medical zzso Tokyo, Japan) permanent magnetic resonance unit was used to obtain zzso zzso and zzso images with zzso pulse zzso zzso acid was administered in 11 zzso Severe artifacts influencing image interpretation were observed in 10 zzso cases on zzso zzso but only in 5 zzso cases on magnetic resonance zzso There was no difference in the zzso of bone invasion between images from the two zzso zzso enhancement with zzso acid provided additional useful information in only 3 of 11 cases compared with zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso tumors showed a higher signal intensity than that of muscle on zzso images in all cases and on zzso images in 23 zzso zzso On zzso images, an intermediate signal intensity similar to that of muscle was seen in 16 zzso cases and a zzso signal in 9 zzso zzso There was poor correlation between signal intensity and zzso diagnosis of the zzso These results suggest that in cases with severe artifacts that disturb the interpretation of the images on zzso zzso magnetic resonance examinations are preferable for defining the exact extent of the primary zzso
