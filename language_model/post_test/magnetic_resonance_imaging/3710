zzso speech has often been used as a control task in zzso studies of language utilizing various zzso zzso The rationale is that reverse speech is comparable to forward speech in terms of auditory zzso while omitting the linguistic zzso Thus, it may control for zzso auditory zzso This finds some support in zzso studies indicating that reverse speech resulted in less zzso zzso signal intensity in zzso regions than forward zzso We attempted to zzso validate a reverse speech control task using zzso zzso zzso in eight patients with intractable focal zzso We studied adolescent and adult patients who underwent zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso All patients received an auditory language task during zzso zzso Patients were presented 115 audible question zzso including 30 reverse speech zzso zzso speech trials more strongly engaged bilateral superior zzso sites than did the corresponding forward speech zzso Forward speech trials zzso larger zzso at frontal lobe sites not attributable to zzso zzso Other zzso and frontal sites of significant zzso showed no significant difference between reverse and forward zzso Thus, we failed to validate reported evidence of weaker zzso of zzso zzso during reverse compared to forward zzso Superior zzso lobe engagement may indicate increased attention to reverse zzso zzso speech does not appear to be a suitable task for the control of zzso auditory functions on zzso
