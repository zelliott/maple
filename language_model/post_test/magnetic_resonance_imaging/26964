This paper describes methods to analyze the zzso electric fields recorded with zzso zzso zzso and demonstrates their zzso in the software zzso It focuses on the analysis of the spatial properties of these fields and on quantitative assessment of changes of field zzso across time, experimental conditions, or zzso zzso analyses are advantageous because they are reference independents and thus render statistically zzso zzso zzso differences in topography directly indicate changes in the zzso of the active zzso sources in the zzso We describe global measures of field strength and field similarities, zzso zzso based on zzso variations, zzso analysis in the frequency domain, zzso statistical analysis, and source imaging based on distributed inverse zzso All analysis methods are implemented in a freely available academic software package called zzso Besides providing these analysis tools, zzso is particularly designed to zzso the data and the analysis results using zzso display routines that allow rapid manipulation and animation of zzso zzso zzso therefore is a helpful tool for researchers as well as for clinicians to interpret zzso zzso and evoked zzso in a zzso comprehensive, and zzso zzso
