Various zzso relaxation times zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso were measured in zzso cartilage in zzso at 3 T to assess their role in visualizing zzso zzso zzso specimens were obtained from patients who underwent total joint replacement and got a double dose of zzso 2 hours prior zzso In these zzso regions of mechanically undamaged cartilage having a decreased content of zzso showed about zzso lower zzso values compared with apparently normal zzso zzso The expected increase of the zzso relaxation time was not observed in these zzso On the other hand, the zzso and, to a lower degree, zzso relaxation times were found to be increased in regions of cartilage zzso The zzso relaxation times obtained were slightly longer than the corresponding zzso values, but both parameters showed almost identical spatial zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
