zzso zzso zzso zzso synchronization zzso fundamental functions in zzso zzso However, different experimental approaches differ widely in their success in finding zzso zzso We aimed at linking animal and human studies of zzso activity and at preparing zzso methods for an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms and functions of zzso activity and zzso zzso in zzso In the first step described here, we zzso the zzso ratio with which we can observe visually induced zzso activity in human zzso zzso We used a stimulus and task design that evoked strong zzso activity in animals and combined it with zzso methods for spectral analysis and zzso spatial filtering for source zzso With this approach, we found human visual zzso activity very reliably across subjects and across multiple recording sessions of a given zzso While increases in zzso activity are typically accompanied by decreases in zzso and zzso activity, the zzso enhancement was often the spectral component with the highest zzso zzso Furthermore, some subjects demonstrated two clearly separate visually induced gamma bands, one around 40 zzso and another between 70 and 80 zzso zzso activity was sustained for the entire stimulation period, which was up to 3 zzso The sources of zzso activity were in the zzso zzso in all zzso The results zzso human visual zzso activity in frequency, time and space and the described methods allow its further investigation with great zzso
