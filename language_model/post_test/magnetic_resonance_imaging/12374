The aim of the study was to analyze the nuclear magnetic resonance image zzso findings for invasion of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso and to improve the understanding of its zzso zzso 

The zzso data of 182 patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso invasion were zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients developed zzso zzso invasion, of which, the zzso of zzso zzso invasion was zzso The zzso findings of zzso zzso invasion of patients with zzso were as zzso zzso zzso and zzso patients revealed damage of zzso wall, uneven zzso of zzso masses of the zzso cavity connected with the primary tumor of zzso and all the zzso presented zzso or slightly zzso signal on zzso and zzso or slightly zzso signal on zzso and significantly zzso enhancement after contrast administration, which were consistent with the primary tumor of the zzso regarding to the signal intensity and reinforcement zzso zzso patients presented massive zzso cavity zzso zzso images are excellent in zzso high signal intensity thickened zzso or retained zzso from relatively lower signal intensity zzso In zzso zzso tumor with solid enhancement can be differentiated from thickened zzso related to inflammation with a thin superficial zzso zzso and zzso patients with zzso zzso invasion and zzso zzso invasion were detected with the contrast enhanced zzso zzso MR imaging respectively, which were higher than those with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso and zzso for zzso zzso invasion; zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso the differences were statistically significant zzso zzso zzso for all zzso All patients with zzso zzso invasion were detected with the contrast enhanced zzso zzso MR zzso 

zzso MR scan and enhanced scan can improve the diagnosis of invasion of zzso zzso in patients with zzso The zzso findings of patients with zzso with zzso zzso invasion include zzso wall zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane of zzso tumors in zzso cavity zzso with the primary tumor of zzso , or with massive zzso cavity zzso The zzso sequence and contrast enhanced sequence are conducive to differential diagnosis of inflammatory changes from zzso zzso The enhanced zzso zzso section and the enhanced zzso zzso section are most helpful to detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso invasion and zzso zzso invasion, zzso
