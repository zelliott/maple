The sensitivity of blood zzso level dependent zzso contrast techniques to changes to zzso zzso concentration is of relevance to many strategies in cancer zzso In the context of zzso studies, which frequently involve the use of agents to modify blood flow, there are underlying zzso changes different to those of zzso in the zzso Hence we use the term, flow and zzso dependent zzso contrast, to emphasize this difference and the importance of flow zzso We have measured the zzso changes in a zzso zzso model for a variety of zzso challenges zzso zzso oxygen and zzso nitrogen as different breathing zzso and administration of zzso blood flow zzso such as zzso gene related zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition we have measured other relevant zzso zzso such as zzso status from zzso zzso and blood pH and zzso that may change during a zzso zzso Here we discuss how they relate to our understanding of zzso contrast in zzso We frequently observe zzso changes that match the expected action of the vascular zzso zzso decreases with agents expected to improve zzso zzso and blood flow, and increases with agents designed to increase zzso zzso Unlike most normal zzso zzso have a chaotic and poorly regulated blood supply, and a mix of zzso and zzso zzso thus the response to a zzso challenge is not zzso Changes in blood volume can counteract the effect of blood zzso changes, and changes in blood pH and zzso levels can alter oxygen zzso This can lead to zzso changes that are smaller or the reverse of those zzso To properly interpret zzso contrast changes these effects must be accounted zzso
