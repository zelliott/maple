Our purpose was to clarify the relationship between the tissue zzso shown on zzso dynamic zzso and the number of zzso vessels and degree of zzso which are two zzso changes in zzso zzso AND zzso The subjects were 10 zzso patients with 20 zzso who had undergone surgery without zzso zzso hormone analogue zzso zzso vessel density was determined by the mean number of zzso vessels with at least one zzso layer in the zzso fields magnified 100 zzso zzso grade was determined by the severity of zzso zzso classified in three zzso The enhancement index zzso of the zzso was calculated using the formula zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso where zzso is the signal intensity on zzso zzso images and zzso is the signal intensity on each dynamic phase image zzso zzso 20, 60, and 180 zzso zzso The zzso parameters of zzso vessel density and zzso grade were compared with the enhancement indexes obtained from the zzso dynamic zzso 

We found positive correlations between zzso vessel density and zzso and between zzso vessel density and zzso (in both cases, p zzso zzso and r zzso zzso We found significant differences among the mean enhancement indexes for each zzso grade at all dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso with lower zzso vessel zzso tended to show greater zzso 

Our results showed that zzso with only slight zzso or with abundant vessels were well zzso but the zzso with severe zzso enhanced zzso
