Several studies demonstrated that zzso zzso power differs tremendously between zzso children and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are dominant in children but become less prominent in the adult brain, where zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso dominate the mature brain zzso However, this assessment of zzso effects with zzso power mapping is restricted to the scalp level and blind to the information flow between brain regions, thus limiting insights about brain zzso In contrast dynamic source synchronization provides a tool to study zzso zzso on the cortical and zzso source zzso In this study we investigated functional and directed zzso zzso zzso with zzso partial directed zzso during resting state zzso zzso open and eyes zzso recordings in 17 zzso children and 17 young zzso First, we found higher spectral mean source power in children relative to adults, irrespective of the examined frequency band and resting zzso We further found that zzso values were stronger in adults compared to children in all frequency zzso The directed zzso zzso analysis indicated information flow from frontal to zzso sources in children, while information flow from zzso to frontal was observed in zzso In addition, significant zzso connectivity was zzso zzso zzso to cortical zzso in adults, but zzso in zzso Group comparison confirmed the results of the single subject analyses for both functional and directed zzso Our results suggest that both functional and directed zzso are sensitive to brain maturation as the distribution and zzso of functional connections differ between the developing and adult zzso
