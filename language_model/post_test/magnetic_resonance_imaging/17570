The aim of this study was to clarify the magnitude of common carotid artery zzso structural and zzso parameters on brain white and gray matter zzso in patients with essential hypertension zzso The study subjects were 49 zzso patients without a history of previous zzso zzso zzso zzso diabetes zzso impaired zzso zzso chronic zzso failure, symptomatic cerebrovascular events, or zzso carotid artery zzso All patients underwent brain zzso and ultrasound imaging of the zzso zzso findings were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso deep and zzso white matter zzso zzso and zzso zzso according to the Japanese Brain dock zzso of zzso zzso media thickness zzso and mean zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by carotid zzso The zzso ratio was further calculated as a relative zzso flow zzso The mean zzso and max zzso were positively associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso max zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structure and zzso are potentially related to zzso zzso in the zzso and might be zzso of future cerebral vascular events in patients with zzso
