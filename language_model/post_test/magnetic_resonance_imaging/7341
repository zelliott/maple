The use of zzso window zzso settings on zzso zzso zzso improves sensitivity for detection of early zzso changes in acute zzso zzso This study analyzed the effect of zzso of window settings on the accuracy of zzso Stroke Program Early zzso zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso CT zzso and CT zzso source images zzso ASPECTS was calculated on zzso and zzso with standard and zzso window zzso settings in a consecutive series of patients with acute zzso zzso The difference between zzso ASPECTS and ASPECTS performed on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging zzso were calculated to determine the disparity between initial estimates of the extent of zzso on CT and follow-up zzso imaging by zzso zzso patients were included into the zzso The mean difference with respect to follow-up zzso was zzso for standard zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for standard zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The improvement introduced by the zzso of window settings and use of zzso was statistically significant zzso Our data indicate that the accuracy of ASPECTS is improved with zzso window display zzso This improvement is irrespective of experience or specialty of the zzso performing the zzso
