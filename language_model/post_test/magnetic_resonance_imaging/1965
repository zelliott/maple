Despite advances in the understanding and treatment of zzso zzso characterized by extensive coronary artery disease and left zzso zzso dysfunction, the prognosis remains poor with only a zzso zzso survival zzso The composition of zzso zzso is currently regarded as being more important than the degree of zzso in determining acute zzso If imaging techniques could distinguish vulnerable from stable zzso then high-risk patient zzso could be zzso Another important concept is that zzso dysfunction may be the result of either zzso due to necrosis or to the presence of zzso zzso in which there is sufficient blood flow to sustain viable zzso but insufficient to maintain zzso zzso This concept of zzso viability is critical for making optimal clinical management zzso This review describes how zzso imaging methods can be used to distinguish regions of zzso injured zzso from viable but zzso zzso Technical advances in CT and MR have made imaging of the beating heart zzso zzso clinical progress has already been made and further cardiac applications are zzso zzso therefore have new opportunities for involvement in cardiac imaging but must recognize the political implications as well as the diagnostic potential of these zzso not only for the heart, but also for the whole vascular zzso This review focuses on imaging zzso zzso It compares state-of-the-art CT and MR with more established yet contemporary zzso and nuclear zzso
