The optimal treatment of multiple sclerosis zzso is not yet zzso 

To estimate the relative effectiveness of treatments in zzso we performed a network of zzso zzso of zzso controlled trials zzso for zzso zzso using three main efficacy zzso zzso patients, patients without disease zzso and patients without magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

We systematically searched zzso and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify English-language articles with zzso that compared pharmaceutical treatments using the terms multiple sclerosis and zzso controlled zzso All zzso that involved patients with zzso zzso zzso and provided data for calculating the odds ratios for the main outcomes were zzso First, comparative effectiveness relative to zzso was assessed using direct zzso Then, each therapy was compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso in direct and indirect zzso Effect sizes were estimated by applying a zzso zzso 

We identified zzso zzso after zzso 109 articles were eligible for zzso In total, zzso patients were zzso The network consisted of 145 treatments involving 59 direct comparisons with zzso and 8 direct comparisons with zzso zzso zzso zzso Two treatments showed better response compared with zzso zzso zzso for all three efficacy zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In comparing treatments with zzso zzso zzso zzso the network analysis revealed that no therapy shows better response for all 3 efficacy outcomes and zzso 12 and 24 zzso have better response for 2 of the outcomes zzso patients and patients without disease zzso 

Although some treatments seem to have better zzso the results should be interpreted with caution because the network was dominated by indirect zzso Data from the selected studies included in the network cannot be zzso beyond zzso Large zzso that make head-to-head comparisons between treatments are needed to draw safe conclusions for the optimal treatment of zzso
