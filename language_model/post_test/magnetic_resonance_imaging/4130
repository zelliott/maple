There is controversy about progression in brain abnormalities in zzso zzso This study looked for more striking progression in brain abnormalities during adolescence in a chronically ill, zzso sample of patients with zzso schizophrenia who had had more zzso zzso zzso but clinical and zzso characteristics similar to those of patients with zzso zzso schizophrenia who have poor zzso 

zzso brain magnetic resonance images were obtained for 16 children and adolescents with onset of schizophrenia by 12 years of age and 24 temporally zzso zzso and zzso healthy zzso zzso were scanned on initial admission and zzso after 2 years with the identical equipment and measurement zzso 

Childhood zzso showed a significantly greater increase in zzso volume than did controls, for whom zzso did not increase significantly zzso of zzso diagnosis zzso time, F zzso zzso P zzso zzso A significant decrease in zzso zzso area was also seen for the zzso zzso zzso zzso which was unchanged at zzso for zzso These differential brain changes correlated significantly with each other and tended to be predicted by both zzso zzso zzso zzso Assessment zzso P zzso zzso and zzso Psychiatric zzso zzso at follow-up zzso zzso zzso 

More consistent progressive zzso enlargement was seen during adolescence for this zzso sample than has been reported for zzso zzso The brain imaging results support other clinical data showing both early and late zzso in brain development for at least this rare zzso of zzso zzso schizophrenic zzso
