zzso imaging has emerged as a leading priority on the imaging research agenda, yet clinical zzso has traditionally maintained a skeptical attitude toward zzso measurement in diagnostic zzso To gauge the extent to which quantitative reporting has been incorporated into routine clinical zzso practice, and to offer preliminary baseline data against which the evolution of quantitative imaging can be measured, we obtained all clinical zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso reports from two randomly selected weekdays in 2011 at a single mixed zzso practice and evaluated those reports for the presence of quantitative zzso We found that zzso of all reports contained at least one zzso zzso zzso defined as any zzso zzso of a physical property other than zzso but only zzso of reports contained an zzso quantitative zzso zzso defined as a zzso zzso reporting on zzso function or zzso excluding simple size and distance zzso zzso reasons for the slow translation of zzso into routine clinical zzso reporting include perceptions that the primary clinical question may be qualitative in nature or that a qualitative answer may be zzso concern that quantitative approaches may obscure important qualitative information, may not be adequately zzso or may not allow sufficient expression of zzso the feeling that zzso interpretation may be superior to quantitative zzso and practical zzso zzso We suggest that quantitative imaging techniques will evolve primarily as dedicated instruments for answering specific clinical questions requiring precise and standardized zzso zzso in real-world settings, ease of use, and reimbursement economics will all play a role in determining the rate of translation of zzso into broad zzso
