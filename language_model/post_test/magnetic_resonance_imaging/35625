The zzso is an important structure for visual attention zzso zzso and zzso attention was examined in three patients with varying zzso zzso zzso and zzso deficits were zzso The patient with anterior damage showed strong spatial but not zzso attention deficits, while the patient with zzso damage showed clear zzso attention deficits, but much reduced spatial zzso A third patient with intermediate damage showed intermediate zzso These findings are discussed within the scope of models of visual attention in which the zzso zzso communication between different brain zzso depending upon the specifics of zzso damage, communication with different cortical areas may be zzso thereby producing distinct patterns of zzso
