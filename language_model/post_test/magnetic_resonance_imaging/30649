We describe a new zzso minimally invasive spinal fixation system based on zzso screws and inflatable zzso The rods are inserted in a flexible state and harden following zzso We test this system in terms of zzso zzso magnetic resonance artifact production, bench top mechanical testing, ease of zzso within zzso potential zzso damage to zzso muscles in zzso and long-term device zzso in zzso 

To determine the safety and utility of this system before its use in human zzso 

Composite materials and zzso compounds have been used safely in a variety of implanted medical devices for years with no signs of systemic toxicity or significant device zzso 

zzso zzso test of system components was conducted according to International zzso Organization zzso and Food and Drug Administration Blue Book zzso zzso zzso Device components were assessed for magnetic zzso and zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso Full zzso of the system were tested for zzso strength, torque, and fatigue per American Society for Testing and Materials zzso zzso The system was deployed using zzso zzso guidance in 11 zzso and 2 live zzso Further, the inflatable rods were tested for zzso damage to zzso zzso in 2 zzso 

All system components were found to be zzso zzso and produce little magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso results for the new system were found to be comparable to standard metallic zzso screw and rod fixation zzso However, the new system displayed a superior zzso of elasticity relative to standard surgical zzso The new system endured 5 million cycles of repetitive zzso without breakage or significant zzso All zzso and sheep insertions were performed zzso zzso suffered no zzso and minimal blood loss occurred during device zzso One of the animals killed at 6 months demonstrated no internal organ zzso The zzso version of zzso used to zzso the flexible rods cured to approximately zzso of its final strength in 90 minutes with maximum external rod temperature of zzso zzso and no adjacent zzso damage within zzso zzso zzso 

The new spinal fixation system is zzso uses a nontoxic zzso is magnetic resonance zzso displays favorable zzso zzso can be easily deployed zzso using simple zzso guidance, is well tolerated in living zzso caused no muscular zzso damage, and could be used in humans within a reasonable operative time zzso The new system demonstrates the feasibility of zzso constructing composite structures in zzso within the zzso
