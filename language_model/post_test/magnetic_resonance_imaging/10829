To evaluate the suitability of different MR sequences for monitoring the stage of maturation of zzso cartilage zzso in the knee joint and the early detection of complications like zzso In addition, it was analyzed whether indirect MR zzso can indicate zzso of the zzso 

zzso examinations were performed in 19 patients, aged 17 - 48 years, with zzso transplantation of a zzso cartilage tissue graft after knee zzso zzso dates were prior to transplantation to zzso the zzso and 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after transplantation to control zzso and maturation of the zzso zzso Standard zzso and zzso zzso spin echo zzso sequences and zzso spin echo zzso sequences were used, as well as zzso echo zzso sequences with and without zzso transfer zzso zzso In some cases, indirect MR zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso and the zzso cartilage graft could be detected in all 19 zzso zzso of the graft could be found early in 3 patients and zzso in 1 zzso For depicting the graft a short time after surgery, zzso zzso showed the best zzso Six and 12 months after zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso low angle zzso showed reduced artifacts due to magnetic zzso from the zzso zzso images from zzso with and without zzso pulse provided high contrast between cartilage and surrounding zzso The zzso of the zzso effect showed an zzso of the graft to the original cartilage within 12 zzso zzso MR zzso showed zzso contrast medium even 12 months after transplantation in 3 zzso 

zzso allows a reliable depiction of the zzso graft and provides very early detection of complications like zzso The zzso effect seems to be correlated with maturation of the graft and allows selective depiction of normal cartilage and zzso zzso
