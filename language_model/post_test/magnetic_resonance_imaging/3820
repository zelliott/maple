zzso cuff tears are the most common zzso injury seen in zzso zzso Muscle zzso and fatty zzso in rotator cuff muscles are considered among the key factors responsible for the failure of attempted repair of a massive rotator cuff zzso However, the zzso of rotator cuff muscle zzso and fatty zzso remains largely unknown, partly because of the lack of appropriate small animal zzso The goal of this study was to develop a mouse model of muscle zzso and fatty zzso after a rotator cuff zzso We also sought to study the role of zzso on muscle zzso and fatty zzso after a rotator cuff zzso 

Adult zzso zzso mice were randomly divided into three zzso Mice in different groups received unilateral complete zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso or both zzso zzso surgery was performed on the zzso shoulder to serve as a zzso Mice were killed twelve weeks after zzso zzso analysis and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging were used to evaluate muscle zzso and fat zzso after a rotator cuff zzso 

zzso and consistent muscle zzso and fatty zzso were observed in the rotator cuff muscles after rotator cuff zzso zzso We further found that zzso significantly increases the amount of muscle zzso and fatty zzso after a rotator cuff zzso 

We successfully developed a novel mouse model of a massive rotator cuff zzso which simulates major pathological changes, including muscle zzso and fatty zzso after massive rotator cuff tears seen in zzso
