The goal of this study was to explore minimally invasive zzso imaging and surgery for the treatment of zzso persistent zzso in cases that were zzso to conservative zzso The study included 43 patients zzso zzso years; average, zzso zzso with long-lasting, severe zzso accompanied by discomfort or pain in the zzso or zzso region, zzso frequent zzso decreased zzso volume, and/or zzso Patient symptoms had persisted for 1 to 10 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging of each patient was zzso and zzso surgery was zzso The causes of zzso were identified in all 43 patients, and their zzso duct obstruction or seminal zzso was successfully zzso No serious zzso or zzso complications zzso zzso analyses revealed that all of the zzso or zzso seminal zzso zzso had chronic zzso inflammation in the seminal zzso wall, and no tumors were zzso zzso zzso of zzso disappeared in all patients followed up for 2 to 30 months zzso 16 zzso A single patient experienced recurrence at 11 months and had a second minimally invasive surgery that was zzso A total of zzso (41 of zzso of the patients experienced normal zzso intensity after zzso zzso resonance imaging is a valuable and accurate diagnostic method for the identification of zzso factors underlying zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso incision of the zzso or the zzso end of the zzso zzso and incision or zzso of the relevant zzso represent simple, safe, and reliable approaches for the management of zzso cases of zzso that do not respond to conservative zzso
