This study was designed to assess whether zzso cardiac zzso imaging at zzso T is achievable without significant image zzso and if zzso phase interference zzso the exponential zzso signal zzso Twelve healthy volunteers zzso age zzso were zzso on a Philips zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso imaging was performed with a zzso zzso zzso echo sequence with a seven echo zzso zzso times zzso zzso repetition time 11 zzso using a zzso zzso and volume zzso zzso values were calculated with both zzso and zzso fits from the mean signal intensity of the zzso zzso The global mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso ratio zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ratio zzso of the zzso to the left zzso cavity zzso zzso zzso A better fit was obtained with a zzso model and the mean fat fraction derived was zzso zzso functional parameters were in the normal range and showed no correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso imaging at zzso T can be achieved with minimal zzso and zzso the signal zzso with a zzso function allows zzso of zzso zzso content as well as zzso zzso
