High zzso rates of zzso massive rotator cuff repair have been reported with relatively satisfactory functional zzso 

To assess the clinical and zzso outcomes of an zzso repair of massive rotator cuff tears using a zzso bridge zzso We also aimed to explore the various factors that may affect zzso 

zzso study; Level of evidence, zzso 

zzso patients included in the study were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso evaluation at a minimum of 1 year after zzso We evaluated the visual analog scale zzso for pain during motions, the University of California, Los Angeles zzso score, and the absolute and relative zzso scores zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the 66 patients zzso in this study had a zzso At the final follow-up visit, pain zzso zzso score, and absolute and relative zzso scores in the completely healed group were significantly superior to those in the zzso group, with 2, zzso zzso and zzso points and 4, zzso zzso and zzso points, respectively zzso zzso zzso From zzso analysis, the zzso mean zzso distance, extent of zzso and degree of fatty zzso of the zzso and zzso were significantly different between the completely healed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso From zzso zzso zzso analysis, the zzso degree of fatty zzso of the zzso and extent of zzso were the 2 most important factors associated with zzso 

zzso repair of massive rotator cuff tears using a zzso bridge technique has a relatively high zzso rate, and these structural failures appear to have a significant difference in clinical outcomes compared with the healed zzso Degree of fatty zzso of the zzso and extent of zzso are the 2 most important factors associated with a zzso zzso surgeons should predict the possibility of zzso before surgery and counsel patients about their expected functional zzso
