A zzso zzso zzso zzso designed for very high field with a novel matching scheme was implemented with the specific geometry chosen for the human zzso This zzso design incorporates a hinge for greater patient zzso Volunteer human subjects were studied using zzso and zzso zzso echo sequences for image zzso The higher zzso and improved tissue contrast obtained from this zzso system, coupled with the zzso zzso design, improves zzso of the structural detail in zzso cartilage, which is not seen well at conventional field zzso This has important clinical zzso as newer medical and surgical treatments become available for the treatment of early cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
