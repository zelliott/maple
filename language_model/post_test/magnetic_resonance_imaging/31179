Important factors that influence food zzso are its texture and fat zzso We investigated their representation in the human brain using zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso It was shown that the zzso of oral stimuli is represented in the zzso taste zzso in the anterior zzso in which zzso was zzso to the log of the zzso of a cellulose stimulus zzso zzso and was also produced by zzso zzso zzso was also represented in a zzso region that was zzso to the taste zzso Third, it was found that oral delivery of fatty vegetable oil activates both of these insular zzso regions, the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Fourth, it was found that the zzso anterior zzso cortex, where it borders the zzso zzso cortex, was activated by oral fat independently of its zzso and was also activated by zzso zzso This zzso anterior zzso region thus represents two indicators of the energy content and zzso of zzso These are the first investigations of the oral sensory representation of food texture and fat in the human brain, and they start to reveal brain mechanisms that may be important in zzso sensory properties of foods that make them palatable and that may accordingly play a role in the hedonic responses to foods, the control of food zzso and zzso
