zzso zzso during zzso contributes to reduction of anxiety levels and zzso However, our knowledge of where zzso acts in the brain to achieve this effect, particularly to an zzso fear zzso is zzso We used blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso to test whether central administration of zzso zzso zzso before zzso scanning alters maternal brain zzso in response to a zzso scent zzso zzso zzso behavioral experiments that examined maternal responses to this zzso zzso odor were carried out in a separate cohort of zzso rats given similar zzso zzso experiments confirmed the effectiveness of zzso at reducing freezing behavior as compared to vehicle zzso Our zzso findings indicate that zzso modulated both positive and negative zzso responses across several zzso and zzso zzso zzso greater percent increases in zzso signal in response to zzso were observed in the anterior cingulate, bed nucleus of zzso zzso and zzso area of zzso zzso zzso These animals also showed significantly larger percent decreases in zzso in zzso bodies, secondary motor cortex, zzso cortex, zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso cortex, and the anterior zzso zzso The observed pattern of brain activity suggests that zzso enhances neural processing in emotion and zzso driven brain areas such as the zzso cortex, while dramatically reducing activity in areas also controlling zzso zzso and zzso zzso The present data contribute to the growing literature suggesting the zzso zzso the integration of emotional and cognitive information through myriad brain regions to facilitate decreases in anxiety (even to an zzso zzso while potentially promoting zzso social memory and parental zzso
