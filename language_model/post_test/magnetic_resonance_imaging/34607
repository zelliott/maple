We present a case of zzso escape reaction in which we encountered difficulty in interpreting the images acquired by plain zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso The 48-year-old male Japanese patient was referred for evaluation of a gradual swelling zzso to the inferior border of the left zzso At the early imaging zzso magnetic resonance imaging provided information crucial to resolving the issue of whether the zzso consisted of a central zzso disease process or a zzso disease in the zzso space or both of these two separate disease zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated no evidence of zzso zzso but rather showed a zzso cavity that was also confirmed by the subsequent zzso zzso On further consideration of these imaging findings, we concluded that the entity was zzso escape reaction with simultaneous occurrence of an zzso tissue zzso adjacent to the left zzso zzso zzso extensive zzso zzso of the left zzso and zzso cortical zzso and chronic zzso of the left zzso zzso
