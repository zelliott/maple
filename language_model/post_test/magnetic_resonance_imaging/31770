zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising zzso tool to assess zzso zzso The accuracy of quantitative zzso zzso has been recently demonstrated, but to date no previous study has compared this technique with stress zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso reserve zzso based on zzso compared with zzso 

We examined 24 patients who underwent coronary zzso stress zzso and zzso zzso zzso assessment of both zzso and zzso images, zzso of zzso zzso and quantitative coronary zzso zzso were independently zzso zzso was calculated using Fermi zzso zzso zzso of quantitative and qualitative data was examined to detect zzso 50% diameter zzso zzso by zzso 

zzso analysis was obtained in 198 segments and quantitative analysis was performed in zzso zzso zzso coronary artery disease zzso was present in zzso of zzso Visual zzso assessment yielded sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso to predict zzso zzso while zzso showed sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso The sensitivity for zzso in the right coronary artery territory and zzso was low compared to zzso zzso and specificity for detection of significant zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso Area under the curve was zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The diagnostic accuracy of qualitative examination of zzso cardiac zzso and stress zzso were zzso The high sensitivity and low operator dependency of quantitative zzso makes it an attractive tool to evaluate zzso zzso
