The present study was designed to evaluate the short-term effects of intravenous administration of zzso on key functions in the kidney zzso and the outer and inner zzso of rats by using magnetic resonance imaging zzso Renal tissue water content, zzso tissue zzso (in relation to the magnetic resonance zzso relaxation zzso the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of water, and volume of zzso blood flow were zzso zzso administration resulted in an increased water content in all regions of the zzso In parallel with this, we found a significant reduction in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and in the outer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso indicating that the zzso to zzso volume fraction of water increased in response to zzso zzso zzso also decreased the blood zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso outer zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and in the inner zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso indicating an increased amount of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso blood flow decreased in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso administration was associated with increased zzso water content, an increase in the zzso to zzso volume fraction of water, an increased oxygen tension, and a decrease in the zzso blood zzso Thus zzso provides an integrated evaluation of changes in zzso function, leading to decreased zzso water and zzso zzso in response to zzso and, in addition, zzso provides an alternative tool to monitor zzso changes at the cellular zzso
