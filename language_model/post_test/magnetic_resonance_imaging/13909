This in zzso study investigated the feasibility to zzso the placement of three different zzso zzso zzso systems using real-time MR zzso 

The experiments were performed on an zzso zzso T high field whole body zzso zzso MR imaging was achieved by zzso or spiral zzso filling in conjunction with the sliding window reconstruction technique yielding an imaging speed of 15 frames per zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and a specially designed zzso closure device were tested in a water zzso A zzso plastic wall served as model for the zzso zzso zzso 

The delivery systems of the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and caused substantial artifacts, making the device placement impossible, even if the magnetic forces would have been zzso The self-made zzso caused only minor zzso artifacts allowing its zzso on the MR zzso The MR imaging techniques applied enabled real-time control of the zzso including steering through the artificial zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging allows for guidance and placement of an zzso zzso zzso in zzso suggesting the feasibility to perform zzso zzso zzso under zzso in zzso as zzso
