To employ magnetic resonance imaging zzso to seek evidence of zzso lateral zzso zzso consistent with a zzso involving selective zzso of only 1 of the 2 zzso compartments of the lateral zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso zzso 

At a single institution, surface zzso zzso zzso was obtained at 312 zzso resolution in zzso planes 2 zzso thick throughout the orbit in 20 normal volunteers and 18 patients with unilateral lateral zzso zzso fixated zzso on a target placed in central zzso zzso cross sections and zzso volumes of the superior and inferior lateral zzso compartments were zzso and correlated with clinical zzso 

Twelve patients with lateral zzso zzso demonstrated zzso highly significant zzso reductions in maximum cross sections and 50% reductions in zzso volumes from normal for both compartments zzso zzso zzso for all zzso Six patients with lateral zzso zzso had similar significant but zzso reductions in those measures only for the superior compartment of the affected lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso for all zzso with insignificant zzso reductions for the inferior compartment zzso zzso zzso for all zzso 

A subset of patients with clinical lateral zzso zzso may have zzso limited to the superior zzso zzso zzso may be caused by lateral zzso superior compartment zzso despite an intact lateral zzso inferior zzso This finding is consistent with evidence supporting independent zzso of the 2 lateral zzso zzso zzso
