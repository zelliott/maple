The purpose of this study was to compare adjacent vessel sign, increased zzso zzso zzso and various zzso features as described in the American College of zzso zzso zzso lexicon with zzso zzso in patients with unilateral breast zzso 

We zzso evaluated breast zzso examinations of zzso patients with zzso confirmed breast zzso In addition to the zzso zzso zzso the adjacent vessel sign and increased zzso zzso zzso of the zzso breast were evaluated by two independent zzso zzso features were then correlated with zzso zzso zzso 

The adjacent vessel sign was significantly zzso to zzso associated with tumor size, zzso zzso zzso distant zzso nuclear grade, and expression of zzso and zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with all zzso zzso zzso to zzso In zzso analysis, the significant and independent zzso were a zzso margin and rim enhancement for negative zzso and zzso zzso a kinetic curve type for higher zzso grade, and an increased zzso zzso zzso for larger tumor size, zzso zzso zzso distant zzso higher nuclear grade, and higher zzso zzso 

In conjunction with the standard zzso zzso zzso the adjacent vessel sign and increased zzso zzso zzso may serve as additional zzso of a poor zzso
