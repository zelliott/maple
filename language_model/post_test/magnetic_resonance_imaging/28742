In the attempts to zzso electric sources in the brain on the basis of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso distributed source zzso procedures have become of increasing zzso Several commercial software packages offer such zzso programs and results using these methods are seen more and more frequently in the zzso It is crucial that the users understand the similarities and differences of these methods and that they become aware of the advantages and limitations that are inherent to each zzso This review provides this information from a theoretical as well as from a practical point of zzso The theoretical part gives the zzso basis of the electromagnetic inverse problem and shows how the different a zzso assumptions are formally integrated in these zzso The authors restrict this zzso to the linear inverse solutions zzso those solutions in which the inversion procedure can be represented as a zzso applied to the zzso It will be shown that their properties can be best characterized by their resolution kernels and that methods with optimal resolution zzso can be zzso The authors also discuss the important problem of zzso strategies that are used to minimize the influence of zzso Finally, a new kind of inverse solution, termed zzso (for zzso zzso is presented that is based on constraining the source model on the basis of the currents that can actually be measured by the scalp recorded zzso The practical part of the review illustrates the zzso procedures with different clinical data zzso Three aspects become important when working with real zzso 1) Clinical data is usually far from ideal zzso number of electrodes, noise, zzso The behavior of inverse procedures in such unfortunate situations has to be zzso 2) The selection of the time points or time periods of interest is zzso especially in the analysis of spontaneous zzso 3) Additional information coming from other zzso is usually available and can be zzso The authors are illustrating these important points in the case of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Spike zzso frequency domain source zzso and zzso zzso based on electric field zzso will be zzso Finally, the technique of zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso will be zzso where zzso is recorded in the magnet and is used to zzso zzso acquisition with zzso zzso The analysis of both functional data, zzso the zzso in terms of three-dimensional source zzso and the zzso zzso combines the advantages of the two zzso the zzso resolution of the zzso and the spatial resolution of the zzso
