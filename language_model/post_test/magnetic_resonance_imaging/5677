The evaluation of plaque zzso as well as the degree of zzso narrowing is important in the management of carotid zzso Several reports have shown that zzso zzso zzso which plays a pivotal role in plaque vulnerability, zzso high signal intensity on zzso images of high-resolution zzso zzso zzso When an zzso is used to screen for vulnerable zzso a short scanning duration and a simple zzso protocol are zzso This study assessed the utility of screening zzso to detect zzso zzso consecutive cases with zzso carotid zzso scheduled for carotid zzso zzso or carotid artery zzso between January 2005 and December 2007 were zzso zzso zzso scans were obtained with zzso zzso recovery fast zzso sequences with cardiac zzso zzso zzso were performed with zzso zzso sequences suppressing blood flow signals by zzso wave spatial zzso over the scanning field of zzso zzso zzso The relative overall plaque signal zzso with reference to the zzso muscle were zzso and the correlation of zzso on zzso images between high-resolution zzso and screening zzso was zzso We excluded 50 cases because of zzso following zzso use of a zzso a long zzso zzso zzso between high-resolution and screening zzso zzso or zzso zzso Among the 43 cases included, the relative overall plaque signal intensity of high-resolution zzso and screening zzso were closely correlated zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso can be an alternative to high-resolution zzso in the assessment of zzso and may be a useful tool for detection of vulnerable zzso
