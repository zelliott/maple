zzso swelling is a common cause for vascular surgical zzso and zzso obstruction due to zzso syndrome zzso can be difficult to zzso Physical examination and zzso zzso imaging give zzso information but may miss the fundamental zzso of zzso Similarly, duplex zzso examination of the legs gives little information about central zzso of zzso return above the zzso zzso We have modified the technique of duplex zzso to evaluate the flow characteristics of the leg after zzso zzso zzso with the objective of revealing zzso obstruction characteristic of zzso Twelve patients with signs and symptoms of zzso were compared with healthy control subjects for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The data for healthy control subjects were obtained from a previous study of zzso volunteers using the same zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso mimics that caused during vigorous zzso A zzso ratio of zzso was generated for patient zzso Patients with clinical evidence of zzso had a mean zzso zzso ratio of zzso zzso control subjects had a mean ratio of zzso and zzso patients who had undergone zzso treatment had a zzso mean ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging results, when available, were interpreted as positive in only zzso of the patients with zzso according to both our zzso criteria and zzso zzso After intervention, the zzso zzso ratio in the zzso patients was found to be reduced similar to zzso control subjects, indicating a relief of central zzso obstruction by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are helpful for detection of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso ratios and zzso spectral analysis are helpful zzso to duplex imaging for leg zzso The zzso maneuvers are well tolerated by patients and yields zzso data regarding central zzso obstruction that zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging fail to zzso
