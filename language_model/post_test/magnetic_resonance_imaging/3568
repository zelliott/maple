The zzso zzso between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder zzso as formulated by zzso is currently being questioned, zzso by the finding that schizophrenia and BD partly share a common genetic zzso Although both disorders are characterized by changes in brain structure, family studies suggest more segregating than overlapping zzso abnormalities in both zzso 

To investigate whether patients with schizophrenia and patients with BD display overlapping abnormalities in brain volumes and cortical thickness and whether these are caused by shared genetic or environmental zzso 

zzso resonance imaging findings of zzso zzso and zzso zzso twin pairs zzso for zzso twin pairs zzso and zzso for zzso and healthy twin pairs were compared using structural equation zzso 

The Netherlands Twin Register and University Medical Center zzso 

A total of 310 individuals from 158 zzso complete and 6 zzso twin pairs were zzso 26 pairs zzso for schizophrenia (13 zzso and 13 zzso 49 pairs with BD (9 zzso and 4 zzso zzso 14 zzso and 22 zzso zzso and 83 healthy twin pairs (44 zzso and 39 zzso 

Estimates of additive genetic and unique environmental associations between schizophrenia and BD with overlapping and zzso volumes and cortical zzso 

Higher genetic liabilities for schizophrenia and BD were associated with smaller white matter volume, thinner right (and left) zzso thinner right zzso cortex, and thicker zzso and left superior motor zzso higher environmental liabilities were associated with thinner right zzso zzso zzso zzso liability for schizophrenia was associated with thicker right zzso zzso for zzso with larger zzso zzso 

Brain structures reflect overlapping and segregating genetic liabilities for schizophrenia and zzso The overlapping smaller white matter volume and common areas of thinner zzso suggest that both disorders share genetic zzso zzso
