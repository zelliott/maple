zzso and characterization of all focal zzso in the liver are critical for screening patients with chronic liver zzso The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and spiral zzso zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso in zzso patients when compared with pathological findings of the zzso zzso From February 1997 to July 1999, 34 zzso patients waiting for zzso liver transplantation zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso years; 24 zzso were zzso All patients had zzso and spiral zzso zzso zzso and findings were matched with the zzso zzso Data analyses were made using the zzso zzso zzso Mean time between zzso examination zzso or spiral zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso 39 zzso A total of 88 zzso were found in the 34 zzso 54 zzso zzso zzso zzso size, 18 zzso 10 zzso in 21 patients, 22 zzso zzso zzso size, zzso zzso zzso zzso in 11 patients, and 12 zzso zzso in 13 zzso zzso analyses showed that sensitivity of zzso and spiral zzso zzso for zzso zzso or zzso zzso diagnosis was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed no statistical difference between spiral zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso In conclusion, in patients with liver zzso zzso is more accurate than spiral zzso zzso for the detection of liver zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso size is always a restricting factor for these two techniques, which are unable to detect small zzso in more than zzso of zzso
