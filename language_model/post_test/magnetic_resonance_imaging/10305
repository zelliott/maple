The zzso zzso complex comprises several zzso but little is known of their human zzso We examined human zzso with zzso in terms of specificity to zzso flow zzso a key characteristic of zzso zzso zzso were large fields of moving dots, forming coherent global flow zzso Random motion was used as a zzso zzso mapping was also zzso The previously suggested existence of at least two distinct zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso complex was zzso Human zzso is activated about equally by all moving dot patterns, including random motion, suggesting that it has little sensitivity to global flow zzso As previously zzso this region shows strong signs of zzso organization and is only zzso activated by stimuli confined to the zzso zzso In human zzso located immediately anterior to zzso and strongly driven by zzso zzso zzso varies markedly with zzso flow zzso The strongest zzso is produced by complex flow that contains multiple flow components zzso contraction and zzso Single components produce rather less response, while rigid translation and random motion produce less zzso The results suggest that human zzso is strongly specialized for zzso global flow properties, while human zzso is less zzso
