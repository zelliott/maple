While recent reports have advocated the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso to detect the effects of zzso currents associated with human brain activity, only preliminary experimental data have been presented so far to demonstrate the feasibility of the zzso Furthermore, it has not been adequately demonstrated that zzso zzso can separate zzso current zzso effects from other effects such as blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has adequate sensitivity to detect zzso in zzso In this work, we introduce a method that can separate slow zzso zzso processes from potential rapid zzso zzso processes and apply this method to investigate whether zzso allows detection of an NC response to a visual zzso zzso studies zzso zzso 8) at zzso T using a sensitive zzso detector showed insignificant effects related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of a highly significant zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso experiments performed under similar conditions on the same subjects showed highly significant electrical activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that, under the conditions used in this study, the sensitivity of zzso to detect evoked responses through zzso is at least an order of magnitude below that of zzso functional zzso zzso or zzso and too low to be practically zzso
