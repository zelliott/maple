The design of a test object for the zzso evaluation of geometric image quality parameters in magnetic resonance imaging zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slice position, slice zzso slice zzso angle, spatial resolution, line spread function zzso are measurable in all slice planes within a volume corresponding to a typical head zzso Additionally, parameters particular to three-dimensional zzso transform zzso imaging are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso with regard to test object positioning through the determination of the six degrees of freedom of the test object within the zzso field of zzso
