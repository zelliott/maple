In several experimental models, status zzso zzso leads to secondary brain zzso and zzso In humans, such phenomena have been rarely demonstrated, particularly in cases of zzso involving the zzso zzso We report a 36 year old woman that presented partial zzso in May 1991 involving the right cerebral zzso The patient was then treated in the intensive care unit with artificial ventilation and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso showed transient right zzso and zzso zzso cortical zzso The cause of zzso was not zzso Three months later, the patient developed partial complex zzso with aura characterized by zzso zzso and auditory zzso zzso zzso recording showed a clear right zzso zzso onset of the zzso We speculate that status zzso created the zzso which subsequently caused the focal chronic zzso
