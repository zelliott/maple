zzso zzso spin tagging zzso approaches were used to zzso regional cerebral blood flow increases during finger tapping tasks in seven normal zzso zzso significant increases in cerebral blood flow were observed in the zzso primary zzso zzso in all seven subjects and in the supplementary motor area in five zzso The intrinsic spatial resolution of the cerebral blood flow images was approximately 4 zzso If no spatial filtering was applied, the average increase in cerebral blood flow in the activated primary zzso zzso was 60 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso If the images were filtered to a spatial resolution of 15 zzso the average increase in cerebral blood flow in the activated primary zzso zzso was 23 zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in agreement with previously reported zzso and PET zzso
