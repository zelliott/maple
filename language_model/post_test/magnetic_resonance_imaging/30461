To determine the impact of prostate motion on dose coverage in zzso zzso 

A total of 120 prostate positions were analyzed on 10 treatment plans for 10 prostate patients treated using our low-risk zzso therapy prostate protocol (University of Florida zzso zzso Institute zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso scans were registered for all zzso The planning target volume included the prostate with a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The prostate was zzso using zzso and zzso one-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The beam was zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso The prescription dose was 78 zzso equivalent zzso 

The mean percentage of zzso receiving 70 zzso zzso was zzso the zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the mean pelvic dose was zzso zzso The percentage of prostate receiving 78 zzso zzso with the zzso movements changed by zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso However, the prostate zzso after a zzso displacement changed significantly zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding minimal doses were also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso GE zzso zzso or zzso zzso For displacement points zzso the clinical target volume zzso coverage had a large and significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in zzso coverage of the clinical target zzso The minimal prostate dose was reduced zzso zzso zzso on average, for Points zzso The prostate minimal dose improved from zzso GE to zzso GE zzso zzso zzso with realignment for zzso zzso 

The good dose coverage and low normal doses achieved for the initial plan was maintained with movements of zzso or zzso 5 zzso zzso realignment improved coverage for zzso zzso
