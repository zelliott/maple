zzso In some species an zzso cavity inside the zzso bulb zzso persists and is called zzso bulb zzso zzso It is generally assumed that zzso in humans are solitary findings representing remnants of zzso structures that were not fully zzso although the zzso of zzso was never zzso Using magnetic resonance imaging zzso the present study aimed to study the zzso of zzso in healthy human zzso zzso and zzso A total of 122 individuals zzso Volumes of the right and left zzso were determined using zzso scans and a standardized protocol for zzso zzso For comparison, zzso of 42 zzso were collected and zzso zzso The main finding of this study was the high zzso of zzso structures in our study zzso zzso out of 122 zzso participants yielded signs for an zzso whereas three out of 42 zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso 

This stands in disagreement with the previous assumption of complete obliteration at the time of zzso This zzso may be explained by the fact that our present findings are based on modern zzso techniques with much higher resolution than 10 or 20 years zzso Another possible explanation for the zzso between studies based on zzso and zzso might relate to zzso zzso of zzso fluid from zzso Especially with a long zzso zzso zzso may collapse and may no longer appear as an open zzso
