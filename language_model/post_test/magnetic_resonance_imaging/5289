The objective of the current study was to compare zzso and long-term effect on chronic low back pain of zzso injection of zzso with or without presence of zzso type 1 zzso zzso 

Medical charts of patients receiving zzso injection of zzso from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1998 were zzso zzso Clinical parameters were recorded at zzso zzso after injection and at follow-up zzso zzso Patients were studied in three groups: zzso zzso if patients had zzso type 1 changes with no previous surgery or zzso zzso zzso zzso if patients had zzso type 1 changes at the level of previous surgery or zzso zzso zzso if patients had no zzso type 1 changes zzso 

zzso hours after zzso injection, higher proportion of patients with zzso improvement was observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than in Control zzso Low back pain decreased in both zzso zzso Low back pain did not vary from baseline in zzso No effect was detected in three groups, neither for radiating pain zzso after injection, nor for any outcome parameters at the latest zzso 

We suggest that patients with disabling chronic low back pain and zzso type 1 zzso changes have specific acute response to zzso injection of zzso Clinical studies are however necessary to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of such zzso
