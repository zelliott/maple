To determine whether damage to left zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso and to characterize the nature of the spelling zzso 

Left angular zzso may play a critical role in zzso However, this traditional view is challenged by reports of zzso after left zzso zzso and by functional imaging studies demonstrating zzso of left zzso during writing in normal zzso 

Patients with focal damage to the left zzso zzso and normal control subjects were administered a comprehensive spelling battery that included regular words, irregular words, and zzso as zzso 

Although patients performed worse than control subjects in all experimental conditions, the spelling deficit was particularly severe for irregular words, whereas regular word and zzso spelling were less zzso Additional analyses indicated that zzso zzso and word frequency had a much more pronounced effect on spelling accuracy in patients compared with control zzso Most errors on irregular words were zzso zzso consistent with reliance on a zzso zzso spelling strategy zzso zzso zzso Overall, the spelling impairment of the patients showed the characteristic profile of zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the damage in the majority of patients zzso an area within the left zzso zzso zzso where the authors previously obtained evidence of zzso in a functional imaging study of writing in normal zzso 

The behavioral and zzso observations in the patients are consistent with functional imaging studies of writing in zzso intact individuals and provide zzso evidence for the role of left zzso in zzso Together, these findings zzso left zzso as a possible neural zzso of the putative zzso lexicon that contains stored memory representations for the written forms of familiar zzso
