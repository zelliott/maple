Dynamic zzso zzso of patients with zzso arthritis has shown a decrease in the early enhancement rate zzso of zzso after zzso The purpose of this work was to investigate the underlying zzso 

zzso dynamic zzso images were acquired from 13 patients before and 1-2 weeks after zzso alpha zzso The zzso of the inflamed zzso was zzso The zzso relaxation time of the zzso was calculated from images at different flip zzso The time course of the arrival of zzso at the zzso artery was zzso The zzso enhancement of the inflamed zzso was modeled to calculate the fractional plasma volume zzso the fractional zzso zzso fluid volume zzso and the volume transfer constant zzso zzso and zzso values were compared and the dependence of the zzso on each zzso was zzso 

There was a decrease in the zzso measured over 26 s after treatment zzso p zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso contributed to this; however, the zzso was relatively insensitive to changes in zzso 

The decrease in zzso after zzso alpha treatment is largely caused by reductions in the volume transfer constant zzso the fractional plasma volume zzso and the zzso relaxation zzso Only the contributions from zzso and zzso directly reflect zzso zzso
