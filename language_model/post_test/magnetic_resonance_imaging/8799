At present, no zzso zzso drugs zzso are approved by the zzso zzso Food and Drug zzso possibly partly due to inadequate trial design since efficacy demonstration requires disease progression in the zzso zzso We investigated whether combinations of zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso markers provided effective diagnostic and zzso tools for identifying subjects with high risk of zzso Specifically, we investigated zzso cartilage longevity markers combining markers of breakdown, zzso and zzso 

The study included healthy individuals and subjects with zzso zzso In total, 159 subjects zzso female, age zzso zzso zzso years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso At baseline and after 21 months, zzso zzso collagen type II zzso fragment, zzso and zzso markers were zzso zzso markers included cartilage volume, zzso area, zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Joint space zzso was measured from zzso and at 21 months to assess progression of joint zzso 

zzso zzso had the highest diagnostic accuracy zzso as the area under the zzso characteristics curve zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso among the individual markers zzso than all others, P zzso zzso to distinguish subjects with zzso zzso from healthy zzso zzso cartilage longevity scored zzso zzso zzso to zzso higher than zzso P zzso zzso For prediction of zzso zzso progression based on baseline marker values, the individual zzso marker with highest zzso was zzso at zzso zzso to zzso zzso cartilage longevity scored zzso zzso zzso to zzso borderline higher than zzso P zzso zzso When comparing patients in the highest zzso for the longevity score to lowest zzso the odds ratio of progression was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso 

Combination of zzso and zzso zzso improved diagnosis and prognosis of knee zzso and may be useful to select high-risk patients for inclusion in zzso clinical zzso
