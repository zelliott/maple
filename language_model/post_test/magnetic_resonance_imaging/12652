To investigate the type of MR imaging diagnosis that corresponded to spinal zzso detected on a bone scan according to the number of zzso in breast cancer zzso 

We zzso reviewed spinal MR images of zzso patients with breast cancer whose bone scans showed one or more spinal hot zzso The patients were grouped according to the number of spinal zzso detected on the bone zzso one or two zzso versus multiple (more than zzso zzso By using MR imaging, we determined the zzso of the spinal zzso in terms of being either benign or zzso If the zzso were benign, we further zzso them into several specific zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso patients had one or two spinal zzso as seen on a bone zzso On MR imaging, 45 zzso of the 64 zzso had benign zzso whereas 19 zzso zzso were zzso The benign zzso in the 45 patients included facet zzso in 20 patients zzso zzso zzso in 12 patients zzso zzso fractures in eight patients zzso and zzso zzso in five patients zzso zzso zzso of zzso patients had multiple spinal zzso as seen on the bone zzso and MR imaging revealed multiple bone zzso in 67 patients zzso and facet zzso in three patients zzso 

One or two spinal zzso seen on a bone scan in breast cancer patients are more likely to be benign zzso such as facet zzso zzso zzso zzso fracture or zzso zzso on MR zzso
