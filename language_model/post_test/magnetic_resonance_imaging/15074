To test the feasibility of zzso zzso flow zzso to zzso the zzso wall zzso stress zzso and zzso zzso index zzso in high-grade internal carotid artery zzso zzso before and after zzso zzso 

Twenty patients with zzso % zzso zzso were zzso and consequently zzso zzso flow zzso was used to measure individual zzso zzso blood flow zzso zzso zzso and zzso were derived at eight wall segments in analysis planes positioned along the zzso common zzso and external carotid artery zzso 

Regional zzso of all patients decreased after zzso zzso Changes were most prominent at the zzso bulb but remained unchanged in the zzso and zzso zzso was significantly lower after zzso in the lateral vessel walls zzso For analysis planes at the zzso zzso and outlet, a reduction of mean zzso by 32 % and 52 % zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso (40 zzso zzso was found after zzso 

Our findings show the potential of in zzso zzso flow zzso to zzso zzso changes in wall zzso stress even in patients with complex flow zzso
