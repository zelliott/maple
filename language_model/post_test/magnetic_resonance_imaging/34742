The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of database zzso as an alternative to conventional zzso in pediatric brain zzso zzso parameters zzso levels and transmit gain zzso were analyzed zzso in 236 pediatric brain zzso zzso zzso zzso test and linear zzso analysis were performed to determine predictability of zzso parameters by zzso zzso zzso ratio, image quality, and potential time efficiency of zzso parameters were zzso No statistical difference zzso zzso zzso and a high correlation between the zzso of the zzso fast spin echo zzso zzso density zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso was zzso Strong correlations were noted between the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The receiver levels did not change significantly between zzso zzso and qualitative analyses revealed no differences in the zzso ratios of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Implementation of database zzso could improve time efficiency by 28 to zzso zzso parameters can be predicted by using zzso information while preserving the diagnostic image quality of the zzso zzso of database zzso into commercial zzso systems could improve zzso time efficiency and patient zzso
