A method for matching a digital brain anatomical zzso to zzso medical images zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The digital zzso was derived from anatomical templates of the brain, cut according to the zzso zzso The zzso consists of a set of zzso slices zzso describing the brain as anatomical contours and of a set of regions of interest zzso zzso the brain into functionally homogeneous zzso The matching procedure includes zzso an edge detection method for the extraction of anatomical contours and zzso a zzso zzso based on zzso matching to fit the zzso to the individual brain zzso as described by zzso Once the zzso is matched to zzso the associated templates of zzso can be overlapped with functional zzso studies, individually registered to zzso The method was tested on zzso zzso The efficacy of the zzso zzso in overlapping zzso and zzso contours was assessed by calculating for each slice an index representing the extent of overlapping zzso zzso of I in the range zzso were found (I zzso 1 complete zzso Local accuracy was also verified by comparing the position of correspondent anatomical zzso in the zzso and zzso images before and after zzso The zzso procedure was applied to representative zzso clinical images for an objective regional analysis of functional zzso
