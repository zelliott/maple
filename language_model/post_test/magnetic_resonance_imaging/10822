zzso zzso outcome represents a major morbidity for survivors of infant heart surgery for zzso heart zzso Previous studies in these zzso have reported zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso The hypothesis of this study is that zzso cerebral blood flow is substantially diminished and might relate to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso brain magnetic resonance imaging was zzso zzso blood flow zzso in infants with zzso heart defects were obtained by using a novel zzso magnetic resonance imaging technique, zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso blood flow was measured before the operation under standard ventilation and repeated after increased carbon zzso 

A total of 25 term infants were zzso The average age at the time of the operation was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heart defects varied zzso zzso occurred in zzso zzso zzso cerebral blood flow was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Five patients had cerebral blood flow zzso of less than 10 zzso zzso 100 g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso cerebral blood flow increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 g zzso zzso zzso zzso , P zzso zzso zzso analyses found that low zzso levels were associated with higher baseline cerebral blood flow values ( P zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso zzso and was associated with decreased baseline cerebral blood flow values ( P zzso zzso and a smaller change in cerebral blood flow with zzso ( P zzso zzso 

zzso brain abnormalities are common in these zzso before surgical zzso zzso cerebral blood flow for this cohort was low and drastically reduced in some zzso Low cerebral blood flow values were associated with zzso zzso zzso dioxide zzso was preserved but might be compromised by some aspects of the cardiac zzso The full spectrum of cerebral blood flow zzso with this technique in zzso heart defects and their long-term significance require continued zzso
