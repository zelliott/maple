zzso antipsychotic medications generally maintain or increase gray matter amount and zzso zzso psychosis patients have lower gray matter volume in the middle frontal zzso as well as worse performance on spatial working memory tasks compared to zzso This study investigated the effects of short-term zzso and eight-week zzso treatment on middle frontal thickness and spatial working memory in zzso psychosis zzso zzso zzso zzso psychosis patients treated with zzso or zzso and 26 controls completed structural magnetic resonance imaging, a spatial working memory task, and clinical assessment at three intervals zzso four weeks, and eight zzso all patients and 23 controls completed all three zzso zzso and zzso middle frontal thicknesses were measured using the automated program zzso zzso negative, and general symptoms of the Positive and zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased significantly in patients, with most of the change occurring in the first four weeks of zzso Patients demonstrated an increase in zzso middle frontal thickness over eight weeks of treatment compared to zzso There was a medium effect size relationship between reduction in negative symptoms at four and eight weeks, and a change in zzso middle frontal thickness over eight zzso No changes were found in spatial working memory zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso or zzso can increase prefrontal cortical thickness in zzso These findings are notable given the role of the zzso middle frontal region in zzso and the relationship between better cognitive functioning and better functional outcome in zzso
