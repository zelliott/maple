Previous work has shown that acupuncture stimulation evokes zzso of a zzso network zzso as well as zzso of zzso brain zzso This study explores the activity and functional connectivity of these regions during acupuncture zzso tactile stimulation and zzso acupuncture associated with zzso sharp zzso zzso during 201 scans and tactile stimulation during 74 scans for comparison at zzso zzso zzso and zzso was monitored with zzso and zzso response in 48 healthy zzso zzso of zzso regions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as activated regions in the zzso and a few zzso structures can be identified during acupuncture by general linear model analysis and zzso cross correlation zzso zzso these clusters showed virtual identity with the default mode network and the zzso zzso network in response to zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso structures not routinely reported in the default mode literature, were frequently involved in zzso When acupuncture induced sharp pain, the zzso was attenuated or became activated zzso zzso stimulation induced greater zzso of the zzso regions but less extensive zzso of the zzso These results indicate that the zzso of the zzso during acupuncture cannot be completely explained by the demand of attention that is commonly proposed in the default mode zzso Our results suggest that acupuncture zzso the zzso functional networks of the brain to mediate its actions, and that the effect is dependent on the zzso zzso
