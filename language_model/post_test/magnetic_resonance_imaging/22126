To assess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging in the characterization of the soft tissue mass associated with primary bone tumors, we compared it with zzso zzso imaging in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ewing zzso family of tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor compared with normal muscle had greater zzso ratio zzso on the zzso zzso zzso image than on zzso for zzso zzso P zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso tumor compared with subcutaneous fat was greater on zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso found it easier to evaluate zzso bundle proximity to tumor with zzso zzso zzso images than with zzso for zzso of patients zzso P zzso zzso They judged zzso zzso zzso superior to zzso for zzso tumor zzso and zzso of soft tissue necrosis in zzso zzso P zzso zzso In patients with zzso or Ewing zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging may replace zzso imaging for soft tissue mass zzso especially if contrast is being used for dynamic zzso
