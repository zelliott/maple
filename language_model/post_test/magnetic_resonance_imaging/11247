The diagnosis of corpus zzso zzso zzso with prenatal zzso relies on indirect zzso However, they are known to be zzso in case of incomplete zzso The purpose of this study is to specify the frequency of indirect signs in partial zzso to approach the reliability of fetal zzso 

This retrospective study included 33 children with partial zzso zzso were reviewed by two observers and a standardized zzso and clinical data collection was zzso Depending on the ratio zzso zzso brain diameter, two groups were statistically zzso zzso partial zzso and mild partial zzso 

zzso of patients had none indirect sign and zzso had only one zzso We found a zzso difference of frequency for most of the indirect zzso zzso of patients had other cerebral zzso Clinical correlation showed no statistical difference between the two zzso 

This series shows that indirect signs are zzso in partial zzso and related to the zzso zzso In contrast, mild and zzso zzso have a similar neurological zzso These data suggest that greatest care has to be taken in the interpretation of fetal zzso
