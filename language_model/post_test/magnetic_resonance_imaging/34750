zzso zzso characterized by zzso loss is a common feature in intractable zzso lobe zzso in zzso In zzso magnetic resonance zzso a reduction in zzso or in its ratio to other zzso is considered a sensitive method for detecting zzso zzso This zzso approach was used to study the zzso zzso especially the zzso regions of children with partial zzso In all cases, zzso scans were studied to verify the extension of the zzso zzso Five children zzso zzso lobe zzso in 2 of them, zzso was zzso Both zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging, and significant reductions in the zzso ratios on zzso zzso to the seizure focus, as verified by zzso Three children with zzso lobe zzso had zzso zzso One of them had a reduction in zzso ratios in the zzso and zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso to the seizure zzso The results show that the value of zzso zzso lies not only in zzso zzso zzso but also in detecting zzso and the extent of zzso loss outside zzso This zzso zzso diagnostic method can be considered an additional technique to be used in conjunction with other imaging techniques for clinical assessment of children with intractable zzso lobe zzso
