A zzso prediction of the 360 degrees point zzso depth would aid the planning of electric acoustic stimulation zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to establish whether the distance between the round window and the opposite cochlear wall on CT or MR imaging may be used to predict the length of a cochlear implant zzso array required to be inserted to the 360 degrees point of the zzso zzso 

CT and MR imaging data were studied in 19 patients undergoing cochlear zzso zzso were measured between the round window and the opposite outer cochlear wall on an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distance zzso were applied to a spiral function to estimate the length of an zzso array extending between the round window entry point and the 360 degrees zzso This was compared with zzso of implant length to this zzso depth on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso for each of the 2 observers was r zzso zzso for CT and r zzso zzso for MR zzso zzso zzso was r zzso zzso for CT and r zzso zzso for MR zzso There was no bias between CT and MR imaging zzso with a mean difference of less than zzso zzso CT and MR imaging estimates markedly correlated with the actual length of the zzso array extending to the 360 degrees zzso depth zzso between the estimated and actual length was zzso zzso for CT and zzso zzso for MR zzso 

CT and MR imaging measures of cochlear distance zzso were used to predict zzso depths to 360 degrees , and these were markedly zzso with the actual length of the zzso array required to reach this zzso MR imaging zzso were more precise and similar in accuracy to those obtained with zzso
