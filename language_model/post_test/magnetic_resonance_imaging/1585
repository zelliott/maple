Two different zzso in disease activity are observed during the clinical course of zzso zzso zzso The assessment of disease activity is important for predicting the outcome of medical management because medical treatment can be effective in the active zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso could assess the disease activity in zzso To investigate the relation between zzso signal intensity zzso and zzso muscle zzso size, 11 patients with zzso were zzso zzso sizes zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso of zzso was expressed as a percentage of zzso zzso The reduction in zzso was significantly positively correlated with that of zzso enlargement after zzso Additionally, zzso in zzso showed a significant correlation with reduction in zzso volume for therapeutic effect, which indicates zzso in zzso can be one of the reliable parameters for predicting the therapeutic outcome of zzso To investigate whether zzso pattern could predict the zzso of zzso 28 patients with zzso disease with or without zzso were zzso Patients with zzso with zzso zzso showed an uniform zzso pattern in enlarged zzso However, in patients with irreversible zzso caused by the mechanical limitation of zzso zzso image showed no uniformity with a partial appearance of low zzso The partial low zzso may indicate the progress of inactive zzso change in zzso after active zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is a useful tool for detection not only of zzso enlargement, but also disease activity in zzso zzso zzso and pattern can predict the outcome of medical management in zzso
