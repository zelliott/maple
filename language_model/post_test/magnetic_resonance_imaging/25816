A zzso technique for zzso zzso of the left zzso volume is much faster than the use of zzso methods and is therefore better zzso leaving time for additional zzso The zzso left zzso volume can be reliably measured by this method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso volume is consistently overestimated by zzso zzso zzso compared with the reference value obtained by single slice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stroke volume and ejection fraction is underestimated on average by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
