In agreement with optical imaging studies, previous zzso studies have reported an initial decrease zzso the initial zzso in the zzso response, which is believed to arise from an increase in oxygen consumption and to be mostly zzso To date, experimental studies of the initial dip in humans have been performed at fields up to 4 zzso with relatively low spatial zzso Because the sensitivity to zzso contribution is increased at high magnetic fields, the present study investigated the initial dip at 7 zzso In addition, to reduce the partial volume effect, the study is conducted at a high spatial zzso The initial dip was detected in all subjects studied and was found to reside mostly in the gray zzso The relative zzso of the early response was found to be zzso higher than that at 4 T zzso and zzso T zzso In addition, based on the assumption that the initial dip is a result of increased oxygen zzso the fractional change in oxygen zzso was estimated to be zzso of that of the fractional change in cerebral blood zzso These results are in agreement with the notion that the initial dip arises from an increase in oxygen zzso
