This study presents zzso validation of an objective zzso computer zzso algorithm, the zzso zzso data analysis technique zzso for analysis of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data in experimental focal cerebral zzso zzso zzso and diffusion zzso weighted zzso images were acquired from 4 to zzso hours after stroke on separate groups of zzso Animals were killed immediately after zzso for zzso zzso MR images were zzso to zzso zzso zzso areas were defined using zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso images, and zzso The last techniques clearly zzso between zzso and zzso intact zzso zzso areas were zzso and significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with zzso defined zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso areas showed no significant correlation with zzso evaluated zzso until zzso time zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso methodology can accurately detect and identify zzso cell damage early and late after zzso with zzso outperforming zzso zzso and zzso images in identification of zzso zzso from 4 to zzso hours after zzso
