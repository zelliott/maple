A subset of patients with zzso zzso zzso present with massive zzso It is unknown why certain patients develop these massive zzso and whether this presentation is specific to the underlying viral zzso or patient demographics such as zzso race and zzso 

All patients with zzso at Bellevue Hospital Center, New York from 1998 to 2012 were identified and relevant demographic and clinical information was zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso images were reviewed and the zzso zzso diameter on zzso sections was zzso zzso was defined zzso or by zzso zzso The two zzso of massive and zzso zzso were zzso 

A total of zzso patients with zzso were identified, of which 58 were zzso as having a massive zzso using a 13 zzso size zzso zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated a significant association of massive zzso with age zzso years; zzso B or Asian zzso and a lack of zzso or zzso count zzso 

zzso zzso represents a zzso zzso that is associated with young, chronic zzso B carriers with zzso zzso The clinical implications of this finding are that patients with massive zzso are typically excellent zzso candidates barring the presence of gross vascular invasion or distant zzso
