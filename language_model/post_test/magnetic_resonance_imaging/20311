We set out to identify whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso would identify evidence of zzso zzso zzso in a group of experienced recreational scuba zzso 

Local British zzso zzso Club divers of at least zzso zzso Leader grade were offered zzso scans zzso and zzso zzso of hips, zzso and zzso zzso images were interpreted separately by two zzso and cases not considered unequivocally normal were discussed for consensus zzso 

Of 26 divers zzso five merited zzso Four of these were considered to show unrelated normal zzso or incidental zzso Only one case zzso in the right zzso and left zzso could have possibly represented zzso zzso After obtaining plain zzso and more detailed clinical and dive history, these zzso were considered zzso but probably not zzso by both zzso and after taking further specialist musculoskeletal zzso zzso 

This study found no evidence that zzso is a significant risk in recreational scuba diving and as such concurs with prevailing current zzso
