The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso Eight patients were zzso enrolled in the zzso The degree of the zzso of the zzso collecting system varied from minimal to zzso All procedures were performed solely under zzso guidance with a zzso open zzso zzso zzso system with zzso optical zzso In each case, zzso was performed with a zzso drainage kit using the zzso zzso Seven out of eight zzso were successfully performed under zzso zzso All zzso procedures in zzso zzso collection systems were zzso however, zzso zzso could not be placed in a zzso zzso The mean time needed for the zzso zzso was 26 zzso No major complications occurred during the procedure or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso collection system is feasible and zzso The presented technique has limitations that zzso further technical developments before the procedure can be applied to zzso zzso and recommended for routine clinical zzso
