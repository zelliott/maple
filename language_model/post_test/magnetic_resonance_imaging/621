To determine the frequency of zzso and zzso consults in children evaluated for physical abuse without zzso symptoms and the diagnostic yield of these zzso 

Records of zzso zzso patients younger than 48 months evaluated with a skeletal survey at two academic medical centers were reviewed for frequency of CT or zzso and zzso zzso the results of these tests, and factors associated with given zzso zzso associated with positive findings during evaluation were also zzso 

Fifty-one patients had a skeletal survey and no clinical signs of zzso zzso Seventy-five percent of patients had CT or zzso zzso had formal evaluation for retinal zzso zzso percent had evidence of zzso injury without zzso zzso Age less than 12 months was the only factor significantly associated with zzso zzso vs zzso zzso Sex, race, insurance, and having an unrelated male caretaker were not significantly associated with performance of zzso or findings of zzso zzso 

Age less than 1 year was the only significant factor associated with the diagnostic zzso Neither retinal zzso nor historic factors were sensitive markers for abnormalities found by zzso zzso should have a low threshold for zzso when physical abuse is suspected in a young zzso
