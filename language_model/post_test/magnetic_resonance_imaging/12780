zzso identification of transplanted neural stem cells in zzso by zzso with contrast agents may play an important role in the translation of cell therapy to the zzso zzso the impact of these labels on the zzso ability to repair is therefore zzso In rats with middle cerebral artery zzso zzso a model of stroke, the zzso migration of zzso cells zzso with the zzso contrast agent zzso was detected on magnetic resonance images zzso up to 4 weeks following zzso However, compared to zzso cells zzso with the red fluorescent dye zzso zzso transplants did not significantly improve zzso and performance was akin to zzso zzso Likewise, the evolution of anatomical damage as assessed by serial, zzso zzso over 1 year indicated that zzso transplants resulted in a slight increase in zzso size compared to zzso animals, whereas the same, zzso cells significantly decreased zzso size by zzso Although zzso zzso allows the in zzso identification of transplanted cells up to 1 month after zzso it is likely that some is gradually zzso inside zzso The translation of cellular imaging therefore does not only require the in zzso assessment of contrast agents on cellular functions, but also requires the zzso in zzso assessment of the label on the stem zzso ability to repair in zzso models of neurological zzso
