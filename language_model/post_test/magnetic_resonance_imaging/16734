We wanted to investigate if retinal nerve fiber layer thickness zzso measured by optical zzso zzso zzso might be a good marker of acute and chronic changes in the zzso visual zzso following acute zzso zzso zzso 

We studied the relationship of zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso nerve mean area, and zzso zzso by zzso with zzso response to a visual paradigm in 40 patients with acute ON and 19 healthy controls in a prospective cohort study over a zzso zzso 

The main finding was a significant correlation of zzso nerve zzso length and mean area with zzso response in affected eyes in the acute phase and between zzso and zzso response in affected eyes after zzso 

zzso is a very good measure of damage to the zzso visual zzso in recovered patients with ON and should be included in future zzso studies when looking for visual reorganization in recovered patients with zzso
