To evaluate a rapid and comprehensive MR protocol based on a zzso sequence in conjunction with a rolling table platform for the zzso of total body zzso 

11 healthy volunteers and 50 patients were included in the zzso MR data was acquired on a zzso system zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso flash zzso sequence zzso 101, TE zzso zzso 70, zzso 50 zzso 205 zzso 256 zzso slice zzso 10 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso was used for data zzso Patients were placed in a zzso position on a rolling table platform capable of acquiring multiple consecutive data sets by pulling the patient through the zzso of the zzso Data sets extending from the upper to lower zzso were zzso The images were analyzed with respect to the amount of zzso subcutaneous and total abdominal fat by zzso image zzso software that employs a zzso zzso 

The obtained MR images were able to be evaluated for all volunteers and zzso Excellent correlation was found between whole body zzso results in volunteers with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the correlation zzso was zzso between zzso and zzso indicating only moderate reliability of the zzso zzso Variations in patients with respect to the amount of total, zzso and zzso zzso tissue was not related to standard zzso zzso and zzso zzso profiles zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The results showed that there was a significant variation in zzso zzso tissue which could not be predicted from the total body fat zzso zzso zzso zzso or subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso Although no significant differences in zzso could be found between females and males zzso zzso zzso females showed significantly higher total and subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso 

This MR protocol can be used for the rapid and zzso zzso of body zzso The missing relationship between serum lipids and body fat masses suggests that the latter is an additional and independent hazard zzso Variations in body fat distribution, zzso zzso relationship between subcutaneous and zzso fat, can be zzso zzso
