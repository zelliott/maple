To investigate the long-term risk of developing zzso in patients presenting with acute zzso zzso zzso and normal brain zzso scans at zzso 

We studied 58 zzso patients with normal brain zzso at presentation for up to 5 years with serial zzso and imaging zzso All patients underwent zzso analysis at onset which was defined positive if two or more zzso zzso bands and/or elevated zzso index were zzso Brain and spinal zzso zzso scans were obtained every 6 months for the first 2 years, and annually thereafter unless the patient experienced a second zzso attack different from the initial episode to confirm zzso or there was demonstration of zzso zzso confirming dissemination in time and space to fulfill McDonald imaging criteria to diagnose zzso 

zzso of 58 zzso patients developed zzso of which 7 zzso patients developed zzso and 10 zzso developed zzso using McDonald Imaging zzso Mean time to zzso by a second clinical attack was zzso 1 months compared to zzso 2 months by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the patients developed zzso after 24 months of zzso All 17 patients who developed zzso had positive zzso although 15 patients who had positive zzso did not develop zzso during the 5 years of zzso 

The majority of patients with zzso and normal brain zzso do not develop zzso after 5 years of follow-up confirming the relatively low risk compared to patients with abnormal brain zzso zzso zzso is helpful in distinguishing patients more likely to develop zzso Compared to clinical attacks, serial imaging may not lead to an earlier diagnosis in zzso patients with normal brain zzso
