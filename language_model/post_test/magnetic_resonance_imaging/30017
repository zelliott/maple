Alzheimer's disease zzso is the most prevalent neurological condition affecting zzso nations and will rapidly become a zzso crisis as the population zzso Currently, the zzso zzso observation of zzso plaques and zzso zzso is the only definitive diagnosis available for zzso A zzso biological or zzso marker specific for zzso used in conjunction with current neurological and memory testing could add a great deal of confidence to the diagnosis of zzso and potentially allow therapeutic intervention much earlier in the disease zzso 

Our group has developed zzso techniques to detect individual zzso plaques in zzso transgenic mouse brain in zzso We are also developing zzso agents to increase the specificity of detection of zzso zzso Such in zzso imaging of zzso plaques will also allow the evaluation of zzso therapies being developed by the pharmaceutical industry in zzso trials of zzso transgenic zzso This short review briefly discusses our progress in these zzso
