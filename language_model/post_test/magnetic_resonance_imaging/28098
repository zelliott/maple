zzso bleeding was produced in 8 zzso and zzso dogs by an artificial zzso Changes in vital zzso variables were related to zzso shifts and tissue water content assessed with MR zzso Six animals survived while 2 zzso In the surviving animals zzso shifts and zzso remained unchanged from an early zzso The cerebral zzso pressure was reduced from between 80 and 110 zzso zzso to between 40 and 60 zzso zzso Some increase in zzso white matter tissue water was zzso In the lethal experiments cerebral zzso pressure fell to less than 40 zzso zzso Moreover, secondary delayed anatomical changes were seen including zzso zzso in cerebral tissue water was more intense and widespread than in the zzso These findings indicate that the outcome of zzso bleeding is related to cerebral zzso pressure with secondary deterioration resulting from additional volume loading from increased tissue water and zzso
