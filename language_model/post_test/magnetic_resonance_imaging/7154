This work deals with dynamic anatomy of human body explored by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Recent development of zzso pulse sequences allow very fast data zzso Using an zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso different body segments have been zzso in two different zzso The first approach consisted in a zzso display of anatomical sections of an articulation obtained in different zzso The result shows the movement of the zzso The second approach consisted in the examination of a single slice several times, with cardiac synchronization zzso the result is the evaluation of phase zzso measuring the flow directions and the zzso of circulating zzso The results are shown as a video tape with zzso It starts with the zzso the ankle, the knee, the zzso the hand, the cervical spine, de zzso zzso the zzso zzso during zzso and the zzso movements zzso and zzso according to different planes, are successively zzso Finally, flow zzso are zzso cardiac movements and zzso zzso flow, the zzso zzso fluid zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is concluded by showing a work in progress on urine flow during zzso
