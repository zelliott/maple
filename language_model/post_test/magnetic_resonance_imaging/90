zzso data from various scientific approaches strongly zzso zzso systems in zzso zzso The functional anatomy of these systems has been zzso together from disparate sources, such as animal studies, zzso studies in humans, and structural and functional imaging studies in zzso To better define this distinct functional zzso in the current study we delineate the role of the zzso in several zzso systems simultaneously and in the same subjects using resting state functional connectivity zzso Independent component analysis was applied to resting state data from two independent zzso to identify common zzso contributions to several previously identified intrinsic connectivity networks zzso involved in executive control, episodic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found distinct zzso contributions to each of these zzso The zzso zzso in zzso the right and left executive control networks (especially zzso I and zzso zzso the zzso network zzso zzso and zzso the zzso network zzso zzso Little to no overlap was detected between these zzso regions and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also located in zzso and zzso zzso prominent points of convergence for zzso input and zzso zzso The results suggest that the most zzso recent part of the zzso particularly zzso I and II, make contributions to parallel zzso zzso involved in executive control, zzso zzso and episodic zzso The largest portions of the zzso take part in the executive control network implicated in higher cognitive functions such as working zzso
