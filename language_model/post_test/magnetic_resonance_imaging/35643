zzso obesity is intimately associated with zzso disease and adverse health zzso However, a direct association between increasing amounts of visceral fat and zzso inflammation and zzso has not been zzso We examined the association between visceral fat and liver inflammation in patients with zzso fatty liver disease zzso to delineate the importance of visceral fat to progressive zzso and hence the inflammatory zzso of the zzso zzso We undertook a zzso proof of concept study in 38 consecutive adults with zzso at a zzso liver zzso All subjects had a complete physical examination, zzso assessment, and zzso blood tests on the day of liver zzso zzso fat volumes were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging within 2 weeks of liver zzso The extent of zzso inflammation and zzso zzso zzso with increases in visceral fat zzso zzso zzso For each zzso increase in visceral fat, the odds ratio for increasing liver inflammation and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fat remained an independent predictor of advanced zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso even when controlled for insulin resistance and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, which correlated with visceral fat, also independently predicted increasing liver zzso zzso fat was associated with all components of the zzso zzso 

zzso fat is directly associated with liver inflammation and zzso independent of insulin resistance and zzso zzso zzso fat should therefore be a central target for future interventions in zzso zzso and indeed all zzso zzso
