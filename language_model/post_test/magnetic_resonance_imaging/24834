The zzso contribution to the zzso barrier zzso in zzso and primary zzso brain tumors is not well zzso To better understand the vascular properties associated with zzso and primary zzso brain tumors, the authors systematically analyzed the zzso component of the zzso in brain zzso 

Twelve patients who underwent zzso of zzso or primary brain zzso (4 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso 4 zzso findings were zzso 

zzso regions of zzso enhancement corresponded with breakdown of the normal zzso cell relationship in the zzso in zzso deposits and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated lack of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso At the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso vessels was zzso zzso zzso in enhancing regions of high-grade zzso revealed gaps in zzso and zzso zzso consistent with disintegration of the normal zzso cell association in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso regions of high-grade zzso maintained the normal zzso cell relationship seen in an intact zzso with zzso and zzso zzso processes that were zzso associated with the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso enhancement in zzso and primary zzso zzso to areas of breakdown of the zzso zzso cell relationship of the zzso including loss of normal zzso zzso architecture on zzso and zzso zzso zzso areas are associated with preservation of the normal zzso cell relationship of the intact zzso
