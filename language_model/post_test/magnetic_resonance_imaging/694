Recent zzso studies have revealed that acupuncture stimulation zzso human central nervous system including cerebral zzso and zzso zzso Due to the wide and intricate connections with zzso we hypothesized that zzso specific areas in human zzso are also modulated by acupuncture stimulation beyond classical involvement of zzso in motor zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate neural zzso responding to the acupuncture stimulation of zzso 6 zzso zzso an zzso relevant for the management of zzso including zzso motion zzso zzso stimulation near the zzso and tactile stimulation on the skin of the zzso were given as separate zzso zzso scores as well as the heart and respiratory rates were measured during each zzso zzso manipulation on zzso in comparison to the sham acupuncture and tactile stimulation conditions, selectively activated left superior frontal zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso nucleus of zzso zzso neural zzso in zzso were also evident in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso MR signal changes, often seen during the acupuncture of zzso points, were not observed in the present zzso Our data suggest that zzso serves as important zzso zzso during the acupuncture stimulation of zzso and clinical efficacy of zzso may be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso
