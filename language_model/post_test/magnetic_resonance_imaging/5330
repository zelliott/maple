The purpose of this study was to directly and zzso compare the capability of dynamic zzso zzso and zzso assessed zzso zzso to assess zzso COPD in a large prospective zzso 

The GOLD criteria for smokers were used to zzso zzso smokers into four clinical stage groups as zzso smokers without COPD zzso and with mild zzso moderate zzso and severe or very severe COPD zzso All smokers underwent dynamic zzso zzso zzso and pulmonary function zzso Mean relative enhancement ratio and mean zzso time on zzso and zzso functional lung volume zzso zzso as well as the ratio of airway wall area to total airway area on zzso were zzso zzso Then, all indexes were significantly correlated with functional zzso To determine the efficacy of all indexes for clinical stage zzso the indexes for the four clinical groups were statistically compared by using zzso honestly significant difference multiple comparison zzso 

All indexes had significant correlations with functional parameters zzso All indexes except zzso zzso in all groups had significant differences each other zzso 

Dynamic zzso zzso for assessment of COPD in smokers is potentially as zzso as zzso assessed zzso zzso
