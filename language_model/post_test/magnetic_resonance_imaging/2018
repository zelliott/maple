zzso in zzso cortisol zzso and feedback sensitivity are reported in zzso However, it is not known whether these zzso zzso axis zzso are related to structural brain zzso This study was designed to investigate these relationships in the zzso Nine young zzso zzso zzso years; mean zzso SE; zzso zzso and 11 older zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso men, in addition to having standardized magnetic resonance imaging of their zzso were given zzso zzso cortisol or zzso zzso in a zzso crossover zzso As expected, older men had significantly smaller volumes for all brain zzso Although the groups did not differ in baseline zzso axis activity, there were significant and specific relationships between the brain volumes and the baseline measures of zzso zzso zzso for young and older subjects combined and after controlling for age and cerebral vault size, zzso volumes were zzso associated with 24-hour urinary cortisol and zzso zzso zzso levels, and the anterior zzso zzso volume was zzso correlated with baseline zzso zzso subjects had a slower decrease in zzso levels zzso of baseline zzso during the first 30 zzso after cortisol zzso However, no associations were observed between the zzso feedback zzso and any brain zzso This report, although based on a small number of subjects, supports previous studies showing a blunted zzso fast feedback during normal zzso zzso zzso appears to be related to increased zzso measures of zzso axis activity, but not to fast zzso zzso It remains possible that zzso changes in fast feedback may be related to changes to other brain sites, such as zzso or zzso
