Emerging data have revealed a negative association between zzso and muscle quality zzso There is a lack of research to examine this interaction among young, healthy individuals, and to evaluate the contribution of zzso to adaptation after resistance exercise zzso 

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the influence of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso on muscle function among non-obese individuals before and after zzso 

zzso included zzso non-obese zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SAT and muscle mass zzso resonance zzso SAT and biceps muscle zzso zzso and dynamic biceps strength, and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed at baseline and after 12 weeks of unilateral zzso 

At zzso SAT was independently associated with lower zzso for males zzso zzso and females zzso zzso controlling for body mass and zzso zzso to zzso revealed a significant negative association between SAT and changes for strength capacity zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso among zzso No zzso was identified among zzso zzso SAT remained a negative predictor of zzso for males and females zzso zzso 

The findings reveal that SAT is a negative predictor of zzso among zzso healthy adults, and that after 12 weeks of progressive zzso this association was not zzso Data suggest that SAT exerts a weak, negative influence on the zzso response to strength and zzso among zzso
