The purpose of our study was to determine if vascular zzso produced an additive effect on muscle zzso and strength performance with high strength training zzso Sixteen physically active men were divided into two groups: high-intensity zzso zzso 6 zzso and zzso training zzso zzso 12 zzso An zzso cuff was attached to the zzso end of the right zzso so that blood flow was reduced during the zzso The left leg served as a control, thus was trained without vascular zzso zzso extension 1 zzso and zzso zzso area zzso were evaluated zzso and zzso weeks of zzso We only found a main time effect for both strength gains and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we conclude that vascular zzso in combination with high-intensity strength training does not augment muscle strength or zzso when compared to high-intensity strength training zzso
