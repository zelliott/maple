Visual word recognition requires information about the positions as well as the identities of the letters in a zzso This study addresses representation of letter position at zzso levels of the word recognition zzso We present evidence from an acquired dyslexic patient, zzso who zzso letters in zzso reading tasks: Far more often than expected by chance, zzso reading responses include letters from preceding responses zzso zzso read as zzso immediately after zzso was read zzso zzso carried out over two large data sets compared the positions of zzso letters zzso the G in zzso with the positions of the corresponding zzso letters zzso the G in zzso The analyses assessed the extent to which the zzso preserved source position as defined by various theories of letter position zzso The results provided strong evidence for graded zzso position zzso in which the position of each letter is zzso zzso relative to both the beginning and the end of the zzso Alternative position representation schemes, including zzso and zzso schemes, were not zzso
