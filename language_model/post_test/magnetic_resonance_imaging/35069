zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso has evolved to a highly sensitive method for zzso detection of zzso sclerosis in zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso resolution and zzso zzso are believed to correlate with extent of zzso Therefore an easy zzso method to determine extent of zzso is zzso The purpose of this work is to evaluate and compare two different measurement techniques for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with a mean seizure history of zzso years and medically intractable zzso were zzso They underwent zzso with zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso recalled echo sequence in 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length was calculated with two different zzso In the slice counting method zzso the number of consecutive zzso slices containing zzso zzso formation was zzso In the zzso method zzso the sum of the zzso and thus longer distances between the zzso points of segmented zzso areas on each zzso slice were zzso 

Since the zzso is a curved body, the zzso lengths measured with zzso were always larger than measured with zzso The comparison of zzso length expressed in zzso of total zzso showed good agreement between the two methods, because unlike the absolute values of zzso zzso the percentage values are unaffected by the three-dimensional shape of the zzso 

The easier and quicker method of zzso zzso may be used to determine zzso length expressed in zzso of total zzso giving reliable values for zzso length but causing less zzso zzso
