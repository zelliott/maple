Identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso can be difficult due to the subtle zzso zzso Though sequences like zzso zzso attenuated inversion zzso can detect a large majority of these zzso there are smaller zzso without signal changes that can easily go unnoticed by the naked zzso The aim of this study is to improve the visibility of focal cortical zzso zzso in the zzso weighted brain zzso zzso In the proposed method, we used a complex diffusion based approach for calculating the zzso affected zzso Based on the diffused image and thickness map, a complex map is zzso From this complex zzso zzso areas can be easily zzso zzso brains of 48 subjects selected by zzso were given to computer scientists who developed the complex map for identifying the cortical zzso The scientists were blinded to the zzso interpretation result of the zzso The zzso could be identified in all the patients in whom surgery was done, however three patients had false positive zzso More zzso were identified in patients in whom surgery was not performed and zzso were seen in few of the zzso These were considered as false zzso This computer aided detection technique using complex diffusion approach can help detect focal cortical zzso in patients with zzso
