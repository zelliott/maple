We report here, for the first time, the case of a 41-year-old man with both zzso disease zzso zzso type 3 zzso and zzso zzso type zzso The patient noted zzso at 14 years of age and unsteady gait at 30 years of zzso Similar sized expansions of the zzso zzso repeats in one zzso of the zzso zzso gene were found in both the patient and his father, although in the other zzso the length of the zzso repeats was shorter in the father compared with the zzso In the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso gene the zzso repeats were much more expanded in the patient compared with his zzso Thus it is possible that, in the farther, the short zzso repeat in the zzso zzso zzso delayed the onset of zzso symptoms, and/or that the expanded zzso repeat in the zzso gene in the patient accelerated the zzso of zzso
