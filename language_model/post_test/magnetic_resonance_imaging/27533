zzso classically involved in social and zzso activities, is increasingly recognized as an zzso and zzso agent, effects which may be zzso via zzso interactions with the zzso zzso Thus, genetic variation within the zzso gene zzso is likely to explain zzso in zzso stress zzso As such, we examined how zzso variation is associated with zzso zzso zzso in a healthy human zzso 

Fifty-five young healthy volunteers were scanned using zzso zzso zzso zzso while they underwent a standardized physical and emotional zzso that consisted of moderate levels of experimental sustained deep muscle pain, and a zzso control zzso Four zzso tagging single zzso zzso located in regions near zzso were zzso zzso of pain, zzso anxiety, well-being and interpersonal attachment were also zzso 

Female zzso C zzso carriers demonstrated greater zzso zzso release, measured as reductions in zzso availability from baseline to the zzso condition relative to female zzso zzso No significant differences were detected among zzso We also observed that female zzso C zzso carriers exhibited higher attachment anxiety, higher trait anxiety and lower emotional well-being zzso In addition, greater zzso zzso release was associated with lower emotional well-being scores in female zzso C zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso within the zzso gene appear to explain zzso differences in zzso responses to stress, which are shown to be associated with anxiety traits, including those linked to attachment style, as well as emotional well-being in zzso
