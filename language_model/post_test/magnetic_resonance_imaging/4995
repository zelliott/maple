Muscle magnetic resonance imaging zzso is an innovative tool for exploring focal zzso However, its usefulness in mild, zzso or chronic zzso when zzso zzso the current zzso zzso sensitivity is zzso has yet to be zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso examinations were performed in 113 muscles of 17 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed lower limb focal zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso were evaluated in relation to disease zzso severity, and anatomical zzso 

Muscle zzso was highly sensitive for the detection of zzso muscle, and, unlike zzso its sensitivity did not decrease regardless of the anatomical location, zzso or severity of the zzso Five zzso false zzso were noted, including three in the thigh zzso 

Muscle zzso is an alternative tool to zzso in zzso mild, or chronic clinical diagnoses of lower limb focal zzso However, it also seems prone to zzso results, particularly in zzso zzso
