zzso advances in functional zzso and zzso neural zzso neuroscientists have increasingly sought to investigate how distributed networks, composed of functionally defined zzso combine to produce zzso zzso biologically realistic neural models, which integrate data from zzso zzso whole brain, and behavioral sources, delineate specific hypotheses about how these interacting neural populations might carry out high-level cognitive zzso In this review, we discuss zzso neural zzso and the utility of large-scale biologically realistic models using modeling of short-term memory as an zzso We present a sketch of the data regarding the neural basis of short-term memory from zzso zzso zzso and zzso perspectives, highlighting the multiple interacting brain regions believed to be zzso Through a review of several efforts, including our own, to combine neural modeling and zzso data, we argue that large scale neural models provide specific advantages in understanding the distributed networks underlying zzso and zzso
