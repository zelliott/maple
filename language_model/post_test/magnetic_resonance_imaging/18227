Experimental evidence suggests that zzso a zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso has significant cardiovascular protective effects in various zzso We examined whether routine use of zzso at the time of primary zzso coronary intervention would reduce zzso size in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso flow 0 were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso size was assessed by measuring the release of zzso zzso and zzso I during 72 hours and by performing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 1 month after zzso zzso and zzso tracking zzso was performed at initial presentation and at 3 days and 6 months after primary zzso coronary zzso The zzso and control groups had similar results with respect to zzso time, demographic zzso and ejection fraction before primary zzso coronary zzso The releases of zzso zzso and zzso I were significantly reduced in the zzso zzso In 58 patients evaluated with cardiac magnetic zzso the absolute mass of delayed zzso was significantly reduced in the zzso group as compared with the control group zzso versus zzso zzso zzso At 6 months, the zzso group showed a significantly lower value of zzso with improved strain zzso No significant adverse effects of zzso administration were zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy with primary zzso coronary intervention was associated with reduction of zzso size and improvement of zzso left zzso zzso
