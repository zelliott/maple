The interaction between language and action systems has become an increasingly interesting topic of discussion in cognitive zzso Several recent studies have shown that processing of action zzso elicits zzso in the cerebral motor system in a zzso zzso The current study extends these findings to show that the brain responses for processing of zzso with specific motor zzso differ not only from that of other motor zzso but, crucially, that the comprehension of zzso with motor zzso zzso zzso to zzso differs fundamentally from the processing of zzso with abstract zzso zzso zzso to zzso Second, the current study investigated the neural zzso of processing zzso complex zzso with abstract zzso built on stems with motor versus abstract zzso zzso zzso to comprehend zzso zzso to zzso Although residual effects of motor stem meaning might have been expected, we see no evidence for this in our zzso zzso of zzso complex zzso built on motor stems showed no differences in involvement of the motor system when compared with processing complex zzso with abstract zzso Complex zzso built on motor stems did show increased zzso compared with complex zzso built on abstract stems in the right zzso zzso zzso This result is discussed in light of the involvement of the right zzso zzso in comprehension of metaphoric or figurative zzso
