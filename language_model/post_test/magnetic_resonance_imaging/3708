The integration of zzso potential zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso can contribute to characterizing neural networks with high zzso and spatial zzso This research aimed to determine the sensitivity and limitations of applying joint independent component analysis zzso zzso for zzso and zzso data collected simultaneously in a zzso auditory frequency oddball zzso In a group of 20 subjects, an increase in zzso peak zzso ranging zzso zzso in the time window of the zzso zzso zzso and a correlated increase in zzso signal in a network of regions including the right superior zzso and zzso zzso was observed with the increase in zzso frequency zzso zzso of the same zzso and zzso group data revealed activity in a similar network, albeit with stronger zzso and larger zzso In addition, activity in the left zzso and zzso zzso likely associated with right hand zzso response, was observed only with the zzso zzso zzso the zzso approach revealed significantly stronger and more extensive activity in the brain regions associated with the auditory zzso than the zzso linear zzso zzso The results suggest that with the incorporation of spatial and zzso information from both imaging zzso zzso may be a more sensitive method for zzso common sources of activity between zzso and zzso
