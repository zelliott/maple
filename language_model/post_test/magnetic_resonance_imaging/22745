The zzso response to neural activity consists of changes in blood flow, blood volume and oxygen zzso Changes in the vascular state after sensory stimulation have different spatial and zzso characteristics in the zzso This has been shown using imaging techniques, such as zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso which monitor vascular changes once the stimulus is turned on, and the eventual return to baseline levels, once the stimulus is turned zzso The zzso zzso signal during sensory stimulation has been well characterized and modeled in terms of the spatial and zzso characteristics of the vascular zzso However, the return of the signals to baseline levels after sensory stimulation is not as well zzso During this period, a zzso zzso in the zzso signal is zzso This zzso zzso has been modeled and investigated to characterize the zzso mechanisms zzso blood flow zzso cerebral blood volume zzso and cerebral oxygen zzso associated with the zzso However, the data in the literature, which lack any zzso dependent information, appear to be contradictory in terms of the mechanisms associated with this zzso zzso With a high spatial resolution cat model at zzso zzso we show that zzso changes in the tissue persist once the stimulus is turned off, while zzso changes in the surface vessels quickly return to baseline levels, despite a concurrent zzso in the zzso signal in both the tissue and surface vessel zzso In addition, the zzso data alone indicate that different zzso mechanisms regulate the zzso response in the tissue versus the surface vessel zzso
