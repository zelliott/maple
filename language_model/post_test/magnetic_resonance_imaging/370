This paper presents a unified framework for automatic zzso of zzso disks of zzso spines from different types of magnetic resonance zzso image zzso The method exploits a combination of statistical and spectral texture features to discriminate closed regions representing zzso disks from background in MR images of the zzso zzso texture features are evaluated for three types of MR sequences acquired in the zzso zzso zzso spin zzso 3-D zzso data image zzso and 3-D fast imaging with steady state zzso A total of 22 texture features (18 statistical and 4 zzso are extracted from every closed region obtained from an automatic zzso procedure based on the watershed zzso The feature selection step based on principal component analysis and zzso process permit to decide among all the extracted features which ones resulted in the highest rate of good zzso The proposed method is validated using a supervised zzso zzso on zzso MR images coming from three different zzso patients and three different MR acquisition zzso zzso suggest that the selected texture features and zzso can contribute to solve the problem of zzso inherent to existing automatic zzso methods by successfully discriminating zzso disks from the background on zzso of zzso zzso
