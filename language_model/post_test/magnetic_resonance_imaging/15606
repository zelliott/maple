zzso brain regions process sensory zzso and affective components of zzso however, the role of these areas in pain memory is zzso This zzso study investigated the short-term memory for sensory features of zzso heat pain using a zzso paradigm and functional magnetic resonance zzso During memory trials, subjects zzso the location and intensity of two painful stimuli presented zzso to the right zzso Control trials comprised the same sequence of stimuli and motor responses but required no delayed zzso zzso activity for memory and control trials was generally indistinguishable within the network of regions normally responsive to experimental pain zzso the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary zzso zzso zzso and anterior insular zzso zzso these data confirm the painful nature of the stimuli and the similar levels of attention and stimulus zzso engaged during the two randomly presented trial zzso zzso activity, assessed by contrasting the zzso zzso in memory and control trials, was observed in zzso and zzso but not in zzso We propose that zzso plays a role in the short-term retention of spatial and intensity aspects of noxious stimuli and that zzso zzso during memory trials is consistent with the integration of sensory and cognitive zzso zzso zzso and zzso components of pain zzso The absence of zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso generally associated with pain unpleasantness, suggests that remembering affective aspects of the stimuli was not required during performance of the sensory zzso zzso
