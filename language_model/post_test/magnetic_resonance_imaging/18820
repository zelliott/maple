zzso nerve root blocks and zzso steroid injections are frequently employed in the management of degenerative conditions of the zzso spine, but relatively few papers have been published that address the complications associated with these zzso Serious complications include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso and hypersensitivity reaction to zzso Although transient zzso has been described after zzso zzso injection, an immediate and lasting deficit has not been previously described as zzso of a nerve root zzso 

We present three cases in which either zzso zzso or zzso occurred immediately after administration of a zzso nerve root block and propose a mechanism for this devastating but previously zzso zzso 

Case reports of three zzso 

Three patients, two women and one man ranging in age from 42 to 64 years, underwent three procedures performed at three different facilities, in the hands of two different zzso In each instance, penetration of the zzso was not thought to have zzso In two procedures the needles were placed zzso one at zzso on the left and one at zzso on the right, and in the third the needle tip was placed immediately lateral to the zzso nerve zzso 

Patient follow-up data from medical office zzso 

In each case, needle placement was verified with injection of a contrast media in conjunction with either computerized zzso or zzso zzso No zzso or zzso fluid was encountered upon aspiration in any of the zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was performed within 48 hours of injury in all zzso 

In each patient, zzso suddenly zzso after zzso of the steroid solution and, in each instance, zzso zzso revealed increased signal in the low zzso spinal zzso on zzso imaging consistent with zzso The sudden onset of neurological deficit and the imaging changes noted in the spinal zzso point to a vascular explanation for these zzso We zzso that in these patients the spinal needle either penetrated or caused injury to an zzso low dominant zzso artery, a recognized anatomical zzso This vessel, also known as the artery of zzso in zzso of individuals arises between zzso and zzso usually from the left, but in a minority of people may arise from the lower zzso spine and rarely even from as low as zzso The artery of zzso travels with the nerve root through the neural zzso and zzso the anterior spinal zzso zzso of it or injection of particulate matter into it, as what may happen with the commonly used zzso steroid zzso may result in zzso of the lower zzso spinal cord, producing the clinical and imaging findings seen in these three zzso 

We present the cases of three patients who had lasting zzso or zzso after the performance of a nerve root zzso We propose that the mechanism for this rare but devastating complication is the zzso of two uncommon circumstances, the presence of an unusually low origin of the artery of zzso and an zzso zzso penetration of the procedure zzso
