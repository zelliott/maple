The standard method of treating acute primary dislocation of the zzso joint is zzso of the arm in zzso and internal rotation with a zzso The recurrence rate for anterior instability after zzso treatment in young active patients is extremely high (up to zzso and well zzso A new method of zzso with the arm in external rotation improves the position of the displaced zzso on the zzso zzso With the use of control zzso before and after zzso in external zzso a study on this new repositioning of the zzso is zzso 

Ten patients zzso age zzso zzso with primary anterior dislocation of the shoulder and zzso zzso as shown on zzso but with no zzso of the zzso side were immobilized in zzso degrees of external rotation for 3 zzso zzso with zzso were taken in internal and external shoulder rotation post trauma and in internal rotation after 6 zzso All patients were reevaluated after 6 and 12 zzso 

zzso and separation of the zzso were both significantly less with the arm in external rotation due to the tension of the anterior capsule and the zzso of the zzso zzso In the zzso taken in internal rotation 6 weeks post zzso all zzso zzso were fixed in zzso after three weeks of zzso in external zzso At 12-month zzso the average zzso zzso was zzso points zzso zzso and the Rowe zzso was zzso points zzso zzso One patient had traumatic zzso after 8 zzso 

After primary shoulder dislocation, zzso the arm in zzso degrees external rotation provided stable fixation of the zzso zzso in an zzso zzso First long-term indications from an ongoing prospective study of recurrence rates after zzso in external rotation are zzso
