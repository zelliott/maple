Brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso and an extensive battery of zzso tests exploring frontal functions, short and long-term memory, zzso skills, attention and language were applied to 14 patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso and 17 patients with secondary progressive zzso zzso Patients with zzso and zzso did not differ in degree of physical zzso but cognitive deficits were found in zzso zzso patients with zzso and in only zzso zzso of those with zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso had higher total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loads than patients with zzso In detail, patients with zzso had greater involvement of frontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso and zzso deficits had higher zzso zzso loads than patients with zzso who did not have such deficits zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that both zzso and brain zzso abnormalities are more extensive in patients with zzso Since physical disability was similar for both groups, disability in zzso may be predominantly due to spinal zzso zzso
