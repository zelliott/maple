zzso block is the most commonly performed zzso zzso block and may be guided by nerve stimulation or zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso has proven to be beneficial in presenting anatomy of interest for regional zzso and in demonstrating spread of local zzso The aim of this pilot study was to demonstrate the anatomy as shown by zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

Nine volunteers and nine patients were examined in a zzso zzso zzso The patients had two different zzso zzso zzso zzso they were scanned by zzso and finally tested clinically for block efficacy before zzso zzso images, with and without local zzso injected, were viewed in a sequence loop to identify the zzso 

With the high-resolution zzso we obtained images of good quality, and cords and all terminal nerves could be zzso When local zzso are injected, zzso structures are zzso and the vein is zzso Viewing the images in a sequence loop zzso identification of the different nerves and has high zzso value zzso zzso to these zzso are zzso 

Clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso scanner gives good zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso The superior ability to detect local zzso after it has been injected and the zzso imaging capability make zzso a useful tool in studies of the zzso zzso
