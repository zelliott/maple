To assess the ability of bone zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso to predict the outcome of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso head zzso 

This study was a prospective evaluation of imaging zzso 

zzso and bone zzso were performed on 20 hips in 18 patients at 3 months after zzso The zzso findings at 3 months after zzso and the zzso and bone zzso findings, were compared with the zzso findings at final follow-up zzso 39 zzso 

On zzso a zzso area or a zzso band in the new zzso area extending over the zzso edge on zzso images was related to the presence of collapse on the zzso at final zzso In hips with an area of absent activity in the new zzso surface on bone zzso collapse was seen more frequently on zzso at final follow-up than in hips without this zzso Bone zzso was no more specific than zzso in predicting the outcome after zzso We consider zzso to be superior to bone zzso in predicting the occurrence of collapse, which is one of the major short-term problems after zzso
