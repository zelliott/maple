Several lines of evidence suggest that zzso may be associated with abnormalities in white matter zzso However, inconsistencies remain in the literature regarding the nature and extent of these zzso partly because of the limited types of zzso that have been zzso Here, we used zzso transfer imaging to provide insight into the zzso of the corpus zzso in children with zzso 

zzso transfer imaging scans were obtained in 101 children with zzso and 35 typically developing children who did not significantly differ with regard to gender or zzso The zzso area of the corpus zzso was manually traced and the zzso transfer ratio zzso was calculated for each zzso within the corpus zzso Mean zzso and height and location of the zzso zzso peak were zzso 

Mean zzso and zzso zzso peak height and location were significantly higher in children with zzso than in typically developing children, suggesting abnormal zzso of the corpus zzso in zzso 

The differences in zzso zzso suggested by these results may reflect an zzso in the normally zzso process of zzso of the brain, with broad implications for zzso diagnosis, and treatment of zzso
