Continuous zzso spin labeling zzso is a zzso magnetic resonance zzso method for measuring cerebral zzso In its most widely used form, zzso incorporates a zzso delay to minimize the sensitivity of the technique to transit time effects, which otherwise corrupt cerebral blood flow zzso zzso For this delay to work zzso it must be longer than the longest transit time present in the zzso In this work, zzso zzso were made in four zzso slices in the rat brain using a range of zzso zzso By doing this, direct zzso of both zzso and zzso transit time zzso was zzso These zzso were performed in the normal brain and during zzso induced by zzso of the common carotid zzso It was found that, in the normal rat brain, significant regional variation exists for both zzso and zzso Mean values of zzso and zzso in the selected gray matter regions of interest were 233 zzso g zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with the latter ranging from 100 to 500 zzso zzso use of a zzso zzso delay is suitable for any location in the normal rat zzso After common carotid artery zzso zzso decreased and zzso increased by regionally dependent zzso In the sensory cortex, zzso increased to a mean value of zzso zzso significantly greater than 500 zzso These results highlight the importance of either zzso determining zzso as part of the zzso measurement or zzso knowing the approximate range of values zzso is likely to take for a given application, so that the parameters of the zzso sequence can be chosen zzso
