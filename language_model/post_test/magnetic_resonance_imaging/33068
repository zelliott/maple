Although zzso cervical zzso has been recommended for the diagnosis of zzso disease zzso no study focused on the MR features at different neck zzso zzso Moreover, no uniform zzso angle has been confirmed in clinical zzso The purpose of this study is to zzso investigate the zzso typical signs of HD patients in different neck zzso degree and gives a suggestion to the MR zzso zzso zzso in neutral and different zzso positions zzso zzso angle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed in 45 HD zzso Three zzso features including anterior shifting of the zzso wall of the cervical zzso canal zzso widening of cervical zzso space, and zzso flow voids zzso at each zzso position were zzso To evaluate zzso zzso the zzso cervical zzso space with the maximum zzso diameters zzso and cervical canal zzso diameter zzso at the same level were zzso The zzso values at different angles were calculated and zzso zzso was demonstrated in 34 out of 45 cases zzso at zzso and in all cases zzso at other 4 angles zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso difference was demonstrated for the appearance rate of zzso zzso zzso among different angles zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The peak mean zzso value was found at zzso Neck zzso angles have effects on zzso widening of cervical zzso space and zzso zzso is recommended as the least effective diagnostic zzso angle for zzso diagnosis of zzso and zzso may be the best zzso
