zzso transient signals on zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso of the internal carotid zzso Few data exist regarding the detection of high-intensity transient signals in dissected carotid zzso In the present study, 6 patients with spontaneous carotid zzso defined by magnetic resonance techniques and duplex zzso were examined by zzso Both middle cerebral arteries were monitored simultaneously for 30 zzso Four of the patients had zzso cerebral zzso while 2 presented with other zzso zzso transient signals were detected in the middle cerebral artery zzso to the dissection in 3 of the 4 patients with cerebral zzso and in none of the patients with other presenting zzso No zzso were found zzso to the dissected zzso zzso can be detected zzso from dissected carotid zzso The present findings support the assumption that embolism is a major cause of stroke in patients with carotid zzso and suggest that high-intensity transient signals are more common among patients with cerebral zzso secondary to zzso
