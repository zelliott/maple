zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso usually is initiated in the zzso department zzso using patient history and physical zzso To reach consensus on stage and therapy, imaging and zzso are more or less routinely applied as additional staging zzso zzso results from the zzso department were evaluated for zzso and neck zzso We investigated in which situations additional staging tests are zzso 

Prospective cohort zzso 

Head and Neck Oncology Group, University Medical zzso 

Of zzso patients, initial staging results from the zzso department were compared with the ultimate staging results from the zzso board review, which provides the basis for decisions on zzso 

zzso stage and neck stage zzso during this staging zzso 

In staging head and neck zzso are zzso cell zzso additional staging tests like imaging and/or zzso remain necessary to evaluate the primary zzso zzso Average zzso of zzso in oral zzso zzso and zzso only amount to zzso zzso and zzso zzso For zzso and zzso oral cavity zzso neck assessment in the zzso department was accurate in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, this was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

For oral cavity and zzso zzso staged as zzso in the zzso department, we concluded that the zzso department staging is highly zzso of the final zzso zzso In these cases, computer zzso and/or zzso remain a necessity but additional ultrasound with or without fine needle aspiration zzso can be zzso In our institution, this would have resulted in a zzso reduction in ultrasound zzso If zzso is upgraded during imaging or zzso additional staging tests for zzso should still be zzso
