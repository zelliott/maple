zzso of medical images is very important for clinical research and diagnosis, leading to a requirement for robust automatic zzso This paper reports on the combined use of a neural network (a zzso zzso zzso and active zzso model zzso to segment structures in magnetic resonance zzso zzso The zzso is trained to produce a zzso zzso of each zzso as either a boundary or a zzso zzso zzso the resulting zzso zzso image forms the external energy function for a zzso used to link the candidate boundary points into a zzso closed zzso We report here on the zzso of the lungs from multiple MR slices of the zzso zzso constraints have been avoided to keep the technique as general as zzso In initial zzso the zzso to the zzso were limited to zzso intensity values of the zzso from an (7 zzso 7) window scanned across the zzso The use of spatial coordinates as additional zzso to the zzso is then shown to provide an improvement in zzso performance as zzso using the effectiveness measure (a weighted product of precision and zzso Training sets were first developed using a lengthy zzso zzso zzso a novel cost function based on effectiveness is proposed for training that allows us to achieve dramatic improvements in zzso performance, as well as faster, zzso selection of training zzso The zzso produced using this cost function were sufficiently good that the zzso image produced by the zzso could be zzso using an active zzso model to provide an accurate zzso of the lungs from the multiple slices in almost all cases, including unseen slices and zzso
