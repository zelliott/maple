Acute zzso zzso is a rare zzso disease most often triggered by a zzso viral event affecting an otherwise healthy zzso The clinical course is characterized by rapid deterioration of the neurological condition that often leads to coma and requires intensive zzso The diagnosis is usually suggested by zzso which shows symmetrical and focal zzso zzso of zzso Acute zzso zzso has been linked in recent studies to an zzso zzso of the gene for the protein zzso protein zzso 

We report three cases in siblings of zzso zzso Two of them presented with acute zzso zzso at the age of 9 months in the immediate aftermath of a viral zzso The molecular study conducted in the family showed that both patients and their mother were carriers of the zzso zzso gene zzso protein zzso 

Although the role of Ran zzso protein is incompletely known, zzso of the zzso gene causes rare, zzso central zzso zzso zzso diagnosis is facilitated by zzso which shows specific zzso of zzso zzso involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso white matter, and zzso Due to the low frequency of the disease and its zzso clinical zzso the diagnosis of acute zzso zzso is a major challenge, while preventative measures can be proposed in familial zzso
