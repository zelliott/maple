This study was undertaken to determine whether the increased zzso fluid zzso volumes found in anorexia zzso zzso are the result of differences in gray matter or white matter volumes or zzso 

Thirteen adolescent girls with AN who were receiving zzso care at a zzso university children's hospital and eight healthy female control subjects were studied by using magnetic resonance zzso Images were processed by means of software developed to zzso all zzso as either zzso gray matter, or white zzso zzso of each class were then summed across all zzso 

The AN group had larger total zzso volumes in association with deficits in both total gray matter and total white matter zzso zzso reported body mass index was zzso correlated with total zzso volume and positively correlated with total gray matter zzso zzso free cortisol levels were positively correlated with total zzso volume and zzso correlated with central gray matter zzso 

These findings add support to the view that the brain abnormalities found in AN are in large part the result of the effects of the zzso The extent to which these differences in gray matter and white matter volumes are zzso with recovery remains to be zzso
