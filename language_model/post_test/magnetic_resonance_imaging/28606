Regional three-dimensional zzso right zzso and left zzso zzso geometry was studied in eight dogs before and 5-6 zzso after induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso shape changes were zzso with a 3-D zzso model fitted to chamber contours traced on cardiac magnetic resonance zzso MR increased zzso zzso volume zzso 99 zzso 57 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso stroke volume zzso 55 zzso 26 zzso P zzso zzso In contrast, zzso decreased zzso zzso 55 zzso P zzso zzso whereas zzso was zzso zzso mass zzso wall plus zzso increased zzso zzso 94 zzso P zzso zzso whereas RV zzso mass was relatively zzso Shape changes due to MR were characterized by a marked zzso rightward shift of the zzso relative to the lateral zzso free wall at end zzso In contrast, the distance from the RV free wall to the lateral zzso free wall was relatively unchanged zzso zzso The distance between the zzso lateral free wall and zzso increased more than the distance between the anterior and zzso zzso walls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso During zzso the displacement of the zzso into the zzso increased significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso with the zzso dimension changes, zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased at end zzso to a greater extent in the anterior and zzso walls than in the zzso and lateral walls zzso zzso zzso Thus chronic MR produced an zzso zzso zzso with regional variation in zzso The zzso increased its contribution to the zzso at the expense of zzso zzso was zzso possibly by zzso zzso
