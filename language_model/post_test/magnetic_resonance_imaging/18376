Clinical diagnosis, as well as therapy planning and zzso are increasingly supported by zzso zzso There are many instances zzso integration of the information obtained by various imaging zzso This paper describes a new approach to match images of different zzso zzso operators are used in combination with zzso blurring to extract geometric features from the images that zzso to similar zzso The resulting zzso images may be used with existing matching techniques that minimize the distance between the features in the images to be zzso Our first application of this new approach concerns matching of zzso and CT brain zzso The so-called L zzso zzso operator produces a zzso feature image from which in CT and zzso the center curve of the zzso is easily zzso First results of this operator's performance in matching tasks are zzso Another promising operator is the zzso operator, which is presented in combination with zzso zzso
