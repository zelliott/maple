zzso of fetal central nervous system zzso zzso by zzso zzso is frequently zzso but magnetic resonance imaging zzso has its own advantages and is gaining popularity in displaying suspected fetal zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the value of zzso in detecting fetal zzso zzso 

Thirty-four women zzso from 22 to 35 years, average 27 zzso with complicated zzso (16 - 39 weeks of zzso average 30 weeks) were examined with a zzso T zzso MR unit within 24 hours after zzso zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso sequence were performed in all patients, and fast low angle shot zzso zzso imaging zzso sequence were applied zzso in seven of zzso zzso of the results was made between the zzso and US findings as well as autopsy or zzso follow-up zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso corpus zzso thalamus, zzso zzso and spinal zzso of fetus were shown more clearly on zzso MR images than on zzso MR zzso zzso corrected the diagnosis of US in 10 cases zzso zzso and the diagnosis was missed only in 1 case zzso zzso 

zzso has advantages to US in detecting fetal zzso anomalies and is a supplement to US in complicated zzso
