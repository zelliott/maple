To compare the prevalence of zzso and lateral zzso zzso cartilage damage in three large zzso zzso studies and determine the relationship of this damage to zzso neutral and zzso knee zzso 

In the Boston zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies, zzso were read for cartilage zzso at the zzso and lateral zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso Scores zzso zzso scores zzso zzso cartilage zzso zzso zzso of partial thickness zzso zzso zzso partial thickness zzso and zzso zzso full thickness zzso were all variously considered as thresholds to identify damage that may indicate zzso zzso zzso were measured for mechanical zzso and zzso zzso neutral zzso to zzso and zzso zzso knees were zzso 

The prevalence of zzso zzso cartilage damage exceeded that of lateral damage in all three studies and according to nearly every zzso Only among severely involved knees zzso zzso or zzso did the prevalence of lateral zzso cartilage damage approximate that of zzso zzso The high prevalence of zzso zzso damage persisted in all strata of knee zzso Even among knees with zzso zzso the prevalence of lateral zzso cartilage damage zzso or surpassed that of zzso zzso damage only when the threshold was specific to severely involved zzso 

zzso zzso cartilage damage is at least as prevalent within these older adult populations as lateral zzso cartilage zzso
