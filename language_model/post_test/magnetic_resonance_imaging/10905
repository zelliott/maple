We describe the very rare condition of an idiopathic spinal zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso and depicted on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso whose features were confirmed at zzso 

A 34-year-old female suffered from progressive gait impairment because of lower limb zzso and sensory zzso zzso demonstrated a bulging membrane at the zzso level that was zzso stretched between the zzso aspect of the spinal zzso and the zzso zzso zzso At this level, the spinal zzso appeared zzso and pushed zzso against the zzso with enlargement of the zzso zzso spaces zzso and focal collapse of an associated zzso zzso Surgery consisted in releasing the zzso zzso and opening the inferior segment of the zzso zzso zzso examination revealed a zzso tissue with cellular areas of zzso zzso zzso neurological status progressively improved but zzso zzso and 1 year zzso zzso showed the collapse of the whole zzso and restoration of zzso fluid zzso flow at the treated zzso zzso 

Spinal zzso zzso associated with zzso are very rare and have never been described up to now on zzso zzso removal of the zzso zzso allows spinal zzso zzso and prevents the recurrence of the zzso by restoring normal zzso zzso
