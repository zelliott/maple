zzso resonance imaging of the cardiovascular system has been beset with difficulties in obtaining clear images due to prominent artifacts which course in the direction of the phase zzso zzso These artifacts are commonly believed to derive from blood zzso However, in the zzso zzso zzso sequence using two-dimensional zzso transform zzso variation in effective repetition time due to zzso changes in the zzso zzso of zzso may also result in prominent zzso To eliminate these artifacts, we developed a new method, the modified zzso zzso zzso by adding a zzso 90 degree zzso pulse and an optional delay time zzso prior to the conventional zzso zzso In the zzso zzso artifacts derived from the cardiovascular system were markedly zzso Using the zzso zzso we attempted direct imaging of the coronary vessels, and obtained very clear images of the coronary arteries and zzso Organic zzso in the coronary arteries were also clearly zzso including coronary zzso zzso coronary zzso and zzso of the origin of the right coronary zzso The zzso sequence may offer a clinical advantage in obtaining coronary artery images, and may be used to evaluate coronary artery zzso
