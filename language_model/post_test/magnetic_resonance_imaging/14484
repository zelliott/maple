zzso : zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso junction in zzso zzso zzso zzso requires representing the location, size, or extent of the zzso zzso The objectives of this work are to zzso assess the feasibility of creating zzso models of cam zzso from zzso sets, zzso present a standardized zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso present and evaluate the potential utility of summary metrics in distinguishing between zzso patients and control zzso 

Using zzso from five subjects with diagnosed zzso zzso and four healthy subjects, we developed a technique based on zzso an estimated normal surface from each zzso actual bone surface in order to generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso that characterized the zzso zzso The models from three control subjects were combined to create the baseline zzso 

The zzso fitting error between the surface models of individual control subjects and their corresponding baseline models was zzso zzso across the head and the zzso transition zzso In the zzso region of the zzso diagnosis zzso the mean height of the detected cam zzso relative to the estimated baseline normal shape was zzso % of the head radius for the five zzso subjects (95 % zzso zzso zzso and zzso % (95 % zzso zzso zzso for the four control zzso A zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that an zzso ratio larger than a threshold of zzso see zzso zzso zzso % zzso to approximately zzso zzso in zzso yielded the best discrimination between zzso zzso subjects and normal zzso 

Our zzso diagnosis graph zzso enabled the zzso zzso in four of our five diagnosed patients to be clearly zzso on zzso zzso We believe this zzso tool may be helpful in better characterizing zzso zzso for diagnosis and for developing more precise plans for surgical zzso
