The goal of this work was to investigate the effects of zzso surface coils on zzso PET zzso zzso The authors studied the cases where either an zzso or a CT scan would be used to provide PET zzso correction zzso Combined zzso scanners that use the zzso for PET zzso zzso face the challenge of absent surface coils in MR images and thus cannot directly account for zzso in the zzso Combining MR and PET images could be achieved by transporting the subject on a zzso registered table between independent zzso and PET zzso In this case, conventional PET zzso methods could be zzso A challenge here is that high atomic number materials within MR coils cause artifacts in CT images and CT based zzso is typically not validated for zzso zzso 

The authors evaluated PET artifacts when MR coils were absent from zzso data zzso or when zzso zzso was measured by CT scanning zzso They scanned PET zzso with MR surface coils on a clinical zzso system and used zzso to reconstruct PET zzso The authors then omitted the zzso from the zzso image to mimic the zzso zzso Images were acquired using cylinder and zzso zzso They evaluated and compared the following five zzso zzso A uniform cylinder phantom and head zzso scanned and reconstructed using zzso zzso similar zzso data (with head zzso zzso were reconstructed without the head zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the same cylinder scanned without the head zzso present zzso zzso zzso a PET torso phantom with a full MR torso zzso present in both PET and CT; zzso only half of the zzso torso zzso present in the zzso zzso The authors also performed zzso simulations of the first three zzso 

zzso artifacts were present in CT images containing MR surface coils due to metal zzso These artifacts persisted after the CT images were converted for PET zzso The artifacts were significantly reduced when half of the zzso zzso was removed during the zzso CT scans tended to zzso the linear zzso zzso zzso of the metal components when using conventional methods for converting from CT number to zzso zzso zzso were visible outside the phantom in some of the PET zzso images, corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso However, only subtle artifacts were apparent in the zzso images inside the zzso On the other hand, the PET zzso image quantitative accuracy was significantly zzso the activity was underestimated by zzso when zzso did not include the head zzso and overestimated by zzso when the zzso included the head zzso 

The presence of MR coils during PET or zzso scanning can cause subtle artifacts and potentially important zzso zzso Alternative CT techniques that mitigate artifacts should be used to improve zzso zzso When possible, removing segments of an MR zzso prior to the zzso exam is zzso Further, MR coils could be redesigned to reduce artifacts by rearranging placement of the most attenuating zzso
