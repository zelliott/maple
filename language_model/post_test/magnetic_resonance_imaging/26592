Recent zzso studies have exploited subtle magnetic zzso differences between brain zzso to improve anatomical contrast and zzso These zzso differences lead to resonance frequency shifts which can be zzso by reconstructing the signal phase in conventional zzso echo zzso acquisition zzso In this work, a method is proposed to improve the contrast to noise ratio per unit time zzso zzso of anatomical zzso based on resonance frequency zzso The method, based on the balanced zzso free zzso zzso zzso acquisition technique, was evaluated in its ability to generate contrast between gray and white matter in human brain at zzso and zzso The results show substantially improved zzso efficiency of zzso phase images zzso times at 3 T and zzso times at 7 zzso compared to the zzso data in a limited spatial zzso This limited spatial coverage is attributed to the sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso With this zzso improvement, high resolution zzso phase images zzso zzso acquisition zzso acquired at zzso had sufficient zzso to allow the zzso of cortical zzso structures in zzso human primary visual zzso zzso application of the proposed method may require improvement of zzso zzso and stability by additional zzso scans and/or compensation schemes such as zzso and drift zzso Without these additions, the zzso benefits of the method may be limited to studies at low field or limited regions of zzso
