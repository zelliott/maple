Aging is associated with changes in human brain anatomy and function and cognitive zzso Recent studies suggest the aging decline of major functional connectivity hubs in the zzso network zzso Aging effects on other networks, however, are largely zzso We hypothesized that aging would be associated with a decline of zzso and long-range functional connectivity density zzso hubs in the zzso To test this hypothesis, we evaluated zzso data sets corresponding to zzso healthy subjects from a public magnetic resonance imaging database using functional connectivity density mapping zzso a zzso and zzso approach, together with parallel zzso Aging was associated with pronounced long-range zzso decreases in zzso and zzso attention network zzso and with increases in zzso and zzso zzso Aging effects in these networks were stronger for long-range than for short-range zzso and were also detected at the level of the main functional zzso zzso had higher zzso and long-range zzso in zzso and lower zzso in the zzso network than zzso but the gender by age interaction effects were not significant for any of the networks or zzso These findings suggest that long-range connections may be more vulnerable to aging effects than short-range connections and that, in addition to the zzso the DAN is also sensitive to aging effects, which could zzso the deterioration of attention processes that occurs with zzso
