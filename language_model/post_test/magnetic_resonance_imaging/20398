Combining zzso magnetic stimulation zzso with concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso allows study of how local brain stimulation may zzso affect activity in remote brain zzso Here, we applied bursts of zzso or zzso zzso over right zzso zzso cortex, during a task requiring sustained covert zzso attention to either the left or right zzso or in a neutral control condition, while recording blood zzso signal with a zzso MR surface zzso As expected, the active attention conditions activated components of the zzso zzso zzso as compared with the neutral zzso Also as expected, when comparing left minus right attention, or vice versa, zzso zzso visual zzso was zzso The critical new finding was that the impact of zzso minus zzso zzso zzso upon these visual regions depended on the currently attended zzso zzso minus zzso zzso zzso increased the difference between zzso versus zzso attention in right zzso visual zzso A related albeit less pronounced pattern was found for left zzso visual zzso Our results confirm that right human zzso zzso can exert zzso influences on zzso visual zzso and provide a proof of concept for the use of concurrent zzso in studying how remote influences can vary in a purely zzso manner with zzso zzso
