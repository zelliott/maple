This article reviews recent advances in structural zzso in zzso disorder zzso zzso studies have found treatment with zzso to be associated more closely with dimensions of some brain structures in typically developing children than in those found in zzso children with zzso Novel zzso approaches allow for greater precision in the definition of brain regions that are most compromised in zzso with zzso highlighting compromise of the zzso zzso zzso changes, particularly in the lateral prefrontal and zzso cortex, are also commonly reported, but with less consensus on the exact location of structural zzso zzso in the shape of zzso structures, specifically of the zzso zzso zzso and amygdala, zzso zzso zzso and the zzso system in the zzso Finally, zzso data suggest that zzso in childhood may be characterized by a delay in cortical maturation and that different clinical outcomes may be associated with different zzso zzso in adolescence and zzso
