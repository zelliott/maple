zzso disorder zzso is emerging as an illness marred by zzso deficits, many of which do not resolve on zzso zzso affecting working memory zzso in particular appear to be zzso zzso comprises temporally separated biological processes that involve the zzso retention and manipulation of zzso Previous zzso studies have not sought to dissect the individual contributions of zzso and examined zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso delay and response components of zzso to identify the neural zzso and respective contributions to the zzso deficits found in zzso 

We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging and a zzso zzso task, incorporating 3 load conditions, to delineate individual zzso zzso in 10 zzso BD patients and 10 control zzso 

Patients exhibited attenuated patterns of activity, predominantly in frontal brain regions, across all zzso zzso 

Based on the attenuated activity observed in the patients, the clinical deficits in zzso found in BD may reflect broad zzso dysfunction that is not confined to any single zzso zzso This is important in understanding the zzso of BD and for future studies on executive functions in patients with this zzso
