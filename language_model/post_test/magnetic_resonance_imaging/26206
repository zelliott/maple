The contribution of magnetic resonance imaging techniques to the clinical prognosis of multiple zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is a diagnostic technique with a high sensitivity for the detection of zzso but with a poor pathological zzso In the case of multiple sclerosis zzso the improvement of diagnostic efficacy depends on a careful analysis of the clinical presentation and the use of increasingly stringent zzso criteria aimed at improving the specificity of the conventional zzso zzso zzso New sequences such as fast zzso (also called zzso zzso and zzso zzso attenuated inversion recovery, a method derived from inversion zzso have improved the zzso of zzso zzso can under certain conditions be used to monitor the evolution of zzso zzso monitoring is focused on observed changes in disease activity such as the appearance, recurrence or extension of zzso after zzso injection of contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the chronic phase, the zzso is the aspect used as the monitoring zzso However, zzso is still only a secondary criterion in phase III therapeutic trials due to its insufficient correlation with the zzso In neurological daily practice, conventional zzso is only of limited interest at the individual level in patient zzso as its zzso value is zzso Moreover, the difficulty in determining the zzso load can only be excluded in the context of clinical trials, in which certain zzso precautions are zzso This is why techniques other than zzso are being investigated to obtain a better correlation with the clinical course of the disease, for instance the zzso of zzso zzso on zzso weighted images, and the measurement of cerebral and spinal zzso Adapted zzso techniques allow a weighted signal to be obtained via the movement zzso zzso by the complexity of the molecular structure zzso transfer zzso by chemical shift zzso zzso or by local zzso zzso zzso These new zzso techniques allow a more precise assessment of the pathological mechanisms involved in zzso such as zzso blood brain barrier zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso and zzso zzso they provide a better means of establishing the correlation between clinical impact and the destructive nature of the zzso zzso The importance of zzso loss has recently been confirmed in zzso by analyzing zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition to zzso transfer imaging, MR diffusion imaging and functional zzso are being zzso studied in order to assess their contribution to the study of zzso of the degenerative zzso
