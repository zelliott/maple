Spinal canal zzso at the most prominent of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso in a case of zzso zzso was undertaken for treatment and diagnosis purposes, as well as to assess possible nature of the zzso underlying the presenting zzso 

To discuss the clinical assessment diagnostic and treatment aspects of this rare coincidence of zzso of zzso zzso in the patient with the skeletal zzso of zzso zzso 

The patient with the zzso and chemical findings of an zzso zzso presented with zzso and multiple zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso This was studied with magnetic resonance imaging and zzso studies of the spinal sensory pathways of the zzso These data constituted the zzso information required to assess later results of surgical zzso 

zzso clinical, imaging and zzso studies and laboratory and zzso investigations of the surgical zzso 

Resolution of the zzso with walking and return to work in a physically demanding job for the last 4 or 5 years of zzso follow-up after surgical zzso of the spinal zzso only at the worst and highest of the zzso spinal zzso 

The coincidence of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso has been reported only in two or three cases in the zzso zzso of the offending zzso zzso is known to result in resolution of the clinical deficits but similar zzso at other spinal levels are suspected of producing zzso The return of function and of the corresponding zzso zzso indicate a zzso nature of the zzso zzso
