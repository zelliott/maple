An animal model of sensory zzso using zzso at zzso T has been developed, demonstrating that zzso studies on animals need not be limited to high field zzso These methods produced reliable image intensity changes of zzso using median nerve stimulation in rats at 3 zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso At 6 zzso the zzso was slightly but not statistically significantly zzso The feasibility of zzso studies in animals using zzso suggests that it may be a useful zzso for zzso studies in agitated adult patients or in zzso
