zzso arteries cause high pulse pressure and flow to be transmitted to zzso zzso during zzso damaging the cerebral zzso We investigated the association between the severity of cerebral small vessel disease zzso the zzso of cerebral zzso and the zzso of large arteries in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso included 120 patients with zzso who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ankle pulse wave zzso zzso We compared the severity of zzso the zzso index zzso of both middle cerebral arteries zzso and zzso 

Patients with higher zzso were more likely to have multiple zzso and more severe white matter zzso and tended to have higher age, zzso blood pressure, pulse pressure, heart rate, and the zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso significantly correlated with zzso (with zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso and age (with zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis indicated that aging zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were independent zzso of the zzso of zzso after adjustment for sex, pulse pressure, hypertension, and zzso 

These findings suggest that systemic zzso zzso may be associated with the severity of zzso and zzso of cerebral zzso
