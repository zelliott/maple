The purpose of this study was to determine whether an external magnet field can induce preferential trafficking of zzso labeled zzso zzso cells to the liver following liver cell zzso zzso zzso cells were labeled with zzso magnetic zzso zzso and zzso with a fluorescent membrane marker zzso zzso was measured by zzso Twenty zzso mice received an zzso injection of 2 zzso zzso labeled zzso An external magnet zzso zzso 25 zzso was placed over the liver of 13 randomly selected animals zzso group), while the remaining 7 animals served as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed 10 days zzso The presence and location of labeled cells within the zzso were compared in the magnet group and controls, and confronted with zzso analysis representing the standard of zzso Mean iron content per cell was 6 zzso Based on zzso labeled cells were more frequently present within recipient zzso in the magnet group zzso zzso zzso where their distribution was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gave similar results for the overall detection of transplanted cells zzso zzso zzso and for the identification of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Application of an external magnet can modify the trafficking of transplanted cells, especially by promoting the formation of zzso zzso
