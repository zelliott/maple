More accurate zzso zzso of prostate size is important in therapeutic trials for benign zzso zzso The accuracy of zzso and zzso ultrasound zzso in assessing prostate weight was evaluated in 48 patients who underwent radical zzso for stage A or B zzso The volume derived from the wet weight of the freshly excised zzso was used as a zzso We compared that volume with volume estimates derived from the zzso linear dimension measurement by zzso and zzso using a tissue density of zzso zzso and the standard formula for an zzso zzso zzso and seminal zzso volumes were also zzso by zzso zzso 5 zzso thick zzso MR images using a semiautomatic edge detection program and zzso zzso zzso volume zzso method versus volume from wet weight has slightly less scatter than zzso zzso method zzso zzso zzso vs r zzso zzso zzso MR volume method has the least scatter r zzso zzso statistically better than the linear axis zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis appears superior to linear zzso or zzso methods in zzso true prostate zzso
