We wished to assess the feasibility of imaging the knee with zzso TE zzso pulse zzso 

Five volunteers and 16 patients were studied with zzso zzso zzso sequences including later zzso Conventional zzso images and difference images were also produced by zzso a later echo from the zzso zzso enhancement was zzso 

High signal was obtained in zzso ligaments, zzso and zzso zzso contrast enhancement was seen in these zzso Deep and superficial layers were seen in the zzso zzso zzso defects were zzso The red zone could be differentiated from the white zone of the zzso zzso tears and zzso were observed with low signal on zzso zzso Enhancement was seen within the anterior and zzso cruciate ligaments and associated zzso zzso 

zzso TE imaging provides new options to zzso zzso manipulate zzso observe contrast enhancement and demonstrate disease of the zzso
