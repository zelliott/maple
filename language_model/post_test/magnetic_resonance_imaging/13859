This cooperative zzso human study was designed to evaluate the safety, magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso and clinical response to a single zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients (age zzso 1 month to 78 years; zzso 50 zzso 45 zzso were included in this prospective zzso The patients presented clinically with a variety of zzso or spinal signs and symptoms for which an zzso contrast zzso or zzso was requested by clinical zzso Via zzso puncture zzso g zzso 3 to 5 zzso of zzso fluid were withdrawn and mixed with a single volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 7) zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Berlin, zzso This was then injected into the zzso space, and the needle was zzso Immediate and delayed (up to 96 zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging was performed on super zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging units in two or three zzso All patients were hospitalized for an observation period of 24 hours following the zzso and follow-up zzso examinations were performed serially for 6 to 12 months zzso 

No patient zzso gross behavioral changes, zzso zzso or seizure activity at any time following the zzso zzso patients zzso experienced zzso zzso puncture headache, six patients had zzso zzso and two patients had episodes of vomiting zzso all which resolved within the first 24 hours of the zzso puncture with conservative bed zzso 

This cooperative study demonstrates the general safety and feasibility of low dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The potential useful clinical applications include the evaluation of zzso and communications of the various zzso spaces, spontaneous or zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso and zzso space zzso flow and zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso This worldwide cooperative study seeks to progressively perform human studies for further definitive evaluation of the practical clinical applications, of the relationship of this technique to other imaging studies and zzso and the long-term safety of the procedure in a larger number of zzso
