To perform a feature analysis of zzso zzso tumors evaluated with magnetic resonance zzso imaging and to investigate the correlation between MR imaging features and zzso zzso MR examinations in 79 zzso zzso masses were zzso zzso and a feature analysis was zzso Each zzso mass was assigned to one of eight categories from a proposed zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the zzso zzso system to predict the zzso zzso and nuclear grade was zzso zzso fat on chemical shift imaging correlated to clear cell type zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso Large size, zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso and zzso vein zzso predicted high-grade clear cell type zzso zzso zzso Small size, peripheral location, low zzso zzso on zzso images, and low-level enhancement were associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the zzso zzso system for diagnosing low grade clear cell, high-grade clear cell, all clear cell, all zzso and transitional zzso were 50% and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The zzso feature analysis and proposed zzso system help predict the zzso type and nuclear grade of zzso zzso
