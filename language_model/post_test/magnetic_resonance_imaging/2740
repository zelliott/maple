This study was undertaken to determine and compare indications and relative benefits of various surgical approaches in 170 patients zzso age 55 zzso with zzso zzso zzso discs, identified by magnetic resonance zzso imaging and computerized zzso zzso and operated on between 1984 and zzso Essentially three surgical procedures were zzso complete zzso in 73 patients, zzso with zzso zzso in 39 patients, and zzso zzso (also known as zzso in 58 zzso zzso periods averaged 5 years zzso zzso zzso Outcomes were scored as excellent (no zzso good zzso zzso fair zzso zzso and poor zzso or zzso Overall, excellent and good results were achieved in 73 and 51 patients, respectively, and fair and poor results in 26 and 20, zzso There was little difference among the results encountered for the three major surgical groups: zzso of the zzso zzso group had zzso zzso as compared with zzso of the zzso group, and zzso of the group who underwent at minimum zzso and additional zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso were the same for the 121 patients followed for more than 2 years and for the 49 patients studied for under 2 zzso In the management of zzso discs, total zzso provides the best exposure, but increases the risk of zzso zzso and zzso zzso uncover the lateral and zzso recess and preserve stability, but zzso of the zzso compartment is often zzso The zzso approach offers extensive zzso but not zzso zzso exposure, while also preserving zzso Full zzso zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso approaches yielded nearly comparable outcomes in zzso disc zzso Only the full zzso exposes the entire course of the nerve root both zzso and zzso whereas the zzso procedure provides direct exposure of the zzso compartment zzso It is important to select the correct approach or combination of approaches to address attendant complicating factors such as spinal zzso zzso and degenerative zzso identified on CT and MR zzso
