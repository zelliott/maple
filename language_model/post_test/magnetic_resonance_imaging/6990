The purpose of this study was to evaluate anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso against the zzso cruciate ligament zzso with the knee in an extended position, which zzso cannot zzso 

Ten normal knees and 30 zzso knees were assessed using MR zzso The three-dimensional reconstruction of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were carried out using commercially available three-dimensional reconstruction zzso zzso cruciate ligament zzso against the zzso was graded into three zzso Grade 1, some space between the zzso Grade 2, no space between the ligaments, and the reconstructed zzso ran zzso and Grade 3, the reconstructed zzso did not run zzso The angle of the reconstructed zzso against the zzso plateau was also zzso 

All normal knees were classified as Grade zzso The 30 reconstructed knees were classified as zzso Grade 1, 12 zzso Grade 2, 7 zzso and Grade 3, 11 zzso The mean angle of the Grade 3 reconstructed zzso knees was significantly more vertical against the zzso as compared with the Grade 1 knees zzso The zzso zzso zzso difference of the Grade 3 knees zzso zzso was larger than that of the Grade 1 knees zzso zzso and Grade 2 knees zzso zzso but no statistically significant difference could be detected between the three groups in the zzso zzso zzso 

This method is useful to evaluate zzso zzso against zzso which cannot be detected by conventional zzso during the zzso The surgeon should pay careful attention to the zzso angle of the reconstructed zzso
