An elevated plasma total homocysteine zzso level is associated with an increased risk of vascular zzso Some studies have shown associations between zzso level and zzso disease of the brain on magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In the zzso Health zzso zzso elderly participants without a history of transient zzso attack or stroke had results for zzso level and zzso zzso We sought associations between zzso level and zzso findings of zzso grade, zzso grade, white matter grade, and zzso We controlled for other factors, including levels of zzso zzso and vitamins zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

After controlling for age and sex, zzso level was not associated with the individual zzso zzso Further adjustments for other factors and other blood tests had little effect on these zzso The only significant finding was a linear trend across zzso of zzso level and a pattern of zzso findings combining zzso and high white matter zzso The linear trend remained significant after controlling for other risk factors and zzso markers zzso zzso vs bottom zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso for linear zzso but was slightly diminished after further controlling for zzso zzso and vitamins zzso and zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso for linear zzso 

We were unable to confirm the results of previous studies with respect to zzso level and individual zzso findings, although an association was seen for an zzso pattern combining zzso and high white matter zzso
