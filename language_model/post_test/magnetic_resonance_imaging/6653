Previous functional zzso findings have indicated that a zzso network is involved in the zzso processing of sequential zzso Given that zzso functions have traditionally been restricted to behaviors requiring motor or zzso zzso the goal of the present patient study was to further investigate whether the lateral zzso zzso is critical in purely zzso zzso Patients with either zzso zzso or inferior zzso zzso in addition to patients with prefrontal zzso and zzso and zzso healthy controls, were tested during the processing of zzso zzso and spatial zzso zzso revealed that zzso patients as well as zzso patients showed significantly higher error rates than did healthy controls on all sequence zzso In contrast, prefrontal patients showed no behavioral zzso These findings support the significance of the zzso zzso cortex, in addition to zzso areas, in zzso zzso zzso
