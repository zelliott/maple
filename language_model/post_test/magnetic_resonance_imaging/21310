zzso responses can be zzso from zzso activity patterns in the human visual cortex, using zzso pattern analysis zzso To what extent do these zzso activity patterns depend on the strength and quality of the sensory zzso and might the reliability of these activity patterns be predicted by the gross zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso viewed oriented zzso that varied in zzso contrast zzso 20 or zzso or spatial frequency zzso zzso or zzso zzso As predicted, activity patterns in early visual areas led to better discrimination of zzso presented at high than low contrast, with greater effects of contrast found in area zzso than in zzso A second experiment revealed generally better decoding of zzso at low or moderate as compared to high spatial zzso Interestingly however, zzso exhibited a relative advantage at discriminating high spatial frequency zzso consistent with the finer scale of representation in the primary visual zzso In both experiments, the reliability of these zzso activity patterns was well predicted by the average zzso zzso in each region of interest, as indicated by correlation zzso as well as decoding applied to a simple model of zzso responses to simulated orientation zzso Moreover, individual differences in decoding accuracy could be predicted by the zzso ratio of an zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that decoding accuracy can be well predicted by incorporating the zzso of the zzso response into simple simulation models of cortical zzso such models could prove useful in future applications of zzso pattern zzso
