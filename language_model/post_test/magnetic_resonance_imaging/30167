Several lines of evidence have highlighted the role of the zzso system in working memory zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso coding for an zzso especially involved in the zzso zzso zzso presents a zzso functional zzso consisting in a variable number of tandem repeats zzso in the promoter region with high activity and low activity zzso The high activity zzso carriers have been associated with higher zzso zzso lower zzso concentration and altered prefrontal zzso zzso function during motor zzso but a direct effect of zzso A zzso on zzso brain activity has not been zzso We have studied the relationship of this zzso to brain activity zzso by a spatial working memory task zzso using blood zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging in 30 healthy male individuals matched for a series of demographic and genetic variables zzso zzso We show that the high activity zzso was significantly zzso associated with increased activity of the right zzso zzso zzso BA zzso during the high load condition of the zzso zzso Our data reveal pronounced zzso functional changes in specific prefrontal region zzso zzso spatial working zzso Moreover, given the well-known role of this area in zzso control, our finding also provides new evidence for the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
