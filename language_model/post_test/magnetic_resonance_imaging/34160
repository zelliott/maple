To describe the magnetic resonance zzso imaging findings in diabetic patients with muscle zzso and to describe commonly associated clinical zzso 

The MR imaging studies of 21 patients with diabetic muscle zzso were reviewed zzso Of the 21 patients, 12 were women, and nine were zzso the mean age was 48 years zzso zzso zzso 

Eight patients had bilateral zzso zzso six had involvement confined to the right lower zzso and seven to the zzso The thigh was involved in 17 patients zzso One or more of the zzso zzso the most frequently affected muscle group, were affected in 16 patients zzso Four patients zzso had isolated calf zzso MR imaging studies showed diffuse enlargement of involved muscle groups and partial loss of normal fatty zzso zzso MR imaging also allowed identification of areas of zzso fluid in 16 patients zzso and subcutaneous zzso in 19 patients zzso MR imaging showed involved muscle groups best with zzso zzso and zzso zzso where the zzso muscles appeared zzso zzso compared with adjacent zzso zzso of zzso and zzso MR images of nine patients showed zzso enhancing muscles in all patients and small, zzso zzso fluid collections in six of nine patients zzso 

zzso muscle zzso is suggested in diabetic patients with sudden onset of severe pain in the thigh or calf muscles who have MR imaging findings of diffuse zzso and swelling of multiple thigh and calf muscles zzso in more than one zzso
