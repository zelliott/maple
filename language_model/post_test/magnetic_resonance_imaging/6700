To add a further contribution to the literature supporting the relationship between previous head trauma and development of zzso 

We report on four patients who developed brain zzso in the zzso of an old brain zzso 

All cases fulfilled the widely established criteria for brain tumors of traumatic zzso In all of our cases there was zzso evidence of absence of tumor at the time of the zzso 

We believe that in specific cases it is reasonable to acknowledge an zzso association between a severe head trauma and the development of a zzso This assumption is further sustained if there is zzso and surgical documentation of the absence of zzso at the moment of the zzso
