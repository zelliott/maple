Assessment of zzso parameters in patients who had transient zzso symptoms suggesting zzso zzso requires a systematic and accurate detection of zzso or zzso zzso Our aim was to detect with zzso and zzso inhalation methods, a low flow state underlying zzso zzso in a patient who had no impairment of cerebrovascular control related to zzso of zzso or zzso A woman with intermittent zzso symptoms had an zzso magnetic resonance imaging and evaluation of zzso parameters with zzso circulation with zzso inhalation and zzso inhalation methods zzso failed to show any zzso or territorial zzso or degenerative zzso zzso study showed significant zzso zzso involving zzso zzso A decrease of blood flow within zzso circulation was observed according to zzso and zzso inhalation zzso These preliminary results support the view that significant zzso changes within the zzso system might account for a low flow zzso zzso inhalation method might be in agreement with a previous study performed in zzso zzso with zzso inhalation zzso
