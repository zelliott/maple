To evaluate the performance of a relative zzso zzso algorithm, versus standard zzso zzso for reliably establishing the location, zzso and spatial extent of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso brain zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso maps from 42 zzso patients performing a simple hand movement task were zzso Relative zzso maps were made by zzso statistical zzso maps to the local peak zzso zzso within each functional brain zzso The spatial distribution of zzso was zzso and compared across mapping zzso subjects, and scan zzso 

Whereas the spatial distribution of blood zzso zzso zzso zzso statistical zzso maps was highly variable across subjects and scan zzso the spatial distribution of relative zzso maps was highly zzso both within individual subjects and across different zzso In every case the zzso most active zzso in the cortical hand region were consistently localized to the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

The zzso and anatomical specificity of the zzso pattern of zzso zzso makes relative zzso zzso mapping a useful tool for clinical imaging, where zzso zzso and quality control are critical zzso
