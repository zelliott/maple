The purpose of this investigation was to derive and validate circumference and zzso equations for zzso the anatomical zzso area zzso of the zzso zzso and total thigh zzso zzso adult male zzso age zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso 5 zzso volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso to determine the zzso of the thigh muscles at the zzso level as well as zzso circumference and anterior thigh zzso zzso Multiple zzso analyses were used to derive equations for predicting zzso zzso and total thigh muscle zzso of the dominant limb from the zzso dimensions on a random sample of 30 of the zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed for each equation on: zzso the zzso thigh of the derivation group (N zzso zzso zzso the dominant thigh of the zzso group (N zzso zzso and zzso the zzso thigh of the zzso group (N zzso zzso The zzso total error values for the zzso zzso and total thigh muscle zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso equations are recommended for one-time estimates of muscle zzso values in healthy, zzso young adult males when more sophisticated procedures are not zzso
