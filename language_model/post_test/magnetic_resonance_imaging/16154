To investigate the ability of an zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso antenna to reduce the zzso shielding of a vascular zzso during signal reception as a way to improve the zzso of the zzso zzso 

Using a balanced zzso zzso zzso sequence and a dedicated vascular zzso the zzso ratio zzso inside the zzso of a zzso is evaluated as a function of the nominal flip angle and compared with the results obtained for a reference vessel without a zzso All experiments are performed using successively an zzso zzso antenna and surface zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments are performed to evaluate the zzso of an approach using an zzso antenna and zzso images to depict a vascular zzso inside a zzso 

The use of a zzso antenna effectively eliminates the zzso shielding effect of the zzso during signal zzso Furthermore, using a zzso sequence with a carefully chosen nominal flip angle, an equally good blood zzso can be obtained inside and outside the zzso zzso of in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the proposed method illustrate the benefits arising from the use of the zzso zzso 

In the perspective of zzso vascular interventions, the presented results illustrate that the use of an zzso antenna can significantly facilitate imaging inside a vascular zzso Potential applications include the monitoring of zzso deployment as well as zzso and zzso of zzso zzso during an zzso
