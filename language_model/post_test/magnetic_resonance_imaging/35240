The aim of this study was to analyze zzso after zzso acute zzso zzso zzso using the maximum slope method of zzso cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso and resting zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained in 30 consecutive patients after zzso zzso and 10 zzso After zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso images were obtained using the zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated by measuring the signal intensity in the zzso and left zzso The zzso input function was obtained from the left zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the maximum slope method, the zzso index zzso was calculated by dividing the maximum initial zzso of the zzso by the initial zzso of the left zzso 

The zzso was significantly lower in the segments related to the zzso coronary zzso zzso in segments with zzso zzso of zzso of peak were significantly lower than in those with zzso zzso of zzso zzso in segments with zzso zzso of zzso of peak were significantly lower than in those with zzso zzso of zzso 

This study presents a method that directly zzso zzso after zzso zzso
