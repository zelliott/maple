zzso anatomical zzso of the gross zzso volume zzso is crucial for effective zzso zzso treatment of prostate zzso Although reference to pelvic magnetic resonance zzso for improved zzso of the prostate is a regular practice in some clinics, MR has not replaced CT due to its geometrical zzso and lack of zzso zzso The possibility and practicality of using MR only for zzso treatment planning were zzso 

The addition of zzso information to MR images for zzso zzso zzso planning of the prostate was zzso by comparing dose zzso created on the homogeneous zzso and zzso assigned images to original CT for four zzso To zzso the MR geometrical zzso zzso of a phantom zzso in CT zzso zzso Plus 4) and zzso zzso zzso MR zzso T whole body zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso statistics from zzso treatment plans made on CT and MR for five patient data were compared to determine if zzso treatment plans can be zzso 

The differences between zzso on zzso assigned images when compared to CT were less than zzso when water and bone values were zzso zzso differences greater than zzso were observed when images of zzso assignment were compared to the zzso Phantom zzso showed that the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso MR averaged 2 zzso in the volume of interest for prostate zzso zzso For the CT and MR prostate planning study, doses delivered to the planning target volume zzso in CT and MR were always inside a zzso dose range zzso to the zzso Also, the doses to the zzso in the MR images were similar to the doses delivered to the volumes in the registered CT image when the organ volumes between the two images were zzso 

zzso differences were observed in dose distribution between zzso plans using zzso CT number zzso image and original zzso Also, the MR zzso were reduced to negligible amounts using large bandwidth MR sequence for prostate zzso zzso MR treatment planning was demonstrated using a large bandwidth sequence and zzso zzso The development of higher quality, low distortion MR sequence will allow regular practice of this zzso
