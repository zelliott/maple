To determine whether patients with zzso disease zzso compensate for zzso changes when performing a zzso task by recruiting 1) the same brain regions as zzso healthy controls, but to a greater zzso 2) additional brain regions not activated by zzso or 3) zzso 

Twelve patients with mild probable zzso and 12 healthy zzso and zzso controls participated in an zzso study of successful zzso and retrieval of zzso paired zzso To ensure successful performance in both groups, participants were given multiple attempts to learn associations between two and three object zzso 

The pattern of brain activity in patients with zzso performing an easy version of the task was indistinguishable from that of controls performing a harder version of the zzso Increased zzso in left zzso and right lateral prefrontal zzso was found in patients with zzso compared to controls during zzso of two object locations, but not when this level of zzso in patients was compared with zzso of three object locations in zzso 

There was no evidence of neural plasticity in the form of recruitment of novel brain regions in patients with zzso zzso Data supported greater recruitment of the same brain regions as zzso controls as a means of zzso for zzso and associated cognitive impairment in zzso zzso
