zzso small cell zzso zzso is a rare disease, which has a slightly better prognosis than small cell lung cancer, but still zzso zzso small cell zzso tend to show a better survival than similar zzso of other zzso However, of five reported cases of zzso manifestation only one patient was zzso at the time of publication with limited zzso 

The authors describe a case of locally advanced small cell zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso with spread to zzso zzso zzso treated by zzso and regional zzso After three cycles of zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging indicated only little zzso transformations but overall stable zzso zzso options were zzso zzso zzso zzso to a total dose of zzso 65 zzso to zzso zzso chemotherapy with zzso weekly, and regional zzso were zzso Acute severe toxicity was limited to skin zzso Despite the zzso situation with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso therapy yielded a zzso zzso zzso 

Thus, the zzso regimen of zzso plus regional zzso offered a zzso chance in spite of resistance to the standard chemotherapy for zzso locally advanced small cell zzso of the zzso zzso this approach merits further evaluation for limited disease of zzso
