The zzso fat pad has been implicated as a possible source of anterior knee zzso This study examined the nature, distribution and zzso of zzso induced pain in the zzso fat zzso zzso saline zzso was injected into the zzso fat pad of 11 healthy individuals with no history of knee zzso zzso of pain was assessed at rest and during activity using an 11 point zzso rating scale zzso at regular intervals over zzso zzso following zzso Participants described the size of the pain region from a series of different sized circles while the area and type of pain was established from a body chart and the McGill pain zzso The effect of pain on zzso threshold and sensory thresholds of the anterior knee was zzso Participants generally reported a deep aching pain that peaked in severity around 3 zzso and gradually declined over 15 zzso zzso levels were not altered by clinical zzso designed to impinge the fat zzso The size of the pain region was related to pain zzso zzso was most commonly felt in the region of the fat pad zzso to the zzso although some individuals reported zzso referred pain as far as the groin zzso zzso and sensory thresholds were not altered at a region close to the injection site during the experimental zzso These results suggest that zzso stimulation of the zzso fat pad may cause anterior knee pain that is not necessarily confined locally particularly if pain is zzso This has implications for the investigation of pathological structures in patients presenting clinically with anterior knee pain and provides an experimental model of anterior knee zzso
