zzso zzso selective zzso zzso has zzso a variety of useful applications in magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso which have regained considerable interest after the recent introduction of parallel zzso For zzso zzso zzso are designed specifically for certain zzso of zzso zzso magnetic fields zzso which are applied simultaneously with the zzso zzso However, experimental imperfections of zzso and zzso zzso field contributions often prevent the correct zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and therefore degrade the zzso of zzso patterns, especially for parallel zzso To cope with such zzso a classical measurement of zzso can be performed followed by an adaptation of the zzso However, this method is limited to linear zzso field zzso which are zzso in the zzso zzso this work presents a more sophisticated method consisting in a zzso resolved measurement of the zzso phase evolution of the zzso zzso This exhaustive phase information can be incorporated into zzso zzso to compensate even for zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso field zzso Both approaches are assessed in various experimental scenarios and individual benefits and limitations are zzso The adaptation of zzso to zzso achieved zzso data turned out to be very zzso and especially the novel zzso resolved method exhibited high potential for robust zzso even in adverse experimental zzso
