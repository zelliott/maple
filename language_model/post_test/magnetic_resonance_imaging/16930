The loss of pulmonary artery zzso compliance has significant zzso effect on the right zzso zzso and reliable assessment of PA wall zzso would be an essential zzso of right heart load and a clinically useful factor to assess cardiovascular zzso Two zzso techniques have been proposed for assessing PA zzso by measuring pulse wave zzso zzso transit time zzso and flow area zzso However, no data are available that compares the two techniques and evaluates their performance, especially over a wide range of zzso values or at zzso which is the purpose of the present zzso zzso patients with different heart conditions were zzso using zzso zzso resolution and zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was conducted to study zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso using zzso and zzso techniques showed good agreement zzso The zzso analysis showed negligible differences between the two methods zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso The repeated zzso showed low zzso and zzso zzso although the zzso of the differences was larger in the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso measurement differences were zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso differences, zzso In conclusion, each technique has its own advantages and zzso The two techniques result in similar zzso although the zzso method is more zzso due to its dependency on operator zzso
