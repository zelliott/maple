The goal of this study was to determine the importance magnetic resonance zzso imaging holds as a complementary fetal imaging zzso to zzso in deciding zzso zzso zzso 

Between 1999 and 2003, 320 fetal MR imaging studies were performed at a single zzso zzso fetuses were found to have central nervous system abnormalities that could potentially require a zzso zzso The diagnoses included spinal anomalies zzso zzso and closed spinal zzso and brain anomalies zzso with or without zzso zzso cyst, zzso and zzso Fourteen of the 24 fetuses underwent surgery based on findings of prenatal MR zzso In seven cases the pregnancy was zzso and in three cases conservative follow up zzso 

In a variety of brain and spine disorders, prenatal MR imaging can delineate and characterize the zzso and thus assist in the diagnosis and in the planning of zzso surgery and zzso This zzso provides important zzso images and may zzso the need for early zzso zzso zzso or MR zzso zzso management can often be guided by prenatal MR imaging zzso
