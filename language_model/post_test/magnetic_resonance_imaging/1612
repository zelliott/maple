To investigate the role of the diffusion MR weighted sequence in the zzso grading of zzso and its application in defining the different components of these zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso high grade, nine low zzso had diffusion weighted zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso of different components of zzso were zzso 

zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso was significantly higher than zzso of the enhanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant difference in zzso values between low grade and high grade zzso zzso zzso zzso was found nor was there any difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso value was useful to differentiate the zzso from the solid components of the zzso However, it was not useful in zzso grading of zzso
