zzso data are high zzso and thus cumbersome to zzso zzso learning is a technique to find a low zzso representation for high zzso zzso With zzso learning, data analysis becomes more zzso in the low zzso zzso We propose a novel shape zzso method based on a zzso learning method, zzso for brain zzso zzso work applied another zzso learning method, zzso zzso zzso to zzso shape information for distinguishing Alzheimer's disease zzso from zzso We enhance the existing methodology by zzso applying it to distinguish mild cognitive impairment zzso from normal, zzso adopting a more advanced zzso learning technique, zzso and zzso showing the effectiveness of the induced low zzso embedding space to predict key clinical variables such as mini mental state exam scores and clinical diagnosis using the standard multiple linear zzso Our methodology was tested using 25 normal, 25 zzso and 25 zzso zzso
