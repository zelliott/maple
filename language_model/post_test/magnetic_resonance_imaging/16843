The aim of this study was to zzso the feasibility and determine the benefits of zzso zzso with zzso data fusion in patients with cervical cancer treated with radical zzso 

Patients underwent zzso examination prior to external beam zzso and prior to the first and fourth fraction of zzso with zzso in zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso department was performed under zzso zzso The benefit of zzso zzso was determined by comparing conventional treatment planning with dose zzso to zzso zzso and dose zzso to zzso of the high-risk clinical target volume zzso zzso zzso of zzso evaluation with zzso coverage of zzso and zzso parameters for zzso at risk zzso has been assessed in 42 zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso at the zzso department was successful in all patients and there were no zzso The target dose was higher for zzso planning than for conventional planning zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso doses in the zzso and zzso were significantly lower zzso for zzso planning than for the conventional approach zzso zzso vs zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso for zzso We found no correlation between the International Commission on zzso Units zzso point dose for zzso and the maximum dose in zzso Nevertheless, a strong correlation between the maximum dose in zzso and the minimal dose in a volume of 2 zzso has been zzso 

zzso zzso with consecutive zzso data fusion is feasible and safe, with the advantage of increasing the dose to the zzso and decreasing the dose to the zzso at zzso
