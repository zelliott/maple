Alzheimer's disease zzso the most common cause of zzso is thought to be a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is clinically zzso by a decline of memory and other cognitive zzso zzso cognitive impairment zzso is considered to be the zzso stage of zzso However, the relationship between zzso and zzso and the development process remains zzso The zzso is one of the most vulnerable structures in the early stages of zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report on the zzso of the functional connectivity of the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso loop is impaired in zzso and that these zzso relate to the disease zzso In our study, we used zzso functional zzso to investigate the altered zzso connectivity patterns in 35 zzso patients, 27 zzso patients and 27 zzso and zzso normal controls zzso Compared with the NC, the decreased functional connectivity found in the zzso patients was mainly located between the zzso and the regions that are included in the default mode, context conditioning and extinction zzso zzso the decreased functional connectivity between the zzso and some of the identified regions was positively correlated with zzso which indicated that the cognitive function impairment is related to an altered functional connectivity zzso
