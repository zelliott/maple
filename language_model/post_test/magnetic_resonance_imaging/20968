zzso zzso is a marker that can measure vessel wall functional and structural changes resulting from zzso with applications including zzso of mechanical properties of the zzso We sought to assess the feasibility of using magnetic resonance imaging zzso to include wall zzso in the characterization of zzso carotid arteries and to analyze the relationship between zzso and zzso and compositional plaque zzso 

Five healthy volunteers were zzso with a zzso zzso MR sequence twice, within 24 zzso to determine the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso subjects with zzso carotid zzso and the five healthy volunteers were zzso using a zzso carotid zzso protocol to characterize zzso wall zzso and zzso zzso wall index zzso zzso vessel zzso maximum wall thickness and, if present, percentages of wall area occupied by zzso and zzso zzso core were zzso A zzso zzso MR sequence was added to the zzso protocol to measure the zzso zzso zzso at several locations spanning the zzso The zzso correlation zzso zzso and the zzso of variation were used to assess the zzso of DC zzso made on the healthy zzso The DC was compared between zzso segments and between the healthy and diseased zzso Furthermore, within the diseased group, DC was correlated to plaque zzso and composition at each location as well as that averaged over the zzso 

zzso zzso were highly zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso was zzso zzso for the common carotid segment and zzso zzso for the internal carotid zzso In healthy volunteers, we found significantly higher zzso in the common segment of the carotid artery compared to the internal carotid segment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso However, no zzso differences were seen in the diseased group zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso changes in DC were not found to correlate to changes in the local plaque zzso or composition nor were average DC found to be associated with zzso plaque zzso 

These results demonstrate the feasibility of zzso to measure zzso in the carotid artery and to presumably detect changes in zzso due to age zzso zzso The results suggest that the effect of zzso on local zzso may not strongly depend upon the specific underlying plaque features in mild to moderate zzso carotid zzso though more diffuse or zzso changes in zzso zzso could not be ruled zzso
