In a recent PET study, we demonstrated the ability to measure zzso zzso release in the human zzso with the relatively high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso and reliability of zzso zzso in the same imaging paradigm we used to measure zzso zzso zzso Six healthy human subjects (three zzso zzso studied twice with zzso zzso once at baseline and again 3 h following the end of the baseline zzso zzso zzso binding parameters were estimated using a zzso compartment kinetic analysis in the cortical regions of interest and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso correlation zzso were assessed for distribution volume zzso binding potential relative to plasma concentration zzso and binding potential relative to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso consistent with the published zzso zzso for this zzso in other brain regions zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso In addition, no significant decrease in zzso zzso was observed in the second scan compared to the first zzso This suggests that the contribution of zzso mass of zzso zzso to the measured reduction zzso zzso zzso following zzso was relatively zzso These data support the further validation of zzso zzso as a tool to measure zzso zzso release in the human zzso
