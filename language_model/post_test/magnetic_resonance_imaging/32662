To investigate the value of simultaneously obtained brain zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso to diagnose brain zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso patients with or without neurological zzso zzso patients zzso male, 4 zzso who were admitted to zzso zzso Hospital and zzso Surgery Center between January zzso 2003 and whom were diagnosed with zzso were included in the zzso Ages of patients varied between zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients had zzso and routine blood chemistry as well as chest zzso zzso CT, brain CT, brain zzso zzso and a complete neurological zzso Brain zzso were detected in 22 of 62 zzso patients by using brain zzso and 16 zzso of these hadn't had any neurological symptoms or zzso The difference to detect the brain zzso between brain zzso and CT was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Nine of the 22 cases zzso who were found to have brain zzso by using zzso were stage zzso While brain CT showed solitary brain zzso in five patients, 4 zzso of them were found to have multiple zzso when zzso studies were zzso We concluded that, in an attempt to make correct staging and treatment of zzso and hence to investigate the brain zzso in zzso patients including early stage ones, brain zzso is superior to brain CT zzso
