To determine the effect of the zzso effect on the MR signal in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso 

MR imaging of 15 zzso evaluated shoulders, five with zzso zzso injury and ten intact, was zzso zzso In the first part of the study, the signal intensity of the zzso zzso on zzso echo zzso zzso zzso images was correlated with the zzso zzso The second part of the study was designed to illustrate the zzso signal that occurs in the zzso zzso of three zzso volunteers when zzso in the conventional zzso position and in a position similar to zzso Another three volunteers were examined with zzso zzso zzso images to assess the zzso zzso signal in the zzso 

The signal increase in the zzso zzso was identified not only in the injured zzso but also in nine of 10 intact zzso In the zzso studies, the signal in the zzso zzso changed according to the zzso positions zzso zzso or similar to zzso and according to zzso 

Increased signal intensity due to the zzso effect may be zzso as a zzso zzso Awareness of this zzso is particularly important in MR imaging of throwing athletes whose zzso zzso are frequently injured by zzso zzso zzso
