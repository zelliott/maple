We sought to determine the association between zzso zzso zzso and survival in patients with significant coronary artery disease zzso and severe zzso left zzso zzso dysfunction using delayed zzso cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

We studied 339 patients zzso women, mean age 65 zzso 11 zzso referred for assessment of zzso viability by zzso zzso was defined as zzso with an intensity zzso zzso above viable zzso Left zzso zzso zzso as a percentage of total zzso zzso zzso volumes, risk factors, cardiac transplantation zzso and zzso mortality were zzso There were 84 deaths and five zzso over zzso zzso zzso years zzso 4 years, zzso range zzso zzso Left zzso ejection fraction zzso in men was only slightly different from women zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso 10, P zzso zzso whereas mean zzso % was similar in both groups (32 zzso 21 zzso 29 zzso 20, P zzso zzso On zzso survival analysis, age zzso ratio, HR, zzso zzso P zzso zzso female gender zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso % zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso predicted zzso and also on multivariable analysis zzso 32, P zzso zzso Women with zzso % greater than the median had more events, compared with men with or without a high zzso burden zzso P zzso zzso 

In patients with zzso and severely reduced zzso women have worse outcomes than men, irrespective of zzso zzso zzso
