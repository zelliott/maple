Development of techniques for zzso closure of zzso zzso defects zzso makes accurate zzso zzso of zzso important for appropriate patient zzso 

zzso resonance zzso images of zzso were obtained in 30 patients zzso age, 41 zzso 16 zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso MR zzso zzso images were obtained in two zzso views zzso and zzso perpendicular to the plane of the zzso zzso major and minor diameters were measured, and zzso zzso area was zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained in the plane of the zzso and zzso major diameter and zzso area were measured from the region of signal enhancement or phase change due to shunt flow across the zzso MR zzso were compared with templates cut during surgery to match the zzso or with zzso diameter determined by balloon zzso at zzso zzso size measured from zzso MR images zzso agreed closely with zzso and template standards zzso For major diameter, y zzso zzso + zzso r zzso zzso and SEE zzso zzso zzso On average, zzso zzso overestimated major diameter and area of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso MR images acquired in the plane of an zzso define the zzso shape by the cross section of the shunt flow stream and allow zzso determination of zzso size with sufficient accuracy to permit zzso of patients to closure of the zzso by zzso techniques versus zzso zzso images, on the other hand, are not adequate for defining zzso size, because zzso thinning adjacent to a zzso zzso may appear to be part of the zzso
