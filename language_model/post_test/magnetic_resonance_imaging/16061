zzso transient zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso are increasingly used methods for the clinical evaluation of soft tissue mechanical properties and their zzso under diseased zzso This study proposes a comparison between magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso transient zzso zzso Both methods were tested on the same soft zzso gels in a common frequency range in order to allow for direct quantitative zzso For the four gels tested, relatively good agreement was found between the zzso zzso measured by both methods, with an averaged relative difference of zzso This study demonstrates that under the assumption of homogeneous media that are significantly more elastic than zzso quantitative results obtained by both methods are zzso
