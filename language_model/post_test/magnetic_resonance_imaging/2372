zzso zzso zzso has been remarkably reduced by the zzso design technique, which zzso the magnetic energy stored by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso designed by this technique, however, often has poor magnetic field zzso Scaling the spatial zzso of the current density function derived by this method, the magnetic field zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can be greatly improved with a small sacrifice of zzso zzso zzso A figure of merit of the zzso zzso zzso has been found to be improved by zzso the spatial zzso
