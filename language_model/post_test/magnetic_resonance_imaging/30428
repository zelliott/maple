zzso heart disease zzso is a major cause of childhood morbidity and death in the West; the zzso is approximately 1 in 145 live zzso zzso and zzso syndromes account for approximately zzso of zzso The genetic mechanisms underlying zzso or zzso zzso zzso which account for the remaining zzso are poorly zzso The genetic architecture of sporadic zzso likely includes zzso of rare zzso zzso in cardiac zzso genes leading to zzso loading of cardiac zzso networks, copy number variation in cardiac zzso zzso and common zzso that may not be obviously linked to cardiac development but may alter genetic zzso pathways zzso folate zzso The rare zzso typically associated with sporadic zzso likely arise from the severe decrease in zzso fitness selecting against any zzso gene zzso The resulting zzso zzso reduces the power of zzso association studies for zzso A complementary approach to the genetic analysis of zzso is to zzso candidate genes that have been shown to be necessary for mouse heart zzso The number of such genes likely exceeds zzso To identify these zzso we have developed an enabling technology zzso magnetic resonance imaging of mouse zzso which is used in combination with zzso zzso and knockout zzso Key future challenges now involve translating discoveries made in mouse models to human zzso zzso and understanding the mechanisms that create and disrupt genetic zzso A long-term goal in zzso is to manipulate these pathways to enhance zzso and prevent disease in a manner analogous to the use of folate in preventing neural tube zzso
