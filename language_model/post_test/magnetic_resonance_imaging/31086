There have been no previously published case series of horses examined using either zzso or zzso to diagnose collateral ligament injuries not zzso using zzso or zzso nor have other concurrent soft tissue zzso been zzso 

To describe the clinical features of horses with zzso of the collateral ligaments of the zzso zzso zzso joint and to evaluate the results of zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

zzso were examined between January 2001 and January 2003 and were selected for inclusion in the study if there was unequivocal evidence of collateral zzso of the zzso joint based on zzso or zzso zzso details, case history, results of clinical examination and responses to local zzso techniques were zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso and zzso examinations were zzso 

zzso horses were identified with zzso of a collateral ligament of the zzso joint, 3 horses zzso 1) based on zzso alone, 7 zzso zzso with positive zzso and magnetic resonance images and 8 zzso zzso with no zzso zzso using zzso but zzso identified using zzso zzso horses had zzso injuries and one a zzso zzso The zzso collateral ligament was injured most frequently (13 zzso In the majority of horses, no zzso clinical signs were zzso zzso was invariably worse in circles compared with straight zzso zzso was improved by zzso digital analgesia in 16 horses zzso but only 6 were zzso zzso analgesia of the zzso joint produced improvement in zzso in zzso horses zzso In 16 horses, no zzso zzso related to the zzso joint or collateral ligament attachments was zzso Eight of 14 horses zzso had zzso moderately or intensely increased zzso zzso zzso at the site of zzso of the injured collateral ligament on the zzso zzso zzso in size and signal in the injured collateral ligament was identified using zzso In addition, 5 horses had abnormal zzso and fluid in the zzso phalanx at the zzso of the zzso Eleven horses had concurrent soft tissue injuries involving the deep digital zzso tendon, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or collateral ligament of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso joint should be considered as a cause of foot zzso Although some injuries are zzso zzso false negative results zzso zzso zzso at the ligament zzso on the zzso phalanx may be indicative of injury in some zzso zzso is useful for both zzso of the injury and identification of any concurrent zzso Further follow-up information is required to determine factors influencing zzso
