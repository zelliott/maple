To describe initial in zzso experiences with a zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso This sparse collection of in zzso results is intended to shed light on some of the strengths and weaknesses of existing clinical zzso approaches and to indicate important areas of future zzso 

zzso property reconstruction results are compared with data compiled from the limited existing body of published studies in breast zzso Mechanical zzso zzso are also investigated in terms of their implications for the nature of biological soft zzso Additionally, a derivation of the statistical zzso of the elastic zzso reconstruction is given and the resulting confidence intervals zzso for different zzso solutions are zzso 

By comparison with existing estimates of the elastic properties of breast zzso the zzso zzso zzso method is seen to produce reasonable estimates for the mechanical properties of in zzso zzso 

zzso shows potential as an effective way to determine the elastic properties of breast zzso and may be of significant clinical zzso
