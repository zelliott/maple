zzso event sequencing is the ability to plan ahead and order meaningful events zzso To investigate the neural systems supporting this ability, an zzso picture sequencing task was zzso Participants zzso a series of four pictures presented in random order based on the zzso relationship among zzso A control object discrimination task was designed to be comparable to the sequencing task regarding semantic, zzso and motor processing requirements but without sequencing zzso zzso revealed significant zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso internal part in the picture sequencing task compared with the control zzso The findings suggest that circuits involving the frontal lobe and zzso zzso output zzso are important for picture sequencing and more generally for the sequential ordering of zzso This is consistent with the idea that the zzso zzso output zzso are critical not only for motor but also for high-level cognitive function, including behaviors involving meaningful zzso We suggest that the interaction between the frontal zzso and zzso zzso output zzso in semantic event sequencing can be generalized to include the sequential ordering of behaviors in which the selective updating of neural representations is the key zzso
