The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of interactive zzso zzso in the zzso and skull base region using a zzso zzso scanner in patients with zzso affecting the zzso or skull zzso Ten patients with zzso or solid zzso affecting the zzso and skull base regions underwent zzso biopsy in a zzso open zzso MR system equipped with an optical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired prior to and following zzso which was performed with zzso or zzso needles using an zzso or zzso approach following zzso of the skin, zzso and zzso with local zzso The position of the needle tip was continuously updated on fast zzso zzso images zzso 19 zzso TE zzso zzso flip angle 30 degrees, slice thickness 1 zzso field of view 24 zzso 24 zzso using the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the needle was identified based on the associated zzso zzso in all three zzso Once the target zzso had been reached, zzso material was zzso All ten patients tolerated the interactive zzso zzso well without zzso Vital structures, including the brain, zzso zzso vessels and eyes, were zzso on MR imaging and could be zzso There was no difference in the use of zzso or zzso zzso needles concerning the zzso zzso zzso material for zzso analysis was obtained in nine of ten zzso The mean biopsy time was 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the head and neck in an open system are technically feasible and zzso Monitoring of the needle path in multiple planes permits the interactive adjustment of the needle course in near real zzso zzso zzso zzso may well replace open surgical procedures in the zzso region in selected zzso
