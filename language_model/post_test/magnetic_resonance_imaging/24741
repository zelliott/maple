zzso artifacts generated in magnetic resonance zzso images were zzso evaluated for various metals using a three-dimensional zzso artifact rendering to demonstrate the correlation between magnetic zzso and artifact zzso Ten metals zzso steel, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Al, zzso zzso and zzso were prepared, and their magnetic zzso measured using a magnetic zzso Each metal was embedded in a zzso zzso gel phantom and the MR images of the zzso zzso were taken using zzso and zzso T MR scanners under both fast spin echo and zzso echo zzso 3-D renderings of the artifacts were constructed from the images and the artifact volumes were calculated for each zzso The artifact volumes of metals decreased with decreasing magnetic zzso with the exception of zzso Although zzso possesses the lowest absolute magnetic zzso zzso the artifact volume from zzso zzso was smaller than that of zzso This is because the magnetic zzso of zzso was close to that of the zzso gel phantom zzso Since the difference in magnetic zzso between the zzso and zzso is close to that between the zzso and zzso zzso their artifact volumes were almost the same, although they formed artifacts that were reversed in all three zzso
