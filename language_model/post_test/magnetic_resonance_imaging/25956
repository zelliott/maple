An zzso zzso of the spatial matched filter and its application to the reconstruction of phased array MR imagery is zzso zzso relevant array correlation statistics for the zzso signal and noise processes are derived directly from the set of complex individual zzso images, in the form of sample correlation zzso zzso yields an optimal filter zzso for the estimated signal and noise array correlation zzso The technique enables zzso reconstruction of zzso MR imagery without zzso knowledge of the individual zzso field maps or noise correlation zzso Experimental results indicate zzso performance approaching that of the optimal matched zzso Compared to the zzso technique, the zzso noise level in dark image regions is reduced by as much as the square root of zzso where N is the number of coils in the zzso The technique is also effective in suppressing localized motion and flow zzso
