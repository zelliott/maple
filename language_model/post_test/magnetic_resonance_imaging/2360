The feasibility of brain zzso with zzso zzso in a small animal model is zzso zzso abundant zzso is polarized and introduced into the lungs of zzso zzso zzso xenon gas zzso in the blood and is transported to the brain where it accumulates in brain zzso zzso studies reveal a single, dominant, zzso zzso resonance in the head at zzso zzso relative to the gas phase zzso Images of zzso in the rat head were obtained with zzso zzso by zzso chemical shift imaging and show that xenon is localized to the zzso This work establishes that nuclear polarization produced in the gas zzso survives transport to the brain where it may be zzso zzso in polarization and delivered volume of zzso will allow clinical zzso of regional cerebral blood zzso
