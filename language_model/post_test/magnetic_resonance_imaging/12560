zzso zzso zzso encephalitis is an zzso encephalitis with a characteristic zzso syndrome and severe and prolonged clinical zzso In contrast, standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging zzso remains normal in the majority of zzso Here, we investigated structural and functional brain changes in a cohort of patients with zzso zzso 

zzso patients with established diagnosis of zzso encephalitis and zzso and zzso controls underwent zzso testing and zzso zzso including zzso structural imaging, analysis of resting state functional zzso analysis of white matter using diffusion zzso imaging, and analysis of gray matter using zzso zzso 

Patients showed significantly reduced functional connectivity of the left and right zzso with the anterior default mode zzso zzso of both zzso predicted memory performance in zzso zzso zzso imaging revealed extensive white matter changes, which were most prominent in the zzso and which correlated with disease zzso In contrast, no differences in zzso structural imaging and gray matter zzso were observed between patients and zzso 

zzso encephalitis is associated with characteristic zzso of functional connectivity and widespread changes of white matter integrity despite normal findings in routine clinical zzso These results may help to explain the zzso paradox in zzso encephalitis and advance the zzso understanding of the zzso zzso of imaging abnormalities with disease symptoms and severity suggests that these changes play an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso
