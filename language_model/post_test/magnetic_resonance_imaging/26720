The objective of the study was to compare the outcomes of a series of diagnostic parameters in zzso disease zzso patients with the extent of zzso zzso zzso as shown by magnetic resonance imaging zzso performed after zzso zzso administration using 18 patients (13 males and 5 zzso age zzso years, median age zzso zzso with zzso zzso A zzso solution of zzso (1 zzso diluted zzso in saline was injected through the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso using a zzso spinal zzso The patient was kept with the head rotated zzso zzso for 30 zzso after the zzso zzso hours later, three-dimensional zzso inversion recovery zzso using a zzso unit, was zzso zzso and extension of zzso in MD patients was evaluated and correlated with age, duration and stage of the disease, frequency of attacks, time zzso from the last attack, functional level scale, zzso zzso zzso caloric zzso zzso and zzso evoked zzso zzso All patients showed impaired enhancement of the inner ear of variable degree with the zzso portion of the labyrinth more frequently involved than the zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso zzso zzso and stage of the disease were significantly correlated to the number of inner ear sites zzso Modern imaging makes possible the identification of the zzso zzso in MD patients, improving diagnostic zzso The role of zzso in the clinical manifestations and its correlation with most of the diagnostic parameters remain, however, not completely zzso
