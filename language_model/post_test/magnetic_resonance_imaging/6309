We have developed a novel in zzso zzso MR zzso zzso transfer method for detection of zzso in zzso tissue in the presence of interfering fat zzso zzso zzso is zzso labeled with a zzso pulse and, when converted to zzso the zzso retains the zzso zzso of zzso obtained with and without a zzso pulse contain no fat zzso zzso zzso zzso with a GE zzso T zzso of low zzso levels were obtained in zzso by water suppression using a zzso composite zzso pulse and zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in real time allowing the monitoring of a buildup of the intensity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer techniques should find wide zzso in the study of zzso
