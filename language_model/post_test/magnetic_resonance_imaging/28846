zzso is a frequent and often severe symptom in multiple zzso zzso mechanisms proposed for fatigue include the release of zzso zzso which is thought to have an important effect on changes in the zzso barrier zzso To investigate whether fatigue is related to zzso disruption we studied 11 zzso zzso patients participating in a zzso zzso study comparing the sensitivity of monthly enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso after zzso and zzso injection of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed in two separate sessions every 4 weeks for 3 zzso An expanded version of the zzso zzso zzso including 29 items, was administered 24 h before each zzso zzso No relationship was found between the number and volume of zzso zzso and fatigue scores at any monthly examination over the study zzso zzso changes in zzso activity were not significantly related to changes in fatigue zzso These results were obtained on zzso delayed zzso which is more sensitive than zzso scanning in detecting areas of zzso zzso Our preliminary results thus do not support the hypothesis of a relationship between zzso zzso and fatigue severity in multiple zzso
