zzso zzso is associated with a considerable proportion of strokes and head zzso The mechanism of brain cell injury associated with zzso may be different from that due to pure zzso zzso it is essential that models of zzso zzso be developed and well zzso The purpose of this study was to obtain zzso MR images of rat brain at progressive times after induction of zzso zzso and to correlate the images with behavior and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was induced in rats by injection of bacterial zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso zzso changes and corresponding MR images were studied from 30 minutes to 3 weeks after zzso zzso changes were also followed for 3 zzso 

zzso correlation showed that MR is capable of resolving the zzso and zzso of the zzso a zzso wave of zzso zzso from the surrounding tissue beginning at 12 hours, and zzso invasion of zzso beginning at 48 zzso zzso white matter zzso was clearly evident on MR images for 1 week after the zzso zzso zzso zzso were lost in the tissue surrounding the zzso zzso improvement was rapid during resolution of the zzso but incomplete at 3 zzso 

MR images correlate very well with zzso changes in this experimental model of zzso zzso and can therefore be used to follow changes due to drug treatments in zzso The intense zzso response to this zzso may contribute to zzso injury at the periphery of the zzso
