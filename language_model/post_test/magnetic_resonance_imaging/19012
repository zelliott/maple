zzso bright zzso zzso have been observed as areas of increased zzso signal intensity on zzso in zzso to zzso of children with zzso 1 zzso Because of this high frequency and the fact that the zzso diagnostic criteria often do not permit diagnosis of zzso in early childhood, zzso have been proposed as an additional diagnostic zzso 

The authors examined the sensitivity and specificity of zzso for zzso in 19 affected children and 19 zzso zzso Eleven of the control patients had zzso pathology that might be classified as zzso on zzso zzso The authors measured the agreement in recognition of zzso between two pediatric zzso who independently examined the zzso studies of these zzso They also assessed the effect of adding zzso to the zzso diagnostic criteria on ability to diagnose zzso in young zzso 

zzso and specificity of zzso for zzso averaged zzso and zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso was zzso overall, but varied greatly from one brain region to zzso Adding zzso as a diagnostic criterion permitted the diagnosis of zzso of young patients with zzso zzso who do not meet the existing zzso diagnostic criteria for zzso The value of including zzso is less in older patients because a larger proportion of them meet the existing diagnostic zzso 

zzso are difficult to identify with certainty and occur in children with suspected zzso disorders who do not have zzso but they tend to occur in different brain zzso zzso may be more useful for diagnosis of zzso in young children if they can be defined precisely and if only the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso
