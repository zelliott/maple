Historically, increased mechanical zzso during tissue zzso exams has been associated with assessing organ health as well as with detecting the growth of a potentially life-threatening cell zzso As such, techniques to image elasticity parameters zzso zzso have recently become of great interest to zzso In this work, a new method of zzso will be introduced within the context of zzso zzso The zzso method proposed represents a zzso zzso image registration zzso that varies material properties within a finite element model to improve zzso More specifically, regional measures of image similarity are used within an objective function zzso framework to reconstruct elasticity images of tissue zzso zzso simulations zzso zzso the zzso of zzso information within the context of a regional image similarity zzso zzso the methodology for an zzso zzso imaging framework and zzso elasticity reconstruction zzso The real strength in this approach is that images from any zzso zzso magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that have sufficient zzso intensity zzso and remain consistent from a zzso to a zzso state could be used in this zzso
