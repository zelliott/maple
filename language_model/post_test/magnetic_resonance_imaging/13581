zzso contact zzso of the left zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of zzso hypertension, and recent studies suggest that this anomaly may be genetically zzso We therefore assessed the prevalence of this vascular anomaly in young zzso zzso We also studied blood pressure, heart rate zzso and changes in zzso sensitivity in response to mental and physical stress in a subset of subjects with positive and negative zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging of the zzso was performed in 113 young zzso 25 zzso 8 zzso zzso male zzso zzso sensitivity was then assessed in 13 subjects with positive zzso findings and 20 subjects with negative zzso 

zzso zzso was found in 19 zzso Blood pressure levels, heart rate, and zzso sensitivity were similar in all zzso However, zzso of zzso sensitivity was reduced under mental and physical stress in subjects with a positive finding for zzso zzso with a positive finding also had a significantly lower body mass index than those with a negative zzso 

zzso zzso is present in approximately one-fifth of young zzso men, and may zzso the zzso zzso under stress in these zzso
