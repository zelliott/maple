zzso pursuit and zzso abnormalities are well documented in zzso but their zzso zzso remain zzso 

In this study, we used statistical zzso mapping to investigate the relationship between zzso abnormalities and brain structure in a sample of zzso schizophrenia patients zzso zzso zzso In addition to conventional zzso magnetic resonance imaging, we also used zzso transfer ratio, a technique that allows more precise tissue zzso 

We found that smooth pursuit abnormalities were associated with reduced zzso transfer ratio in several regions, predominantly in the right prefrontal zzso zzso errors correlated with gray matter volume in the right zzso superior frontal zzso as measured by conventional magnetic resonance imaging but not with zzso transfer zzso 

These preliminary results demonstrate that specific structural abnormalities are associated with abnormal eye movements in zzso
