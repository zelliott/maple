zzso zzso zzso is a rare, normally painful zzso of the wrist and zzso which characteristically begins in zzso Usually the zzso appears between the age of 8 and 14 years, often progressing from initially mild functional pain to fatigue and loss of strength and finally, reduced zzso We present the zzso in three patients with bilateral MD, using a high-resolution imaging protocol adapted for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso images of three patients were acquired at a zzso T Scanner zzso zzso Philips Medical Systems, Best, The zzso using a dedicated phased array zzso The imaging protocol consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso 

zzso of these three girls demonstrated severe zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with a zzso prominence of the zzso head, also a curved zzso zzso zzso surface with increased zzso zzso due to a zzso of growth in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso row showed zzso zzso Also visible was a prominent short zzso zzso the so called zzso zzso which originates from the zzso border of the zzso zzso into the zzso pole of the zzso and likely contributes to zzso zzso Furthermore, the images demonstrated an anomalous zzso and zzso zzso zzso ligament which, to our knowledge, has been described elsewhere only in another zzso 

High resolution imaging at zzso T permitted a detailed analysis of the complex zzso in patients with zzso Investing the better zzso ratio at higher field strengths into spatial resolution an excellent image quality could be zzso depicting the zzso ligament and the anomalous zzso zzso ligament in this rare zzso
