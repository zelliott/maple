A few years ago it became possible to carry out complicated surgical procedures in humans with the required precision by combining medical imaging zzso zzso with minimally invasive zzso The confined space within these imaging systems and the resulting zzso associated with the manual use of instruments increasingly make necessary the help of aids ranging from positioning systems to robotic devices, which themselves must be position zzso A position sensor has been developed for a medical robotic system allowing the zzso zzso of injection needles and the simultaneous administration of different zzso The zzso position coordinates are determined by a zzso optical principle, which also enables simultaneous determination of all 6 basic degrees of freedom of the robotic system (3 zzso 3 zzso On the basis of an area image sensor and the measurement of a zzso defined structure in the path of the rays between sensor and light source, the position coordinates are calculated almost real zzso Special emphasis was placed on designing the sensor system to cover a sufficiently large zzso to enable it to cover the entire intervention zzso The sensor described zzso determines the position coordinates in a volume of 10 zzso 10 zzso 10 zzso at a resolution of up to 1 zzso for translations and 1 degree for zzso
