The dependence of zzso on the magnetic field strength (the relaxation zzso has been measured at 37 degrees C on autopsy samples of human brain gray and white matter at field strengths corresponding to zzso zzso zzso between 10 zzso and 50 zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso of zzso and zzso have been performed at 200 zzso zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso Absolute signal zzso are found to be zzso to the sample water content, not to the zzso zzso and it is concluded that the zzso lipids do not contribute to the zzso zzso zzso zzso data can be fitted with a triple exponential function, giving characteristic results for each tissue type, and are insensitive to variations of the pulse spacing zzso The zzso relaxation zzso zzso show characteristic shapes for each tissue zzso The most striking difference is a large zzso for white matter at very high zzso As a consequence, the relative difference in zzso between gray and white matter shows a marked maximum around 10 zzso zzso implications for zzso are zzso A weighted zzso fit of the zzso has been performed using a zzso function of the form zzso zzso zzso + D + zzso + zzso The quality of the fit is superior to that of other functions proposed zzso The results of these fits are used to predict image contrast between gray and white matter at different field zzso
