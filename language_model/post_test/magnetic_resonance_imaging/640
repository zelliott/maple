zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso can predict functional recovery after zzso zzso with small, zzso scars have a large likelihood of recovery, and segments with zzso zzso have a small likelihood of zzso zzso with an intermediate extent of zzso have an intermediate likelihood of recovery, and therefore, additional information is zzso zzso the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso was compared with zzso zzso zzso to further define viability in 48 zzso Regional zzso dysfunction was determined by zzso zzso at rest zzso zzso and zzso reserve was determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to assess the extent of zzso zzso A total of 338 segments zzso were zzso with zzso having zzso zzso Most segments zzso zzso with small, zzso scars zzso scores 1 or 2) had zzso reserve, whereas zzso reserve was not frequently zzso observed in segments with zzso zzso zzso score 4) zzso zzso Of segments with an intermediate zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso reserve was observed in zzso whereas zzso did not have zzso zzso In conclusion, the agreement between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is large in the extremes zzso scars and zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be sufficient to assess the likelihood of the recovery of function after zzso However, zzso of segments with an intermediate extent of zzso tissue on zzso have zzso reserve and zzso lack zzso zzso In these zzso zzso zzso zzso may be needed to zzso differentiate zzso with large and small zzso of functional recovery after zzso
