We studied the development of visual processing in 58 children, ranging from 1 d to 12 y of age zzso age 29 zzso using functional magnetic resonance zzso All but nine children had either been zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine children were studied under a full zzso zzso zzso In the first zzso month, zzso of the zzso showed a positive blood zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso zzso for infants between the ages of 1 zzso and 1 zzso zzso did zzso Thirty-one percent of children between 1 and 6 y of age and zzso of children aged 6 y and above showed a positive zzso contrast signal change to our visual stimulation zzso Besides the usual positive zzso contrast signal change, we also noted that a large portion of the children measured displayed a negative zzso contrast signal zzso This negative zzso contrast signal change was observed in zzso of children up to 1 zzso of age, in zzso between 1 zzso and 1 y of age, in zzso between 1 and 6 y of age, and in zzso of children 6 y and zzso In the children in which we observed a negative zzso zzso contrast signal change, the locus was more anterior and more lateral than the positive zzso contrast zzso placing it in the secondary visual cortical zzso The results indicate that when using functional magnetic resonance imaging on children, the primary visual cortical area does not respond functionally in the same manner as that of the adult until zzso y of zzso This supports earlier clinical and zzso findings that different cortical mechanisms seem to contribute to visual perception at different times zzso
