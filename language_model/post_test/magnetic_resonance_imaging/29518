To assess the values of pulse sequences with zzso echo times zzso zzso for detecting and characterizing zzso 

Two normal volunteers aged 33 and 58 years and 12 patients aged seven to 55 years were zzso A total of 10 of the patients had contrast enhancement with intravenous zzso Two zzso zzso were examined before and after the zzso was stripped from the zzso 

High signal regions were observed adjacent to cortical bone in all parts of the skeleton zzso They were generally more conspicuous after fat suppression and contrast zzso In the zzso zzso there was a reduction in the high signal normally seen at the surface of the bone after zzso zzso The detached zzso produced a high zzso Mean zzso values for adult human zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso After enhancement the signal intensity zzso In two patients with zzso fractures, increased zzso signal was seen and this showed marked zzso zzso from zzso could be simulated by fat, zzso blood and zzso 

The zzso can be zzso with zzso echo time pulse sequences in health and zzso
