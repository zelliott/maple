zzso healing after zzso rotator cuff repair remains a zzso Earlier studies have shown a relatively high rate of zzso New surgical techniques may improve healing zzso The purpose of this study was to provide an objective evaluation of repair site integrity after zzso zzso zzso rotator cuff zzso 

zzso cuff tears repaired using the zzso zzso technique will show a higher intact rate on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

Case series; Level of evidence, zzso 

The first 25 patients who underwent zzso rotator cuff repair using the zzso zzso technique underwent zzso evaluation of the zzso zzso Minimum follow-up was 1 zzso zzso clinical, and surgical factors, including tear size, were zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrated intact surgical repair sites in 22 of 25 patients zzso Tears limited to the zzso zzso were intact in 16 of 18 patients zzso Tears of the zzso involving part or all of the zzso showed an zzso intact rate (6 of 7 zzso Of these tears, 3 were considered massive zzso zzso or zzso These demonstrated an intact cuff on zzso 

The zzso zzso technique demonstrates a high healing rate on imaging studies at 1 zzso Of the first 25 patients repaired with the technique, zzso had an intact rotator cuff repair on zzso zzso This indicates excellent cuff healing, as judged by the intact repair sites, compared with most standard zzso rotator cuff repair zzso In this early report of the technique, a persistent tear could not be correlated with age or initial tear size; however, this may be due to the relatively small sample zzso
