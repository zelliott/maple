The zzso zzso is a multilayered structure with separate layers arising from different muscle zzso We examined this layered zzso on MR images to determine if it is relevant in the evaluation of the traumatized zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso MR images of 52 knees with normal zzso were reviewed to determine the number and the muscle origins of these zzso Five knees with traumatized zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso weighting to determine the relationship between the layered zzso and the zzso 

All the normal zzso zzso had a laminated appearance with either four zzso three zzso or two zzso zzso In zzso the zzso were barely zzso The site of origin of each layer was consistent, and each favored a given zzso The superficial layer originated from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso muscle, and the deep layer originated from the anterior zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The middle zzso arose from the deep zzso separating the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso muscles from the zzso zzso zzso When only two layers were present, the middle layer merged with the superficial and deep zzso In the injured tendon, complete zzso produced zzso of all the zzso zzso zzso were seen as focal zzso of individual zzso other layers remained zzso 

The existence of a layered zzso of the zzso zzso is significant in the MR examination of partial zzso It can help not only in detecting and zzso injuries but also in determining appropriate treatment based on the number or thickness of injured zzso
