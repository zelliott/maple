The possibility of deep tissue temperature imaging with a magnetic resonance zzso zzso was studied in 30 zzso zzso The coronary view of the brain of a dog zzso with muscle zzso and zzso and zzso automatically with air was taken with a special head zzso by a zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso driven by a spin zzso pulse zzso zzso in the imaging of the right and left white matter, zzso matter, zzso and zzso nucleus were measured with zzso temperature in group I (10 zzso for a control study every 30 zzso until 120 zzso without intervention, in group II (10 zzso for zzso with zzso bypass method, before heating, at 41 and 42 degrees C, in group III (10 zzso for hypothermia, before zzso at 35 and 30 degrees C and after zzso zzso In groups I, II and III, the zzso at all sites except the white matter at 42 degrees C did not change significantly at any zzso zzso zzso zzso in the white matter at 42 degrees C may be due to zzso probably because of biological reaction to zzso The present study suggests that deep tissue temperature imaging in zzso by zzso measured with the MR zzso may be impossible in spite of obvious evidence of zzso zzso on temperature in zzso in zzso and ex zzso studies already zzso
