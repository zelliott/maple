To assess the significance of zzso zzso in detecting hip joint zzso in patients with rheumatic zzso 

Forty patients with rheumatic disease and suspected hip joint zzso underwent zzso and US of the hip zzso In addition to the throughout zzso zzso the anterior zzso distance zzso was determined by both zzso and zzso Thirteen healthy volunteers were examined with zzso to establish the criteria for normal findings in zzso when zzso hip zzso to those with zzso and those zzso zzso was used as a gold zzso 

zzso was found using zzso in 31 hips of 22 patients (9 patients had bilateral zzso The zzso correlation was zzso between zzso and US in measuring zzso In zzso hip joint zzso with zzso the sensitivity of the method was zzso and specificity zzso when the zzso criterion for zzso was determined to be zzso or zzso 7 zzso If the zzso point was raised to 9 zzso the sensitivity decreased to zzso while specificity increased to zzso A difference in zzso of zzso or zzso 1 zzso between the hips as an additional criterion for zzso increased the number of zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso with US proved to be a rather inaccurate method to point out zzso in rheumatic patients when using zzso as a zzso The main reason for this result was the thickened zzso which US could not differentiate from a thickened zzso
