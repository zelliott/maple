To zzso investigate the prevalence of fat deposition in chronic zzso zzso zzso by using magnetic resonance zzso zzso separation imaging with sampling of the entire left zzso zzso zzso A subsidiary aim was to determine the relationship between zzso fat deposition and zzso zzso as well as regional and global cardiac functional zzso 

Twenty-five patients with zzso zzso were evaluated in this prospective institutional review zzso Health Insurance zzso and Accountability zzso study after they provided written informed zzso A zzso MR system was used to perform zzso zzso zzso and late zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso separation was performed by using a zzso Dixon reconstruction from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Fat deposition location was compared with zzso zzso imaging by using a zzso zzso Global and regional functional zzso zzso volumes, and fat deposition were compared by using the zzso zzso Student zzso test, and multiple zzso 

A fat deposition prevalence of zzso was found in areas of chronic zzso The patients with fat deposition had larger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso decreased wall zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and impaired zzso wall motion zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The volume of fat deposition was correlated with zzso volume, zzso ejection zzso zzso zzso volume index, and zzso zzso volume zzso 

There is a high prevalence of fat deposition in healed zzso It is associated with zzso characteristics including zzso volume, zzso mass, wall zzso wall zzso and wall zzso
