To compare zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the study of zzso abnormalities in pulmonary embolism zzso and to compare the zzso results to the findings previously reported for pneumonia and chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso in terms of zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso MR images and zzso scans of 20 patients with zzso 11 patients with acute pneumonia, and 13 patients with zzso of COPD were zzso Five categories of zzso abnormalities within each imaging zzso were zzso zzso and zzso agreement zzso zzso in the evaluation of zzso abnormalities were zzso based on the two observers of each imaging zzso (all blinded to each other and true zzso Finally, three categories of zzso zzso diagnosis zzso pneumonia, and zzso were also defined and the zzso agreement zzso zzso was zzso 

For zzso the zzso agreement zzso zzso in the evaluation of zzso abnormalities was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The zzso agreement varied from zzso to zzso respectively, and was zzso For the pooled group of zzso pneumonia, and zzso the zzso agreement of zzso abnormalities was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and the zzso agreement varied from zzso to zzso The zzso value for zzso agreement for zzso diagnosis was zzso 

zzso of zzso abnormalities in zzso pneumonia, and COPD using zzso zzso and zzso scan showed a high zzso agreement that was higher than the zzso zzso Further studies are now needed in patients presenting with possible zzso to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso
