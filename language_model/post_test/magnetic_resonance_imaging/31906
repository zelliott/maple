zzso studies indicate deficits in zzso working memory zzso and executive functioning in zzso However, little is known about the underlying functional zzso In the present study, neural zzso of zzso in adolescents and young adults with zzso were investigated using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and a zzso verbal zzso task which required the manipulation of verbal zzso zzso were not significantly slower than zzso however, they were less accurate with the highest zzso zzso The functional analysis excluded incorrectly performed and omitted trials, thus controlling for potential zzso zzso Compared with control subjects, both increased and decreased zzso of the prefrontal zzso were found in the dyslexic zzso zzso showed significantly more zzso than controls with increasing zzso demand in the left superior frontal zzso zzso zzso as well as in the inferior frontal zzso including zzso area zzso zzso and its right zzso Less zzso was found in the middle frontal zzso zzso 6) and in the superior zzso zzso zzso zzso A positive correlation between zzso of prefrontal regions and verbal zzso performance (as measured by zzso span zzso was found only in the dyslexic zzso zzso deficits at the highest cognitive demand during the verbal zzso task and the zzso span backwards suggest that manipulation rather than maintenance is selectively impaired in zzso The zzso data provide further evidence for functional differences in cortical regions associated with language processing and executive function in subjects with zzso
