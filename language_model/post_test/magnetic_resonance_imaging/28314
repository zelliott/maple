An understanding of zzso zzso and reaction processes occurring within porous materials is central to the design and zzso of chemical processing operations such as gas zzso zzso and soil zzso To address many of the important questions in these areas the process engineer needs to zzso zzso in both the physical and chemical properties of porous media, and to identify the importance of these properties in determining the operating characteristics of the system under zzso In this paper three examples, each considering different types of zzso zzso are zzso zzso single and zzso component zzso processes in zzso zzso structure and transport zzso in porous catalyst zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso space in packed beds of zzso
