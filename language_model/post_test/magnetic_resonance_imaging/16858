The present study was designed to detect the abnormalities of the cerebral zzso density in zzso zzso vascular zzso patients by zzso method to promote the early diagnosis of zzso 

Nine zzso zzso vascular zzso patients and nine zzso normal controls underwent zzso brain structure scanning that was performed on a zzso zzso zzso zzso scanner and standard zzso high-resolution zzso scans of zzso sequence were zzso The zzso zzso images were processed with zzso package and the cerebral gray matter density was compared between the zzso zzso vascular zzso patients and normal zzso 

Compared with the normal control group, the cerebral gray matter density of zzso zzso vascular zzso patients was found significantly zzso including brain regions of thalamus, zzso zzso frontal lobe and zzso lobe zzso 

The cerebral gray matter density zzso have closed correlation with cognitive dysfunction in zzso zzso vascular zzso patient and can be detected by zzso zzso has some potential value in the diagnosis of zzso
