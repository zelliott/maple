To measure the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso MR zzso in distinguishing normal from abnormal brain tissue and zzso from zzso brain zzso 

MR zzso was performed at zzso T with the zzso zzso pulse sequence and conventional zzso zzso zzso consisted of a consecutive series of patients with suspected brain zzso or zzso zzso and 10 healthy adult zzso Fifty-five zzso in 53 patients with subsequently verified final diagnoses were zzso zzso were interpreted zzso by visual inspection by zzso readers zzso with the benefit of prior clinical data and imaging studies, and by blinded readers zzso The zzso readers interpreted the zzso as diagnostic or not, and, if zzso as zzso or zzso The blinded readers classified the zzso as diagnostic or not, and, if zzso as normal or abnormal and as zzso or zzso (when zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values, and accuracy were calculated from blinded and zzso MR zzso zzso A receiver operator characteristic zzso curve analysis was performed on blinded MR zzso zzso 

The diagnostic accuracy averaged across four blinded readers in zzso patients from control subjects was zzso while the area under the zzso zzso zzso zzso curve approached zzso zzso in the zzso and blinded discrimination of zzso from zzso disease was zzso and zzso zzso The area under the zzso zzso curve in the blinded discrimination of zzso from zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso obtained at zzso T from patients with suspected zzso can be distinguished from zzso in healthy control subjects, and zzso zzso can be distinguished from zzso zzso with a high degree of diagnostic zzso
