Recent data have revealed that clinically zzso zzso zzso do not involve all brain regions zzso The zzso in particular could be protected from zzso activity by putative filtering properties of the zzso zzso Here we investigated if simple or complex focal zzso zzso and in particular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso onset zzso spare the zzso and if there are zzso zzso 

We zzso assessed clinical, zzso imaging and zzso data from patients undergoing zzso evaluation of focal zzso with zzso depth and zzso zzso zzso and selected those suffering from zzso of zzso We further subdivided this patient sample according to qualitative zzso criteria into a zzso group, with an zzso zzso only, and a zzso group, displaying an zzso and additional zzso zzso 

14 patients zzso in each zzso fulfilling the inclusion criteria had a total of 43 zzso of which 35 were of zzso Whereas only zzso of zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso all zzso of zzso invaded the zzso independently of the zzso propagation pattern or degree of zzso zzso All zzso in the zzso group displayed zzso zzso activity and even seizure onset in two zzso 

In our patient sample, the human zzso was not spared during zzso of zzso but was invariably invaded by zzso zzso The presence of spontaneous zzso activity in the zzso group revealed persistent modifications in zzso zzso that might be due to secondary zzso in the zzso following repeated zzso of zzso
