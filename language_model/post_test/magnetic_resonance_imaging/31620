For zzso zzso a three-dimensional zzso acquisition is desired to obtain high-resolution zzso Current zzso methods that use zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging suffer from high zzso low zzso ratio zzso and the need for retrospective correction of zzso zzso zzso In this study, a novel zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso snapshots zzso zzso developed and used to obtain in zzso zzso zzso zzso signal evolving towards the zzso were acquired in an zzso segmented elliptical zzso phase zzso order immediately after a zzso zzso preparation zzso zzso cycling was applied to eliminate the adverse impact of zzso relaxation on quantitative zzso A variable flip angle train was designed to provide a flat signal response to eliminate the filtering effect in zzso caused by transient signal zzso zzso in zzso agreed well with results from zzso The zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso in overall cartilage of healthy zzso The average zzso zzso of mean zzso values (N zzso 4) for overall cartilage was zzso with regional zzso ranging from zzso to zzso The fitting errors using zzso were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso than those using sequences without zzso cycling and variable flip zzso
