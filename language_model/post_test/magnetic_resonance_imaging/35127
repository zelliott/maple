zzso of the study is to demonstrate the main role of magnetic resonance imaging in the identification and characterization of zzso zzso of the head and zzso 

CT and zzso findings of 78 patients zzso male, 35 zzso aged zzso zzso zzso years surgically treated for zzso zzso of the head and neck region between January 1995 and June 2005 were zzso zzso and correlated with the zzso zzso 

On CT images, zzso and zzso appeared as smooth zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso masses associated with moderate displacement of surrounding zzso zzso had high signal intensity on MR zzso images, with relative decreasing signal on zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared as zzso zzso masses with zzso zzso zzso showed a characteristic contrast enhancement on both CT and zzso In one case of zzso the zzso appeared markedly zzso in zzso MR and CT images of zzso disease showed multiple symmetrical zzso masses involving the neck zzso zzso fatty zzso appeared as zzso zzso masses sometimes associated with cortical expansion and zzso 

Both CT and zzso exams are useful for detecting zzso zzso zzso however, is more accurate in the evaluation of their extent and in the zzso of uncommon zzso zzso of the head and neck, and intravenous administration of zzso better depicts the margins of the zzso and its zzso
