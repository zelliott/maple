To evaluate the zzso agreement on magnetic resonance imaging zzso evaluation of zzso discs, zzso zzso zzso and root zzso in patients with recent onset cervical zzso and in addition, to assess the added value of disclosure of clinical information to zzso zzso 

The zzso images of 82 patients with less than 1 month of symptoms and signs of cervical zzso were evaluated independently by two zzso who were unaware of clinical zzso zzso analysis was repeated after disclosure of clinical zzso zzso agreement was calculated using zzso zzso 

The zzso score for evaluation of zzso discs and of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso A zzso score of zzso was found for the presence of root zzso After disclosure of clinical information zzso scores increased zzso from zzso to zzso for the detection of zzso discs, from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso for root zzso 

zzso reliability of zzso evaluation in patients with cervical zzso was substantial for root zzso with or without clinical zzso zzso on the cause of the zzso zzso zzso disc or zzso zzso zzso was zzso
