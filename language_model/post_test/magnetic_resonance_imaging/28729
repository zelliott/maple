There is immense zzso in the clinical presentation of zzso sclerosis and many incomplete forms zzso zzso zzso To investigate the imaging characteristics of cortical zzso seen in zzso sclerosis unaccompanied by other zzso we reviewed zzso and CT of six patients who met the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of zzso established solely by the presence of a zzso confirmed cortical zzso Five of the patients had a solitary cortical zzso and the last had three zzso one of which was zzso and confirmed zzso The other two zzso were included in our zzso CT showed five zzso as low density, but three were not zzso No zzso or dense zzso were zzso zzso revealed peripheral components and inner zzso of seven cortical zzso in five patients, with differing signal zzso The zzso cores, with zzso and zzso zzso were separated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso high signal was observed in both the zzso and zzso white matter on zzso weighted or zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso band was observed in one patient, and central depression of the expanded zzso in zzso In one patient, a cortical zzso was zzso with a thick zzso on zzso images and a blurred zzso matter junction with zzso increased signal on zzso zzso zzso zzso without other zzso of zzso sclerosis are shown to be distinct from focal cortical zzso
