zzso zzso zzso zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with zzso zzso zzso resulting in high levels of plasma zzso and a characteristic clinical zzso 

To investigate the molecular basis of zzso in a patient with a normal plasma zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso examinations as well as molecular and genetic zzso 

Nerve and muscle center and genetic zzso Patient A 42-year-old woman with clinical findings strongly suggestive for zzso 

Clinical description of the disease and its novel genetic zzso 

Identification of zzso DNA depletion in muscle samples zzso zzso of the control mean zzso prompted us to look for other causes of our patient's zzso zzso of genes associated with zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso not reveal deleterious zzso zzso of sequencing and array comparative zzso zzso of the zzso DNA for point zzso and deletions in blood and muscle were zzso zzso of zzso a gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso revealed 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are predicted to affect the zzso interface of the zzso zzso and likely result in impaired zzso zzso 

This study expands the clinical spectrum of impaired zzso function, challenges the notion of locus zzso of zzso and sheds light on the zzso of conditions involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that patients with zzso who have normal zzso levels should be tested for zzso zzso
