Assessment of right zzso volume and mass with three zzso zzso and comparison with magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso of right zzso volumes performed on three zzso zzso acquired by zzso zzso were compared to those obtained from magnetic resonance imaging performed on the same zzso Volumes were measured in end zzso and end zzso and ejection fraction zzso Right zzso mass was assessed in end zzso With both methods, the areas of a 2 zzso thick slice of the zzso were manually outlined and multiplied by the slice thickness to obtain slice zzso Slice volumes were multiplied by the number of measured slices to obtain the zzso zzso 

16 patients were zzso three with normal hearts, three after surgical repair of zzso of the zzso nine following repair of zzso of zzso and one with zzso zzso repair of complete zzso of the great zzso 

zzso between end zzso volumes measured by both methods was r zzso zzso with limits of agreement ranging from zzso to zzso zzso correlation for end zzso volumes was r zzso zzso with limits of agreement between zzso and zzso zzso correlation for end zzso right zzso mass was r zzso zzso with limits of agreement between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso for end zzso volume to zzso zzso to zzso for mass zzso 

With zzso three zzso zzso end zzso right zzso volumes can be assessed with acceptable accuracy in normal hearts and those with enlarged right zzso whereas the current method of three zzso zzso is less good for end zzso volumes and not satisfactory for right zzso mass zzso
