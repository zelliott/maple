In patients with coronary disease and poor left zzso function, zzso reconstruction with zzso is a surgical zzso Details of patient selection and optimal surgical technique are still zzso This study reports results achieved with zzso reconstruction in 285 patients who had zzso or zzso associated with relative wall zzso 

Data were zzso zzso Reconstruction on the beating heart was accomplished by a modified linear closure plus zzso when zzso zzso zzso zzso 237 zzso were in symptom class III or IV with zzso heart failure zzso zzso zzso angina zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Average ejection fraction was zzso zzso zzso and 144 zzso had zzso grade zzso zzso zzso zzso procedures included coronary artery bypass zzso in 262 zzso zzso in 64 zzso zzso of zzso zzso in 118 zzso and a zzso valve procedure in 6 zzso 

zzso room mortality was zzso zzso support included zzso balloon pumping in 49 zzso and zzso drugs in 154 zzso During a mean follow-up of 63 zzso 48 months, 8 patients required transplantation zzso of 49 zzso 41 zzso 2 needed zzso valve replacement, and 9 required use of an zzso zzso for zzso zzso At 1, 5, and 10 years zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso Freedom from sudden death was zzso zzso and zzso Among survivors, symptom class improved in 140 of 208 patients zzso mean improvement zzso zzso zzso functional class per zzso Average increase in ejection fraction zzso was zzso zzso zzso 

Using wall thinning as a criterion for patient selection, left zzso reconstruction can be performed with low operative zzso provides good control of symptoms, excellent long-term survival, and freedom from sudden zzso This approach should be considered in all patients with coronary disease, poor left zzso function, and relative wall zzso
