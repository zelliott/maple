A distinct type of mental preparation zzso in zzso frontal and zzso zzso had been found to facilitate insight problem solving independent of specific problems zzso In order to explore whether neural activity during a zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with which insight problems would be solved or not, we developed a task that uses Chinese zzso zzso as zzso Blood zzso zzso zzso contrasts between zzso and zzso mental preparation were zzso zzso showed that mental preparation leading to successful problem solving involves heightened activity in the left zzso frontal zzso the left zzso zzso zzso the right zzso the bilateral zzso and the left zzso zzso We discussed the role of these areas in mental preparation for successful insight problem zzso
