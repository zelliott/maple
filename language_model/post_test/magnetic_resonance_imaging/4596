We measured left zzso volume in 70 zzso patients after first zzso anterior zzso zzso in order to determine whether zzso zzso occurs and whether there is evidence for its zzso or prevention by treatment with zzso or zzso Of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of patients received zzso zzso Patients were zzso a mean of 11 days after zzso to receive either zzso 25 zzso three times daily, zzso 200 zzso twice daily or matching zzso After 6 months of treatment, 6 patients from the zzso group zzso zzso 24), 1 from the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and 3 from the zzso group zzso zzso zzso had been withdrawn from the study because of clinical zzso Left zzso volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging, before zzso and after 6 months of zzso Changes in left zzso zzso and zzso volume after 6 months of treatment were defined zzso as the primary zzso Mean initial zzso volume index was 85 zzso zzso zzso mean zzso volume index was 45 zzso zzso zzso and mean ejection fraction was 48 zzso zzso for the whole zzso There was no significant change in left zzso volume index in the zzso or either treatment group after 6 months of zzso Only minimal left zzso zzso was evident at 11 zzso No further increase in left zzso volume occurred after six months and there was no additional benefit from treatment with either zzso or zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
