We sought to analyze the zzso findings of 30 patients with a diagnosis of zzso right zzso zzso zzso based on established clinical and instrumental criteria, who did not have a family history of zzso 

The diagnostic role of zzso biopsy zzso in patients with a clinical profile of zzso is still zzso 

Thirty patients (19 male, 11 female, mean age 27 zzso 10 zzso with left bundle branch block zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings diagnostic of zzso were zzso All patients, besides zzso zzso and invasive cardiac studies, underwent zzso in the zzso anterior free wall, inferior wall of the right zzso zzso and in the zzso region of the left zzso 

zzso zzso features of zzso were found only in 9 zzso patients and a zzso according to the Dallas criteria, in the remaining 21 zzso zzso zzso evaluation of RV samples showed significant differences in fatty tissue and zzso percent area between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no difference was found between the two groups in zzso patterns and structural and functional zzso zzso and zzso RV zzso zzso resonance imaging showed zzso signals in zzso of zzso and in zzso of zzso group zzso zzso zzso During follow-up zzso 23 zzso 14 zzso all patients with zzso remained stable on zzso therapy while five patients with zzso required zzso of an zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso involving the RV can mimic zzso An zzso appears the most reliable diagnostic technique, with significant zzso and therapeutic zzso
