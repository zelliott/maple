Still today, zzso used as a reference in the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have been obtained mainly from studies carried out in zzso and European zzso 

To obtain zzso of the zzso diameter, zzso diameter, end zzso volume, end zzso volume, ejection zzso and zzso mass of the left and right zzso in zzso 

54 men and 53 women, with mean age of zzso zzso zzso years, zzso with no zzso have been subjected to the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, using a balanced steady state free zzso zzso 

The averages and the standard zzso of the parameters for the left zzso have zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For the right zzso they have zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The masses and the volumes were significantly greater in the men, except for the end zzso volume of the left zzso The ejection fraction of the right zzso has been significantly greater in the zzso There has been a significant and zzso correlation of the zzso volume of the right volume with the progression of the zzso 

This study has zzso for the first time, cardiac zzso obtained through the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in zzso zzso with no zzso showing differences in accordance with gender and zzso
