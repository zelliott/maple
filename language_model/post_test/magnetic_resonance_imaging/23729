The zzso zzso procedure with fat obliteration has been hailed as the gold standard of definitive frontal zzso procedures for chronic inflammatory zzso The value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso follow-up has not yet been sufficiently zzso 

All zzso zzso scans performed in patients undergoing surgery between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1996 were zzso The outcome parameters were zzso changes in the distribution of fatty or zzso tissue and development of zzso or oil zzso as well as zzso inflammatory zzso or zzso 

zzso operations were performed in the specified period and a total of 73 zzso zzso scans from 45 operations were available for zzso In 16 cases, between two and five zzso scans were zzso The individual time between surgery and the last zzso scan ranged from two weeks to 130 months with an average of zzso zzso We found four zzso 34, 49, zzso and 130 months, zzso Three of the zzso were diagnosed on the first zzso zzso zzso In the fourth case the zzso had not been seen on the previous zzso The amount of zzso tissue zzso on the last scan was less than zzso in the majority of cases zzso and more than zzso in only zzso of cases, although in the latter group the time between surgery and zzso was less than 7 months in half the zzso 

zzso is the most valuable diagnostic tool after frontal zzso obliteration using zzso zzso Despite the good soft tissue zzso the method has some limitations with regard to detection of small zzso zzso and differentiation between vital zzso tissue and fat necrosis in the form of oil zzso In these difficult cases, long-term zzso follow-up is necessary for definitive zzso We therefore recommend zzso 1, 2, and 5 years after zzso frontal zzso surgery with zzso
