Previous research characterized three cognitive zzso in zzso lobe zzso each associated with a different profile of clinical seizure and demographic zzso total cerebral zzso white, zzso zzso and zzso volumes, and prospective cognitive zzso The objective of this investigation was to characterize in detail the specific zzso abnormalities associated with each cognitive zzso 

zzso zzso scans of healthy controls zzso and patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso grouped by cognitive zzso zzso zzso memory zzso memory, executive function, and speed zzso were examined with respect to patterns of gray matter thickness throughout the cortical zzso as well as volumes of zzso structures, corpus zzso and regions of the zzso 

zzso abnormalities in zzso and zzso cortical zzso volumes of zzso structures zzso thalamus, zzso zzso all regions of the corpus zzso and bilateral zzso gray matter distinguish the cognitive zzso in a generally zzso zzso The most intact anatomy is observed in the minimally impaired zzso group and the most abnormal anatomy is evident in the zzso group with zzso in memory, executive function, and zzso 

zzso derived cognitive zzso are associated with the presence, severity, and distribution of zzso abnormalities in widely distributed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
