The use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been shown to be safe during pregnancy and can accurately assess fetal fat and rate of zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate with zzso the relationship between maternal weight, fat distribution, and zzso levels and zzso zzso ratio, percent fat, and infant outcome in zzso complicated by zzso zzso Twenty zzso diabetic women were studied at 36 to 38 zzso gestation with zzso zzso a zzso tolerance test and maternal body fat by electrical zzso zzso scans of the maternal upper arm and from her zzso process to her zzso zzso including all fetal zzso were analyzed for percent fat of the mother's arm and trunk and her zzso zzso All variables were then related to infant outcome zzso zzso ratio, and zzso zzso zzso body composition was related to maternal weight zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso as was maternal arm fat zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso fat did correlate with trunk fat, but trunk fat did not correlate was well with weight zzso zzso zzso Although maternal zzso zzso correlated with maternal weight zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso it did not correlate with infant zzso In contrast, maternal mean zzso levels correlated with both maternal and infant weight and infant zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso r zzso zzso and p zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
