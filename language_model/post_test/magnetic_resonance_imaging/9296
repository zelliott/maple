zzso of zzso tissue is a promising strategy for treatment of acute cerebral zzso more than 3 hours from symptom zzso However, there has been only sparse direct evidence that zzso after 3 hours prevents zzso zzso 

We analyzed clinical and serial magnetic resonance imaging zzso data on patients who received zzso zzso therapy zzso hours after last known well zzso zzso zzso were acquired zzso early zzso hours), and late zzso zzso after zzso Degree of zzso was assessed on end of procedure zzso zzso degree of zzso on early zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth by analysis of diffusion zzso volumes on zzso and late zzso 

zzso (12 men, 15 zzso underwent zzso zzso procedures at zzso zzso zzso hours zzso zzso zzso after last known well zzso Immediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso volume correlated strongly with zzso growth zzso zzso P zzso zzso exceeding the correlations of vessel zzso score zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mismatch volume zzso zzso zzso zzso Without zzso enlargement of zzso zzso volume was observed in all patients, and extent of enlargement depended on volume of immediate zzso zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso zzso is the major zzso of threatened tissue outcome, and suggest zzso even after 3 hours of symptom onset can alter tissue fate over a wide range of mismatch zzso
