Corpus zzso size has been found to be abnormal in adult zzso and other studies have implicated abnormal zzso communication in this zzso To assess continuity with brain abnormalities in the later onset disorder and to further zzso brain zzso this structure was examined in a unique sample of childhood onset zzso zzso brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired for 25 patients zzso age zzso zzso zzso who had onset of schizophrenia by age 12 zzso age at onset zzso zzso zzso and 55 normal zzso The zzso area of the corpus zzso was divided into seven zzso With no adjustment for brain volume, no diagnostic differences were zzso After adjustment for the smaller cerebral volume of the zzso larger total, anterior and zzso corpus zzso areas emerged for the zzso These findings provide further evidence for continuity between childhood onset and later onset schizophrenia and support other studies showing white matter sparing in the context of decreased cortical zzso
