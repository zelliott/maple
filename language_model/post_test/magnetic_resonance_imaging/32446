The presence of Q waves in the zzso zzso has been used as a marker of prior zzso zzso zzso Its zzso however, is zzso The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of an zzso to detect prior zzso compared with a novel criterion zzso 

This study conducted retrospective inclusion with de zzso analysis of zzso and cardiac magnetic resonance zzso by independent blinded readers in a zzso zzso The population consisted of a consecutive sample of 146 patients referred for zzso for evaluation of zzso viability and zzso zzso waves on zzso were defined as per Minnesota Code zzso zzso zzso was zzso and localized by zzso delayed contrast zzso and assumed as criterion zzso zzso zzso and zzso values of zzso were calculated for different zzso sizes zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso and location zzso zzso inferior, and lateral zzso 

zzso was zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso zzso zzso improved when only large zzso were considered zzso but specificity decreased to zzso zzso for detecting isolated anterior or inferior wall scars was similar, but isolated lateral wall zzso was rarely identified zzso When all 3 walls were involved, sensitivity was still low at zzso 

The lack of sensitivity and the resulting low negative zzso value of zzso criteria seriously limit its accuracy as a marker of prior zzso
