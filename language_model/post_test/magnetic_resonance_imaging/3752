To evaluate whether focal abnormalities zzso depicted by prostate zzso could be zzso using simple zzso zzso 

zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso and dynamic zzso zzso at zzso T before prostate biopsy were zzso zzso zzso visible at zzso were zzso by their shape, the degree of signal zzso zzso to zzso zzso on individual MR zzso and a zzso score zzso benign to zzso zzso zzso were then zzso under US zzso 

zzso zzso were positive at zzso The zzso score significantly predicted biopsy results zzso As compared to zzso zzso the odds ratios zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unlike zzso shape, a simple combination of MR signal abnormalities zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly predicted biopsy results zzso As compared to zzso zzso zzso the OR of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the overall population and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

A simple combination of signal abnormalities of individual MR sequences can significantly zzso the risk of zzso of zzso holding promise of a more zzso interpretation of zzso by readers with varying zzso 

zzso Using zzso experienced zzso can zzso the zzso risk of zzso zzso zzso The shape of zzso focal abnormalities in the peripheral zone does not help predicting zzso zzso A simple combination of findings at zzso can help zzso zzso
