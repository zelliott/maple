In zzso and animal model studies suggest that zzso zzso zzso the production of the zzso zzso zzso a major contributor to zzso disease zzso zzso We evaluated the association of 16 zzso single zzso zzso zzso with zzso risk in 158 African American and 469 Caucasian zzso zzso from the zzso zzso There was no evidence for association of zzso with zzso in either population zzso To examine the possibility that zzso zzso affect specific components of the zzso process, we tested association of these zzso with four measures of zzso and cerebrovascular disease defined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in a subset of 48 African American and 265 Caucasian zzso Five of seven common zzso and several zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso in the Caucasian zzso Two of these zzso also showed marginal evidence for association in the African American zzso zzso for the other zzso traits were zzso This study highlights the potential value of zzso zzso as a tool for finding genes influencing zzso zzso
