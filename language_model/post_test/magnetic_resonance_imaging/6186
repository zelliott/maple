zzso spreading depression zzso has been suggested to zzso migraine zzso Despite a precise match in speed, the zzso patterns of zzso observed in animal zzso and aura symptoms mapped to the cortical surface zzso differ in aspects of size and zzso We show that this mismatch is zzso by utilizing that both pattern types zzso from an instability point of generic zzso zzso To zzso these zzso pattern we suggest a zzso scale having the value zzso zzso 1 at the instability zzso We predict that human zzso is only zzso susceptible to zzso zzso and support this prediction by directly matching visual aura symptoms with anatomical landmarks using zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we use retinal zzso to give a proof of concept of the existence of this instability point and describe how cortical zzso to zzso must be adjusted for migraine drug zzso Close to the instability point at zzso zzso 1 the zzso repertoire of cortical tissue is zzso As a consequence, the picture of an engulfing zzso that became zzso for migraine with aura needs to be modified in most cases towards a more zzso confined pattern that remains within the originating major zzso or zzso Furthermore, we discuss the resulting implications on migraine pharmacology that is zzso tested in the regime zzso and potentially silent aura occurring below a second zzso point at zzso zzso 0 on the susceptible zzso
