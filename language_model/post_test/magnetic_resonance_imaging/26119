We investigated the function of biceps in 18 patients (19 zzso with zzso of the rotator zzso Their mean age was 59 zzso Another series of 18 patients (19 zzso with normal rotator cuffs as seen on zzso acted as a control zzso Their mean age was 55 zzso A brace was used to maintain contraction of biceps during zzso zzso zzso were obtained with the arm elevated at 0 degrees , 45 degrees and 90 degrees with and without contraction of zzso The distance between the zzso of the head of the zzso and the zzso was compared in the two zzso We found that in the group with tears there was significantly greater zzso migration of the head of the zzso at 0 degrees and 45 degrees of zzso without contraction of biceps but depression of the head of the zzso at 0 degrees, 45 degrees and 90 degrees when biceps was zzso We conclude that biceps is an active zzso of the head of the zzso in shoulders with zzso of the rotator zzso
