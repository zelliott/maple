The first two decades of brain research using zzso have been dominated by studies that measure signal changes in response to a presented zzso A rapidly increasing number of studies are showing that consistent zzso maps appear by assessment of signal correlations during time periods in which the subjects were not directed to perform any specific task zzso zzso state zzso Even though neural interactions can happen on much shorter time zzso most zzso zzso studies assess these zzso correlations over a period of about 5 to 10 zzso Here we investigate how these zzso correlations change on a shorter time zzso We examine changes in brain correlations to the zzso zzso zzso zzso across a 10-minute zzso We show: zzso zzso correlations zzso over time, zzso these fluctuations can be zzso and zzso correlations between the zzso and other brain regions zzso at distinct zzso While the precise zzso of correlation fluctuations vary across subjects and runs, it is still possible to parse brain regions and combinations of brain regions based on fluctuation frequency zzso To evaluate the potential biological significance of these empirical zzso we then use synthetic time series data with identical zzso zzso but zzso phase to show that similar effects can still appear even if the timing relationships between zzso are zzso This implies that observed correlation fluctuations could occur between regions with distinct zzso zzso whether or not there are dynamic changes in neural connectivity between such zzso As more studies of brain connectivity dynamics appear, particularly studies using correlation as a key zzso it is vital to better distinguish true neural connectivity dynamics from connectivity fluctuations that are inherently part of this zzso Our results also highlight the rich information in the power zzso of zzso data that can be used to parse brain zzso
