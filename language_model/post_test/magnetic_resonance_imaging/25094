To test the hypothesis that magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso safe and zzso zzso is associated with zzso patient survival, and zzso decreases viable zzso 

One hundred and zzso zzso laser zzso zzso zzso were performed on 35 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly zzso and zzso liver zzso zzso 

Mean overall survival was zzso months zzso zzso months, zzso zzso zzso Near real-time zzso zzso zzso maps correlated moderately with follow-up zzso MR imaging in predicting zzso zzso area zzso correlation zzso There was a significant difference in percentage enhancing zzso and zzso zzso signed ranks zzso An average of zzso of zzso was zzso by each zzso In patients with multiple liver zzso zzso zzso grew significantly less than zzso zzso zzso with zzso growth, follow-up period zzso months, zzso 

zzso guided zzso of primary and secondary liver zzso is safe, zzso and significantly decreased amount of enhancing or viable zzso zzso zzso produces a better survival in patients with zzso than would be expected in zzso patients, and has a mean survival in patients with zzso at least equal to the longest median survival in zzso zzso
