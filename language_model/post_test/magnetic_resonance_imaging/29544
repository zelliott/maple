zzso series of patients with idiopathic zzso with zzso zzso 

The purpose of this study is to define a specific yet sensitive set of signs and symptoms to indicate the use of zzso in patients with zzso idiopathic zzso Specifically, this study zzso defines a new diagnostic test for the presence of zzso zzso based on clinical and zzso data and then reports the properties of this test in relation to zzso as the gold zzso 

The reported prevalence of brain stem and spinal zzso abnormalities in patients with idiopathic zzso associated with zzso features varies from zzso to zzso This wide range most likely results from the fact that the samples studied are either not well defined or are zzso across zzso Because of these issues, the likelihood of zzso zzso in zzso idiopathic zzso is not zzso consequently, the decision to order an zzso is zzso A total of zzso patients coded as having idiopathic zzso were identified from our institutional zzso Of these, 72 patients had one or more zzso features: zzso zzso zzso curve, severe curve despite zzso zzso degrees ), rapidly progressive curve zzso degrees per zzso back pain, headache, or zzso abnormalities on clinical zzso All 72 patients underwent brain and spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine significant zzso of positive zzso and to define the zzso zzso 

Eleven patients zzso had abnormal findings on zzso Eight had an zzso type I zzso associated with a zzso 1 had an zzso type I zzso 1 a zzso and 1 a cervical zzso with a zzso zzso zzso was positive in 5 of 9 patients zzso with severe zzso despite zzso Twenty patients had one or more abnormal zzso zzso Of these, 8 zzso had a positive zzso while only 3 of the 52 patients zzso with a normal zzso examination (but other zzso zzso had a positive zzso The most zzso model included the variables zzso abnormalities zzso or zzso and severe curve despite zzso zzso or zzso Using this model, patients with zzso characteristics other than severe zzso or abnormal zzso zzso had a zzso probability zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso of having a positive zzso patients with abnormal zzso zzso but a zzso curve, had a zzso probability of a positive zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients with severe zzso and no zzso zzso had a zzso probability of positive zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with both a severe curve and abnormal zzso zzso had an zzso probability of positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between this test and the zzso was zzso with a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The model derived in this study indicates that the probability of zzso zzso is extremely low in most patients with idiopathic zzso with zzso zzso However, patients with severe zzso despite skeletal zzso and an abnormal zzso examination have a significant probability of zzso zzso zzso clinical efficiency will be enhanced by narrowing the indications for zzso to those patients with these risk zzso
