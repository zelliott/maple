The acute affect of voluntary muscle zzso performed by healthy volunteers was evaluated using zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso images, zzso zzso and zzso relaxation times were obtained before and after ankle zzso zzso The muscle sodium concentration was calculated from zzso images using a 40 zzso zzso standard and the measured zzso zzso Before exercise the muscle sodium concentration was zzso zzso wet zzso This agrees closely with literature values, suggesting that muscle zzso is fully zzso zzso The zzso image intensity increased by zzso in the exercised muscle and diminished with a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, did not show any significant change in muscle signal intensity following exercise, but the relative contribution of the slow zzso component zzso The calculated sodium concentration also did not change significantly after the zzso We therefore zzso that the changes in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso were due to a change in zzso interaction rather than a change in tissue sodium zzso We believe that this report represents the first study of zzso zzso of skeletal zzso
