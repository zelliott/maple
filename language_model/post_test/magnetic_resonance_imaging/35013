The anatomy and functional importance of the zzso zzso joint zzso have rarely been zzso Specifically, the detailed zzso basis and zzso findings of the communication between the zzso zzso and the knee have not been defined in the zzso To investigate such communication, zzso and zzso correlation with zzso findings in frozen specimens and zzso of embalmed specimens was used in the zzso 

Twelve frozen knees were studied on MR zzso MR images of each zzso were compared with zzso slices and zzso sample zzso zzso of an additional 28 embalmed specimens was performed to further investigate communication and the anatomy of the zzso zzso 

Communication between the zzso zzso and the knee was observed in zzso of all zzso zzso It occurred via the zzso recess and was related to a zzso in the zzso ligament of the zzso head in all zzso Evidence of an injury was apparent on MR images and was proven on zzso examination in zzso of the zzso specimens that had such zzso 

The frequency of the communication between the zzso zzso and knee via the zzso recess related to a zzso in the zzso ligament of the zzso head was found to be zzso Evidence of an injury was present in zzso of zzso specimens that had such zzso zzso to the zzso ligament of the zzso head and instability of the zzso zzso may accompany a variety of knee zzso zzso of the detailed zzso appearance and zzso characteristics of the structures related to the zzso zzso is key to identifying injuries to these zzso
