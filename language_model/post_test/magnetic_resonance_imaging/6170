We repeatedly measured the zzso bone zzso zzso of the zzso radius in 5 healthy volunteers using a compact magnetic resonance zzso imaging system to evaluate the zzso of the zzso structural zzso The compact system was specially developed with a zzso permanent magnet for the zzso radius in a previous zzso We measured the zzso radius using a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso number of zzso field of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso zzso zzso zzso 150 zzso zzso 500 zzso and analyzed the acquired image zzso using the virtual bone biopsy system developed by the University of zzso Root mean squares of the zzso of zzso expressed as percentages ranged from zzso to zzso for the zzso structural zzso zzso we concluded that this compact MR imaging system could be used to assess zzso zzso of the zzso radius and provide results consistent with those using a zzso MR imaging system and showing the promise of this system for evaluating bone quality in clinical zzso
