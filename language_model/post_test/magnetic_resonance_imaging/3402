We reported previously that sustained release zzso zzso showed zzso drug release without being affected by pH zzso To understand drug release mechanisms more fully, we monitored the swelling and erosion of zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso Three different types of zzso comprised of zzso zzso materials and a zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso images of the zzso zzso were acquired at zzso Furthermore, apparent zzso zzso maps were generated from zzso imaging to evaluate the state of zzso zzso Our findings indicated that water penetration into zzso complex zzso was faster than that into zzso zzso zzso In zzso complex zzso water molecules were dispersed zzso and their zzso was relatively high, whereas in zzso zzso zzso water zzso movement was tightly restricted within the zzso An optimal tablet zzso determined in a previous study had water zzso penetration and zzso properties that appeared intermediate to those of zzso complex and zzso zzso zzso water molecules were capable of penetrating throughout the zzso and relatively high zzso was similar to that in the zzso complex zzso whereas like the zzso zzso zzso it was well zzso This study succeeded in characterizing the tablet zzso zzso zzso provides profound insight into the state of water molecules in zzso zzso thus, it is a useful tool for understanding drug release mechanisms at a molecular zzso
