A high zzso zzso zzso zzso system was created to allow transmission imaging of thick zzso with spectral zzso for parallel source zzso The design was created to maximize tissue penetration through up to 10 zzso of zzso allowing eventual use in human zzso Eight zzso laser zzso zzso are used in parallel with zzso zzso shifts in their zzso zzso zzso detection is achieved with eight zzso zzso zzso that were synchronized to detect the zzso and decode their source locations from the zzso zzso and dynamic imaging is demonstrated through a 64 zzso zzso zzso with acquisition rates up to 20 frames per zzso Imaging of zzso zzso changes through a 72 zzso phantom was demonstrated with a zzso zzso varying object having only zzso effect upon the transmitted zzso This subtle signal change was used to show that while reconstructing the signal changes in a tissue may not be possible, zzso recovery of the zzso change in broad regions of tissue was zzso The ability to image thick tissue and the capacity to image periodic changes in zzso makes this design well suited for tracking thick tissue zzso in zzso during MR or CT zzso
