It is current dogma that zzso in primary visual zzso extract local edges from the scene, from which later visual areas reconstruct more meaningful zzso In intermediate areas, such as area zzso responses are driven by features more complex than local oriented edges but more basic than meaningful zzso The present study was motivated by the proposal that concentric zzso shape processing is an important aspect of intermediate shape processing and is proposed to occur in area zzso However, previous studies are not able to discriminate between the number of zzso within the image nor how these zzso vary across space zzso zzso contrast or zzso as opposed to concentric shape processing per zzso We address the question whether zzso responses are driven by zzso or zzso We use zzso and tightly controlled zzso stimuli with identical local and global zzso These patterns either form random or circular patterns with tightly matched orientation zzso and therefore similar zzso We find stronger responses to circular patterns in areas zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso circular shape is an important step in intermediate shape zzso
