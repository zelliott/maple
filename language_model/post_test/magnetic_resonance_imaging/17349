The objective of this article is to describe the clinical, zzso and molecular genetic features of a new intermediate form of free zzso storage zzso Free zzso storage disease is a rare zzso zzso zzso disorder that results from zzso in zzso a gene that codes for zzso a zzso membrane zzso acid transporting zzso zzso zzso acid storage disease has a severe zzso and zzso disease zzso zzso is generally milder in zzso intermediate forms have also been zzso There have been few reports of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the zzso acid storage disorders; zzso has been the characteristic finding, along with zzso of the corpus zzso An zzso zzso child presented with zzso and global zzso zzso zzso zzso with magnetic resonance zzso at 9 and 16 months revealed severe zzso and zzso of the corpus zzso There was mild zzso of urinary zzso acid zzso times above zzso zzso zzso of a skin biopsy showed zzso enlargement with zzso storage, and zzso molecular genetic testing revealed compound zzso for two new zzso zzso Free zzso storage disease of the intermediate type is an important part of the differential diagnosis of a zzso delayed child with abnormal white matter on zzso Intermediate types of free zzso acid overlap in zzso with infantile zzso acid storage disease and the milder zzso disease and thus might be more difficult to identify zzso the lack of Finnish ethnicity should not zzso testing for this probably zzso zzso zzso abnormalities appear to be characteristic of the entire zzso zzso
