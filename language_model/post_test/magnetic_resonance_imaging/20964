zzso zzso are a leading cause of death in women zzso Standard treatment for many primary and zzso zzso cancer cases includes zzso radiation followed by zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging is beneficial in diagnostic zzso in mapping the tumor location to tailor radiation dose and in monitoring the tumor response to zzso zzso studies of MR guidance in zzso zzso demonstrate the ability to zzso tumor coverage and reduce radiation dose to normal zzso resulting in improved outcomes for zzso In this article, we describe a methodology to aid zzso placement and treatment planning for 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso that was developed specifically for zzso zzso This methodology has been used in 18 cases from September 2011 to May 2012 in the Advanced zzso Image zzso zzso zzso suite at Brigham and Women's zzso zzso comprises state-of-the-art tools for MR imaging, image analysis and treatment zzso An MR sequence using three-dimensional zzso zzso free zzso in a zzso MR scanner was identified as the best sequence for zzso identification with zzso artifact at the zzso zzso treatment planning was performed using MR zzso Items in development include software designed to support virtual needle trajectory planning that uses zzso bias zzso zzso zzso and image registration zzso The results demonstrate that zzso MR image guidance has a role in zzso zzso These novel developments have the potential to improve targeted treatment to the tumor while sparing the normal zzso
