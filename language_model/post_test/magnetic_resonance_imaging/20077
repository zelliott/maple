To zzso investigate whether zzso changes in zzso white matter zzso and zzso gray matter zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso are global or regional and their relationship to disease zzso 

The institutional ethics review board approved study; written informed consent was zzso zzso zzso maps were obtained in 67 patients with zzso and 24 healthy control subjects with three-dimensional fast zzso shot flip zzso method, with correction for zzso zzso Analysis of zzso was performed on zzso zzso parameters of global zzso zzso and zzso Regional mean zzso values were analyzed with a zzso zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis was performed to investigate associations with clinical disability and overall zzso For patients, zzso zzso load was zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso had significantly higher peak positions for patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 36 in secondary progressive zzso zzso than for control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso and were significantly broader and lower (all P zzso zzso zzso for cortical zzso zzso were significantly shifted zzso positions, zzso zzso zzso 44 in control subjects and zzso zzso zzso 62 in patients with SP zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peak positions were significantly higher in SP zzso than in zzso zzso and primary progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso In SP disease, at least zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of cortical zzso zzso were zzso In zzso zzso was significantly elevated in all zzso zzso and cortical zzso zzso regions (all P zzso zzso but was elevated only in the zzso in deep zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peak position was associated with clinical zzso zzso zzso load was zzso 

zzso suggest that a global disease process affects large parts of both zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and effects are worse for SP zzso than for zzso zzso
