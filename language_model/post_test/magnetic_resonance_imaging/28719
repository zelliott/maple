The objectives of the present study was to correlate the segmented magnetic resonance imaging zzso volumes of zzso zzso fluid zzso spaces zzso the extent of brain zzso and cerebral plaques with the neurological disability in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso Earlier studies have mainly correlated zzso plaques and neurological disability measured by expanded disability status scale zzso The data on the association between brain zzso and zzso or regional functional scoring scale zzso are very zzso We measured the volumes of zzso zzso spaces in 28 patients with secondary progressive zzso using zzso and semiautomatic zzso zzso The volumes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso plaques were also zzso In multiple zzso analysis, increasing volumes of total zzso and relative zzso zzso zzso spaces were significantly associated with worsening neurological disability as expressed by zzso No associations were found between these zzso zzso space volumes and total zzso zzso The mean volume of zzso plaques showed a tendency to associate with total zzso score zzso zzso but no correlations were detected between zzso or zzso plaque volumes and zzso The application of a new zzso technique in zzso zzso zzso fluid spaces allowed an exact and sensitive way of assessing brain zzso The associations between brain zzso and neurological disability expressed by zzso suggests that the effect of zzso therapies should be evaluated by measurement of brain zzso
