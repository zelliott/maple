zzso is a major regulator of structural brain zzso which may occur following cortical zzso in zzso In this study we used zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to evaluate zzso zzso in zzso structures following cortical zzso in children with intractable zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso nucleus was evaluated zzso zzso months following zzso in 19 children zzso age: zzso zzso with a previous cortical zzso due to intractable zzso Ten children with partial zzso but without zzso and seven normal children served as zzso 

There was an increased zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso to the zzso as compared to the zzso side zzso zzso zzso and the zzso were significantly higher than those measured in the control groups zzso zzso asymmetry zzso in the zzso nucleus correlated zzso with zzso time zzso zzso but not with age zzso or the extent of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso were not different among the three groups zzso 

zzso zzso results in a sustained increase of zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus, suggesting increased zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso may play a role in the functional reorganization of zzso projections in zzso
