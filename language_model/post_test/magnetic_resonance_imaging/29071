zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso based on zzso zzso mapping has attracted much attention zzso The contrasts in the zzso zzso maps are usually too low to allow direct image zzso In this study, an image registration strategy has been proposed for zzso zzso data sets acquired for dynamic zzso zzso We performed image registration of the zzso images before the calculation of the zzso zzso maps using two different zzso One is to perform separate image registration on each echo and the other is to use the same motion correction parameters extracted from the second echo for all the zzso Both strategies increase the number of activated zzso and reduce the effective noise zzso The results also indicate that, for a zzso zzso image data set, it is slightly preferable to use the second echo for direct image registration and then apply the same motion correction parameters to the first echo zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
