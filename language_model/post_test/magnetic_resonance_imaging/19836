There are limited data addressing the question of sex differences in zzso cerebral zzso This study examined whether zzso blood zzso zzso zzso signal change measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso demonstrated sex differences, under conditions of equivalent pain zzso zzso healthy volunteers (17 women, 11 zzso were subject to a zzso scan while noxious heat stimuli were applied to the zzso of the left zzso zzso zzso signal zzso was observed in several zzso processing regions of interest zzso in all zzso There were no sex differences in the spatial extent of zzso signal change for any zzso but the signal zzso was lower for women in most zzso and significantly so for the primary zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso cortex, and the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso The zzso signal response could be positive or negative, and zzso both zzso were observed within a single zzso In most zzso women show zzso more zzso with negative signal change than men, and this difference was statistically significant for the zzso and the zzso The time course of the negative signal change was very similar to that of the positive signal change, suggesting that the latter was not zzso the zzso The location of negative and positive clusters formed distinct patterns in several of the zzso and these patterns suggest something other than a local zzso phenomenon as an explanation for the negative signal zzso Sex differences in baseline cerebral blood flow may contribute to the zzso signal differences observed in this zzso
