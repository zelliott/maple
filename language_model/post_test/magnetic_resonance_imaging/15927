zzso of the apparent zzso relaxation time zzso were collected on a zzso plane across the zzso zzso in 54 healthy subjects at zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso We attempted to zzso the zzso iron concentration zzso in various brain regions in zzso based on the linear relationship between the apparent relaxation rate constant zzso zzso zzso and regional zzso as demonstrated previously in 12 zzso The calculated zzso in five gray matter zzso regions agreed well with the previously reported regional iron distribution as well as reproduced its zzso zzso In particular, a decrease of iron in the zzso region in subjects over 30 years of age was demonstrated while an upward trend was shown in other zzso Furthermore, the average zzso in each zzso region in subjects over 30 years of age showed a zzso from the zzso line with zzso in an identical manner to that obtained in the previous 12 zzso This strongly suggests that there is a systematic regional factor affecting zzso in addition to zzso zzso difference in the zzso mass fraction zzso explained this systematic zzso zzso When accounting for zzso in the analysis, the apparent zzso relaxation rate seems to give a significantly better zzso of regional zzso
