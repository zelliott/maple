We studied MR fluid attenuated inversion recovery zzso pulse sequences in 37 cases with zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso sequence suppressed the zzso signal and produced very heavy zzso weighted zzso This has been of particular benefit in identifying zzso at the margins of the brain, around the zzso zzso in the brain stem and at the zzso matter zzso Based on these findings, we were able to detect the zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to be demonstrated as high signal intensity on zzso sequences in all zzso Clear zzso of acute zzso zzso was able to be obtained by MR zzso sequences in not only zzso group 3 or 4, but also zzso group zzso zzso it was suited for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso it was useful for detecting zzso zzso zzso if patients suffering from zzso zzso present slight headache or zzso symptoms, sometimes it may be more suitable to perform zzso zzso pulse sequences zzso zzso were found in 21 cases zzso When the zzso size is more than 7 zzso the rate of detection becomes zzso zzso present various MR appearances because of flow zzso zzso were demonstrated as low signal intensity except in 3 zzso In one out of 3 cases, zzso were revealed as high signal intensity and in the other two cases, it was revealed as mixed signal zzso According to the previous studies, rapid flow was demonstrated as low signal intensity by vascular flow zzso and delayed flow was demonstrated as high or mixed signal intensity by flow related enhancement and even echo zzso MR clearly zzso the size, the zzso the flow, and the zzso location of zzso In conclusion, MR zzso pulse sequences could be reliable and useful for diagnosis of zzso zzso especially as screening tests for zzso
