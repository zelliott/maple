zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso has recently been proposed to offer valuable information in assessing the functionality of zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso and zzso imaging are important in the zzso examination of zzso concentration in zzso zzso this investigation presents an automated zzso image registration zzso based on a new similarity zzso This similarity metric combines anatomical features that are characterized by specific zzso the mean count per zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and the distribution of image intensity that is characterized by zzso mutual information zzso A zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso algorithm, is also presented for zzso zzso Clinical zzso data from 18 healthy subjects and 13 Parkinson's disease zzso patients are involved to validate the performance of the proposed zzso An appropriate color map, such as zzso for image display enables the zzso zzso zzso zzso to provide clinically meaningful visual zzso The proposed registration scheme reduces target registration error from zzso zzso for conventional registration zzso based on zzso to approximately 4 zzso The error in the zzso zzso binding ratio, which is employed as a quantitative measure of zzso zzso zzso is also reduced from zzso to zzso among healthy subjects and from zzso to zzso among zzso zzso
