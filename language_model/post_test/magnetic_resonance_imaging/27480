zzso imaging is a critical part of the study of developing zzso particularly in the context of zzso of gene expression in genetically modified zzso However, in zzso animals, such as mice, the inability to accurately identify individual zzso in zzso is a major obstacle to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso spin labeling zzso was adopted here to determine the fetal order along the zzso horns in zzso based on the specific pattern of dual zzso blood supply within the mouse zzso zzso Blood enters the mouse zzso zzso through the zzso artery and zzso through the zzso zzso zzso slices were alternately placed on the maternal heart or on the zzso point of the common zzso artery, thereby zzso either downward inflow via the zzso arteries or upward inflow via the zzso zzso zzso zzso maps provided a unique signature with highly significant correlation between the zzso zzso transfer and the position of the zzso along the zzso zzso The zzso zzso spin zzso method reported here opens possibilities to determine and pursue zzso zzso in fetuses and zzso in zzso studies of transgenic and knockout mice models, and for studying defects in zzso vascular zzso
