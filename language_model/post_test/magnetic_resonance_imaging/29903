We describe clinical and muscle magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in 11 cases (three familial and eight zzso with the form of spinal muscular zzso zzso by zzso involvement of the lower limbs with weakness of the zzso and zzso muscles and marked zzso of the zzso leg and foot zzso All patients presented at birth with zzso which were in extension in seven of the zzso zzso muscle and function were preserved and lower limbs appeared to be disproportionately shorter compared to trunk and upper zzso zzso abilities were markedly affected and only one of the 11 is able to walk independently for long zzso while six require support of zzso and two use zzso for zzso One child lost zzso following a zzso The course of the disease is relatively stable and the progression of disability appeared to be related mostly to increased zzso rather than to loss of muscle zzso Respiratory and cardiac function were well zzso A zzso disorder was suggested by zzso and/or muscle biopsy in all patients, while motor nerve zzso was consistently zzso Muscle zzso of the zzso revealed diffuse zzso appearance with relative zzso of the zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso studies excluded the involvement of the survival motor zzso gene but none of these families was sufficiently zzso to study linkage to the locus on zzso zzso previously found to be involved in patients with similar zzso In our experience this form of spinal muscular zzso affecting predominantly the lower limbs is a relatively common form and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infants with zzso and weakness in the lower zzso The identical clinical and imaging features of the sporadic and familial cases suggest that these cases are likely to be affected by the same zzso
