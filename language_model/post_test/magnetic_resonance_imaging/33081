zzso zzso recording and stimulation can provide unique knowledge about functional brain anatomy in patients undergoing brain zzso This approach is commonly used in the treatment of medically zzso zzso However, it can be very difficult to integrate the results of cortical recordings with other brain mapping zzso particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The ability to integrate imaging and zzso information with simultaneous zzso zzso zzso and zzso could offer significant insight for cognitive and systems zzso as well as for clinical zzso particularly for patients with zzso or functional zzso However, standard zzso zzso cause significant artifact in zzso images, and concerns about risks such as cortical heating have generally precluded obtaining zzso in patients with implanted zzso We propose an zzso set based on zzso thick film organic zzso zzso an organic zzso flexible and zzso zzso grid for zzso zzso These new types of zzso transparent zzso zzso are based on zzso ink technology that builds on our earlier development of an zzso zzso set for scalp zzso The development of zzso zzso zzso with a very thin profile could allow functional mapping at the individual subject level of the underlying feedback and feed forward zzso The thin flexible zzso would allow the zzso to zzso contact the convoluted brain zzso Performance properties of the zzso were assessed by zzso zzso finite difference time domain zzso simulations, zzso recording, and injecting currents using standard zzso stimulation in zzso In contrast to the large artifacts exhibited with standard zzso sets, the zzso exhibited no artifact due to the reduced amount of metal and zzso of the zzso ink and had similar electrical properties to a standard zzso zzso zzso The enhanced image quality could enable routine zzso exams of patients with zzso zzso zzso and could also lead to chronic zzso zzso
