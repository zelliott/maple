Loss of pancreatic beta cell mass and function leads to the development of diabetes zzso Currently there is no technical way to zzso image zzso function and zzso zzso models suggest that zzso are highly zzso zzso that make a significant contribution to the total pancreatic blood zzso The current study was undertaken to test with zzso spin zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging if zzso mass and/or stimulation of human pancreatic zzso by zzso can zzso increase zzso zzso thereby distinguishing zzso from type 1 diabetic zzso 

We assessed pancreatic blood flow using zzso at zzso during a zzso clamp study zzso at 11 zzso and during recovery to zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers and seven type 1 diabetic patients were zzso In healthy volunteers we observed no change in pancreatic blood flow during the three zzso of the zzso A trend for an increase in blood flow was observed in the two control zzso the liver and zzso Similarly, there was no significant difference in blood flow during the three stages zzso zzso and zzso in diabetic patients and there was no significant difference observed between diabetic patients and normal zzso 

Our data suggest that in humans neither increased demand nor zzso mass has a substantial influence on pancreatic zzso It is possible, however, that the current zzso art imaging technology employed in this study might not be sensitive enough to distinguish between a true effect and zzso
