The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of cardiac magnetic resonance zzso first pass zzso zzso measures of absolute zzso blood flow zzso with a zzso magnet and compare these measures with zzso zzso at zzso with absolute zzso by labeled zzso as the gold zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso imaging can zzso zzso but images are of low signal at conventional magnetic field strength due to the need for rapid zzso 

A pig model was used to alter zzso in a coronary artery during zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso This produces an active zone with a range of zzso and a control zzso zzso were injected into the left atrium with concurrent reference zzso zzso MR zzso imaging was performed at zzso zzso zzso 9) or zzso zzso zzso 8) with a zzso zzso echo sequence in zzso slices during a zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fermi function zzso was performed on active and control region of interest from zzso slices with an zzso input function derived from the left zzso zzso These MR values of zzso were matched to zzso values obtained from zzso slices at zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and control zone zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The correlation of MR zzso zzso with zzso was close for both field strengths: zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso confidence limits of agreement were slightly zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso zzso image characteristics were better at zzso zzso and contrast enhancement were both superior at zzso In zzso zones where zzso zzso zzso the correlation with zzso was closer at zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso r zzso zzso at zzso 

Absolute zzso by zzso zzso imaging is accurate at both zzso and zzso Signal quality is better at zzso which might zzso a benefit for zzso zzso in zzso zzso
