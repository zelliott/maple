zzso imaging studies using emotional stimuli have suggested a role for the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, the neural zzso of late-life depression zzso a highly prevalent but zzso clinical entity in which age-related brain changes might influence disease mechanisms, have not been studied in great zzso With an emotional evaluation task, we conducted a zzso study of zzso functioning in a homogeneous sample of elderly zzso zzso female zzso with isolated, first diagnosed mild to moderate depressive zzso 

zzso responses of the zzso to the emotional evaluation of positive, negative, and neutral words were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy older subjects zzso zzso zzso All patients were zzso after approximately 7 zzso 

Although there were no performance differences, compared with healthy volunteers, zzso patients showed a decreased response to negative compared with positive stimuli in the zzso This altered pattern was positively correlated with symptom zzso At zzso the attenuated neural response in the zzso had zzso accompanied by a significant improvement in zzso 

These findings indicate zzso dysfunction as a biological state marker of geriatric zzso Furthermore, our data underline the pathological significance of mild to moderate zzso and highlight the usefulness of functional zzso for evaluating zzso processes in this specific depression zzso
