A novel zzso zzso has been proposed for the zzso operation with promising initial zzso However, previous studies have relied either on idealized models or a single zzso zzso The objective of this study is to zzso compare the zzso performance and zzso blood flow distribution of the zzso zzso zzso with 2 current designs using multiple zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were virtually implanted into 5 zzso Glenn models forming 3 types of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso flow simulations were performed at rest and at varying exercise zzso The zzso flow distribution between the right and left lungs was carefully zzso using a particle tracking zzso Other zzso relevant parameters such as energy zzso superior zzso zzso pressure, and wall zzso stress were zzso 

The zzso geometry significantly influences the zzso flow zzso The zzso design improves the zzso flow distribution effectively in 4 of 5 patients, whereas the zzso and offset designs may skew as much as zzso of zzso flow to 1 lung in 2 zzso zzso studies show that changes in pulmonary flow split can affect the zzso flow distribution dramatically but that some zzso and zzso designs are relatively less sensitive than offset zzso The zzso design offers moderate improvements over the traditional designs in power loss and superior zzso zzso pressure in all zzso 

The zzso zzso design achieves overall superior zzso performance compared with traditional zzso However, the results emphasize that no one-size-fits-all solution is available that will universally benefit all patients and that designs should be customized for individual patients before clinical zzso
