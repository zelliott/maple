The sex disparity in the development of depression has long been an important research topic, but the sex-related differences in neural activity during emotion regulation have been less thoroughly zzso It was hypothesized that, during the regulation of emotion, there would be more zzso in the prefrontal regions implicated in cognitive processing for zzso while there would be more zzso in the prefrontal regions implicated in affective processing for zzso This zzso study recruited 12 females and 12 males who were required to view or to regulate the negative and positive emotion induced by some zzso zzso During the regulation of negative emotion, both males and females had stronger zzso in the left anterior zzso zzso but males showed more zzso in the prefrontal regions in general, including the left zzso and lateral zzso zzso as well as the right anterior zzso zzso while females only showed stronger zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso For the regulation of positive emotion, both males and females showed stronger zzso in the left zzso prefrontal zzso but males were found to also have stronger activity in the left lateral zzso zzso It was concluded that there are common as well as zzso sets of brain regions involved in regulating negative and positive emotion, and the findings may have significant implications for zzso vulnerability to developing zzso
