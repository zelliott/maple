zzso depends on precise placement of the stimulating zzso into an appropriate target zzso zzso zzso targeting has been limited by the ability of current technology to zzso zzso zzso We have recently developed and employed a Fast Gray Matter Acquisition zzso zzso Recovery zzso zzso zzso sequence to more reliably zzso these zzso The zzso provides significantly better high resolution thin (1 zzso slice zzso of zzso targets than does either standard zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso image revealed relatively poor contrast among the targets for zzso though the sequence did allow zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso scans demonstrated better contrast between the zzso zzso red nucleus zzso and zzso zzso The zzso scans allowed for zzso of the thalamus, zzso zzso RN, and zzso and displayed sharper zzso of these zzso The zzso also revealed features not visible on other scan zzso the internal zzso of the zzso fiber zzso from the internal capsule piercing the zzso and the boundaries of the zzso We hope that use of the zzso to aid initial targeting will translate in future studies to faster and more accurate procedures with zzso improvements in clinical zzso
