While functional MR imaging and other techniques have contributed to our knowledge of functional brain zzso these methods have not been extensively applied to the complex and incompletely understood task of zzso We used functional MR imaging to investigate motor zzso activity during swallowing in healthy human zzso 

Eight subjects were zzso on a zzso MR system using blood oxygen zzso contrast zzso zzso performed three swallowing tasks and a zzso zzso Areas of zzso in the zzso and zzso areas were zzso and a zzso index, defined as zzso zzso zzso left - zzso zzso left + zzso zzso zzso 100, was zzso for the three zzso 

zzso was observed in the primary motor and sensory zzso motor processing and association areas, and zzso zzso This activity was dominant for one zzso with left zzso dominance more prevalent among the zzso Right zzso dominance, however, showed stronger zzso than the left zzso 

Our data indicate that specific sites in the motor zzso and other cortical and zzso areas are activated with swallowing tasks and that zzso dominance is a feature of swallowing under these zzso In addition, we demonstrate the utility of functional MR imaging in the study of the cortical representation of swallowing and suggest a role for functional MR imaging in the diagnosis of zzso of cerebral zzso
