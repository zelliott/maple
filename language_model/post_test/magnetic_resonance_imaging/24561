In this paper, zzso zzso abnormalities in zzso Spin zzso zzso were identified by comparing a single patient to a group of healthy controls using a zzso zzso General Linear Model zzso Two approaches are currently in use to solve zzso zzso zzso the zzso approach assumes homogeneous zzso across subjects and zzso the zzso approach is theoretically more efficient in the presence of zzso zzso but zzso more zzso In practice, in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, the superiority of the zzso approach is still under zzso Due to the low zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso have a significant impact on the estimated zzso maps and the zzso model might be better suited in this zzso In this paper we studied how the zzso and zzso approaches behave in terms of specificity and sensitivity in the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was undertaken on a zzso of 25 patients diagnosed with brain tumors and 36 healthy zzso We showed evidence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and pointed out an increased false positive rate of the zzso zzso In the detection of zzso brain zzso abnormalities with zzso modeling zzso zzso increases the sensitivity at the same specificity zzso
