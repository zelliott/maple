With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging zzso it is possible to obtain high-resolution anatomical images of the monkey zzso zzso however, is lost in the laboratory or surgical setting when the zzso of brain structures depends on zzso tracking zzso Here we present an zzso zzso system that is able to zzso and access anatomical brain structures using the monkey's zzso This system, which is also known as zzso zzso is capable of computing the relation of the physical zzso zzso of the monkey's head to the corresponding image space, while a position sensor enables the tracking of the zzso head and the zzso of brain areas and favorable paths to targets within the brain using real time display zzso zzso procedures make use of an adjustable upright chair and a surgical zzso instead of the traditional restrictive head holder with ear zzso This novel system allows for the flexible positioning of the animal and the ability to reach areas of the brain that were difficult to access in the zzso The zzso also serves as a tool holder, which in the present application guided a zzso of retrograde zzso to the desired location in the frontal zzso zzso examination of the brain showed that the injection reached the target site, and tests using an zzso compatible phantom demonstrated that the precision of the system in bringing an injection to target is less than zzso zzso This system can be used to inject accurately zzso for anatomical zzso to make precise zzso and to position zzso for zzso zzso
