To assess whether measuring the pattern of pancreatic enhancement on zzso zzso dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso is helpful for diagnosis of suspected early or mild chronic zzso 

In this retrospective study, 24 patients with suspected early or mild chronic zzso classified by imaging criteria of zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso had dynamic zzso that included zzso zzso dominant, early zzso and late zzso zzso of contrast zzso Twenty patients without pancreatic diseases also had the dynamic sequence as a control zzso The signal intensity was measured at the pancreatic head, body, and tail on all zzso and for each, the signal intensity ratio zzso the signal intensity in zzso divided by that in zzso was zzso Two zzso independently reviewed the images of the patients with suspected early or mild chronic zzso for pancreatic zzso abnormalities without knowing the results of signal intensity zzso 

On zzso images, there was no significant difference of signal intensity between control and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, but not in the control group, the zzso signal intensity of the pancreatic head and body were significantly higher than that of the tail zzso zzso zzso In the control group, the greatest enhancement zzso zzso after injection was in the zzso phase zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than that in the early zzso phase zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and in the late zzso phase zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso group, however, had an zzso phase zzso zzso zzso zzso that was significantly lower than its early zzso phase zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and lower than the zzso phase zzso of the control group zzso zzso zzso The presence of an zzso less than zzso in the zzso phase and/or a delayed peak enhancement after contrast agent administration had a sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing early or mild chronic zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This sensitivity was significantly higher than the sensitivity of 50% for diagnosis based on zzso abnormalities zzso zzso zzso 

zzso pancreatic signal intensity on zzso zzso dynamic zzso is helpful for diagnosing early or mild chronic zzso especially before apparent pancreatic zzso or signal intensity changes are zzso
