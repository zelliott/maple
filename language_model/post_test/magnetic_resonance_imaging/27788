In this study, we analyzed the correlations between hip zzso zzso sprint performance, zzso zzso zzso and the zzso area zzso of the zzso muscle zzso Ten young adults performed two sprint tests and zzso tests to determine hip zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to determine zzso and PM zzso There were correlations between hip zzso power, sprint performance, and PM zzso but zzso showed no correlation with any zzso The impact of hip zzso power and zzso on sprint stride pattern efficiency was zzso zzso zzso might not have a simple role in the passive knee replacement of the stride zzso instead, it may be an active zzso Other investigations are needed to determine the influence of pelvic architecture on sprint zzso
