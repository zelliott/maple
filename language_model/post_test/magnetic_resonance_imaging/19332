Recent studies have reported the clinical improvement in patients with AIDS treated with a combination of zzso zzso The purpose of our study was to describe the effects of highly active zzso therapy on MR images in patients with zzso zzso and to compare the clinical course with follow-up zzso zzso 

zzso and follow-up MR imaging findings are described in four patients with AIDS zzso complex at baseline and after zzso therapy, and correlated with clinical and zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging revealed white matter signal abnormalities on zzso images without mass effect and without enhancement on zzso images, consistent with zzso zzso zzso were located in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in two zzso All four patients showed progression of white matter disease on the first follow-up MR scan zzso 6 zzso On subsequent scans, zzso was seen in three patients and stabilization of white matter disease was observed in one zzso zzso in zzso count and decreases in viral load below the limit of zzso were present in all zzso 

Although our patient population was small, the results suggest that disease zzso in patients with AIDS zzso complex after treatment with highly active zzso therapy can be characterized and monitored by MR zzso
