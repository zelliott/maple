To examine changes in the zzso brain zzso profiles associated with successful completion of an intensive intervention program in individual dyslexic zzso 

The authors obtained magnetic source imaging scans during a zzso reading task from eight children (7 to 17 years old) before and after 80 hours of intensive remedial zzso All children were initially diagnosed with zzso marked by severe difficulties in word recognition and zzso zzso Eight children who never experienced reading problems were also tested on two occasions separated by a zzso zzso 

Before intervention, all children with zzso showed distinctly zzso zzso profiles featuring little or no zzso of the zzso portion of the superior zzso zzso zzso an area normally involved in zzso processing, and increased zzso of the corresponding right zzso zzso After intervention that produced significant improvement in reading skills, activity in the left zzso increased by several orders of magnitude in every zzso No systematic changes were obtained in the zzso profiles of the children without zzso as a function of zzso 

These findings suggest that the deficit in functional brain organization underlying zzso can be reversed after sufficiently intense intervention lasting as little as 2 months, and are consistent with current proposals that reading difficulties in many children represent a variation of normal development that can be altered by intensive zzso
