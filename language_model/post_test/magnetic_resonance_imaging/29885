A new magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agent designed to mimic zzso Lewis X zzso and to target inflammation has been zzso and zzso The evolution of its zzso zzso zzso as a function of the magnetic field zzso and temperature has been zzso The exchange rate of the water coordinated to the metal has been assessed by zzso zzso The zzso by zzso zzso and the zzso binding to human serum zzso have been zzso The results show no limitation by the residence time of the coordinated water zzso above room temperature, a higher stability of the complex versus zzso by zzso zzso than a parent complex, the clinically used zzso and negligible interaction with human serum zzso
