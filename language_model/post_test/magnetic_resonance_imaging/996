To examine the brain zzso involved in emotional experience and determine whether the cerebral zzso are specialized for positive and negative emotional zzso 

Recent research has provided a preliminary sketch of the zzso zzso of emotional processing involving specialized contributions of zzso and cortical brain zzso zzso functional imaging, and Wada test data have suggested positive, zzso emotions are associated with left cerebral zzso regions, whereas negative, zzso emotions appear to be more aligned with right zzso zzso 

These zzso associations were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 10 healthy controls with 20 positively and 20 zzso zzso pictures from the International zzso Picture System in a zzso zzso Pictures were viewed within a zzso zzso scanner through computerized video zzso 

zzso pictures resulted in significantly increased blood flow zzso in the zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso regions, and zzso zzso emotional pictures resulted in greater zzso of the right hemisphere, and positive pictures caused greater zzso of the left zzso 

zzso are consistent with theories emphasizing the importance of zzso linking zzso structures with zzso zzso anterior cingulate, and frontal lobe regions in emotion and with the zzso model of emotion that zzso zzso cerebral specialization for positive and negative emotional zzso
