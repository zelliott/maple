The objectives were to study the clinical and neurological abnormalities in children with cerebral zzso and to attempt to correlate the signs with zzso abnormalities detected by CT scan and/or zzso of the zzso In a zzso zzso study, 65 children with cerebral zzso were examined zzso and their zzso history was zzso Their zzso CT zzso and/or magnetic resonance images were zzso The association between the zzso ages, zzso history, neurological deficits, and the zzso appearances were zzso Of the 24 zzso and 41 zzso children, 23 had zzso zzso 57 per cent of these children has significant zzso zzso which was more common among zzso zzso Of the 13 children with zzso 12 had unilateral zzso on zzso zzso zzso was associated with extensive, zzso diffuse brain zzso zzso cerebral zzso was far more common among zzso infants and 80 per cent of these showed significant abnormalities in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso was an uncommon variety and there was no significant correlation between neurological signs and abnormalities on brain zzso In conclusion, the zzso findings were closely related to the type of cerebral zzso and the neurological deficit except in the zzso zzso We believe that CT and zzso imaging are helpful in understanding the pathology and the timing of the zzso in cerebral zzso
