The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy and sources of error in zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso MR zzso To analyze imaging data, MR signal intensity zzso were converted to concentration zzso time curves, and a zzso zzso model of the zzso system was used to analyze measured zzso zzso and zzso enhancement zzso zzso of the zzso estimates was evaluated by sensitivity analysis and by zzso Carlo analyses of model solutions to which random noise had been zzso The dominant sensitivity of the zzso enhancement curve to zzso zzso zzso after zzso injection was supported by a low zzso of variation in zzso zzso values zzso when measured data were subjected to zzso zzso These analyses also showed the minimal effects of zzso zzso in the zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso from MR zzso analyzed by the zzso model zzso zzso agreed well with reference zzso from zzso clearance and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso analysis showed an average difference of zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso between model and reference zzso We conclude that a zzso zzso model can be used to derive clinically useful estimates of zzso zzso from zzso MR zzso
