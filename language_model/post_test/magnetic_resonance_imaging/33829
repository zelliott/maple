zzso examination of 37 patients with zzso spinal tumors treated with zzso radiation zzso 

To propose a new technique for local control of zzso spinal zzso 

No reports of zzso radiation therapy for zzso spinal tumors have been published as of the time of this zzso 

Between December 1992 and April 1996, zzso radiation therapy was performed in 37 patients with spinal zzso In all but one patient, the spinal zzso was protected during zzso radiation therapy by a lead shield to prevent radiation zzso In addition to zzso radiation therapy, 22 of the 37 patients received external radiation therapy, either before or after their zzso Although the authors had recommended a dose of approximately 30 zzso of external radiation therapy after wound zzso removal to patients who did not receive zzso radiation therapy, the remaining 15 patients did not receive external radiation therapy, either by choice or because they received alternative zzso zzso chemotherapy for various zzso was administered to 9 of the 37 patients, including 4 of the aforementioned zzso 

All patients attained clinical improvement in pain, zzso function status, or both, with no evidence of local zzso zzso zzso developed in the one patient whose spinal zzso was not protected during zzso radiation zzso Eleven patients experienced zzso in zzso that were not surgically zzso 

zzso radiation therapy appears to achieve good zzso and may be useful for local control of spinal zzso
