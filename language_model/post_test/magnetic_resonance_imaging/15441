To determine the in zzso precision and accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in evaluating the thin zzso zzso zzso neck zzso 

zzso regions of 30 volunteers were scanned with standard zzso T zzso twice with zzso and the images of the zzso zzso were zzso Two zzso independently delineated zzso and zzso cortical zzso and several structural variables were zzso For precision, zzso limits of agreement and zzso of variation were zzso zzso was determined with zzso 

In zzso precision of the directly delineated zzso varied from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso while the precision of the calculated variables remained poorer, from zzso zzso to total area zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso error of the cortical thickness measurement was zzso zzso 

Thin cortical bone at the zzso location of the zzso neck can be delineated precisely and accurately with a standard clinical zzso T zzso zzso zzso provides a feasible tool for the assessment of mechanically important cortical bone at the zzso neck and may be of clinical utility in assessing hip zzso
