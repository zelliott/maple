To determine the frequency of early zzso deterioration with zzso expansion zzso and poor outcomes among zzso stroke patients not treated with zzso therapies because of rapidly improving or mild symptoms zzso and to study the zzso value of zzso zzso in these zzso 

We identified consecutive patients with symptoms of acute stroke undergoing zzso zzso within 6 hours of onset without evidence of zzso on zzso Medical records were reviewed for evidence of early zzso deterioration within 48 zzso All deteriorating patients had repeat zzso to ascertain causes of zzso Poor outcome was defined as a discharge modified Rankin zzso zzso score of zzso or zzso zzso 

We identified 74 patients with stroke symptoms zzso or zzso 6 hours from zzso Forty had zzso and 39 did not receive zzso therapies because of zzso Among these 39, 4 experienced zzso and 8 were discharged with zzso score of zzso or zzso zzso Eight of the 39 patients had zzso zzso on MR zzso Three of 8 patients with zzso zzso as against only one of 31 patients without zzso had zzso zzso ratio zzso 18, zzso zzso zzso to 209, p zzso zzso Four of 8 patients with zzso zzso as against 4 of 31 patients without zzso had a discharge zzso score of zzso or zzso 3 zzso 7, zzso zzso zzso to 38, p zzso zzso 

About zzso of patients eligible for acute zzso therapy excluded on the basis of mild or rapidly improving symptoms show early zzso deterioration with zzso expansion within 48 hours, and about zzso show poor outcome at zzso zzso zzso zzso substantially increases the risk of early worsening and poor functional zzso
