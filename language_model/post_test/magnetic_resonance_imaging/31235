To describe and characterize the zzso changes in zzso disorders of the zzso spine using MR zzso 

A retrospective zzso cohort study was carried out of 40 patients with two sequential zzso spine MR images at variable zzso The images were assessed for baseline presence of, new zzso of and changes in disc zzso degenerative disc disease, zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso 

The range of follow-up was zzso zzso zzso presence was: disc zzso zzso zzso degenerative disc disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Most pre-existing zzso tended to remain zzso zzso showed the most change, tending to improve in zzso New zzso was: disc zzso zzso zzso degenerative disc disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was first visible at an zzso zzso and once established almost never changed over many weeks to zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso show no change from baseline for up to 2 1/2 zzso All findings predominated in the lower zzso levels from zzso to zzso 

The most prevalent zzso spine zzso findings are zzso and zzso zzso zzso predominate in the lower segments and are a dynamic zzso zzso zzso can be rapidly evolving but tends to remain unchanged after zzso zzso zzso signal changes were an uncommon manifestation of zzso disc zzso zzso zzso showed the least change over zzso
