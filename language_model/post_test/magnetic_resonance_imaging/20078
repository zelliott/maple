To zzso determine the safety of cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging performed early zzso zzso after coronary zzso zzso in patients with acute zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso study was approved by the institutional review board; the informed consent requirement was zzso zzso patients with zzso who underwent cardiac MR imaging zzso zzso shortly after zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso were compared with control subjects who did not undergo MR imaging and were matched for clinical factors and zzso extent of coronary zzso A zzso MR zzso was used to evaluate zzso function, zzso and zzso Rates of death, nonfatal zzso zzso or zzso 30 days and 6 months after zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso 

The study group consisted of 66 patients zzso age, 56 years; 17 zzso with 97 zzso 38 zzso of which were drug zzso The control group included 124 patients zzso age, 58 years; zzso zzso with 197 zzso 21 zzso of which were drug zzso There was no significant zzso zzso zzso difference in the combined end point of death, nonfatal zzso zzso or zzso between the study zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and control zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso groups at 30-day zzso The zzso survival rate at zzso follow-up was zzso in the study group and zzso in the control group zzso zzso zzso Considering the end points zzso there was no difference in the event rate at 30-day or zzso follow-up between zzso No adverse cardiovascular events occurred in patients with zzso zzso who underwent MR zzso 

zzso MR imaging performed shortly after zzso and zzso zzso with bare metal or zzso zzso appears zzso The risk of adverse cardiovascular events is low and similar to that in patients who do not undergo MR zzso
