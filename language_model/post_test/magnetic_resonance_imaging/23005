To determine differences in size of cochlear nerves among subjects with deafness due to zzso 26 zzso zzso subjects with deafness of unknown origin, and normal hearing subjects by zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the zzso zzso 

zzso and surface areas and zzso zzso of the cochlear nerve and zzso were made on zzso images of the internal auditory canal zzso and inner ear in the 3 groups of children zzso 1, 2, and zzso zzso comparisons of in zzso cochlear nerve zzso on zzso imaging were made among 17 children with zzso hearing loss zzso and no obvious zzso for the hearing loss zzso 1), 7 children with profound zzso due to a zzso zzso zzso zzso and 10 normal hearing children zzso zzso 

Children with profound zzso of unknown cause and children with profound zzso due to a zzso zzso displayed zzso cochlear nerves as compared with normal zzso zzso imaging of the zzso bone was accurately delineated potential problems with cochlear nerves in 2 of 17 instances where high-resolution zzso zzso did not do zzso 

zzso and specific zzso of the cochlear nerve and related structures is possible on zzso imaging of the zzso zzso The size of the cochlear nerve is mildly zzso in children with profound zzso of unknown causes or children with a zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging is superior to high-resolution zzso zzso in the investigation of profound zzso in zzso
