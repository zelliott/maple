We investigated the prevalence and zzso associations of cortical superficial zzso zzso in patients with probable cerebral zzso zzso zzso compared to those with zzso zzso zzso not attributed to zzso 

We conducted a retrospective zzso cohort study of 120 patients with probable zzso and 2 comparison groups: 67 patients with either single zzso zzso or mixed zzso and zzso zzso and 22 patients with strictly deep zzso We rated zzso zzso white matter changes, and cerebral zzso 

zzso was detected in 48 of 120 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso patients with probable zzso 10 of 67 zzso zzso zzso zzso with single zzso zzso or mixed zzso and 1 of 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with strictly deep zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was present in 29 of 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with probable zzso but none of the other patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso In probable zzso age zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a history of transient focal zzso episodes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were independently associated with zzso However, zzso occurred in 17 of 48 patients with probable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without chronic zzso zzso 

zzso zzso if zzso is a common and characteristic feature of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an independent risk factor for zzso but the zzso direction and mechanism of association are zzso zzso into the zzso space, independent of previous zzso zzso zzso must also contribute to zzso in zzso zzso focal zzso episodes are the strongest clinical marker of zzso
