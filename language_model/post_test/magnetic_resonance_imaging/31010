zzso zzso zzso tumors are zzso zzso of the zzso bone that are associated with von zzso zzso disease but can also occur zzso The zzso gene product zzso protein is important in the regulation of zzso zzso factor zzso which controls expression of molecules that are important in zzso and cell zzso In this study the authors examine the role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso tumors from three patients were examined using the following method: DNA from tumor tissue was isolated, amplified by zzso chain reaction and the zzso gene sequence was compared with the known zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso studies were performed to confirm the sequencing zzso zzso evaluation for zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso IX zzso zzso was zzso zzso tumor tissue was examined using Western zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Two patients had sporadic zzso tumors and the other one suffered from zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene sequencing were normal in the tissue derived from the sporadic zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso were zzso for the same zzso zzso found in the zzso carried by the patient with zzso zzso No zzso was detected in the tumor tissue obtained in the patient with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and CA IX evaluated using zzso studies was elevated in the zzso zzso Nevertheless, Western blots and zzso for zzso did not show elevated expression in these zzso 

The sporadic and zzso zzso zzso tumors in this study had normal zzso zzso zzso This is a result of normal zzso gene expression in the case of the sporadic zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso this is due to one normal copy of the zzso gene and adequate zzso gene zzso
