We aimed to demonstrate the appearances of the zzso zzso on zzso performed later than 2 years zzso zzso surgery zzso We zzso reviewed 47 patients in whom follow-up zzso scans had been performed at least 2 years zzso We specifically reviewed the clinical and imaging of those patients in whom the zzso zzso was filled with signal zzso or masses were present arising from the zzso roof and classified them as zzso or indeterminate abnormalities on imaging zzso We documented other zzso zzso Twelve of 47 patients demonstrated zzso zzso filling or zzso roof masses and in six of 12 patients it was possible to zzso them as zzso using imaging and clinical zzso The indeterminate and zzso zzso zzso abnormalities most frequently had a zzso signal similar to zzso zzso and displayed rim enhancement and thus could not be reliably distinguished from zzso zzso on the basis of signal or enhancement zzso The presence of a zzso surgical zzso in the zzso floor was associated with resolution of zzso on zzso zzso We concluded zzso findings of zzso zzso filling or zzso roof masses are present in approximately zzso of scans performed longer than 2 years zzso Half of these are of indeterminate origin and follow-up is required to discriminate zzso from zzso zzso with zzso A zzso surgical zzso in the zzso floor is, however, suggestive of a zzso zzso
