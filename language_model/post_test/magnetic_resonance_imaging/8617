Prospective zzso study of patients undergoing zzso zzso 

To zzso zzso changes of the zzso zzso following zzso surgery through a zzso approach and the possible protection of these muscles during surgery by the use of zzso zzso 

It has been shown that zzso spine surgery through a zzso approach can induce zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We have shown in a previous study that zzso changes on muscular biopsy performed in the zzso at the end of the surgical procedure were not modified by the use of zzso blockade during zzso 

Twenty patients scheduled to undergo zzso enhanced zzso zzso were enrolled in this zzso Ten patients received zzso during zzso and 10 patients did zzso zzso was obtained the day before the operation and at 6 months of follow-up on the same MR zzso zzso images were obtained in the zzso zzso The 2 slices immediately zzso and zzso to the zzso screw construct on the zzso zzso were zzso The corresponding slices were selected on the zzso zzso Each zzso zzso on the 4 slices was surrounded using a zzso zzso The zzso component of the zzso area zzso was calculated from the number of zzso surrounded and the signal intensity of each zzso 

There was only slight changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased by zzso zzso to the zzso zzso showed no efficacy in preventing muscle zzso 

zzso zzso muscle zzso mainly occur zzso to zzso zzso surgical zzso
