Large zzso duct and zzso zzso is one of the most common anomalies seen in patients with zzso zzso hearing loss zzso and is known to occur with other inner ear zzso Our purpose was to use high-resolution zzso fast zzso zzso MR imaging to describe the features and prevalence of specific anomalies that occur in association with zzso 

We zzso reviewed MR images of the inner ear obtained in 63 patients with zzso and in 60 control zzso We evaluated each image for features of cochlear and zzso zzso including zzso of the cochlear zzso gross cochlear zzso asymmetry of the cochlear zzso chambers, enlargement of the zzso zzso gross zzso zzso and zzso of the semicircular canals zzso 

zzso anomalies were present in zzso of ears with zzso zzso zzso gross zzso and zzso asymmetry were seen in zzso zzso and zzso of abnormal zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were present in zzso of ears with zzso zzso enlargement, gross zzso and distortion of the lateral SCC were seen in zzso zzso and zzso of abnormal zzso zzso 

zzso cochlear anomalies, zzso anomalies, or both are present in most ears with zzso and appear as a spectrum of zzso ranging from subtle zzso to overt zzso The presence of zzso anomalies in zzso affects treatment decisions and zzso Newer techniques of high-resolution zzso MR imaging provide a means of exquisite characterization of zzso as well as more sensitive detection of associated zzso zzso
