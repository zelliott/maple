zzso in extended, zzso or zzso operating networks is well zzso Changes in zzso activity after zzso to distinct localized structures, such as the primary visual cortex, are less well zzso We investigated the cortical reorganization in patients with zzso visual field defects using blood oxygen zzso functional zzso 

Brain zzso was measured in 7 patients with a single zzso cortical zzso and partially recovered zzso and in 7 zzso control zzso zzso in zzso between rest and visual zzso stimulation were assessed with statistical zzso mapping zzso 

In normal subjects, significant zzso was found in the zzso primary visual zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso During zzso stimulation of the unaffected side of stroke patients, a similar pattern was found compared with that seen in control zzso During stimulation of the zzso side, bilateral zzso was seen within the zzso cortex, stronger in the zzso zzso The primary visual zzso was not significantly activated in either zzso during stimulation of the zzso zzso 

Visual field defects after stroke are associated with bilateral zzso of the zzso visual zzso This pattern of zzso indicates altered zzso activity in the visual zzso Further investigation is necessary to determine the relationship between functional reorganization and recovery of lost visual function after zzso zzso
