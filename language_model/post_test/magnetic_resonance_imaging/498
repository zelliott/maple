To zzso zzso genes for zzso in brain structure associated with risk of stroke and zzso We conducted zzso linkage analyses for magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures of brain zzso zzso and zzso white matter zzso zzso in zzso zzso white zzso sibling zzso median age, 61 zzso and 544 zzso black participants zzso sibling zzso median age, 64 zzso from zzso with at least 2 members with essential zzso 

We determined brain, zzso and zzso volumes from zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso we calculated brain zzso as the difference between total zzso and brain zzso zzso markers zzso zzso zzso distributed across the 22 zzso were zzso and we used zzso components methods to estimate zzso and assess evidence of genetic linkage for each zzso zzso 

Brain zzso zzso volume, and zzso determined from zzso inversion recovery zzso 

In both races, the zzso of each zzso measure was statistically greater than 0 zzso zzso zzso ranging in magnitude from zzso (for zzso volume in zzso to zzso (for brain zzso in zzso Based on zzso zzso of odds scores zzso the strongest evidence of genetic linkage was observed for brain zzso on zzso 1 zzso zzso at 161 zzso P zzso zzso and 17 zzso zzso at 18 zzso P zzso zzso in zzso for zzso volume on zzso 12 zzso zzso at 49 zzso P zzso zzso in blacks and zzso 10 zzso zzso at 110 zzso P zzso zzso in zzso and for zzso on zzso 11 zzso zzso at 118 zzso P zzso zzso in whites and zzso 22 zzso zzso at 36 zzso P zzso zzso in zzso 

The zzso measures of structural brain injury are zzso in zzso black and white zzso zzso through zzso sibling zzso The zzso zzso for brain zzso zzso volume, and zzso identified by linkage analyses differ among zzso measures and between zzso
