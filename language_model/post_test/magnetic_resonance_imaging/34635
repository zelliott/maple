A method of using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure zzso organization within human zzso is zzso The method is based on a visual stimulus that creates a traveling wave of neural activity within zzso organized visual zzso We measured the zzso signal caused by this stimulus in visual zzso and represented the results on images of the flattened cortical zzso We used the method to locate visual areas and to evaluate the spatial precision of zzso Specifically, zzso zzso identified the borders between several zzso organized visual areas in the zzso zzso zzso zzso measured the function relating cortical position to visual field zzso within area zzso zzso localized activity to within zzso zzso of visual zzso and zzso estimated the spatial resolution of the zzso signal and found that signal zzso falls to zzso at a spatial frequency of 1 cycle per 9 zzso of visual zzso This spatial resolution is consistent with a zzso whose full zzso at half maximum spreads across zzso zzso of visual zzso
