A range of measurement techniques have been described which may be used to calculate zzso zzso zzso A zzso method involves application of a formula for the volume of an zzso sphere to three zzso axes of a zzso as measured on zzso zzso We aimed to compare this method and a second method, that of zzso parallel zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso images, to a gold zzso the volume of objects measured by water zzso We also compared these methods in volume zzso of patient zzso using zzso zzso 

Mixed zzso study and blinded zzso analysis of imaging zzso 

Large zzso zzso was noted when using the zzso formula method, which was also inaccurate when compared to the gold zzso zzso the parallel zzso method showed excellent zzso correlation and a high degree of correlation with gold standard volume zzso 

We conclude that the parallel zzso method, although a more complex and time consuming technique, is the more accurate and therefore preferred method for measuring zzso zzso zzso
