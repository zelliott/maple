zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to study the neural zzso of neutral, zzso negative and positive autobiographical zzso The brain activity produced by these different kinds of episodic memory did not differ significantly, but a common pattern of zzso for different kinds of autobiographical memory was revealed that included zzso largely bilateral portions of the zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso portions of the zzso zzso superior and zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso the anterior and zzso cingulate, including the zzso cortex, zzso the zzso cortex, and zzso portions of the zzso The brain regions that were mainly activated constituted an interactive network of zzso and prefrontal areas associated with structures of the extended zzso zzso The main bilateral zzso with zzso preponderance probably reflected zzso of complex semantic and episodic zzso information representations that included previously experienced zzso In conclusion, the earlier view of a strict left versus right prefrontal zzso in the retrieval of semantic as opposed to episodic autobiographical memory, may have to be modified by considering contextual variables such as task demands and subject zzso zzso autobiographical memory integration should be viewed as based on distributed zzso neural networks supporting zzso emotionally zzso components of personal zzso
