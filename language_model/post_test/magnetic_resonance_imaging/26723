zzso zzso zzso occurs when the auditory system restores an zzso or masked sound of zzso zzso work on auditory restoration in humans began over 50 years ago using it to model a noisy environmental scene with competing zzso It has become clear that not only humans experience auditory zzso restoration has been broadly zzso in many zzso zzso studies in humans and animals provide a necessary foundation to link the insights being obtained from human zzso and zzso to those from animal zzso The zzso of data resulting from multiple approaches across species has begun to clarify the zzso bases of auditory zzso Different types of neural responses supporting restoration have been found, supportive of multiple mechanisms working within a zzso Yet a general principle has emerged that responses correlated with restoration mimic the response that would have been given to the uninterrupted sound of zzso Using the same technology to study different species will help us to better harness animal models of zzso scene zzso to clarify the zzso neural mechanisms shaping the zzso organization of sound and to advance strategies to improve hearing in natural environmental zzso
