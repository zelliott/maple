This work demonstrates an alternative approach, termed zzso zzso zzso for generating contrast that is sensitive to zzso zzso This method leads to a calculated contrast that increases with zzso zzso zzso Experimental data demonstrate that in the presence of zzso zzso an zzso effect exists that is distinct from the zzso transfer zzso effect and is highly dependent on zzso Data show that the dependence on water diffusion becomes most significant at rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We investigated the dependence of the zzso effect on zzso frequency and particle zzso The data suggest a useful frequency offset range of 500 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1500 zzso at zzso This approach may be especially useful in zzso and diseases in which diffusion may be altered by zzso
