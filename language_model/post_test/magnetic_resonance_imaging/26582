Surgery is often the only effective treatment for intractable zzso but its benefits must be balanced by potential disruption of eloquent cortical zzso Wada test is the standard technique to zzso language before zzso however, it is invasive and associated with zzso zzso provides an attractive zzso alternative, which has been previously shown to correlate with Wada zzso However this correlation is imperfect since standard zzso zzso zzso are dependent on a particular arbitrary statistical threshold used in the data zzso We report a novel zzso zzso zzso methodology to assess language zzso which we zzso provides a robust and unbiased zzso zzso This zzso zzso analysis method can accurately interrogate language zzso as validated against the Wada zzso zzso subjects with intractable zzso received zzso evaluation for language zzso using zzso zzso data then were analyzed using a novel automated zzso method for determining language zzso The methodology generated a zzso score based on zzso zzso of language areas and a quality index based on multiple factors, including patient motion and zzso zzso zzso scores were compared to Wada test results zzso zzso direct cortical stimulation (3 zzso and zzso grid stimulation (5 zzso Data sets were used to generate a probability score for language zzso for each zzso The zzso scores correlated well with the objective measures of language zzso zzso zzso historical data were zzso to zzso determine probabilities of language zzso for individual zzso In conclusion, zzso language zzso can be accurately determined using a novel objective and automated methodology that zzso language zzso in a zzso manner and can be used to determine the probability of language dominance in individual zzso
