zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging is a promising technique for detecting changes of zzso zzso content in cartilage associated with knee zzso Despite its potential clinical benefit, sodium MR imaging in zzso is challenging because of zzso low sodium concentration and low MR signal zzso Some of the challenges in sodium MR imaging may be eliminated by the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of sodium and zzso MR images and the evaluation of both zzso and structural properties of knee zzso Nevertheless, zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is technically difficult because of the zzso effect between the zzso elements zzso at high zzso and the required compact design with improved zzso zzso In this study, we applied a zzso zzso zzso design to develop a zzso zzso zzso for knee cartilage imaging at 3 zzso With the new design, the size of the zzso was zzso and a high zzso ratio zzso was zzso zzso zzso exhibited high levels of reflection zzso zzso zzso and transmission zzso zzso zzso zzso for both the zzso and sodium zzso High zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso were achieved in sodium MR imaging of knee cartilage in zzso at zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso performance was comparable to that measured using a zzso zzso zzso zzso of 28 and zzso of zzso Clinical evaluation of the zzso zzso on four normal subjects demonstrated a consistent acquisition of high-resolution zzso images and measurement of relative sodium zzso of knee zzso without repositioning of the subjects during the same MR scanning zzso
