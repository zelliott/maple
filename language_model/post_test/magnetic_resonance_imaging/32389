We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether zzso zzso impairment can play an independent role in the functional reorganization of zzso activity in the zzso Fourteen patients with large vessel zzso but no zzso performed a simple motor task with the hand zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso maps of regional activity were generated to compare the distribution of zzso activity among patients with that of control zzso Patients were classified into normal or abnormal cerebral zzso on the basis of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and carbon dioxide zzso zzso and patients with normal zzso zzso showed typical motor activity in zzso motor zzso When the 9 patients with abnormal zzso zzso were compared with the 14 control subjects in a single analysis, unique motor zzso was identified in zzso motor regions in the zzso zzso In a zzso analysis, blood oxygen zzso zzso signal intensity was averaged in zzso motor regions of zzso A significant group by zzso interaction was identified, driven by higher zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso signal in patients with abnormal zzso zzso compared with controls zzso zzso The average zzso motor region signal intensity was also significantly higher in the zzso of patients with abnormal zzso and no zzso compared with controls zzso Our results suggest that zzso impairment in one hemisphere, even in the absence of any focal zzso or any symptoms can be associated with a functional reorganization to the opposite zzso
