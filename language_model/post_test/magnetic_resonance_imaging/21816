zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso levels have been reported in patients with zzso of zzso type zzso in comparison with zzso We wished to assess the zzso of these findings and to evaluate possible correlations of zzso proportions with cognitive dysfunction in zzso Twelve patients with zzso and 10 healthy zzso controls were zzso The severity of zzso was assessed using different scales including the zzso State zzso MRS was performed with a conventional zzso zzso scanner in a single zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso or TE zzso 136 zzso zzso zzso 1500 zzso The evaluation of MRS results was limited by low zzso zzso zzso echo zzso and zzso zzso by a high zzso zzso and by the failure to measure absolute zzso zzso These problems in mind, it was remarkable that previously reported reductions of zzso levels in patients with zzso could be reproduced in the present zzso The proportion of zzso was diminished in zzso subjects in comparison with controls zzso vs zzso short zzso A zzso trend towards minor reductions of zzso zzso and zzso proportions in these subjects might indicate that proportions of other zzso necessarily increase when zzso is zzso zzso dysfunction of zzso subjects was significantly correlated with reductions of zzso but not with increases of zzso Due to the present technical and zzso problems and to the zzso of findings, zzso MRS cannot be applied to support the diagnosis of zzso in a clinical zzso
