zzso have been implicated in playing an important role in blood vessel formation, zzso zzso and zzso However, the role of zzso in tumor zzso remains zzso In this study, expression of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso was amplified in the rat zzso cell line zzso by stable zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were implanted zzso into zzso Fischer 344 zzso We demonstrated by means of magnetic resonance imaging that increased zzso expression promoted a significant in zzso growth of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso resulted in more numerous, more highly zzso vessels, which were covered by zzso On the other hand, tumors derived from zzso cells were smaller than zzso control zzso The tumor zzso in these tumors was composed of zzso small vascular zzso which were associated with few mural zzso Our results indicate that in the presence of zzso tumors induce a more functional vascular network, which led to better tumor zzso and zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso led to less intact tumor vessels, inhibited zzso zzso and impaired tumor zzso
