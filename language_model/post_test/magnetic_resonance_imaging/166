The zzso zzso zzso zzso System zzso Francis Medical Technologies, Concord, zzso is an zzso device used with increasing frequency in the treatment of degenerative zzso spine zzso To date, limited data are available on complications observed in association with zzso procedures, and even less information exists on their underlying zzso The aim of this study was to analyze a series of complications occurring at a single institution and their potential causes and propose an zzso scoring system that may help to zzso patients and prevent zzso 

zzso patients were treated with the zzso zzso single-level and 23 zzso operations zzso zzso were performed according to recommended zzso The mean follow-up duration was 23 zzso 

Eight complications were recorded: 4 device zzso and 4 zzso process zzso fractures, including 2 spontaneous fractures of the zzso SP in patients treated at zzso and zzso The following zzso zzso were zzso markedly decreased zzso distance zzso zzso with zzso facet joint zzso a zzso zzso zzso area, limited accessibility of the space between the base and the tip of the SP because of facet joint zzso and variations in the shape of the inferior surface of the zzso zzso 

This is the first study focusing on zzso zzso complications and the zzso features of the SP and zzso areas of the patients, which could potentially be the underlying causes for those zzso The zzso can be an effective treatment option, but it is not a zzso for all patients with degenerative zzso spine zzso Not only do the clinical indications deserve attention, but also, and most importantly, the patient's zzso zzso
