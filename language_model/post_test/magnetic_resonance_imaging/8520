Much attention has been focused recently on the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms and natural progression of knee zzso zzso particularly in its early zzso One technique that has been used to investigate early zzso is delayed zzso magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage zzso where zzso zzso value after penetration of the zzso contrast agent zzso zzso zzso is used as an index of the molecular status of zzso zzso The goal of this study was to explore zzso in the zzso and its relationship with zzso cartilage zzso in knee zzso image data zzso 

zzso maps of the zzso and zzso cartilage were made from knee zzso images obtained from prior studies of zzso of the knee in 21 zzso subjects and 9 patients with zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso covered a range of values zzso zzso and patterns zzso and focal zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso correlated with that of zzso cartilage (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso R zzso zzso P zzso zzso for correlations of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso cartilage, zzso zzso of the anterior zzso and lateral compartments also zzso with R zzso zzso and P zzso zzso potentially demonstrating parallel zzso processes in the zzso 

While the zzso basis for the zzso results relative to zzso molecular structure needs investigation, these findings introduce a potential means of examining the time course of zzso tissue change in the development and progression of zzso
