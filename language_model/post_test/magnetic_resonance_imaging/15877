zzso zzso are highly zzso zzso with a fatal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso often reveals a broader extension of these zzso compared with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso Complete zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso using zzso acid zzso improved the extent of zzso In this study, we investigated whether the zzso zzso zzso with the extent of zzso using zzso zzso 

Thirteen patients who underwent zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were included in this zzso The areas in which zzso zzso terminated the zzso were zzso After fusion of PET and zzso the standardized zzso value zzso of zzso related to normal brain zzso was measured in regions of interest corresponding to zzso and remaining zzso zzso zzso characteristic zzso curve analysis determined the optimal threshold of the relative zzso anticipating zzso zzso 

During zzso a vivid zzso was present in all zzso zzso revealed zzso in 11 cases, an zzso zzso in one case and a zzso zzso in one zzso The median zzso zzso was higher in areas corresponding to the fluorescent zzso compared with the zzso normal brain zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso zzso A zzso greater than zzso predicted the zzso with a sensitivity of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso The area under the zzso curve was zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso predicts the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso provides useful information for planning zzso zzso
