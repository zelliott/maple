Physical activity zzso has been hypothesized to spare gray matter volume in late adulthood, but zzso data testing an association has been zzso Here we tested whether PA would be associated with greater gray matter volume after a zzso zzso a threshold could be identified for the amount of walking necessary to spare gray matter volume, and greater gray matter volume associated with PA would be associated with a reduced risk for cognitive impairment 13 years after the PA zzso 

In 299 adults zzso age 78 zzso from the zzso Health zzso zzso we examined the association between gray matter volume, zzso and cognitive zzso Physical activity was zzso as the number of blocks walked over 1 zzso zzso brain scans were acquired 9 years after the PA assessment on cognitively normal zzso White matter zzso zzso grade, and other health variables at baseline were used as zzso Clinical zzso for cognitive impairment occurred 13 years after zzso 

Walking amounts ranged from 0 to 300 blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso Greater PA predicted greater volumes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions 9 years zzso Walking 72 blocks was necessary to detect increased gray matter volume but walking more than 72 blocks did not spare additional zzso Greater gray matter volume with PA reduced the risk for cognitive impairment zzso 

Greater amounts of walking are associated with greater gray matter volume, which is in turn associated with a reduced risk of cognitive zzso
