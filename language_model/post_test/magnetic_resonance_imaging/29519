To assess soft tissue zzso as well as zzso of the ankle associated with trauma by using zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso acquisition in the steady state with zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

A total of 36 patients who had had chronic ankle pain associated with a traumatic injury undertook zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso MR imaging and then zzso of the zzso The ankle joint was divided into four compartments by zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhancement was graded as zzso grade I, no zzso grade II, linear zzso grade III, focal zzso zzso and grade IV, irregular zzso zzso MR grading of the zzso enhancement zzso grade III or zzso soft tissue zzso grade III or IV with its intrusion from the zzso zzso was compared with zzso zzso A control study of zzso zzso zzso was done for determining zzso zzso confirmed zzso in 47 compartments of 27 zzso Of the 27 patients, 15 revealed soft tissue zzso in 17 zzso 

For the assessment of zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso MR imaging had an accuracy of zzso sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso whereas for that of soft tissue zzso it had an accuracy of zzso sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso All of the zzso subjects showed grade I zzso or II zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso MR imaging was sensitive for the evaluation of zzso of the ankle associated with zzso whereas it was specific for soft tissue zzso zzso
