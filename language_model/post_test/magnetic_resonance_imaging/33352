zzso studies of professional athletic or musical training have demonstrated considerable zzso plasticity in various brain structures, which may reflect distinct training zzso In the present study, structural and functional brain zzso were examined in professional badminton players and compared with healthy controls using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso functional zzso Gray matter concentration zzso was assessed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso functions were measured by zzso of zzso fluctuation zzso and zzso functional zzso zzso showed that the athlete group had greater GMC and zzso in the right and zzso zzso regions, zzso The athlete group also demonstrated smaller zzso in the left superior zzso zzso and altered functional connectivity between the left superior zzso and frontal zzso These findings indicate that badminton expertise is associated with not only plastic structural changes in terms of enlarged gray matter density in the zzso but also functional zzso in zzso zzso Such structural and functional zzso may reflect specific experiences of badminton training and practice, including zzso zzso processing and hand-eye coordination in addition to refined motor zzso
