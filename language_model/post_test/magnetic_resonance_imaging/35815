To evaluate the risk of zzso zzso the zzso pole of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso mass zzso and anomalies was investigated with magnetic resonance zzso The zzso zzso was clearly demonstrated in relation to the surrounding structures on zzso images in the zzso or zzso zzso zzso In zzso of a control group of 50 cases, the zzso was located just on or close to the upper border of the zzso lip of the zzso zzso It was close to the line of the zzso zzso in 4 cases zzso but displacement below this line was not observed in any zzso In 18 cases of zzso zzso mass zzso the zzso tended to be in a lower position than in the control group, and zzso displacement below the zzso zzso was noted in 3 zzso Two of these cases had anterior zzso displacement with loss of the zzso fluid zzso space anterior to the zzso these patients had either rapid clinical deterioration or severe zzso In the remaining case and in 3 additional cases of zzso zzso the zzso were displaced into the cervical canal with preservation of the zzso space, and the patients showed no signs of rapid clinical deterioration or increased zzso zzso The present study suggests that zzso displacement through the zzso zzso with associated anterior zzso displacement and loss of the zzso space anterior to the zzso can be regarded as a sign of zzso zzso
