zzso lines of evidence point to the zzso zzso zzso as a critical structure in visual zzso For instance, human functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has revealed a modular zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso visual areas in the zzso and disruptions to the processing within these regions, either in zzso patients or through zzso magnetic zzso can produce zzso deficits in visual zzso Here we show, using zzso and pattern zzso methods, that the activity in the zzso also represents how stimuli will be zzso with by the zzso level of processing more traditionally associated with the zzso activity in zzso circuits of the zzso Combining functional mapping of different zzso areas with a real zzso delayed movement task, we found that the zzso spatial activity patterns across the zzso could be used to predict both the action of an upcoming hand movement zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso hand zzso right hand) to be zzso Interestingly, we were able to extract this wide range of zzso movement information even though nearly all zzso areas showed either zzso or below zzso activity prior to action zzso Our zzso of different zzso areas according to the features of upcoming movements that they could predict also revealed a general zzso of zzso movement representations along the zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso visual pathway, which is well known to be involved in object recognition and zzso processing, plays a larger than previously expected role in preparing zzso hand zzso
