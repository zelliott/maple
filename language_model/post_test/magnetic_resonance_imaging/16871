It is important to differentiate zzso fungus ball from zzso zzso and other forms of zzso zzso in order to determine the optimal zzso In particular, a zzso fungus ball, a zzso zzso zzso can be characterized by zzso findings before zzso 

To differentiate a zzso fungus ball from other types of zzso and determine optimal treatment on the basis of zzso findings before zzso 

We studied 119 patients with clinically and zzso proven zzso fungus zzso Their condition was evaluated zzso with zzso CT (99 zzso zzso CT (18 zzso and/or zzso (17 zzso prior to zzso zzso 

zzso were found in 78 of 116 zzso patients who underwent CT scans for fungus zzso As opposed to zzso CT scans, contrast CT scans revealed zzso zzso ball in zzso and enhanced inflamed zzso in zzso of the patients, zzso On zzso most zzso zzso balls showed zzso or zzso on zzso images and marked zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were noted and appeared as zzso on zzso images zzso and zzso on zzso images zzso 

When there are no zzso visible on the CT zzso a zzso zzso ball located in the central area of the zzso with zzso zzso on enhanced CT scans is an important feature of a zzso zzso fungus zzso On zzso a zzso fungus ball has typical features of a marked zzso fungus ball with a zzso zzso membrane in zzso zzso A zzso CT scan or zzso provides sufficient information for the zzso differentiation of a zzso fungus ball from other forms of zzso
