This study aims to review the magnetic resonance imaging zzso aspects of a large series of patients with focal cortical zzso type II zzso zzso and attempt to identify distinctive features in the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

We zzso reviewed the zzso scans of 118 patients with zzso proven zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso who were surgically treated for intractable zzso 

zzso was abnormal in 93 patients (79 zzso and unremarkable in 25 (21 zzso A zzso zzso was identified in 90 cases zzso zzso and classified as zzso II in 83 and zzso zzso in seven zzso In three cases, the zzso diagnosis was other than zzso There was a significant association between the presence of cortical zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and a correct zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso was more frequent in the patients with zzso zzso than in those with zzso zzso zzso % zzso 51 zzso and the detection rate of zzso II was also better in the patients with type zzso zzso % zzso 32 zzso The zzso sign was significantly more frequent in the zzso zzso zzso 

The rates of abnormal zzso results and correct zzso diagnoses of zzso II were significantly higher in the zzso zzso Although other zzso zzso may contribute to the diagnosis, the only significant correlation was between the zzso sign and zzso zzso
