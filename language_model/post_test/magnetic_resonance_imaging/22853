Monitoring of oxygen zzso in jugular zzso blood gives an estimate of the balance of global oxygen delivery and cerebral oxygen zzso We present a zzso approach to measure oxygen zzso in zzso in the internal jugular vein using MR zzso by exploiting the characteristic zzso of zzso and demonstrate the feasibility of performing such zzso in a group of zzso We assessed the sensitivity of the method for detecting small changes in oxygen zzso by monitoring the variations observed during zzso and zzso zzso Unlike alternative methods, the zzso technique does not require zzso
