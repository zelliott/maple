The use of zzso MR imaging to delineate the area at risk and subsequently zzso zzso salvage is problematic on many zzso The validation studies available thus far are zzso Unlike the data zzso DE MR imaging, in which zzso analysis has shown the precise shape and zzso of the bright region exactly match the zzso area, this level of validation does not exist for zzso MR zzso Technical advances have occurred, but image contrast between abnormal and normal regions remains zzso and in this situation, measured size differences between MR imaging data sets should not be zzso Moreover, with any zzso technique, there remains the key issue that there is no zzso basis for the apparent zzso zzso Indeed, a zzso bright area at risk on zzso MR images is incompatible with the known levels of zzso that occur in zzso and salvaged zzso and the finding that the lateral borders of zzso zzso regions frequently extend far beyond that of zzso is contrary to the zzso zzso Even if zzso MR imaging provided an accurate measure of zzso zzso the level of zzso within the area at risk is dependent on multiple zzso including zzso size, age, zzso status, zzso injury, and therapies that could have an zzso zzso The area at risk is a coronary zzso zzso There is a fundamental limitation with defining the area at risk by using a zzso indicator that can vary with different zzso zzso There are several applications for zzso zzso imaging, including differentiation of acute from chronic zzso and identification of acute zzso On the basis of the currently available zzso however, we conclude that zzso MR imaging should not be used to delineate the area at risk in patients with zzso zzso zzso
