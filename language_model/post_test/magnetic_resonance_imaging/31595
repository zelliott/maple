Abuse history is common in irritable zzso syndrome zzso and is associated with greater pain reporting, zzso distress, and poorer health zzso These effects may be zzso by enhanced responses to aversive visceral zzso We investigated the effects of zzso and abuse history on pain reporting and brain zzso in response to zzso zzso 

Ten female patients with zzso and 10 controls were zzso Half of patients in each group reported a history of zzso Brain functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso images and pain ratings were obtained during zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping identified zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with rated zzso 

zzso zzso pain correlated with anxiety and zzso of the zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a history of abuse showed greater zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than subjects without zzso zzso Those with zzso and abuse reported greater pain than all others zzso zzso zzso had more activity in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and had less activity in the left zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso ratings during zzso zzso are associated with zzso of zzso zzso regions implicated in zzso zzso processing, and prior abuse enhances this zzso Patients with zzso and abuse report more pain, greater zzso zzso and reduced activity of a region implicated in pain zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest a possible explanation for the clinical observation of greater pain reporting and poorer outcome in zzso patients with a history of zzso
