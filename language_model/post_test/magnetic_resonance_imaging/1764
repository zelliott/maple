To evaluate the effect of intravenous injections of zzso during zzso zzso 

From 1998 to 2001, 340 patients were examined with zzso Depending on the native zzso diagnosis, 110 of them received an injection of zzso followed by multiple zzso zzso 2 minutes) up to 10 zzso after zzso Diagnosis included healthy persons zzso zzso 23), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic tumors zzso zzso zzso some patients had more than 1 zzso zzso of duct structures and amount of fluid filling of the zzso after zzso injection were evaluated zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso were tested statistically by means of zzso zzso test and zzso zzso 

The visibility of the pancreatic duct could be increased significantly after zzso injection in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it turned out not to be important at what time point after injection the zzso was zzso It was possible to evaluate the zzso rate of the zzso In healthy persons and those with zzso zzso the fluid filling of the zzso was significantly higher than in those with chronic zzso or pancreatic zzso However, this finding alone did not suffice in zzso between both groups zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso injection of zzso improves the ability of zzso to evaluate the zzso by increasing the visibility of the pancreatic duct structures and provides a method to assess the zzso rate of the zzso
