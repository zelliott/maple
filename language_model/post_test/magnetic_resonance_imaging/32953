To compare changes in zzso relaxation on magnetic resonance zzso images of knee zzso cartilage in younger and older amateur athletes before and after zzso 

By using a zzso MR zzso quantitative zzso maps of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in 10 younger and 10 older amateur athletes were acquired before, immediately after, and 2 hours after 30 minutes of zzso Changes in global cartilage zzso signals of the zzso and lateral zzso of the zzso and zzso and regional cartilage zzso signals in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in response to exercise were compared between the two age zzso 

Changes in global cartilage zzso values after running did not differ significantly between the age zzso In terms of the depth variation, relatively higher zzso values in the older group than in the younger group were observed mainly in the superficial layers of the zzso and zzso cartilage zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cartilage changes may occur mainly in the superficial layer of cartilage where collagen zzso zzso is primarily zzso However, no trend is observed regarding a global zzso changes between the younger and older age groups in response to zzso
