Small zzso zzso resulting from zzso disease are often zzso It is important to distinguish these from pure zzso zzso resulting from zzso disease because the investigations and examinations zzso We investigated the differences on brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso between small zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso disease and pure zzso zzso Thirteen subjects with small zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso resulting from zzso disease, and 30 subjects with zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso without zzso disease were zzso We measured zzso size using a zzso zzso device and evaluated silent zzso zzso zzso using the modified zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by conventional zzso duplex carotid zzso and magnetic resonance zzso There was no difference in the mean age of the two zzso zzso risk factors and zzso complications were also comparable for the two zzso Progressive stroke was more common in the zzso zzso group than in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso Scores for zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso scores were significantly higher in the zzso zzso group than in the zzso zzso zzso The difference in zzso zzso zzso scores was remarkable zzso zzso zzso The enlargement of the zzso space was also significantly greater in the zzso zzso group than in the zzso zzso zzso These findings seem to reflect differences in the zzso of zzso between the two zzso Silent zzso zzso zzso and enlargement of zzso space are useful for between distinguishing small zzso zzso resulting from zzso disease and pure zzso zzso This may have significant implications for the management of patients with zzso zzso It suggests that the zzso of zzso zzso is zzso
