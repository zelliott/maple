To compare the clinical implications of zzso study with those of magnetic resonance imaging in patients with zzso zzso zzso disc or spinal zzso 

zzso study of clinical zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso zzso disc or spinal zzso diagnosed by clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging zzso were zzso A total of zzso patients zzso with zzso zzso zzso disc and zzso with spinal zzso were included in the zzso 

Clinical data for zzso study zzso zzso were compared and the sensitivity and specificity of these studies were zzso Among all subjects, 267 had zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso no zzso zzso Furthermore, 391 had root zzso on zzso zzso zzso and 362 no root zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso on zzso zzso showed a significantly higher visual analogue scale score for radiating pain and a higher zzso zzso Index than those with negative findings by zzso zzso in the total subjects group and the zzso zzso zzso disc zzso and there was a trend toward higher zzso zzso Index in the spinal zzso zzso Although patients with zzso on root zzso on zzso zzso also had a higher visual analogue scale for radiating pain than patients with negative findings by zzso zzso in the total subjects group and the zzso zzso zzso disc zzso no significant difference was seen in the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a significant correlation with muscle weakness in the total subjects group and the zzso zzso zzso disc zzso and trends toward muscle weakness in the spinal zzso zzso whereas there was no such significant correlation for zzso findings in any zzso zzso study had a higher specificity in terms of physical examination data than zzso in spite of its lower zzso 

zzso study was significantly more correlated with clinical data, especially leg muscle weakness and functional status, and showed a higher specificity than zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso disc or spinal zzso
