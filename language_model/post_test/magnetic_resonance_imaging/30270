zzso zzso zzso detected by magnetic resonance imaging are thought to represent the effects of cerebral zzso disease and neurodegenerative zzso We sought to determine whether the spatial distribution of zzso discriminates between different disease groups and healthy aging individuals and whether these zzso are related to local cerebral zzso zzso 

We examined the pattern of zzso by zzso inversion zzso magnetic resonance imaging in 3 groups of zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso disease or mild cognitive impairment zzso and healthy aging zzso zzso frequency maps were calculated for each group, and spatial zzso were compared by zzso zzso zzso zzso were also analyzed as a function of normal cerebral zzso patterns by zzso a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Although zzso volume was greater in cerebral zzso zzso and zzso zzso cognitive impairment than in healthy aging, there was no consistent difference in the spatial zzso when controlling for total zzso zzso zzso were most frequent in the deep zzso zzso in all 3 zzso A strong inverse correlation between zzso frequency and normal zzso was demonstrated in all groups, demonstrating that zzso were most common in regions of relatively lower normal cerebral zzso 

zzso show a common distribution pattern and zzso for cerebral zzso regions with lower zzso zzso regardless of the underlying zzso These data suggest that across diverse disease zzso zzso injury may occur in a pattern that reflects underlying tissue properties, such as relative zzso
