To investigate the relation between zzso volume, zzso location, and clinical outcome in children with zzso in the territory of the middle cerebral artery zzso 

Children with zzso territory zzso were selected zzso from a database of children with zzso zzso zzso volumes were expressed as a percentage of the zzso zzso volume and were zzso as zzso zzso or zzso zzso location was zzso as cortical or purely zzso zzso was zzso by parental questionnaire and was zzso as zzso or zzso 

38 patients were identified zzso age 6 zzso 21 patients had zzso that involved cortical zzso zzso was good in 12 cases and poor in 26 cases (including 2 children who zzso Although there was no significant effect of zzso size or zzso location on outcome for the group as a whole, all children who had zzso more than zzso of zzso volume had a poor zzso Of note, some children with small zzso zzso had pronounced residual zzso 

Although the outcome after a small zzso in the zzso territory is variable and zzso zzso of more than zzso of zzso volume is universally associated with a poor zzso zzso of zzso volume and topography might be helpful in identification of such children for participation in future trials of treatments for acute zzso
