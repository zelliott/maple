Extension of zzso melanoma along zzso nerves is a little-known complication of zzso melanoma of the head and zzso We describe the clinical and MR imaging findings of zzso spread of zzso melanoma to zzso nerves, emphasizing that this entity occurs more commonly with zzso zzso and may have a long zzso period following primary zzso 

At two institutions, we identified and zzso reviewed eight cases of zzso melanoma of the head and neck that had MR imaging evidence of zzso spread of zzso All patients underwent zzso tissue zzso 

Seven patients had zzso of the facial skin or lip, and one patient had a primary zzso zzso By zzso these zzso included five zzso two zzso and one poorly differentiated zzso zzso zzso All patients developed symptomatic zzso zzso an average of zzso years from the time of initial zzso MR imaging demonstrated zzso enhancement of at least one branch of the zzso nerve in all cases and of at least one other zzso nerve in five zzso Other findings included abnormal contrast enhancement and soft tissue zzso in the cavernous zzso zzso zzso and/or the zzso segment of the zzso zzso 

Although zzso spread of disease occurs most commonly with zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma must also be included in this differential diagnosis, particularly if the patient's pathology is known to be zzso Similarly, any patient with zzso melanoma of the head and neck who zzso MR imaging should receive an imaging assessment focused on the likely routes of zzso zzso
