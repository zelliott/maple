The aim of this zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study was to test whether the right middle frontal zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso zzso would show differential sensitivity to the effect of zzso association strength on repetition zzso In the experimental condition zzso the target occurred after repetitive presentation of the prime within an oddball zzso In the control condition zzso the target followed a single presentation of the prime with equal probability of the target as in zzso To manipulate semantic overlap between the prime and the target both conditions zzso and zzso employed either the zzso zzso as the prime and the zzso zzso as the target zzso or zzso zzso since semantic overlap was previously shown to be greater in zzso The results showed that the left zzso was sensitive to release of adaptation while both the right zzso and zzso were sensitive to sequence zzso extraction and its zzso However, zzso activity between zzso and PO was revealed in zzso only in the right zzso Specifically, target zzso zzso and the physically equivalent target in zzso zzso comparable zzso whereas target zzso zzso zzso less inhibited response in zzso than in zzso This interaction in the right zzso was explained by zzso these effects into a competition model between zzso and conceptual effects in zzso zzso
