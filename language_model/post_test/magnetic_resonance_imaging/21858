The zzso of periodic limb movements and sensory leg discomfort in the restless legs syndrome is zzso With high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging, we localized for the first time cerebral generators associated with sensory leg discomfort and periodic limb movements in 19 patients with restless legs zzso During sensory leg discomfort there was mainly bilateral zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso During the combined periodic limb movement and sensory leg discomfort conditions, patients also showed activity in the zzso and zzso In contrast to the sensory leg discomfort condition alone, the combined condition was associated with additional zzso in the red zzso and zzso close to the zzso zzso Voluntary zzso of periodic limb movements by patients and control subjects was not associated with zzso activity, but with additional zzso in the zzso zzso and motor zzso These findings indicate that zzso and zzso zzso may occur because of sensory leg discomfort and that the red nucleus and zzso are involved in the generation of periodic limb movements in patients with restless legs zzso
