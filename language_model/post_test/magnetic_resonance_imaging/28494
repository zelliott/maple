To determine the optimal size criterion for detection of zzso zzso zzso from zzso cancer for zzso by zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In 58 patients with zzso cancer treated with zzso zzso and radical zzso zzso dissection the zzso MR zzso zzso zzso images and CT scans zzso zzso zzso were zzso The relationship of the CT and MR findings for the neck and zzso to the surgical and zzso results was zzso Five size criteria on zzso zzso zzso were used to construct receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso for CT and zzso and their zzso were zzso 

The zzso of both zzso at the zzso of 3 zzso zzso diameter were lower than those at the zzso of 5 zzso or zzso In contrast, the sensitivities apparently decreased at the zzso of 10 zzso or zzso The analysis of the zzso zzso showed that the optimal size criterion for zzso zzso zzso was 5 zzso for both CT and zzso When the criterion of 5 zzso was used, the sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for CT was 68, 92, and zzso respectively, and the respective values for MR were 70, 93, and zzso Although there was no significant difference between the two zzso curves, MR was useful in distinguishing zzso zzso from vascular structures because of the flow zzso 

There was no significant difference between CT and MR in the detection of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The optimal size criterion for both CT and MR in the detection of cervical and zzso zzso zzso zzso is 5 zzso for zzso zzso These results suggest that all regional zzso zzso of 5 zzso or more on CT or MR should be regarded as part of the gross tumor volume in the treatment planning of zzso for zzso zzso
