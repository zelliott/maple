zzso was administered weekly in zzso of 3-6 patients during the zzso phase and continued for up to 2 zzso Twelve patients were treated at the zzso to further evaluate toxicity and zzso 

Thirty patients zzso age zzso years, range zzso zzso were zzso No zzso toxicity zzso was seen in patients treated at the 3 zzso dose level zzso during the first 4 zzso All 5 patients treated at the zzso zzso DL came off study or required dose reductions for behavioral toxicity or zzso Similar zzso on the 3 zzso DL became apparent over zzso There was 1 zzso zzso in 12 patients enrolled at the zzso zzso zzso Eleven of 16 patients with pain showed improvement and 13 of 14 patients with a palpable mass had a decrease in zzso Five of 17 patients zzso who underwent zzso analysis had a zzso decrease in zzso Three of 4 patients with documented zzso progression prior to enrollment showed stabilization or zzso 

The zzso of zzso for pediatric patients with zzso is 1 zzso Clinical and zzso improvement and zzso of growth can zzso 

This study provides Class III evidence that zzso zzso in patients with zzso progressive, zzso or life-threatening zzso results in zzso reduction or stabilization of zzso zzso
