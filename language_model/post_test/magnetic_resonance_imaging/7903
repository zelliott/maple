zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso was applied in simulated Donation after zzso Death zzso in zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso was compared to evaluate the zzso zzso organ zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by P nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso Whereas this latter technique requires sophisticated hardware, zzso can be realized using any standard zzso zzso The aim of this work was to establish a correlation between the two zzso 

Twenty-two zzso zzso presenting up to 90 zzso warm zzso were zzso with zzso at 4 zzso using our magnetic zzso zzso During the zzso P zzso zzso and zzso sequences were zzso zzso obtained from the zzso were the speed of elimination of the cortical zzso and the presence or absence of a zzso zzso For zzso zzso analysis, P chemical shift imaging was acquired and zzso All the zzso have been submitted to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was observed in all zzso presenting a cortical zzso elimination slope of zzso zzso or zzso In zzso with lower zzso zzso no AN or only precursors were zzso This study reveals a link between the two methods and demonstrates ex zzso viability in zzso of the analyzed zzso zzso and side effects of both methods are zzso 

zzso zzso zzso enables the evaluation of zzso in zzso simulated situation; zzso can be introduced into any center equipped with a zzso scanner allowing results zzso with zzso zzso
