One useful strategy for zzso others' mental states zzso zzso may be to use one's own thoughts, feelings, and desires as a proxy for those of other zzso Such self-referential accounts of social zzso are supported by recent zzso observations that a single brain region, zzso prefrontal zzso zzso is engaged both by tasks that require introspections about self and by tasks that require zzso about the minds of others perceived to be similar to zzso To test whether people automatically refer to their own mental states when considering those of a similar other, we examined zzso suppression of zzso response during zzso that followed either an initial reflection about self or a judgment of another zzso zzso with the hypothesis that zzso spontaneously engage in self-referential processing when zzso about particular individuals, zzso response was suppressed when zzso followed either an initial reflection about self or a judgment of a similar, but not a zzso zzso These results suggest that thinking about the mind of another person may rely zzso on reference to one's own mental zzso
