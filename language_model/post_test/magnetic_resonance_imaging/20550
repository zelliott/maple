To determine how often zzso zzso zzso or contradicts initial diagnoses of late-life cognitive zzso 

zzso case zzso 

zzso clinic specializing in memory zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso referred cognitively impaired zzso 

zzso using research criteria were developed for each patient at the first visit and ranged from cognitive impairment without zzso to zzso of single, complex, or indeterminate zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso images were zzso together as normal, suggestive of specific diseases, or zzso zzso 

When a single neurodegenerative disease was suspected clinically zzso imaging confirmed the diagnosis in 50, contradicted the diagnosis in 32, and was zzso diagnostic in zzso When more than one neurodegenerative zzso was clinically suspected zzso imaging assigned a single diagnosis in 13 and only cerebrovascular disease in one and was zzso diagnostic in zzso In zzso not otherwise specified zzso zzso imaging suggested a specific zzso in 23 and was zzso diagnostic in zzso zzso diagnostic images were more common in cognitive disorder zzso zzso zzso than in other clinical groups zzso zzso zzso zzso indicators of cerebrovascular disease were common zzso zzso but not predicted by the presence of vascular risk factors zzso 

Overall, zzso confirmed, zzso or contradicted the initial clinical diagnosis in more than zzso of patients, whereas fewer than zzso had zzso diagnostic zzso Imaging suggested a complex zzso zzso in zzso of cases clinically thought to be caused by a single process, whereas zzso of complex clinical differential diagnoses appeared to reflect a single zzso zzso Further work is needed to determine whether refinement of clinical diagnoses using specialized zzso improves clinical decision-making and patient zzso
