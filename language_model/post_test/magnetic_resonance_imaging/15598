zzso of zzso brain dysfunction remains poor, and relies mainly on data from animals or zzso studies in zzso The current study provided findings from magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in septic zzso 

Nine patients with septic shock and brain dysfunction zzso women, median age 63 years zzso range zzso zzso zzso II: 48 zzso zzso 8 zzso underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging including zzso echo zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso and diffusion zzso images, and mapping of apparent diffusion zzso 

Brain imaging was normal in two patients, showed multiple zzso strokes in two patients, and in the remaining patients showed white matter zzso at the level of the zzso zzso zzso around zzso spaces, ranging from small multiple areas to diffuse zzso and zzso by zzso on zzso zzso The main zzso were also zzso by reduced signal on diffusion zzso images and increased apparent diffusion zzso The zzso of the white matter worsened with increasing duration of shock and were correlated with zzso zzso zzso 

This preliminary study showed that zzso brain zzso can be documented by magnetic resonance zzso These zzso predominated in the white matter, suggesting increased zzso barrier zzso and were associated with poor zzso
