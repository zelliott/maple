Hands were transplanted from zzso donors for the treatment of two male unilateral zzso aged 35 years and 32 years, involved in the Italian Hand zzso zzso Each had lost his right dominant hand, in a farming accident and an explosion, zzso In one case artificial sensibility was applied zzso using a Sensor Glove that transformed zzso stimuli induced by touch, to zzso zzso stimuli perceived through zzso The principle is based on the zzso capacity for zzso zzso zzso that deprivation of one sense zzso can be compensated for by another sense zzso zzso magnetic resonance images zzso taken at regular intervals showed that cortical zzso of the transplanted hand within the zzso maps occurred early in the patient who used the artificial sensibility regimen compared with the one who did zzso We conclude that zzso use of a device using hearing as a substitution for sensation in hand transplantation may have considerable potential value for speeding up cortical integration of a transplanted zzso
