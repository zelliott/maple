Although experts recommend routine screening of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cases of potential child physical abuse, this practice is highly zzso Our objective was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of routine zzso testing in young children who underwent consultation for physical zzso 

This was a zzso zzso zzso study of all children younger than 60 months referred for zzso evaluation of possible physical zzso The child abuse team at each center recommended screening zzso routinely as standard of care for all cases with a reasonable concern for physical zzso zzso and specificity for zzso and clinical examination findings to detect identified abdominal injuries were determined, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was zzso 

Of zzso zzso zzso zzso patients underwent zzso testing, and 54 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso had identified abdominal zzso Area under the curve for the highest level of either zzso was zzso Using a threshold level of 80 zzso for either zzso or zzso yielded a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso likelihood zzso zzso negative likelihood zzso zzso Of injuries with elevated zzso levels, 14 zzso were clinically occult, lacking abdominal zzso zzso and zzso Several clinical findings used to predict abdominal injury had high specificity but low zzso 

In the population of children with concern for physical abuse, abdominal injury is an important cause of morbidity and zzso but it is not so common as to warrant universal zzso zzso imaging should be considered for potentially abused children when either the zzso or zzso level is zzso zzso or with abdominal zzso zzso or zzso
