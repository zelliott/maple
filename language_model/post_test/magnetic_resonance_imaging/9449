The purpose of this study is to evaluate the zzso effect on zzso zzso images at zzso and 3 T zzso We examined the influence of zzso by comparing the full zzso at zzso zzso and slice profile of images of a zzso phantom for various slice zzso We also assessed zzso effect in the brain by comparing image contrast among healthy volunteers zzso Among the subjects, the shapes of the slice profiles at zzso T were similar to those at 3 T for long repetition times zzso however, at shorter zzso differences in slice profiles were observed among the subjects and were more apparent at 3 than at zzso zzso The relative contrast between white matter and gray matter on zzso images was lower at 3 than at zzso zzso The zzso effect was strongest when the zzso of the zzso pulse was zzso The influence of the adjacent zzso pulse is important in the process of zzso relaxation because zzso values are greater at 3 zzso In conclusion, the influence of zzso on zzso zzso images is greater at 3 than at zzso zzso
