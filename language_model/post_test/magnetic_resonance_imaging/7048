The purpose of the study was to evaluate the hypothesis that magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are complementary and valuable in monitoring response and assessing residual disease of locally advanced breast cancer zzso treated with zzso zzso We sought to determine if the combination of the two zzso was more accurate than either alone and could provide better guidance in patient zzso 

Sixteen zzso in 15 women with zzso were evaluated with zzso zzso and clinical breast examination zzso before and after zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso tumor sizes on zzso and zzso and standard zzso values zzso on PET served as the zzso for clinical response zzso and residual disease zzso zzso assessment provided the reference for zzso and microscopic zzso tumor response and residual zzso 

PET correctly predicted lack of zzso response in five of six cases zzso zzso predicted correctly in one of six zzso cases, and zzso predicted correctly in zero of six zzso When PET predicted response, zzso defined the extent of zzso zzso residual disease accurately in 9 of 10 cases zzso When zzso zzso showed complete response zzso in eight cases, zzso zzso complete response zzso was observed in all eight cases zzso 

Our study suggests that combined use of zzso and PET is complementary and offers advantages over zzso PET was more accurate in predicting zzso zzso Complete response by zzso correlated well with zzso zzso complete zzso
