We present a case similar to previously described cases of idiopathic zzso zzso zzso However, our patient responded to zzso zzso This raises the possibility that some cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent zzso zzso zzso 

A 55-year-old woman presented with a right fourth nerve zzso and a zzso history of zzso zzso resonance imaging with zzso revealed thick enhancing zzso on the right half of the zzso zzso with zzso of the adjacent zzso zzso and cerebral zzso 

Open biopsy of the zzso zzso revealed only dense zzso with zzso zzso An exhaustive search failed to demonstrate an underlying zzso In particular, zzso zzso were negative, there was no zzso formation, and the chest zzso was zzso However, because of a strongly positive zzso zzso skin test and residence in an area endemic for zzso the patient was placed on zzso zzso 

The patient's symptoms and signs resolved with zzso zzso Resolution of the zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso magnetic resonance zzso We conclude that this case represented zzso zzso zzso An zzso trial of zzso therapy may be warranted in other cases of apparently idiopathic zzso zzso zzso
