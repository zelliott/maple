The purpose of the study was to assess global and regional zzso function of the right zzso zzso with the use of phase contrast zzso zzso mapping in patients after acute zzso zzso We examined 8 patients after acute zzso wall zzso and 10 healthy volunteers for zzso PC zzso mapping was performed in a single zzso zzso slice with zzso zzso in three different zzso RV displacement during zzso in the zzso direction differed significantly between patients and volunteers zzso zzso zzso RV zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso directions, evaluated at time of peak ejection rate, was significantly lower in patients than in healthy volunteers zzso RV abnormalities may be detected in patients after acute zzso zzso using PC zzso mapping with zzso zzso in three different zzso zzso to their short acquisition times and relatively easy zzso PC techniques are zzso and promising tools for the evaluation of RV zzso
