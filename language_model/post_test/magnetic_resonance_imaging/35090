An extensive body of literature demonstrates a strong correlation between zzso disk zzso zzso status zzso and functional spinal zzso However, to date, in zzso zzso HS assessment has relied largely on zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to establish the consistency of signal zzso of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso phantom for HS correlation using conventional magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

Sixteen zzso zzso of increasing relative zzso concentration zzso zzso to zzso zzso underwent zzso MR zzso Phantom zzso ratio measures were recorded for each concentration on several sequence zzso zzso of zzso data were calculated to determine the degree of MR signal variation at each zzso 

Analysis of zzso testing suggested no significant difference in zzso of zzso data derived from phantom signal zzso using either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso sequence types zzso zzso zzso suggesting a high degree of relative signal zzso 

The findings of this study suggest that a zzso phantom combined with a zzso zzso zzso gelatin suspension media can produce a zzso zzso homogeneous MR signal zzso This may be an appropriate base material for a zzso model to allow accurate zzso of the zzso status of the in zzso human zzso
