22 patients known to be suffering from Crohn's disease were examined via zzso zzso system; an oral contrast examination using 1000 zzso of a zzso zzso solution was performed in all zzso zzso zzso sequences and zzso zzso sequences were performed before and after the intravenous injection of zzso To reduce movement artifacts caused by zzso of the gut, intravenous injection of 40 zzso zzso was zzso The findings of zzso were compared with the zzso zzso 

In the upper gastrointestinal zzso the zzso examination showed clear advantages compared with zzso for the demonstration of inflammatory changes in the zzso zzso was, however, somewhat more reliable in the zzso and zzso It was also more sensitive than the zzso for the demonstration of enteric zzso (four as compared with two zzso and in demonstration zzso changes zzso fluid in six against zero, and inflammatory adherent zzso (four against zzso zzso the 22 patients, zzso was equal (in 10) or better (in 8) than the zzso examination for demonstrating the zzso manifestations of Crohn's disease, and zzso was better in only zzso 

For follow-up of Crohn's disease, zzso is at least as good as zzso examination, and is even zzso because of the absence of radiation exposure of the usually young zzso
