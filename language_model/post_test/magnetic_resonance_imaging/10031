zzso zzso and targeted quantum dots were zzso To that aim, quantum dots were coated with zzso and zzso zzso which resulted in a zzso zzso of nearly 2000 zzso per quantum zzso The quantum dots were zzso by zzso linking zzso zzso zzso and the specificity was assessed and confirmed on cultured zzso zzso The zzso character, the high zzso and the specificity of this zzso probe make it an excellent contrast agent for molecular imaging zzso
