Acute zzso zzso zzso may result from zzso zzso zzso without zzso disruption zzso zzso but can also be found in association with processes in which an zzso zzso is present, such as zzso zzso zzso where the zzso represents the acute zzso of the false zzso or in penetrating zzso zzso zzso where blood collects beyond the disrupted internal elastic zzso As the clinical presentation of these conditions is very similar, imaging techniques should aim both to diagnose the zzso and to characterize the underlying zzso This review critically analyzes the diagnostic potential of several imaging methods based on personal experience and literature zzso Although zzso zzso can be easily diagnosed zzso of the zzso imaging zzso it is usually difficult to distinguish between zzso and zzso associated either to zzso or to zzso Indeed, only zzso related zzso can be consistently diagnosed due to the high probability of unveiling the zzso wall zzso conversely, the differential diagnosis between zzso and zzso - associated zzso is still matter of zzso According to the literature, the two conditions cannot be differentiated by zzso zzso though some reports state that a distinction might be made by MR zzso As regards CT, only a small percentage of zzso - associated zzso exhibit clear evidence of a typical zzso zzso allowing for a safe diagnosis to be made: often, unfortunately, the zzso zzso subsequently found at surgery cannot be zzso yielding a picture of zzso zzso the zzso report should give the same diagnostic probability to both zzso
