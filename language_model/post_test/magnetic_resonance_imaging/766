Double zzso syndrome is a zzso in which there is a band of zzso zzso zzso matter separated from the zzso by white zzso The functional activity of the zzso zzso is zzso 

A 13-year-old female was evaluated for zzso The zzso showed zzso spike wave zzso Band zzso in association with mild reduction of zzso of the cerebral zzso was found on zzso Psychological assessment indicated the presence of variable cognitive abilities, with verbal zzso zzso generally better than zzso zzso zzso and specific difficulties in language comprehension and zzso 

zzso zzso was used to zzso the areas of language and motor zzso The language zzso paradigm was a visual verb generation task with a visual fixation zzso The motor paradigm consisted of alternating blocks of sequential finger tapping and zzso zzso functional and anatomical images were zzso 

The motor paradigm produced zzso of the primary motor cortex, the band zzso and the supplementary motor zzso The language paradigm produced zzso of the left inferior frontal zzso and left supplementary motor area, but not of the band zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso matter during a motor task demonstrates a zzso association with motor activity and suggests that this tissue may be zzso Such association was not seen with the language zzso We speculate that later maturing functions such as language are restricted in their development to the normal situated superficial zzso in our zzso
