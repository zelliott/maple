It was recently observed that zzso causes shrinkage of brain tissue and an associated increase in zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso on cognitive performance have been shown in some but not all studies, and it has also been reported that an increased perceived effort may be required following zzso However, the effects of zzso on brain function are zzso We investigated this question using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 10 healthy adolescents zzso age zzso zzso five zzso Each subject completed a zzso exercise protocol and zzso exercise control condition in a zzso repeated measures zzso zzso lost more weight via perspiration in the zzso exercise versus the control condition zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso enlargement correlated with the reduction in body mass zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso following the zzso exercise protocol led to a significantly stronger increase in zzso zzso zzso response during an executive function task (Tower of zzso than the control condition, whereas cerebral zzso during rest was not zzso The increase in zzso response after zzso was not paralleled by a change in cognitive performance, suggesting an inefficient use of brain zzso activity following zzso This pattern indicates that participants exerted a higher level of zzso activity in order to achieve the same performance zzso Given the limited availability of brain zzso resources, these findings suggest that prolonged states of reduced water intake may adversely impact executive functions such as planning and zzso zzso
