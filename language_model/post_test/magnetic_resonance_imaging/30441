Gray matter brain structures, including deep zzso and the cerebral cortex, are affected significantly and early in the course of multiple sclerosis and these changes may not be directly related to zzso white matter zzso The zzso is an zzso structure that is critical for memory functions and is especially sensitive to multiple insults including zzso We used high-resolution MR imaging at zzso T to measure zzso volumes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and secondary progressive zzso zzso patients and zzso We found that both groups of zzso patients had zzso zzso and that this volume loss was in excess of global brain zzso zzso analysis revealed selective volume loss in the zzso zzso zzso 1 region of the zzso in zzso with further worsening of zzso loss and extension into other CA regions in zzso zzso zzso was not correlated with zzso volumes, and right and left zzso were affected zzso Volume loss in the zzso and zzso was correlated with worsening performance on zzso learning, a task requiring memory zzso but not with performance on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Task zzso a test of information processing zzso Our findings provide evidence for selective and progressive zzso zzso in zzso localized initially to the zzso zzso that is associated with deficits in memory zzso and zzso The underlying zzso zzso for this selective, zzso and disproportionate regional zzso vulnerability remains speculative at this zzso Further understanding of this process could provide targets for therapeutic interventions including zzso zzso
