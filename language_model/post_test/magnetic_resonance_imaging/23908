A magnetic resonance imaging method is described for measuring the magnetic zzso difference between two homogeneous zzso compartments in contact with each zzso A boundary condition is derived for the interface of the two zzso This boundary condition predicts that across the interface there is a resonant frequency zzso which is a function of zzso orientation relative to zzso field and the difference in zzso of the two zzso Based on this relationship, the magnetic zzso difference between two materials can be obtained from MR zzso echo imaging using signals from both sides in the vicinity of the zzso This method is demonstrated by solution phantom zzso
