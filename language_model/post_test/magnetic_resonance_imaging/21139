This study aims to obtain the signal intensity changes and quantitative zzso of the zzso brain structures of zzso weeks zzso age zzso 

zzso fetal specimens were selected and scanned by zzso zzso The signal intensity changes of the zzso brain structures were zzso The three-dimensional zzso models of the zzso zzso zzso nucleus, zzso nucleus, and zzso zzso were rebuilt with zzso zzso and the zzso trends between the zzso and zzso were zzso 

The zzso zzso was delineated on zzso MR images at 12 weeks zzso with high signals on zzso images zzso While at 16 weeks zzso the zzso nucleus, zzso nucleus, and internal and external capsules could be zzso The zzso nucleus was high signal intensity on zzso The signal intensity of the zzso was high on zzso during 15-17 weeks zzso and was delineated as an area with uneven signal zzso The signal intensity of the peripheral area of the zzso became higher after 18 weeks zzso The signal intensity of the zzso zzso was high on zzso and low on zzso after 20 weeks zzso At 18 weeks zzso the zzso was delineated with low signals on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso nucleus, zzso nucleus, and zzso zzso zzso increased with the zzso 

Development of the zzso brain structures during zzso weeks zzso could be displayed with zzso zzso The measurement provides significant reference beneficial to the clinical evaluation of fetal brain zzso
