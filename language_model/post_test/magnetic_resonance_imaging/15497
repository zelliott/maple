In a zzso zzso trial (the zzso Safety and zzso in zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso involving zzso patients with zzso multiple sclerosis zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso rate by zzso and progression of sustained disability by zzso vs zzso We report the effect of zzso on zzso measures from the zzso zzso 

The number and volume of zzso zzso new or enlarging zzso and new zzso zzso and brain zzso fraction were measured from annual scans obtained at zzso 1 year, and 2 zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso produced a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso an zzso decrease in new or enlarging zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso and a zzso decrease in new zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso over 2 zzso Median zzso zzso volume increased by zzso in the zzso group and decreased by zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso median zzso zzso volume decreased by zzso in the zzso group and decreased by zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso was greater in year 1 and less in year 2 in zzso zzso 

zzso has a sustained effect in preventing the formation of new zzso in patients with zzso multiple zzso
