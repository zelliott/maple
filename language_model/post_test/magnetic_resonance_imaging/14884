Our purpose was to identify the zzso factors for the zzso distribution obtained with zzso by comparing zzso with clinical information and other zzso findings in zzso zzso 

Seventy-one patients with zzso disease underwent zzso and other zzso including zzso inversion recovery imaging zzso and three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso values zzso zzso for the cerebral zzso zzso zzso were measured on zzso maps generated by zzso zzso between the zzso values and the following 9 factors were zzso sex, family history, zzso surgery, age at MR exam, age at zzso the zzso severity on zzso zzso zzso degree of zzso zzso degree of zzso high signal intensity seen on zzso and size of zzso or zzso cerebrovascular accident zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with a family history had significantly higher zzso values than those without such a zzso There were significant negative correlations between zzso values and age at MR exam, zzso score, and zzso zzso 

zzso may have zzso or mutual associations with family history, current patient age, size of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso severity in zzso zzso
