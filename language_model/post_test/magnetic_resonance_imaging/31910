zzso studies investigating the neural network of zzso processing have revealed a right zzso network of zzso including inferior zzso zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, and zzso zzso zzso zzso processing, indicated by the zzso of Line Orientation zzso is commonly seen in individuals with zzso type 1 zzso Nevertheless, few studies have examined the neural activity associated with zzso processing in zzso in particular, during a zzso zzso This study used functional zzso to explore differences in volume of zzso in zzso regions of interest between 13 individuals with zzso and 13 controls while performing an analogue zzso zzso We hypothesized that participants with zzso would show anomalous right zzso zzso and therefore would recruit regions within the left zzso to complete the zzso zzso analyses of zzso were used to test for differences between groups in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicate that, as predicted, controls zzso various right zzso regions to complete the task, while the zzso group tended to recruit left zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso group has an inefficient right zzso zzso An additional unexpected finding was that the zzso group showed decreased volume of zzso in primary visual zzso zzso zzso Future studies are needed to examine whether the decrease in primary visual zzso is related to a deficit in basic visual zzso findings could ultimately lead to a greater understanding of the nature of deficits in zzso and have implications for zzso
