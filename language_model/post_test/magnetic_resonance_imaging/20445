To investigate the neural mechanisms of food motivation in children and zzso and examine brain zzso differences between healthy weight zzso and obese zzso 

Ten zzso children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 10 obese children zzso zzso zzso zzso matched for age, gender and years of zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans were conducted twice: when participants were hungry zzso and immediately after a standardized meal zzso During the zzso scans, the participants passively viewed blocked images of food, zzso zzso and blurred baseline zzso 

Both groups of children showed brain zzso to food images in the zzso and zzso regions zzso The obese group showed significantly greater zzso to food pictures in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso than the zzso zzso In addition, the obese group showed less zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso regions, including the nucleus zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso in high food motivation states was noted in both groups of zzso However, obese children were zzso to food stimuli as compared with zzso zzso In addition, unlike zzso children, brain zzso in response to food stimuli in obese children failed to diminish significantly after zzso This study provides initial evidence that zzso even among children, is associated with abnormalities in neural networks involved in food zzso and that the origins of neural zzso dysfunction associated with obesity may begin early in zzso
