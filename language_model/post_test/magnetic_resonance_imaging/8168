In zzso internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery zzso zzso disease, chronic zzso compromise may increase the risk for cerebral zzso zzso To determine whether selective zzso damage demonstrated as a decrease in central zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cerebral zzso is associated with increased oxygen extraction fraction zzso (misery zzso 

We measured zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso in 105 nondisabled patients with zzso internal carotid artery or zzso zzso disease and no cortical zzso By using three-dimensional zzso surface projections and the zzso extraction zzso method, without correction for partial volume effects, the zzso decreased zzso index zzso extent of the zzso with zzso more than 2 compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso in those zzso in the cerebral zzso of the zzso distribution with zzso disease was zzso and it was found to be correlated with the mean zzso value of zzso and several clinical zzso 

All patients had zzso with zzso decreased zzso with the extent varying from zzso to zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso decreased zzso index was positively correlated with the value of zzso and the history of stroke, whereas it was zzso correlated with the presence of zzso with zzso zzso zzso examinations of 17 patients without zzso episode showed that a decrease of zzso was associated with an increase of zzso 

In zzso internal carotid artery or zzso zzso disease, misery zzso may cause selective zzso damage, and statins might have beneficial effects against zzso zzso
