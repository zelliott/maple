zzso intractable zzso arising from the zzso zzso zzso present a formidable challenge for zzso and zzso zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment for zzso in this zzso 

We zzso reviewed the medical records of 24 children and adolescents who underwent surgical management of zzso zzso zzso at our zzso 

Patient age at the time of surgery ranged between zzso and zzso years, and median zzso follow-up was zzso zzso Three patients had clear zzso on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso that correlated with zzso zzso zzso and underwent zzso zzso Of the 21 patients who underwent invasive monitoring, 19 underwent therapeutic procedures, including zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso Engel class I and II outcomes were seen in five of six patients zzso after zzso and in seven of nine patients zzso and four of six patients zzso after zzso zzso or multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso At last zzso zzso deficits were observed following zzso zzso zzso 3 of 6) of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 7 of 9) of zzso no zzso deficits were seen in patients undergoing motor zzso zzso No correlation existed between seizure outcome and duration of zzso age at diagnosis, age at surgery, zzso or the presence or absence of a discrete zzso 

Surgery for appropriately selected children with intractable zzso arising from zzso zzso was effective and associated with minimal zzso morbidity in many zzso Engel zzso outcome was achieved in zzso of patients overall, and zzso deficits were often mild and improved over zzso zzso resulted in the best seizure control, followed by zzso and then zzso
