To investigate zzso and chest wall motion during the whole breathing cycle using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and a zzso model in correlation with zzso 

zzso cycles of 15 healthy volunteers were examined using a zzso sequence (5 slices in 3 planes, 3 images per zzso zzso zzso were calculated and correlated to zzso A model for vital capacity zzso continuous zzso vital capacity zzso and investigating the influence of horizontal and vertical parameters on zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso of the breathing cycle using zzso correlated highly significant with zzso zzso zzso zzso VC calculated by the model was similar to VC measured in zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated highly significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters had a more profound influence on zzso change than horizontal zzso 

Dynamic zzso is a simple zzso method to evaluate local chest wall motion and respiratory zzso It widens the repertoire of tools for lung examination with a high zzso zzso
