The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of treating the pelvic zzso regions during prostate zzso zzso zzso with respect to our routine acceptance zzso 

A series of 10 previously treated prostate patients were randomly selected and the pelvic zzso regions delineated on the fused magnetic zzso zzso data zzso A targeting progression was formed from the prostate and zzso seminal zzso only to the inclusion of all pelvic zzso regions and zzso region resulting in 5 planning scenarios of increasing geometric zzso zzso plans were generated for each stage for two accelerator zzso zzso volume zzso data were analyzed with respect to dose to the planning target volumes, zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso Analysis was performed for the number of segments required, monitor units, zzso zzso and treatment zzso 

Both zzso zzso were met for all zzso zzso zzso were not met and the zzso zzso was met in zzso of cases with the inclusion of the extended and zzso zzso A significant difference was found in the number of segments and monitor units with targeting progression and between accelerators, with the smaller zzso yielding poorer zzso Treatment times between the 2 zzso did not exhibit a clinically significant difference when zzso 

Many issues should be considered with pelvic zzso zzso during zzso delivery for prostate cancer including dose per zzso normal structure zzso limits, planning target volumes generation, zzso treatment time, and increased radiation zzso We would suggest that, at a zzso the zzso used in this work be evaluated before beginning zzso pelvic zzso zzso
