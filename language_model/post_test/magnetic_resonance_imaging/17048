The transition from quiet zzso rest to sleep represents a period over which attention to the external environment zzso zzso zzso have provided much information on the shift in neural activity patterns in sleep, but the dynamic restructuring of human brain networks in the transitional period from wake to sleep remains poorly zzso Analysis of zzso measures and functional network connectivity of these early transitional states shows subtle shifts in network architecture that are consistent with reduced external zzso and increased internal and self-referential zzso Further, descent to sleep is accompanied by the loss of connectivity in anterior and zzso portions of the zzso network and more locally organized global network zzso These data clarify the complex and dynamic nature of the transitional period between wake and sleep and suggest the need for more studies investigating the dynamics of these zzso
