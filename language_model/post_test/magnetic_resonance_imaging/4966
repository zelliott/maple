To explore tumor zzso with special attention to the zzso in two molecular zzso of human breast cancer using in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso The impact of tumor growth, size, and the influence of zzso were also zzso 

Two zzso and directly transplanted human breast cancer models representing zzso and zzso molecular zzso were characterized by dynamic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the level of zzso zzso were associated with the calculated in zzso zzso parameters of the zzso 

The vascular zzso and zzso zzso ) was significantly higher in zzso compared to zzso zzso These findings were confirmed by a zzso higher zzso zzso density zzso in zzso tumors, reflecting the difference in aggressiveness between the zzso No effect of tumor growth was observed during 6 days of growth in any of the zzso however, large tumors had lower zzso , higher zzso zzso volume fraction zzso ), and more zzso than zzso zzso zzso withdrawal induced increased zzso , zzso , and tumor water diffusion zzso in zzso tumors, corresponding to increased zzso zzso which is likely to cause increased tumor vessel zzso 

These novel data confirm the potential of functional zzso methods to map zzso proven changes in breast tumor zzso and zzso in zzso
