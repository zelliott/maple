To assess the effects of moderate zzso zzso on zzso parameters in an zzso balloon zzso model in rats and to correlate the results with magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso 

zzso monitoring included laser zzso flow, tissue partial oxygen pressure, and zzso pressure zzso and zzso assessments during balloon expansion, sustained inflation, and zzso zzso zzso cooling of animals was extended throughout the zzso period, and results were compared with those for zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso analyses of the zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso flow decreased slightly during zzso zzso zzso zzso in animals treated with hypothermia, and flow values demonstrated complete zzso compared with incomplete flow restoration in zzso animals zzso zzso zzso During zzso the tissue partial oxygen pressure was less than zzso zzso zzso in both zzso After zzso values returned to the normal range in both groups, but the tissue partial oxygen pressure in zzso animals was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated zzso higher values, compared with zzso animals, before zzso zzso zzso attenuated a secondary increase in zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso and zzso findings indicated a trend toward faster recovery zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso size was reduced by zzso in magnetic resonance imaging zzso evaluations and by zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso improves cerebral zzso zzso a secondary increase in zzso pressure, zzso zzso recovery, and reduces the zzso zzso
