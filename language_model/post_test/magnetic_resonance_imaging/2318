To assess the feasibility and safety of using zzso zzso to increase the volume of zzso necrosis obtained or reduce the number of treatment sessions necessary with zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with 44 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso 1), or breast zzso zzso 1) zzso were treated with zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso with 2-3 zzso tip zzso Each tumor was treated in one or two treatment zzso 

Technical success, zzso of all zzso zzso was achieved in 40 zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging performed 3-6 months after treatment confirmed complete necrosis of the entire zzso in zzso zzso survival was 50% at 12 months and zzso at 18 months, with localized progression of disease in zzso of treated zzso zzso survival was zzso zzso and zzso at 6, 12, and 18 months, zzso Only one complication, zzso zzso was zzso 

Use of zzso zzso was a safe and feasible adjunct for tumor zzso zzso therapy that produced larger volumes of zzso necrosis with fewer zzso insertions than is produced with other zzso zzso zzso
