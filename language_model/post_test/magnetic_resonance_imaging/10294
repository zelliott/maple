zzso of the cervical spine during lateral zzso were investigated using a novel system of three-dimensional motion zzso 

To demonstrate in zzso zzso coupled motions of the cervical spine during lateral zzso of the zzso 

No previous studies have successfully documented in zzso three-dimensional zzso motions of the cervical spine during lateral zzso 

Twelve healthy volunteers underwent three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the cervical spine in 7 positions with 10 degrees increments of lateral zzso Relative motions of the cervical spine were calculated automatically by zzso a segmented zzso of the vertebra in the neutral position over images of each position using volume zzso 

Mean maximum lateral zzso of the cervical spine to one side was zzso degrees to zzso degrees at each zzso zzso zzso rotation opposite to lateral zzso was observed in the upper cervical levels zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso degrees ), while in the zzso cervical levels, it was observed in the same direction as lateral zzso except for at zzso zzso zzso motion was small at all zzso levels zzso zzso 

We succeeded in identifying in zzso coupled motions of the cervical spine in lateral zzso for the first zzso
