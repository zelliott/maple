There is evidence that anterior zzso zzso zzso function is related to individual differences in zzso An important question regards how early such zzso associations zzso We examined the relationship between cortical folding patterns of the zzso which are functionally relevant and primarily determined by birth, and individual differences in four core temperament dimensions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to zzso 153 zzso zzso early adolescents as displaying a zzso zzso rightward zzso or zzso pattern of zzso zzso as zzso by the zzso and extent of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso pattern of zzso folding was associated with significantly higher temperamental zzso Control and lower zzso zzso than a rightward zzso zzso Further, this difference was significant only for zzso Across males and zzso a zzso pattern was associated with higher temperamental zzso than was a rightward zzso pattern of zzso zzso These findings suggest that early zzso processes contribute to individual differences in zzso They also illustrate sexual zzso in the neural zzso of zzso
