The spatial relationship between an zzso zzso zzso focus and cortical zzso on zzso PET has not been precisely zzso In order to zzso evaluate the hypothesis that zzso seizure onset and/or rapid seizure zzso detected by zzso zzso monitoring, commonly involves zzso zzso adjacent to zzso cortical regions, we applied a novel, zzso zzso mapping approach in 14 children with zzso zzso zzso The zzso brain surface was zzso into finite cortical elements zzso and zzso was defined using zzso and zzso asymmetry zzso derived from normal adult zzso The severity and location of zzso areas zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were compared on the zzso brain zzso zzso was more severe in the seizure onset zone than in cortical areas covered by zzso zzso However, similar proportions of the onset zzso were located over and adjacent to zzso 2 zzso zzso regions zzso zzso zzso respectively), whereas rapid seizure spread zzso preferred these zzso zzso rather than the zzso area itself zzso zzso zzso On average, zzso of the zzso regions had no early seizure zzso These findings strongly support that the seizure onset zone often extends from zzso to adjacent zzso cortex, while large portions of zzso zzso are not involved in seizure onset or early zzso The clinical utility of zzso PET in guiding zzso zzso placement in zzso zzso could be greatly enhanced by extending grid coverage to at least 2 zzso beyond zzso cortex, when zzso
