Driving while intoxicated is a major public health zzso We investigated impaired driving using a simulated driving skill game that presents an zzso view of a road and a zzso of zzso We explored brain zzso and behavioral zzso from baseline at two blood alcohol zzso zzso Participants received zzso individualized doses of zzso alcohol designed to produce blood alcohol content zzso of zzso and zzso or zzso zzso occurred on a zzso zzso Philips zzso scanner after training to zzso zzso Analysis was performed using independent component analysis zzso to isolate systematically zzso zzso and their time zzso Imaging results revealed seven separate zzso brain networks with different time zzso Several significant findings were observed for the imaging zzso First, zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso changes were revealed in zzso zzso and motor (but not zzso zzso visual and zzso frontal regions were zzso Second, zzso regions were significantly associated with driving behavior in a zzso zzso Finally, a global disruptive effect of alcohol on the zzso time courses was observed with highly significant differences in OF and motor zzso Alcohol thus demonstrated some behavioral effects and unique, zzso zzso effects on zzso signal within several brain zzso The zzso data also suggest that the deficits observed in alcohol intoxication may be modulated primarily through zzso cingulate, motor and zzso regions as opposed to zzso areas in zzso zzso
