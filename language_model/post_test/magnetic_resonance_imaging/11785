Our purpose was to investigate the role of diffusion imaging zzso in central nervous system zzso infections in pediatric zzso It was anticipated that zzso would be more sensitive than conventional zzso in the detection of the zzso complications of infection, and zzso in the detection of the infectious process as zzso zzso pediatric patients, eight having zzso five with zzso encephalitis, three with brain zzso or zzso and one with zzso were evaluated at zzso with zzso All zzso patients had positive zzso at the site of zzso involvement, and two had the addition of watershed zzso zzso demonstrated more zzso in three of the four cases of zzso zzso Half the meningitis cases had watershed zzso where zzso was better and half had zzso zzso in which zzso was equal to or better than conventional zzso zzso imaging was more sensitive than conventional zzso alone in detection of changes due to infections and zzso zzso but did not differentiate between them by zzso or apparent diffusion zzso zzso although zzso distribution of zzso proved zzso
