The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between vascular and zzso characteristics of breast zzso in zzso using zzso dynamic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso PET zzso Twenty patients with large or locally advanced primary breast zzso were zzso prior to zzso zzso data were acquired using a dynamic zzso echo sequence and zzso using two zzso zzso zzso PET data were acquired in zzso zzso A significant association ( zzso was observed between the calculated exchange rate zzso of both zzso models and calculated PET zzso dose zzso ratios zzso zzso analysis showed that the exchange rate zzso can explain between 27 and zzso of the zzso observed in the PET zzso zzso zzso A relationship was demonstrated between the vascular and zzso characteristics of primary breast zzso showing that any assessment of zzso zzso activity using PET may be controlled at least in part by delivery of zzso agent due to the vascular characteristics of the zzso zzso and PET provide methods of assessing breast zzso zzso and metabolism in zzso using the exchange rate zzso of dynamic zzso and zzso of zzso respectively, these measures being related but not zzso
