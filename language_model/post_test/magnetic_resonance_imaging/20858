The aim of this study was to compare the zzso utility of a staging system using magnetic resonance imaging zzso with the seventh American Joint Committee on Cancer zzso staging system in patients with zzso zzso zzso who underwent zzso zzso 

A total of 175 consecutive patients with zzso who underwent zzso zzso zzso after zzso between January 2000 and December 2007 were zzso In lieu of zzso invasion, which is used by the zzso staging system, we devised an zzso staging system in which a size criterion of 2 zzso was used to differentiate between tumor stages 1 and zzso All patients were zzso staged using the seventh zzso staging system and the zzso zzso staging zzso zzso in zzso and overall survival rates between different stages by the zzso and zzso staging systems were analyzed using the zzso method with zzso zzso The zzso accuracy of the 2 staging systems was directly compared using the zzso receiver operating characteristic curve zzso 

Median follow-up period was zzso zzso During the follow-up period, 74 zzso patients experienced tumor recurrence and 22 zzso zzso The median zzso survival and overall survival were zzso and zzso weeks, zzso Both staging systems were excellent for the prediction of zzso survival across different tumor stages but failed to predict overall survival differences between stages 1 and zzso For zzso and overall zzso the zzso receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed no significant differences in zzso accuracy between the 2 staging zzso 

A zzso zzso staging system using a size threshold instead of zzso invasion may predict the prognosis of zzso patients undergoing zzso zzso as accurately as the seventh zzso zzso staging zzso
