Among mass zzso causing zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso disc zzso are very rare, with only four such cases reported in the zzso 

A 77-year-old woman with this rare condition complained of motor and sensory disturbances in her zzso zzso resonance imaging scans demonstrated an zzso mass zzso at the zzso zzso zzso the lower zzso zzso and the upper cervical zzso zzso 

The zzso which was partly zzso zzso and partly fatty and zzso was meticulously removed via a left zzso zzso The zzso was not zzso but was determined to be composed of zzso zzso consistent with disc zzso zzso the patient's sensory disturbances and motor weakness improved, and magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated marked shrinkage of the zzso 

zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated a zzso band between the zzso process and the body of the zzso which suggested a persistent zzso zzso Although upward migration of a zzso disc from the lower cervical spine and zzso of zzso ligaments might be possible causes, a persistent zzso band extending between the zzso process and the body of the axis was considered to be the more likely origin of the zzso zzso disc zzso Because the zzso surgical approach does not require zzso of the cervical zzso and provides safe access to the zzso at the zzso zzso it is a suitable surgical method for this zzso
