To evaluate whether degree of inflammatory activity in multiple zzso expressed by frequency of zzso enhancement, has zzso value for development of zzso zzso on zzso zzso magnetic resonance images, a putative marker of tissue zzso 

zzso design with long-term zzso zzso patients with multiple sclerosis who in the past had been monitored with monthly zzso magnetic resonance imaging for a median period of 10 months zzso zzso zzso were zzso after a median period of zzso months zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso Center for Multiple zzso Research, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, referral zzso 

The new enhancing zzso rate zzso number of zzso zzso per monthly zzso during initial monthly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso load at first and last zzso 

The number of enhancing zzso on entry scan correlated with the new enhancing zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rank correlation zzso The new enhancing zzso rate correlated with yearly increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rank correlation zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rank correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso load correlated more strongly with yearly increase in zzso zzso load zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rank correlation zzso 

Degree of inflammatory activity only partially predicted increase in zzso (and zzso zzso load at long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso load strongly contributed to subsequent increase in zzso zzso zzso load, suggesting that there is a zzso of patients with multiple sclerosis who are prone to develop destructive zzso
