zzso episodes associated with zzso zzso have previously been attributed to zzso within the zzso zzso causing zzso 

A 22-year-old woman with a zzso zzso zzso presented with acute left zzso Brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso demonstrated a vascular zzso of the right cerebral zzso consistent with zzso zzso There was mild zzso of the right zzso zzso While in hospital she developed zzso complex partial zzso Repeat brain zzso showed a diffusion zzso affecting the right zzso with an increase in the degree of zzso There was no evidence of zzso on cerebral zzso The patient's zzso deficit and acute zzso changes subsequently zzso 

Although cerebral zzso could potentially demonstrate zzso causing large vessel zzso it is unlikely to have the resolution to detect stasis at a zzso zzso zzso stasis with zzso zzso is the likely zzso mechanism in this zzso
