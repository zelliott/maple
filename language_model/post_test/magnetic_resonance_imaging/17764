Of the seven zzso dominant genetically distinct forms of zzso so far zzso in only four the zzso gene has been identified zzso We describe clinical, zzso and muscle zzso features of a large zzso zzso with zzso presenting zzso and zzso muscle zzso We obtained complete clinical data and graded the progression of the disease in 29 zzso Muscle zzso was performed in seven zzso Three muscle zzso from two patients were zzso Patients with age at onset in the early zzso had a more severe zzso with a rapid disease course; adult onset patients presented a slow zzso Muscle zzso showed prominent zzso of lower limb muscles, involving especially the zzso zzso zzso the patients population resulted in the identification of previously zzso features, including zzso zzso and respiratory zzso Muscle zzso showed diffuse zzso zzso which evolved with time, chronic zzso changes, zzso zzso areas, zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is characterized by a selective involvement of limb muscles with respiratory impairment in advanced zzso and by different degrees of clinical zzso Novel clinical features emerged from the investigation of additional zzso
