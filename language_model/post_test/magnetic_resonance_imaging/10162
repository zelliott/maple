A new method for zzso zzso and cerebral shape and asymmetry fits zzso zzso geometric models to three-dimensional coordinate zzso zzso is zzso as zzso zzso of the surface data points from their zzso zzso zzso Twenty human zzso 10 magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso surfaces, and 10 corresponding zzso cerebral surfaces as well as two infant head casts were digitized and modeled using zzso zzso parameters have simple geometric zzso are very zzso and demonstrated statistically significant differences between zzso of zzso ancestry and zzso zzso surfaces of European ancestry used in this zzso zzso models demonstrated strong zzso between zzso zzso and cerebral zzso Typical asymmetry was zzso zzso Lastly, polar zzso plots of zzso zzso for head casts before and after zzso zzso demonstrated the efficacy of using zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of infant zzso
