The human brain is thought to process auditory objects along a zzso zzso zzso stream that progressively abstracts object information from the low-level structure zzso zzso as processing proceeds along the zzso zzso zzso demonstrations of abstract object zzso independent of low-level structure, have relied on speech zzso and zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso human zzso often lack a systematic assessment of low-level information zzso zzso are highly zzso It is currently unknown whether abstract zzso constitutes a general functional principle that operates for auditory objects other than zzso We combined zzso analyses of functional imaging data with an accurate analysis of the low-level zzso information to examine the abstract zzso of zzso zzso We observed abstract zzso of the living and zzso sound categories in the zzso spatial distribution of activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Abstract zzso of auditory objects appears to extend to zzso biological sounds and to operate in regions other than the anterior zzso zzso zzso processes for the abstract zzso of auditory objects might have facilitated the emergence of speech categories in our zzso
