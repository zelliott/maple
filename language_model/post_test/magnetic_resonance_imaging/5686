zzso risk factor exposure increases zzso zzso and blood pressure in humans and animal zzso however, limited insight has been gained as to zzso zzso 

We investigated the effects of zzso Na exposure zzso versus zzso zzso regular rat zzso on vascular disease outcomes using the zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso rat model of zzso coronary zzso zzso Rather than the expected increase in coronary heart disease, fetal zzso Na exposure zzso or zzso g of Na per zzso zzso induced zzso stroke in both sexes zzso zzso with earlier stroke onset in zzso zzso Analysis of later onset of zzso Na exposure resulted in decreased stroke risk and later stroke onset despite longer zzso Na exposure zzso which indicates increasing risk with earlier onset of zzso Na zzso zzso analysis of zzso rat brains revealed cerebral cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso rat brains detected cerebral zzso zzso and zzso with middle cerebral artery distribution and zzso zzso zzso zzso detected carotid artery zzso zzso analysis detected zzso zzso and decreased mass of isolated cerebral but not zzso zzso 

zzso Na exposure exacerbated hypertension and unmasked stroke zzso with greater female vulnerability in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso modeling in zzso zzso rats of carotid artery disease, cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests a zzso spectrum with zzso zzso This zzso spectrum could represent zzso of zzso transformation and/or a zzso basis for the association of zzso zzso zzso and strokes in zzso Together, the data reveal zzso Na exposure to be a significant modifier of hypertension and stroke disease course and hence a potentially modifiable prevention target that deserves systematic zzso
