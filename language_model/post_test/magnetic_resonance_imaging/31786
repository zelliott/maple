In this in zzso study, we investigated the influence of different load situations on zzso cartilage thickness in individuals with zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso and Swiss zzso Centre zzso zzso 

A previously validated three-dimensional zzso zzso echo zzso with selective water zzso was zzso Three groups were zzso individuals with zzso with high shoulder demand zzso individuals with zzso with reduced load on the shoulder joint zzso and a control group zzso After zzso zzso the mean cartilage zzso local thicknesses zzso zzso zzso and the minimum joint space were zzso 

The mean zzso cartilage thickness zzso zzso as well as the minimum joint space zzso zzso did not differ between zzso In individuals with zzso the superior cartilage thickness was significantly greater than in individuals with zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso In the control group, there was a significant negative correlation between mean cartilage thickness and age zzso 

Neither higher shoulder demand nor reduced shoulder loading leads to thinning of zzso zzso It is hypothesized that higher local stresses prevent local cartilage zzso as in normal load situations zzso cartilage thinning is occurring with zzso Furthermore, joint space narrowing was only associated with inferior cartilage thickness and cartilage thickness is not related to shoulder zzso
