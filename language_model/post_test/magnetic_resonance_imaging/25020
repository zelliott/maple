zzso zzso characterized by unexplained difficulty in reading, is associated with behavioral deficits in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have shown a deficit in the neural mechanisms underlying zzso processing in children and adults with zzso The present study examined whether behavioral zzso ameliorates these dysfunctional neural mechanisms in children with zzso zzso zzso was performed on 20 children with zzso zzso years old) during zzso processing before and after a zzso program focused on auditory processing and oral language zzso zzso training improved oral language and reading zzso Physiologically, children with zzso showed increased activity in multiple brain zzso zzso occurred in left zzso zzso and left inferior frontal zzso bringing brain zzso in these regions closer to that seen in zzso zzso Increased activity was observed also in zzso frontal and zzso regions and in the anterior zzso zzso Children with zzso showed a correlation between the magnitude of increased zzso in left zzso zzso and improvement in oral language zzso These results suggest that a partial zzso of zzso deficits, resulting in improved reading, ameliorates disrupted function in brain regions associated with zzso processing and produces additional zzso zzso in other brain zzso
