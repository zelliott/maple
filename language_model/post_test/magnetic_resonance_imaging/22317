We investigated the effect of zzso on the initiation and propagation of spreading zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by focal cerebral zzso in zzso zzso zzso were monitored during the initial 15 minutes after remotely induced middle cerebral artery zzso zzso using serial diffusion weighted magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso were calculated and zzso decreases were monitored over zzso zzso rats zzso zzso 6) had a significant zzso of the time from induction of zzso to the start of the zzso decrease as compared with zzso control zzso The time to the zzso zzso decrease was significantly delayed and recovery of transient zzso declines in the area adjacent to the zzso core was significantly faster in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso delays the terminal zzso in the zzso core and supports a faster zzso in severely zzso zzso tissue after zzso which reflects the increased availability of energy zzso in the state of zzso
