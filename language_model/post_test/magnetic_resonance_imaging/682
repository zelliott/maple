zzso sensory memory is needed to zzso shape or motion from the zzso pattern of sensory input during manual zzso Here we applied triplets of pressure zzso to the fingertips of subjects who were asked to respond when successive triplets were the same zzso zzso or when a particular stimulus was included in a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences (30 zzso zzso with rest blocks (30 zzso and functional magnetic resonance images zzso were acquired in a zzso zzso During the zzso task, we found enhanced zzso in inferior zzso cortex, supplementary motor area zzso and right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso of zzso is likely to be related to the attempt to memorize the stimulus sequences and zzso of zzso and inferior zzso zzso to the analysis of zzso tactile patterns and, more generally, to guidance of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was seen in anterior zzso zzso possibly related to the high mental effort required by the comparison zzso Our rhythmic tactile stimulus as such, without any zzso enhancement, activated also left zzso and zzso left) zzso supporting the idea that these structures are related to perception of zzso order of tactile zzso
