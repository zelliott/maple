The objective of this study was to compare the relative zzso of bone zzso on zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso MR sequences for breast, prostate and myeloma zzso 

44 zzso zzso scans were reviewed zzso zzso zzso zzso STIR and zzso with zzso On each zzso up to four of the largest bone zzso were identified on zzso zzso and the region of interest signal intensity was measured on STIR and zzso as well as the background signal zzso The mean zzso signal to background ratio was calculated for each patient and then for each zzso zzso 

In prostate cancer patients, the zzso zzso ratio was greater than that of STIR in 22 out of 24 patients zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso mean STIR zzso ratio zzso zzso In multiple zzso the zzso ratio was higher in zzso patients zzso group mean ratio zzso STIR group mean ratio zzso zzso In 13 breast cancer patients, mean STIR and zzso zzso were similar zzso group mean ratio zzso group mean STIR ratio zzso zzso 

Bone zzso zzso measured by zzso signal intensity was higher on zzso zzso than on STIR in patients with prostate cancer and multiple zzso zzso should be used in zzso MR zzso protocols in these conditions to zzso zzso zzso
