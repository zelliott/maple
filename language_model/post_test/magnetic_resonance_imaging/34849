To investigate zzso zzso and clinical differences between delusional and zzso zzso 

A zzso study of depressed zzso 

Melbourne, zzso 

zzso subjects zzso over the age of 55 meeting zzso criteria for major depression of whom 22 had delusional zzso of zzso 

Clinical assessment, including documentation of vascular risk zzso zzso assessment by the Cambridge zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso scans were performed on a zzso zzso scanner with zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso and deep white matter zzso zzso rated visually on 4-point zzso A standard 1 zzso zzso suppression test zzso was zzso 

zzso with delusional depression had significantly more vascular risk factors than those without zzso There were no differences in measures of zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso results or cognitive test scores, though there was a zzso trend for zzso to be more prevalent in those with zzso zzso depression was associated with a shorter duration of history and more frequent treatment with zzso 

The increase in vascular risk factors and trend towards greater zzso on zzso suggests an organic contribution to delusional depression in the zzso In contrast to some previous reports, we found no differences in cortical zzso appearance or neuroendocrine measures between zzso
