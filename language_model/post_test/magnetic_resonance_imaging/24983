To assess the effect of aging on the proportions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the brains of elderly women and zzso 

A zzso plane above the zzso of the brain was mapped with magnetic resonance zzso zzso were performed in zzso with zzso healthy subjects (age range, zzso years; mean age, 73 zzso and were repeated 4 years later zzso Student zzso tests were used for statistical zzso 

zzso analysis of the changes in 4 years zzso zzso reproduced the decrease in zzso in women only zzso per year, P zzso that had been indicated with zzso correlation zzso zzso in zzso though significant in both men and women according to age correlation analyses zzso zzso for zzso did not reach zzso The resulting sex difference in the zzso ratio at a mean age of 77 years, while not yet significant at a mean age of 73 years, was especially manifest in the zzso half of the plane zzso 

zzso sex differences in zzso ratios in a zzso plane indicate that brain zzso levels differ between women and men at advanced zzso
