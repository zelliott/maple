To assess whether a zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso sequence can improve the accuracy of fast zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging in the staging and zzso of prostate zzso 

In 57 patients with prostate cancer, MR imaging was performed with the following zzso zzso SE, zzso fast SE, zzso zzso dynamic zzso zzso (one image every zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two blinded independent readers graded onset and zzso slope of enhancement and assessed tumor involvement and zzso zzso MR findings were correlated with zzso zzso 

On zzso images, prostate cancer was characterized by early and rapidly accelerating enhancement compared with that of surrounding zzso Average sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for detection of tumor involvement for the two readers with zzso images were zzso zzso and zzso These values with fast zzso images were zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso penetration and zzso and staging of tumor were better when zzso images were included with fast zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso however, were not statistically zzso 

Because the zzso sequence did not statistically significantly improve tumor zzso and staging results, routine use is not zzso The technique may be useful for selected patients with zzso evidence of zzso zzso
