Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in humans, we identified regions of zzso involved in the zzso of limb zzso zzso stimulation of the right hand, across the body zzso activated the right zzso zzso when the eyes were zzso zzso shifted to a left zzso network when the eyes were zzso These data reveal important similarities between human and zzso primates in the network of brain areas involved in the zzso representation of limb zzso
