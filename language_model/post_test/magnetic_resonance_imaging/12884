zzso zzso have previously been shown to promote recovery in animal models of stroke using ex zzso outcome measures which have raised the hopes for a potential clinical zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential zzso properties of a novel zzso zzso zzso in 2 different models of transient focal zzso stroke of varying zzso using both in zzso zzso and zzso techniques as primary outcome zzso For these studies, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso as a positive control to further assess the effectiveness of the stroke models and techniques zzso 

In contrast to zzso no significant therapeutic effect of zzso on zzso volume in either the zzso zzso or zzso thread model of stroke was zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso volume in both zzso the mild zzso zzso condition zzso zzso zzso and the zzso thread model, although it had no significant impact upon the zzso size in the severe zzso zzso condition zzso zzso zzso These therapeutic effects on zzso size were mirrored on a zzso test for sensory neglect and neurological deficit score in the zzso thread zzso 

This study highlights the need for a thorough experimental design to test novel zzso compounds in experimental stroke investigations zzso a positive reference compound, different models of focal zzso varying the duration of zzso and objective in zzso assessments within a single zzso This procedure will help us to zzso the translation of less zzso zzso
