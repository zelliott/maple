Previous studies have provided evidence of structural and zzso functional changes in the brains of patients with migraine without zzso zzso brain activity in patients with migraine provides clues to the zzso of the zzso However, few studies have focused on the zzso abnormalities in patients with migraine without zzso In the current study, we employed a zzso method, regional zzso zzso to analyze the local features of spontaneous brain activity in patients with migraine without aura during the resting zzso Twenty-six patients with migraine without aura and 26 zzso zzso and zzso healthy volunteers participated in this zzso Compared with healthy controls, patients with migraine without aura showed a significant decrease in zzso values in the right zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso the prefrontal zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the supplementary motor area zzso In addition, we found that zzso values were zzso correlated with the duration of disease in the right zzso and zzso Our results suggest that the zzso abnormalities of these regions may be associated with functional zzso in pain processing in patients with migraine without zzso We hope that our results will improve the understanding of zzso
