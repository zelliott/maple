To discuss the technical details of a head mounted display with an zzso reality zzso system and to describe a first zzso evaluation in zzso zzso 

The zzso system consists of a zzso head mounted display zzso mounted with a mini video camera for tracking and a stereo pair of mini cameras that capture live images of the zzso The live video view of the zzso is zzso with zzso representations of anatomical structures from zzso image data and is displayed on the zzso The application of the zzso system with zzso zzso was tested using a zzso data set of the head and a head zzso 

The zzso enables the user to move around and observe the scene zzso from various zzso Within a short time the natural hand-eye coordination can easily be adapted to the slightly different zzso The zzso perception is based on stereo and kinetic depth zzso A circular target with a diameter of zzso square zzso was hit in 19 of 20 zzso In a first evaluation the zzso image data zzso reality scene of a head phantom allowed good planning and precise simulation of a zzso 

The zzso in combination with zzso provides a zzso intuitive guidance for zzso MR zzso
