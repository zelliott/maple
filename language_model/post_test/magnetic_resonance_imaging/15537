Although it is assumed that cerebral zzso during exercise is influenced by both zzso function and cerebrovascular zzso the latter factor has not been fully zzso In the present study the relationship between the degree of cerebrovascular zzso and cerebral zzso during exercise was zzso 

A total of 109 patients zzso patients with coronary artery disease, 40 patients with zzso heart disease) zzso zzso performed a zzso exercise test with respiratory gas zzso zzso From the respiratory gas analysis, peak zzso zzso zzso the slope of the increase in zzso to the increase in work rate zzso zzso and the slope of the increase in ventilation to the increase in zzso output zzso slope) were zzso zzso zzso at the forehead was monitored using zzso zzso The brain zzso score was counted based upon zzso inversion recovery images of magnetic resonance imaging and expressed from 0 to zzso When compared with patients with a lower zzso score zzso zzso those with a higher zzso score zzso or zzso zzso had a lower increase in brain zzso during exercise zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso Of brain zzso score, left zzso ejection zzso peak zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be the sole independent index determining cerebral zzso during zzso The zzso parameters were also significantly related to the degree of cerebrovascular zzso 

Although cerebral zzso during exercise is mainly related to zzso function, the degree of cerebrovascular zzso partly influences cerebral zzso in patients with risk factors for zzso
