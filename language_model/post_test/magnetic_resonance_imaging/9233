This work examines the efficacy of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso for language zzso using a comprehensive zzso zzso zzso Two zzso methods and four different metrics for zzso zzso within zzso are compared and validated with Wada zzso Sources of zzso between zzso and Wada zzso are discussed with respect to specific patient zzso 

zzso language mapping was performed in patients with zzso (N zzso 40) using reading sentence zzso auditory sentence zzso and a verbal zzso zzso This was compared with the Wada procedure using both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Different zzso scores were examined as a function of statistical threshold to investigate the sensitivity to threshold zzso 

For the zzso patients zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with the Wada procedure results in zzso patients for the reading task, zzso patients for the auditory task, zzso patients for the verbal zzso task, and in zzso patients for the conjunction zzso The patients zzso as bilateral via the Wada procedure showed some zzso dominance in zzso and discrepancies between the Wada test findings and the functional zzso scores arose for a range of zzso 

zzso was dependent upon whether zzso or zzso exclusion zzso zzso was zzso and in the former case the inclusion of the zzso and other zzso regions often zzso influenced the zzso zzso zzso zzso was in agreement with the Wada test in zzso of patients, suggesting its utility for clinical use with the proper consideration given to the confounds discussed in this zzso
