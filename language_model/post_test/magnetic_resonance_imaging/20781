The zzso mental state for psychosis zzso has been associated with abnormal structural brain dynamics underlying disease transition or zzso To date, it is unknown whether these dynamic brain changes can be predicted at the zzso level prior to disease transition using zzso zzso zzso 

First, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was used to investigate patterns of zzso changes over time in 25 zzso individuals versus 28 healthy controls zzso zzso irrespective of the clinical outcome and zzso according to illness transition or zzso Then, the baseline zzso data were employed to predict the expression of these zzso changes at the individual level using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso revealed a pattern of pronounced zzso changes in zzso versus HC that affected predominantly the right zzso as well as the zzso zzso and zzso structures zzso and that was more pronounced in the zzso versus the zzso zzso The zzso analysis facilitated a reliable prediction of these zzso brain changes in individual zzso training cases zzso vs zzso zzso zzso HC vs zzso vs zzso zzso zzso by relying on baseline patterns that involved zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso 

zzso brain changes over time may zzso an elevated vulnerability for psychosis and may be most pronounced in subsequent zzso to zzso zzso zzso techniques may facilitate an accurate prediction of these structural brain zzso potentially allowing for an early recognition of individuals at risk of developing zzso zzso changes over zzso
