To establish the quantitative MR diagnostic criteria for zzso lateral zzso MR imaging of 60 knees with zzso confirmed zzso lateral zzso and zzso knees with zzso lateral zzso were zzso Following four quantitative parameters were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The minimum zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to the zzso zzso The ratio of minimum zzso zzso to maximum zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso coverage of the zzso zzso The ratio of the sum of the zzso of the anterior and zzso horns to the zzso diameter on the zzso slice showing the maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso of the anterior and zzso horns zzso The number of consecutive zzso slices showing continuity between the anterior and zzso horns of the zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso values of each zzso to discriminate between the zzso and zzso zzso were calculated based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity were also calculated for each of 4 parameters and combinations of these zzso The zzso value was 15 zzso for the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso for the zzso and 3 slices for the zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the four parameters ranged between zzso and 50% and between zzso and zzso zzso The most accurate diagnostic criterion was either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso or the zzso zzso or zzso zzso and the sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso respectively, even when torn zzso were zzso
