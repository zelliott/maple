Late morbidity and mortality remain problematic after repair of zzso of zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso detected by late zzso enhancement zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso would be present in adults with repaired zzso and would be related to adverse markers of zzso 

zzso was scored in the right and left zzso zzso and zzso of 92 adult patients who had undergone zzso zzso RV zzso was seen in all patients at surgical sites located in the zzso tract zzso or the site of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the inferior RV zzso point zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was located at the zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso in the inferior or lateral wall consistent with zzso zzso or in other areas zzso Patients with zzso RV zzso score were older zzso versus 27 years, zzso and more symptomatic zzso versus zzso in New York Heart Association class II or greater, zzso had increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and had a trend to higher brain zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso exercise intolerance zzso zzso 24 versus 28 zzso zzso RV dysfunction zzso zzso volume 61 versus 55 zzso zzso RV ejection fraction 50% versus zzso zzso and clinical zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also correlated with markers of adverse zzso In a zzso model, RV zzso remained a predictor of zzso 

RV and zzso zzso were common after zzso repair and were related to adverse clinical zzso including zzso dysfunction, exercise zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, RV zzso was significantly associated with clinical zzso
