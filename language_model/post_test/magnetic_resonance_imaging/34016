zzso after replacement of diseased heart valves with mechanical zzso have been shown to be related to the zzso zzso to the zzso For this reason, the zzso patterns have been disclosed in zzso with a variety of different zzso This study introduces a magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso technique, which zzso easy acquisition of fluid zzso field data with a high accuracy and spatial zzso 

A zzso magnetic resonance scanner equipped with short echo time zzso zzso measurement software was applied in a detailed mapping of the zzso zzso profile across the entire vessel area at two positions downstream of a zzso valve zzso inserted in a zzso flow system in zzso The zzso zzso forces were calculated from the fluid zzso field zzso 

The zzso profiles very close to the valve reflected the zzso design as also shown in previous studies, but the extent and zzso of the jet emanating from the slit between the leaflets were clearly better zzso However, one diameter downstream of the valve the central jet was completely dispersed and the zzso complexity was significantly zzso zzso and retrograde flow regions that might be relevant for understanding typical long-term complications after zzso were observed close to the zzso 

In one scan experiment the presented method provides information on flow characteristics that previously required application of different types of zzso Thus, the method seems promising as a new technique for detailed and extensive mapping of the zzso and zzso zzso stresses downstream of prosthetic heart valves in zzso
