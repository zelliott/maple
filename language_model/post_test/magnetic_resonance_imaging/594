To test the hypothesis that gut stimulation provokes zzso zzso via zzso of regional cerebral zzso How the human brain processes zzso signals and forms initial zzso zzso is one of the key questions to be answered in research on zzso 

Twelve healthy males participated in this zzso A zzso bag was inserted in the zzso and zzso inflated with 0, 20, or 40 zzso zzso at random for 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the brain, zzso and blood sampling for catecholamines were zzso Changes in regional cerebral blood flow were interpreted using statistical zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with 40 zzso zzso induced a significant increase in heart rate, low frequency zzso frequency zzso ratio of heart rate zzso and plasma zzso zzso brain areas that were associated with increased heart rate during zzso zzso were the right zzso right zzso right zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso thalamus, zzso gray, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas those that were associated with an increased zzso ratio were the bilateral zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso brain areas that were associated with increased plasma adrenaline were the right zzso right zzso cortex, right zzso zzso zzso thalamus, zzso gray, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that the right zzso and the related body mapping regions may form the functional module of sympathetic zzso in response to gut zzso
