To evaluate the natural progression and the impact of zzso in zzso zzso and to correlate these changes with the profile of genetic zzso 

The mean tumor diameter zzso of zzso zzso was evaluated on serial magnetic resonance images before zzso zzso zzso zzso and after zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso growth zzso were correlated with zzso zzso loss and zzso zzso in the zzso 

Before zzso zzso zzso increased zzso over time, indicating a continuous growth that was significantly slower in zzso deleted tumors zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso and in tumors that did not zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso During zzso treatment, almost all patients zzso experienced initial decrease of zzso zzso some tumors started to resume growth despite continuous administration of zzso with a lower rate of zzso in zzso deleted tumors zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso and in tumors that did not zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso When zzso was discontinued in the absence of tumor zzso a majority of tumors resumed their progressive growth within a zzso 

zzso zzso zzso grow continuously at a rate that is influenced by the genetic zzso of the zzso zzso reverses this pattern at the zzso but this effect is often brief in patients whose tumors zzso zzso and do not harbor the zzso zzso suggesting acquired zzso A majority of tumors will resume their growth when treatment is zzso raising the issue of the optimal duration of treatment in continuously responding zzso
