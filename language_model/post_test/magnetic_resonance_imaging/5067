Previous research in zzso King Charles zzso zzso has found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are associated with a volume mismatch between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the brain zzso contained zzso The objectives of this study were to zzso compare zzso volume in zzso (a zzso zzso group which frequently develops zzso small breed dogs zzso zzso develop zzso and zzso zzso zzso not zzso zzso evaluate a possible association between increased zzso volume and zzso in zzso zzso investigate the relationship between increased zzso volume and crowding of the zzso in the zzso part of the zzso zzso the region of the zzso zzso Volumes of zzso magnetic resonance imaging derived models of the zzso and zzso were obtained from 75 zzso 44 small breed dogs, and 31 zzso As zzso is thought to be a late onset disease process, two zzso were formed for zzso 18 zzso younger than 2 years with zzso zzso zzso and 13 zzso older than 5 years without zzso zzso zzso Relative zzso volume was defined as the volume of the zzso divided by the total volume of brain zzso Our results show that the zzso has a relatively larger zzso than small breed dogs and zzso and provide evidence that increased zzso volume in zzso is associated with crowding of zzso in the zzso part of the zzso In zzso there is an association between increased zzso volume and zzso These findings have implications for the understanding of the pathological mechanisms of zzso and support the hypothesis that it is a zzso disease process governed by increased zzso volume and failure of the zzso to reach a commensurate zzso
