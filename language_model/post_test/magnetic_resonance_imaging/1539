To our knowledge, no published functional map of the human lower zzso zzso Our purpose was to use zzso functional MR imaging zzso to zzso the location of zzso nerve zzso zzso and other zzso zzso and cervical spinal zzso zzso by using specific sensory stimulation or motor zzso 

We localized zzso by using zzso analysis of regional blood oxygen zzso zzso signal intensity during specific motor and sensory procedures based on known functions of specific zzso zzso zzso mapping zzso analysis was used for zzso Head, zzso and respiratory motion artifact correction was zzso zzso zzso aided zzso 

We obtained evidence of zzso of the following zzso by using tests, as zzso main zzso sensory zzso zzso brushing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso eye zzso facial zzso zzso smiling and lip zzso zzso zzso zzso pushing the tongue against the hard zzso nucleus zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso tasting a zzso zzso nucleus zzso finger zzso and cervical spinal zzso levels zzso tongue movement to activate the strap zzso zzso of cortical motor and sensory areas and zzso zzso corresponded with the tasks and sites of zzso zzso Head movement was zzso typically less than 1 zzso in all three zzso 

With zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso and other zzso of the lower zzso and cervical spinal cord, can be localized in awake humans with specific sensory stimulation or motor zzso
