The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of zzso zzso MR imaging of the female zzso 

Ten healthy female volunteers were examined on a zzso zzso MR system zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso body zzso The examination protocol included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso echo zzso zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For qualitative image analysis pelvic zzso zzso zzso anatomy and image impairment due to zzso was assessed using a zzso zzso For quantitative analysis contrast ratios between the zzso zone and zzso were obtained for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso offered the best overall image quality zzso zzso and highest tissue contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging provided a moderate to high zzso of the zzso zzso anatomy with mean scores ranging from zzso for zzso to zzso for zzso zzso image impairment was rated strongest for zzso zzso zzso and least for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrated the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso of the female pelvis and current constraints associated with zzso zzso 

zzso Dynamic zzso female pelvis MR imaging at zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso offers inherent zzso zzso of pelvic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provided best overall image quality and least zzso zzso
