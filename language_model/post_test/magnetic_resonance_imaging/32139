To investigate the role of the zzso index measured with zzso color zzso zzso zzso for assessing the zzso response of cervical zzso and to compare it with magnetic resonance zzso 

A total of 13 patients with advanced stage cervical zzso zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso exams 6 months prior to and 6 months after zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso obtained from the central and peripheral zones of the tumor were zzso These values were also compared with zzso findings and zzso zzso obtained from the control zzso 

zzso masses could be zzso in all patients with zzso zzso prior to the zzso zzso zzso before and after treatment were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Eleven out of 13 patients responded to the treatment completely and no mass was detected in zzso and zzso zzso were performed in areas with flow within the zzso zzso A residual mass was noted in 2 patients with zzso and zzso There was a statistically significant difference between complete response to the treatment and increased zzso zzso zzso In 2 patients with residual masses, no increase in zzso zzso was zzso The mean zzso index of the control group was zzso and the difference was statistically significant compared to the zzso zzso of the patients prior to the zzso 

Since there was a significant correlation between the zzso findings and zzso zzso the spectral parameters obtained with zzso were a good alternative to such an expensive zzso as zzso in the evaluation of the response of cervical cancer to the zzso
