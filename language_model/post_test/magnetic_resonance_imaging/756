To investigate the cerebral organization for language production across the particular channels supporting linguistic behavior, a functional magnetic resonance zzso study was conducted in deaf native users of American Sign Language zzso and zzso hearing zzso Seven native zzso speakers and 15 vocal English speaking subjects covertly performed an object naming task inside the 4 T scanner using their native languages zzso or English, zzso In subjects of both groups, classical language areas were found to be zzso including zzso zzso area, the anterior zzso zzso cortex, and the zzso parts of the superior zzso zzso zzso showed a predominance of the left zzso for both zzso In the deaf group, however, there was markedly larger involvement of the zzso the inferior frontal zzso and the zzso zzso and more robust zzso in zzso and superior zzso zzso In zzso it could be demonstrated by zzso that native language production using zzso is associated with zzso of classical language areas, although the neural organization for language processing is not identical in the two language zzso zzso and English zzso
