The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of sparing zzso or bilateral neural stem cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso circuit during partial brain zzso zzso 

Treatment plans were generated for five zzso high-grade zzso five zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso (12 zzso For each, standard zzso zzso zzso plans were generated, as well as zzso plans which spared zzso zzso zzso or bilateral zzso zzso zzso circuit, zzso and zzso zzso equivalent dose for late effects zzso zzso was generated for zzso circuit, zzso and zzso zzso cent relative reduction in mean physical dose and zzso was calculated for each plan zzso zzso zzso 

We were able to reduce physical dose and zzso zzso to these critical structures by zzso and zzso zzso 

It is possible to spare zzso zzso circuit, zzso and zzso during zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso using zzso and to spare the zzso zzso during zzso for zzso zzso zzso This approach may reduce late cognitive zzso of zzso zzso
