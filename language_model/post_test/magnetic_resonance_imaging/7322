Patients with repaired zzso of zzso zzso experience increased rates of mortality and morbidity in zzso This study was designed to identify risk factors for death and zzso zzso zzso in a large contemporary cohort of patients with repaired zzso 

zzso with repaired zzso from four large zzso heart zzso in the USA, Canada and Europe were zzso zzso zzso exercise, cardiac magnetic resonance zzso and outcome data were zzso 

Of the 873 patients zzso age zzso zzso 32 zzso reached the primary outcome zzso deaths, 4 sustained zzso median age at outcome 38 years; median time from zzso to outcome zzso zzso Cox zzso zzso identified RV zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and history of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso as outcome zzso RV dysfunction was zzso of the outcome similar to zzso zzso In zzso analysis of 315 subjects with zzso assessment of RV zzso pressure, higher pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was associated with death and sustained VT independent of RV zzso and zzso zzso 

RV zzso zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso are zzso of death and sustained VT in adults with repaired zzso These findings may inform risk zzso and the design of future therapeutic zzso
