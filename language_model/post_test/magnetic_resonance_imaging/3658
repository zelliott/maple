Women with anorexia zzso zzso have zzso zzso about food and altered activity in prefrontal cortical and zzso regions to food zzso However, differential effects on the brain when thinking about eating food between healthy women and those with AN is zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso examined neural zzso when 42 women thought about eating the food shown in zzso 18 with AN (11 zzso 7 zzso and 24 zzso controls zzso 

Group contrasts between HC and AN revealed reduced zzso in AN in the bilateral zzso zzso and increased zzso in the right visual zzso zzso comparisons between AN zzso and healthy controls suggest differences in cortical and zzso zzso 

These preliminary data suggest that thinking about eating food shown in images increases visual and prefrontal cortical neural responses in females with zzso which may zzso cognitive biases towards food stimuli and zzso about controlling food zzso Future studies are needed to explicitly test how thinking about eating activates restraint zzso specifically in those with restricting zzso zzso AN zzso
