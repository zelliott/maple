zzso and zzso relaxation, and zzso transfer zzso of the rat brain were measured during zzso induced spreading depression zzso All measured MR parameters changed during zzso zzso relaxation increased by approximately zzso whereas the zzso increase was substantially larger zzso zzso results showed an zzso ratio zzso decrease of zzso The lack of change in the zzso exchange rate indicated that the zzso processes between water and zzso zzso are not affected by zzso zzso The observed decrease in zzso was only caused by changes in zzso and zzso zzso
