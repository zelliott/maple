zzso zzso growth factor zzso plays a key role in the development of cerebral zzso as a major zzso of zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether the zzso gene zzso were associated with the risks of acute cerebral zzso 

We examined the distribution of three single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the promoter and coding region of the zzso gene in DNA samples from 147 Chinese patients with acute cerebral zzso and 131 control zzso 

There was no significant difference in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with the risk of acute cerebral zzso when compared with zzso However, zzso analysis from the zzso three zzso showed that zzso zzso was significantly lower in patients with acute cerebral zzso zzso than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggested that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was associated with the risk of acute cerebral zzso with an OR of zzso and it may reduce the risk of acute cerebral zzso through the regulation of zzso zzso
