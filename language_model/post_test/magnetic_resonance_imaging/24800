Dynamic alignment of zzso & zzso is a risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament injury and is possibly influenced by zzso knee zzso range of zzso rotation and zzso plateau zzso 

zzso healthy women were classified into zzso neutral and zzso groups based on zzso alignment of their zzso A zzso motion analysis was carried out for a single limb drop zzso The range of zzso rotation and zzso zzso slope angle was measured by zzso zzso among the 3 groups and correlation between the angles was analyzed during zzso 

The differences between the zzso and lateral zzso zzso slope angles were greater zzso also range of internal zzso rotation for the zzso group zzso and, for the zzso group, the zzso angle zzso The zzso angle correlated significantly with the zzso rotation angle zzso zzso and the range of zzso rotation correlated with the variations between the zzso and lateral zzso zzso slope angles zzso zzso 

The range of zzso zzso zzso zzso slope and zzso angle varied according to whether the knee was in zzso or zzso with the range of zzso rotation dependent on the zzso zzso slope zzso The greater the zzso angle became, the smaller the internal zzso rotation was, acting in a kinetic zzso The results suggest that zzso alignment of the knee may be zzso as a predictor for potential problems that occur during zzso
