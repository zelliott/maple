Recent progress in diffusion imaging has lead to zzso acquisitions of fiber orientation data in the beating zzso Current methods are however limited in resolution to a few zzso zzso For this particular application and others where the diffusion volume is zzso partial or even damaged, the reconstruction of a complete volume can be zzso To address this problem, we present two complementary methods for fiber reconstruction from sparse orientation zzso both of which derive from zzso properties related to fiber zzso as described by zzso connection zzso The first is an zzso partial volume reconstruction method based on principal component analysis of the connection forms and is best put to use when dealing with highly damaged or sparse zzso The second is an intrinsic method based on zzso zzso of the connection forms on zzso shells and is advantageous when more slice data becomes zzso Using a database of 8 cardiac rat diffusion zzso images we demonstrate that both methods are able to reconstruct complete volumes to good accuracy and lead to low reconstruction zzso
