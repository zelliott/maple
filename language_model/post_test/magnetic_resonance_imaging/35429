In this paper the authors analyzed the clinical and zzso outcomes of patients with cerebral zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso surgery zzso focusing on the analysis of the radiation injury rate depending on the zzso zzso 

Between 1997 and 2004, 277 consecutive patients with cerebral zzso were treated with zzso Of these patients, 218 were followed up for zzso 2 zzso The mean age was 31 zzso 15 years, the median zzso volume was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the median marginal dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean follow-up duration was 44 zzso 20 zzso The authors reduced the prescription dose by various zzso depending on the zzso volume and location as prescribed in the classic zzso to avoid irreversible radiation zzso 

The zzso obliteration rate was zzso overall, and it was zzso zzso and zzso for small, zzso and large zzso zzso The overall annual bleeding rate was zzso The annual bleeding rate was zzso and zzso for small and large zzso zzso zzso zzso of the patients showed severe zzso imaging zzso zzso The rate of zzso change was zzso zzso and zzso for small, zzso and large zzso volume groups, respectively, and a permanent radiation injury developed in zzso of zzso 

By using the reduced dose from what is usually zzso the authors were able to obtain outcomes in small zzso that were comparable to the outcomes described in previous zzso However, medium zzso appear to still be at risk for adverse radiation zzso zzso in large zzso the authors were able to attain a tolerable rate of radiation zzso however, the clinical outcomes were quite disappointing following administration of a reduced dose of zzso for large zzso
