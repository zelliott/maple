The optimal treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in children is yet to be zzso There is a general consensus that surgical zzso results in a definitive resolution of the zzso The main aim of surgery is to remove affected zzso so that they do not discharge through the zzso Recently there are some investigators who are reporting successful zzso treatment and advocating medical therapy as the first line zzso 

16 children zzso presenting to zzso in a zzso referral zzso over an zzso period with zzso zzso criteria were chronic zzso zzso with either: zzso a culture positive for zzso zzso (from either a zzso zzso or fine needle zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso identified (from either a zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso post zzso zzso findings consistent with zzso infection zzso zzso zzso in the absence of other clinical features suggestive of other zzso zzso zzso with superficial skin change were treated zzso with zzso Children presenting with zzso zzso contained deep to zzso were assessed with zzso zzso and zzso analysis and zzso or CT, and treated zzso with antibiotics or watchful zzso 

4 children (2 culture positive, 2 with zzso zzso on needle zzso presented with zzso deep to zzso and were managed zzso All 4 resolved without zzso zzso 11 children with a clinical presentation of zzso underwent complete zzso of all involved zzso for superficial zzso (6 were culture positive, and all had zzso zzso None zzso 1 patient presented late with a mature, discharging zzso zzso which was managed with watchful waiting as the zzso was clinically close to natural zzso 

zzso at presentation may help decide which patients with zzso can be treated zzso without zzso zzso We propose that a watch and wait management is an option for deep zzso
