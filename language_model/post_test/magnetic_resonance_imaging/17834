In zzso trials testing treatments for acute zzso stroke, imaging markers of tissue zzso and zzso zzso may provide early response zzso 

To determine the zzso value of zzso zzso and zzso imaging for early and late clinical outcomes and assess zzso in three comprehensive stroke zzso 

We recruited patients with potentially disabling stroke in three stroke zzso performed magnetic resonance zzso or CT, including zzso and zzso imaging, within 6 zzso at 72 h and 1 month after zzso We assessed the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso score serially and functional outcome at 3 months, tested associations between clinical variables and structural imaging, several zzso parameters and zzso 

Among 83 patients, median age 71 zzso zzso median zzso 7 zzso zzso 38 zzso received zzso 41 zzso had died or were dependent at 3 zzso Most baseline imaging was CT zzso follow-up was MR zzso despite both being available zzso At zzso zzso zzso size varied considerably between parameters zzso 40 zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso and baseline zzso zzso extent were both associated with baseline zzso zzso zzso by 72 h was associated with 1 month zzso zzso and 3 month functional outcome zzso whereas tissue zzso using even the best zzso zzso was not zzso zzso zzso 

Early zzso on zzso appeared to predict clinical outcome more directly than did tissue zzso Acute assessment with CT and follow-up with MR was practical and zzso did not zzso image analysis, and would enhance trial recruitment and zzso of zzso
