To evaluate efficacy and safety of a zzso iron oxide contrast agent zzso as an zzso contrast medium for magnetic resonance zzso zzso in a phase III zzso zzso patients with history of known or suspected small zzso Crohn's disease underwent MR imaging of the abdomen at zzso T zzso The imaging protocol included two zzso the first one without administration of any contrast agent and the second one, where the small zzso was filled by zzso with 800 zzso of the zzso iron oxide contrast medium and zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and Short zzso zzso Recovery zzso sequences were subsequently zzso Three investigators blindly evaluated images to determine small zzso distribution of zzso presence of artifacts, zzso of zzso zzso and the diagnostic value of zzso combined with zzso zzso and zzso signal intensity zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and background noise were also zzso Three patients withdrew before the zzso therefore 20 patients were effectively included in the zzso No significant difference between the three zzso evaluations of the improvement of the diagnostic information was found zzso of improvement of zzso with zzso confidence limits of zzso and zzso A statistically significant difference between the first and third investigators was found for grading of quality of zzso of zzso zzso Signal intensity measures showed a significant increase of the zzso zzso and background zzso for the zzso zzso zzso No serious adverse event was reported in our zzso MR zzso using zzso as an zzso contrast agent appears to be a safe and efficient procedure for the study of the small zzso
