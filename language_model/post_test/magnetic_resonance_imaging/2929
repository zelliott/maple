We report and discuss the imaging features of 8 cases of spontaneous unilateral adrenal zzso a rare zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was done in 8 cases, magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 5, and CT and zzso in zzso Imaging findings were reviewed and correlated with zzso findings in all 8 zzso 

zzso was the most accurate imaging zzso and showed variable zzso On pathological evaluation the zzso were old and zzso No contrast enhancement was noted on CT or zzso 

One must not consider the diagnosis of spontaneous adrenal zzso only as superimposed on a zzso or zzso zzso in the case of an zzso discovered large adrenal mass with normal biological zzso zzso signs of adrenal zzso and the failure of enhancement of such a mass should strongly suggest adrenal zzso
