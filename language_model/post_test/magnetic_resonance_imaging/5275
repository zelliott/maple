To evaluate the zzso zzso and accuracy of cerebral blood flow zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in typically developing zzso 

Institutional review board approval with zzso compliance and informed consent were zzso Twenty-two children aged zzso years underwent repeated zzso examinations 2-4 weeks apart with a zzso MR zzso along with in zzso blood zzso and zzso transit time zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was performed as the reference standard for global blood flow zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso zzso of variation zzso were used to evaluate accuracy and zzso 

The accuracy of zzso against the reference standard of PC MR imaging increased on incorporating zzso in zzso blood zzso measurement zzso zzso vs zzso The zzso further increased to zzso by using a zzso model of blood zzso Additionally, zzso zzso with use of zzso demonstrated a moderate to good level of zzso zzso in whole brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in gray matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and across 16 brain regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso transit time was zzso zzso zzso 123 zzso zzso in the pediatric cohort zzso which showed an increasing trend with age zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso changes in blood zzso is important for improving the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso in children and zzso the zzso nature, zzso and zzso zzso should facilitate the use of zzso zzso MR imaging in zzso zzso
