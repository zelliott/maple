Previous studies examining explicit semantic processing have consistently shown zzso of the left inferior frontal zzso zzso In contrast, implicit semantic processing tasks have shown zzso in zzso areas including the superior zzso zzso zzso and the middle zzso zzso zzso with less consistent zzso in the zzso These results raise the question whether the functional role of the zzso is related to those processes needed to make a semantic decision or to processes involved in the extraction and analysis of zzso This study examined neural zzso patterns during a semantic judgment task requiring overt semantic analysis, and then compared these zzso patterns to previously obtained results using the same zzso related and unrelated word pairs in a zzso decision task which required only implicit semantic processing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso investigation of implicit semantic zzso Journal of zzso zzso 15, zzso The behavioral results demonstrated that the tasks were equivalent in zzso zzso results indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso showed greater zzso for zzso unrelated than related word pairs across the two zzso zzso of the two task types across conditions revealed greater zzso for the semantic judgment task only in the zzso zzso and not in the zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso is recruited similarly in the service of both the zzso decision and semantic judgment zzso The increased zzso in the zzso in the semantic judgment task reflects the greater depth of semantic processing required in this task and indicates that the zzso is not simply a passive store of zzso information but is involved in the active retrieval of this zzso
