Although previous zzso clinical trials established a basis for zzso guidelines worldwide, they employed fixed doses of statins throughout trials zzso zzso In the real clinical setting, however, zzso doses are zzso to achieve target zzso zzso cholesterol zzso levels zzso zzso The major objective was to investigate whether intensive zzso therapy using the zzso approach yielded greater zzso of zzso zzso 

We therefore performed a zzso zzso trial comparing the effects of standard zzso zzso levels recommended by the Japanese guidelines) and intensive zzso zzso lower zzso levels than zzso zzso therapy for 1 year in 60 zzso patients with a primary zzso of zzso zzso plaques evaluated by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Average doses were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for standard zzso zzso 29) and intensive therapy group zzso zzso 31), zzso Although both therapies significantly reduced zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso levels, zzso reduction was significantly greater in the intensive group zzso zzso zzso zzso study showed that zzso zzso plaques were significantly zzso in both groups, with greater zzso of zzso plaque in the intensive group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso plaque zzso was significantly correlated with zzso reduction, but not with changes in serum zzso zzso function, or doses of zzso 

zzso zzso therapy with zzso targeting lower zzso levels resulted in greater zzso zzso plaque zzso compared to standard therapy, which was correlated with zzso reduction, suggesting that intensive zzso therapy could provide better clinical zzso
