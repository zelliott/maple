To assess by magnetic resonance imaging zzso if adult zzso bone zzso stem cells accelerate zzso healing in the zzso tunnel, after hamstring anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso 

zzso patients underwent zzso reconstruction and were zzso zzso into two groups: 20 patients in the experimental group zzso zzso with adult zzso bone zzso stem cells and 23 patients in the control group zzso zzso without adult zzso bone zzso stem zzso All patients underwent zzso of the knee at three months after surgery to evaluate the zzso ratio of the zzso 

There was no difference in the zzso ratio of the zzso on zzso between the experimental and the control zzso 

Adult zzso bone zzso stem cells do not seem to accelerate zzso healing in zzso zzso The clinical relevance of this finding is that adult zzso bone zzso stem cells apparently have a limited role in zzso zzso
