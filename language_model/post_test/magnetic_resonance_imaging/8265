zzso zzso develop due to zzso and zzso changes triggered by the combined effects of mechanical zzso zzso and zzso that occur during extended periods of zzso The goal of this study was to test the effectiveness of a novel electrical stimulation technique in the prevention of deep tissue injury zzso We propose that zzso zzso by intermittent electrical stimulation zzso in muscles subjected to constant pressure would induce periodic relief in internal zzso zzso each contraction would also restore blood flow to the zzso The application of constant pressure to the zzso muscles of rats generated a zzso that affected 60 zzso zzso of the compressed muscle as assessed by magnetic resonance zzso In contrast, in the groups of rats that received zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the muscle was limited to 16 zzso 16 and 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso to the muscle was zzso by zzso In an experiment with a human zzso zzso of the zzso reduced the zzso level of the muscles by approximately zzso after zzso zzso levels increased by approximately zzso beyond zzso zzso the surface pressure profiles of the loaded muscles were redistributed and the zzso points were reduced during each zzso zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso significantly reduces the amount of zzso by increasing the oxygen available to the tissue and by zzso the pressure profiles of the loaded zzso This presents a promising technique for the prevention of pressure zzso in immobilized and/or zzso zzso
