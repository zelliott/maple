To compare the MR signal intensity patterns and enhancement pattern of zzso zzso with their zzso zzso 

MR images of six patients with surgically proved zzso zzso were reviewed zzso and were compared with zzso findings of the zzso zzso zzso zzso examination was performed to look for the extent and characteristics of zzso zzso fibrosis, and inflammatory cellular infiltrates at each area of different signal zzso and at the enhancing areas on zzso Signal zzso for zzso and zzso images were compared with normal gray zzso 

On zzso images, the zzso showed a slightly zzso rim surrounded by a complete or partial rim of slight zzso and central zzso or mixed zzso and zzso in five patients and homogeneous zzso in one zzso zzso the zone of central zzso or mixed intensity corresponded to zzso necrosis plus adjacent cellular zzso The zzso and zzso rims corresponded to the layers of zzso fiber and the layers of the inflammatory cellular zzso zzso On zzso images, the entire portion of the zzso showed slightly zzso zzso or zzso with small markedly zzso zzso in five patients, and a zzso center surrounded by a zzso rim in one zzso zzso layers were not zzso on zzso zzso On zzso zzso images, there were single or multiple conglomerate ring enhancements within a zzso in all six patients, corresponding to the layers of both zzso and inflammatory zzso 

Combination of the described signal intensity patterns and conglomerate zzso enhancing appearance of the zzso is characteristic of zzso and may play an important role in zzso zzso zzso from other zzso brain zzso
