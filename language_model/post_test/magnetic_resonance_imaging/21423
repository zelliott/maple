zzso memory provides information about the zzso of events as well as zzso and zzso they zzso Using functional imaging, we investigated the domain specificity of zzso processes following zzso of complex, zzso zzso zzso watched a zzso TV episode, and zzso later, made zzso choices of scenes from the clip during zzso zzso were presented with two scenes and required to either choose the scene that happened earlier in the film zzso or the scene with a correct spatial arrangement zzso or the scene that had been shown zzso We identified a retrieval network zzso the zzso lateral and zzso zzso cortex, middle frontal and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and angular zzso are associated with zzso zzso with zzso activity zzso zzso with zzso distance between two zzso at zzso A zzso zzso network engages during spatial zzso while zzso zzso regions activate during zzso zzso We propose that access to episodic memory traces involves different processes depending on task zzso These include zzso within an zzso knowledge structure in the zzso zzso zzso online maintenance of spatial information in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and combining zzso spatial and zzso information in the zzso zzso zzso Our findings support the proposal of zzso zzso of zzso
