The zzso and zzso zzso rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced zzso techniques have been proposed to reduce the effect of head zzso zzso results have shown that zzso also reduces zzso artifacts from zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to compare zzso zzso acquired with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the detection of contrast enhancement in a phantom and in patients with suspected brain zzso and to compare the degree of zzso artifacts in the zzso A phantom filled with diluted zzso was scanned in addition to 27 zzso In the phantom study, the peak zzso ratio of zzso zzso was larger than that of zzso and the position of the peak was shifted to a lower zzso In patients, the degree of zzso artifacts was significantly higher in zzso Among the 27 patients, 9 had zzso zzso and 18 did zzso On a zzso basis, the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of zzso zzso on zzso zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, while on zzso zzso zzso they were zzso and zzso zzso zzso seems to be capable of replacing zzso at least for zzso zzso imaging to detect brain zzso
