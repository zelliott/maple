Using a zzso memory zzso the anatomical zzso of spatial location zzso and retrieval in the healthy human brain as reflected by zzso zzso were zzso During zzso subjects were instructed to view and keep in mind different locations of an object on a platform seen from different viewpoints in virtual zzso In retrieval trials, subjects had to recognize previously learned object zzso Comparing zzso patterns associated with zzso and recognition on a zzso basis, we found regions in the zzso zzso activated by both zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study that directly compared human brain zzso patterns associated with zzso zzso and retrieval of spatial locations in virtual zzso Our results provide further information concerning the role of the zzso in zzso memory zzso pointing to zzso involvement in zzso and retrieval of spatial zzso
