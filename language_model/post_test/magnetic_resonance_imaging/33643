To evaluate zzso patients with PA for zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso to detect presence of aneurysm at the repair zzso 

All patients who underwent PA at the zzso institution were zzso zzso was performed in zzso and long axis zzso views on all patients except those who had, or were going to have, zzso zzso for other zzso Details of the surgical procedure were obtained from the hospital zzso
