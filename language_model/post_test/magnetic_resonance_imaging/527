The zzso provides a zzso assessment of varying degrees of zzso Visual zzso zzso the ability to identify simple stimuli inserted into more complex ones according to their exact geometrical properties in a limited span of zzso zzso analysis of stimuli dealing with the exact discrimination of size and dimension is related more to mathematical abilities zzso while zzso analysis of direction and spatial orientation is related more to abilities in reading and reading comprehension zzso Some stimuli are MIXED since they deal with both of the above features zzso We previously determined the distributed zzso network of zzso visual zzso processes as measured by the zzso Here, we aim at further assessing as to how brain activity is zzso modulated by the discrimination of very subtle zzso zzso zzso Brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 young healthy subjects while they performed a zzso version of the zzso zzso results of the present study indicate that performance was not different among stimulus zzso However, brain functional data show that zzso zzso processes for zzso zzso and MIXED stimuli rely on partially distinct brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and prefrontal regions along with the anterior zzso appeared to be more activated by zzso zzso while zzso stimuli predominantly activated bilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the right inferior frontal zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso showed a higher activity specifically for MIXED zzso Altogether, these findings demonstrate that in the zzso the exact discrimination of very subtle zzso relationships between geometrical stimuli distinctly zzso cerebral activity, so that zzso brain responses can be related to identifiable cognitive zzso
