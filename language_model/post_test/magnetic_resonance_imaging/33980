Our purpose was to determine the characteristic MR features of zzso zzso age 2 zzso versus zzso (after age 2 zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 

Thirty-four brain MR images in 22 patients with zzso were zzso A severity score zzso to zzso based on a point system derived from the location and extent of disease and the presence of focal and/or global zzso was calculated for each zzso 

Of the 22 patients, three were zzso and 19 were zzso Ten patients had zzso disease, whereas nine had zzso zzso MR images of all patients showed zzso In the zzso group zzso zzso 10; mean maximum MR score, zzso range, zzso zzso had zzso tract involvement, zzso had zzso white matter involvement, zzso had deep gray matter involvement, zzso had zzso corpus zzso involvement, 50% had zzso white matter involvement, and zzso had cerebral zzso zzso MR imaging in four of these patients revealed progressive zzso In the zzso group zzso zzso 9; mean maximum MR score, zzso range, zzso zzso had zzso tract involvement, zzso had zzso white matter involvement, zzso had zzso corpus zzso involvement, and none had zzso white matter involvement, deep gray matter involvement, or cerebral zzso zzso MR imaging in one patient with zzso zzso did not reveal any zzso A spectrum of findings was observed in the three patients who were zzso 

zzso white matter and deep gray matter involvement are present only in zzso zzso zzso tract involvement is a characteristic finding in both zzso and zzso zzso This scoring method for brain MR observations will assist in the objective assessment of the impact of zzso stem cell transplantation in patients with zzso
