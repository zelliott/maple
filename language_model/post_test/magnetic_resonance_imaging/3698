zzso zzso of zzso studies point to at least two major zzso subdivisions within the anterior zzso that contribute to the detection and processing of salient information: a zzso region that is routinely active during attention tasks and a zzso region that is routinely active during affective zzso In two independent samples of cognitively normal human adults, we used intrinsic functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate that the right zzso and right zzso anterior zzso are zzso in zzso large-scale functional zzso Furthermore, stronger intrinsic connectivity within the right zzso anterior zzso network was associated with better performance on a task involving attention and processing speed whereas stronger connectivity within the right zzso anterior zzso network was associated with more intense affective zzso These results support the hypothesis that the identification and manipulation of salient information is zzso by at least two brain networks anchored in the right anterior zzso that exhibit distinct large-scale topography and zzso behavioral zzso
