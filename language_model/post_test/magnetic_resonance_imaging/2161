In this paper, we present a novel zzso for fuzzy zzso of magnetic resonance imaging zzso data and zzso of intensity zzso using fuzzy zzso zzso intensity zzso can be attributed to imperfections in the zzso coils or to problems associated with the acquisition zzso The result is a slowly varying zzso artifact over the image that can produce errors with conventional zzso zzso Our zzso is formulated by zzso the objective function of the standard fuzzy zzso zzso zzso to compensate for such zzso and to allow the labeling of a zzso zzso to be influenced by the labels in its immediate zzso The neighborhood effect acts as a zzso and biases the solution toward zzso zzso Such a zzso is useful in zzso scans corrupted by salt and pepper zzso Experimental results on both synthetic images and MR data are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed zzso
