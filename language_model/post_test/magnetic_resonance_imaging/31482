The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic efficacy of zzso zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso for revealing small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with 37 zzso zzso size: zzso zzso that were diagnosed by zzso zzso zzso zzso or imaging findings zzso zzso 10) underwent two separate zzso dynamic zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Three observers interpreted both zzso in terms of zzso detection using the zzso response receiver operating characteristic method and zzso contrast using matched pairs zzso The two zzso were also compared zzso by measuring the zzso ratio zzso of the liver and zzso as well as the zzso zzso ratio zzso The zzso of the liver and zzso and zzso zzso with zzso were better than those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in terms of the diagnostic accuracy zzso zzso for zzso zzso and mean zzso for zzso zzso zzso the sensitivity zzso positive zzso value zzso zzso zzso and zzso contrast, the two dynamic zzso were zzso zzso showed a superior degree of enhancement for zzso zzso than did zzso zzso but the diagnostic capabilities of the two agents for revealing zzso were zzso
