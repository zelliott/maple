To describe magnetic resonance zzso imaging features in patients with proved zzso zzso disease and to compare these features with those in a matched group of patients with proved zzso in zzso to determine the accuracy with which MR imaging can be used to distinguish between the two zzso 

Seven patients with zzso zzso disease underwent MR imaging with a body zzso The site and zzso of zzso were noted, with particular reference to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso canal zzso and any enteric zzso zzso was made with 14 zzso and zzso patients with zzso in zzso zzso zzso were compared to calculate differences between the groups and sensitivities, zzso and zzso zzso 

All patients with zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso but five zzso had zzso at zzso sites more characteristic of zzso in zzso Eight patients with zzso in zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso that was thought characteristic of zzso zzso No patient with zzso zzso had zzso zzso or an enteric communication, in contrast to all patients with zzso in zzso having both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reached the subcutaneous zzso zzso the zzso and zzso in only one patient with zzso zzso in contrast to six zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging had a sensitivity of zzso (six of zzso specificity of zzso zzso of zzso positive zzso value of zzso (six of zzso and negative zzso value of zzso zzso of zzso for diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso 

MR imaging features of zzso and zzso zzso characteristic of zzso in zzso are also found in patients with zzso zzso but the absence of zzso zzso or enteric opening allows reliable MR imaging distinction between the zzso
