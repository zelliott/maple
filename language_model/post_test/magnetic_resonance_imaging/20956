zzso analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in zzso to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical zzso In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the zzso Imaging Network zzso initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment zzso zzso analysis is an important component contributing to zzso and efficiency of the quantitative imaging zzso The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to zzso zzso zzso is a free zzso software application for medical image zzso As a clinical research zzso zzso zzso is similar to a zzso zzso that supports versatile zzso but also provides advanced functionality such as automated zzso and registration for a variety of application zzso Unlike a typical zzso zzso zzso zzso is free and is not tied to specific zzso As a programming platform, zzso zzso zzso translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the zzso of the zzso and providing zzso for the common tasks of data communication, zzso and user interface zzso Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this zzso zzso zzso is fully open source and can be readily extended and zzso In addition, zzso zzso is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we present an overview of zzso zzso as a platform for zzso development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research zzso To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of zzso we discuss several use cases of zzso zzso by the existing zzso teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging zzso using zzso zzso
