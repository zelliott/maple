We performed zzso potential recording with dissected snail zzso inside an zzso scanner to investigate correlation between zzso activity and MR image zzso To increase zzso activity we applied a zzso oxide zzso zzso to the zzso The MR image intensity change in the zzso region is correlated with the zzso activity and was up to zzso Since the snail has zzso zzso as oxygen carrying zzso it seems that the image intensity change is mainly due to the local magnetic fields produced by the zzso zzso
