zzso zzso transplantation may depend on accurate zzso zzso zzso is currently determined by measuring a combination of zzso landmarks and zzso zzso points through images obtained zzso or by magnetic resonance imaging zzso The literature widely reports inaccuracy in zzso resulting from zzso errors in zzso erroneous identification of zzso landmarks, and difficulty in zzso between the zzso and bone zzso In our zzso zzso we have observed that when the height and weight of the recipient matched those of the zzso the zzso size appeared to be a match at surgical zzso we designed this study to confirm this zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso of 111 patients zzso male and 38 female zzso mean age, 44 years zzso 15 to 76 zzso totaling 147 zzso zzso lateral and 60 zzso was compared with the zzso weight, zzso and body mass index zzso of each zzso zzso scans were obtained with a zzso zzso system zzso Medical Systems, Wilmington, zzso zzso was performed by an independent musculoskeletal zzso zzso as established by the zzso zzso methods include zzso zzso correlation zzso between zzso lateral zzso zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso plateau zzso and patient zzso weight, zzso and zzso zzso at the P zzso zzso level was zzso 

Height was found to have a linear relationship to total zzso zzso which has a good zzso correlation with zzso dimensions of r zzso zzso Female patients generally present with smaller dimensions than male zzso zzso groups present with significantly larger zzso dimensions than zzso groups at any given zzso 

zzso weight, and gender are easily obtained variables and are zzso to zzso tissue zzso These exploratory statistics establish correlations between zzso weight, zzso total zzso plateau zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso weight, and gender should be considered by both tissue banks and surgeons as fast and cost-effective variables by which to predict zzso zzso
