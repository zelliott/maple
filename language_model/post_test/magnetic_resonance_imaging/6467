Little is known about the different patterns of fetal cerebral zzso zzso at MR zzso Our purpose was to evaluate the contribution of MR imaging in the evaluation of such zzso by zzso the results with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

We examined 28 fetuses zzso 28 zzso zzso with cerebral zzso zzso on zzso zzso MR findings were correlated with US and zzso results with regard to the depiction of zzso and zzso zzso 

MR imaging added to US findings in 24 cases by revealing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results were either overlooked during US zzso zzso zzso or more extensive than expected with US zzso zzso zzso MR findings were always confirmed by zzso zzso yielded additional findings for 14 zzso that were overlooked during MR imaging zzso zzso 4) or that were more extensive than expected with MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR patterns of different zzso zzso zzso softening of the white matter, zzso zzso zzso zzso old zzso were zzso 

MR imaging is a valuable tool in the evaluation of fetal brain zzso The results of this study emphasize the role of the different sequences zzso zzso zzso required to detect fetal cerebral zzso zzso MR imaging is more accurate in the detection of small focal zzso than in the evaluation of diffuse white matter zzso
