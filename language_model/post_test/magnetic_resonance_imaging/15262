zzso zzso injury zzso is a common mechanism of traumatic brain injury zzso for which there is no zzso zzso measures of injury zzso The present study aims to zzso assess zzso by measuring white matter zzso volume visible in zzso inversion recovery zzso weighted images and to determine whether higher zzso volumes are associated with zzso functional outcome 6 months after zzso zzso patients who experienced moderate to severe zzso without zzso or major cortical zzso were included in this zzso zzso volume was assessed by zzso areas of zzso in the white matter utilizing digitized zzso zzso Two independent zzso processed the magnetic resonance zzso images and determined the total zzso zzso zzso outcome was assessed at 6 months after injury using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation analyses showed very high zzso reliability for each measure between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Total zzso volume was significantly, although zzso correlated to zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso White matter zzso volume resulting from zzso can be zzso and reliably assessed from standard zzso zzso Patients with greater zzso volume have poorer functional zzso These methods may be useful in zzso injury severity and for the assessment of zzso zzso
