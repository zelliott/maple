zzso and hallucinations are classic positive symptoms of zzso A contemporary cognitive theory called the zzso output zzso suggests that the zzso of zzso actions may zzso some of these types of symptoms, such as delusions of control - the experience of zzso action being controlled by an external zzso In order to examine the zzso of this zzso we performed a zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study examining zzso zzso associated with motor movement during acute zzso 

We studied brain zzso using zzso during a motor task in 11 patients with schizophrenia and 9 healthy zzso The patient group was tested at two time points separated by zzso zzso 

At initial testing, the patient group had a mean Positive and zzso zzso zzso score of zzso and showed significantly increased zzso within the left inferior zzso lobe zzso compared to zzso Patients reported significantly decreased positive symptoms at zzso week followup and zzso zzso had returned to zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso positive symptoms are associated with zzso in the secondary zzso zzso zzso 

These findings lend further zzso to the theory that a dysfunction in the sensory feedback system located in the zzso and which is thought to zzso our sense of agency, may contribute to the zzso of delusions of zzso
