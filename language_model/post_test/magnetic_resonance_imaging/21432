Observing someone perform an action engages brain regions involved in motor planning, such as the inferior zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso Recent research suggests that during action zzso activity in these neural regions can be modulated by membership in an ethnic group defined by physical zzso In this study we expanded upon previous research by matching physical similarity of two different social groups and investigating whether zzso of an zzso member zzso activity in neural regions involved in action zzso zzso Jewish subjects were zzso with biographies of eight individuals, half of the individuals belonged to zzso groups zzso and half of which did not zzso All subjects and actors in the stimuli were Caucasian and physically zzso The subjects then viewed videos of actors portraying the characters performing simple motor actions zzso grasping a water bottle and raising it to the zzso while undergoing zzso Using zzso pattern analysis zzso we found that a zzso trained on brain zzso patterns successfully zzso between the likable and zzso action observation conditions within the right zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that the spatial pattern of activity in action observation related neural regions is modulated by zzso even when watching a simple action such as reaching for a zzso These findings lend further support for the notion that social factors such as interpersonal liking zzso zzso processing in zzso zzso
