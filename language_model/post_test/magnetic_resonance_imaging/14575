Patients with schizophrenia exhibit zzso in working memory that often appear in attenuated form in persons at high risk for the zzso The authors hypothesized that zzso in zzso brain zzso and zzso would occur in persons with an zzso mental state performing a working memory task that entailed the maintenance and manipulation of zzso 

Participants at ultra high risk for developing psychosis zzso identified using the Comprehensive Assessment of zzso Mental States, and healthy comparison subjects zzso 14 to 29 years of age underwent functional zzso while performing a verbal working memory zzso Group differences in brain zzso were identified using analysis of zzso 

The two groups did not show significant differences in speed or accuracy of performance, even after accounting for differences in zzso zzso of task condition, zzso participants exhibited significantly less zzso than healthy comparison subjects in the left anterior zzso During letter zzso zzso persons exhibited greater zzso zzso within the zzso network than comparison zzso zzso analysis in the zzso group revealed significantly greater right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso during manipulation of zzso 

Despite comparable behavioral performance, zzso participants performing a verbal working memory task exhibited altered brain zzso compared with healthy zzso These findings demonstrate an altered pattern of brain zzso in zzso persons that contains elements of reduced function as well as zzso
