Although there is widespread agreement that the zzso is critical for explicit episodic memory zzso it is controversial whether this region can also support indirect expressions of zzso memory when explicit retrieval zzso Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with concurrent zzso zzso memory measures, we obtained evidence that zzso activity predicted expressions of zzso memory in subsequent patterns of viewing, even when zzso conscious retrieval zzso Additionally, activity in the lateral prefrontal zzso and functional connectivity between the zzso and prefrontal zzso were greater for correct than for incorrect zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso activity can support the expression of zzso memory even when explicit retrieval fails and that recruitment of a broader cortical network may be required to support explicit zzso zzso
