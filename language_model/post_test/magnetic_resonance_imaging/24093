Among the zzso imaging zzso contrast enhanced magnetic resonance zzso imaging is the most powerful tool with which to zzso zzso Common pathology only shows zzso density, whereas dynamic MR imaging is sensitive to the total zzso surface area of zzso zzso zzso dynamic MR imaging may be of additional value in tumor staging and in evaluating therapies that affect the zzso zzso density or surface area, such as zzso radiation, or zzso zzso In urinary zzso cancer, this technique results in improved local and zzso staging, in improved separation of zzso zzso tissue and zzso from zzso zzso and in improved evaluation of the effect of zzso In prostate cancer, dynamic MR imaging may be of help in problematic zzso This technique can assist in determining seminal zzso zzso in depicting of minimal zzso zzso and in recognizing tumors within the transitional zzso Also, based on very rapid enhancement, very poorly differentiated tumors can be zzso zzso of the effects of therapy is another promising area, however a lot of research remain to be zzso This article reviews some basics of fast enhancement techniques, provides practical information, and shows recent developments, in using these fast techniques for staging and grading of zzso and prostate cancer, and for evaluating the effect of zzso
