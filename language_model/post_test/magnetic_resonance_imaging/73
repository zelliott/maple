Although the utility of two-dimensional zzso zzso tracking zzso zzso to zzso left zzso zzso volume has been demonstrated, this methodology is limited by zzso views, geometric zzso and the assumption that zzso can be tracked from frame to frame, despite their out of plane zzso To circumvent these limitations, a three-dimensional zzso zzso tracking zzso was recently zzso Our goal was to evaluate the accuracy of the new zzso side by side with zzso using cardiac magnetic resonance zzso as a zzso 

zzso two- and zzso views zzso and zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained in 43 patients with a wide range of zzso size and function were zzso to measure zzso zzso and zzso volumes zzso and zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso acquired on the same day were zzso to obtain zzso and zzso reference values using the method of disks zzso zzso of both zzso techniques was assessed using repeated zzso While zzso correlated well with zzso zzso zzso it underestimated zzso volumes with relatively large biases zzso zzso and wide limits of agreement zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso being worse than zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed higher correlation with zzso zzso and zzso smaller biases zzso zzso and zzso limits of agreement zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso showed lower zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso than zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This is the first study to validate the new zzso technique for zzso volume zzso and demonstrate its superior accuracy and zzso over previously used zzso zzso
