zzso and novelty are potent learning signals that critically rely on zzso zzso zzso Recent findings suggest that although reward and novelty are likely to zzso both functions may be zzso by distinct zzso zzso We used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to isolate neural responses to reward and novelty within the human zzso zzso zzso area zzso complex to investigate the spatial zzso and integration of zzso and zzso activity zzso We demonstrate that distinct clusters within the zzso portion of the zzso zzso and the lateral portion of the right zzso are predominantly modulated by the anticipation of zzso while a more zzso part of the zzso zzso was exclusively modulated by zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso cluster embodied an interaction between novelty and reward where novelty selectively increased zzso zzso This interaction, in turn, was paralleled by differences in the zzso patterns of these zzso zzso Specifically, novel as compared to familiar zzso stimuli increased the functional connectivity of the zzso zzso with zzso regions, including the nucleus zzso and the zzso as well as with the primary visual zzso This functional correlation may highlight how zzso of the zzso zzso provide zzso information about novelty and zzso or, zzso how zzso zzso activity may zzso memory processes for novel events associated with zzso
