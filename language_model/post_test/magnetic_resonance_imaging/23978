zzso and neurological impairment are the major residual problems of spinal tuberculosis after the zzso has been eradicated with use of appropriate zzso Spinal zzso is needed to support anterior zzso zzso in patients who have zzso that affects more than two zzso Most surgeons use zzso zzso zzso zzso despite its advantages, has not been widely accepted, partly because of concerns about introducing foreign material into infected zzso The purpose of the current study was to address those zzso 

Twenty-two patients who had tuberculosis of the spine with zzso localized zzso and zzso patients who had more than two involved levels had stabilization with anterior zzso zzso medication was used zzso according to a standardized zzso The patients were followed to determine if there was any recurrence of the disease and if the correction had been zzso 

The zzso patients who had involvement of one or two levels had an average correction of the zzso of 64 percent zzso 58 to 90 percent), and the zzso patients who had more than two levels of involvement had an average correction of 81 percent zzso 75 to 97 zzso The correction was maintained in zzso patients, the maximum loss was 3 degrees in zzso and one patient died on the second zzso zzso There was no recurrence of the zzso 

We believe that anterior zzso is more effective than zzso zzso for reducing the zzso and stabilizing the zzso column in patients who have zzso related to tuberculosis of the zzso
