Previous studies in early blind individuals zzso a possible role of zzso connections in conveying zzso information to the visual zzso zzso As a consequence of blindness, zzso areas would thus become able to integrate a greater amount of zzso information than in sighted zzso To verify this hypothesis, we compared zzso zzso signal zzso zzso an index of efficiency in functional information integration, in zzso blind and sighted individuals during tactile spatial discrimination and motion perception zzso In both tasks, the zzso zzso analysis revealed many cortical regions with a significantly greater zzso in the blind as compared to sighted individuals, with an overlapping cluster located in the left inferior zzso zzso zzso A functional connectivity analysis using this region as seed showed stronger correlations in both tasks with zzso areas in the blind as compared to sighted zzso As zzso zzso reflects neural integration and processing efficiency, these zzso plastic changes in the zzso cortex, even if described in a limited sample, reinforce the hypothesis that this region may play an important role in processing zzso information in blind subjects and act as a hub in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso to the reorganized zzso zzso
