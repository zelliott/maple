Surgery for zzso and zzso zzso requires meticulous preservation of the cortical veins that surround the zzso thus, knowledge of the relevant zzso anatomy would be extremely helpful during zzso 

This study zzso virtual reality technology to determine the number, size and disposition of the veins in relation to the zzso in 8 patients with zzso and zzso zzso The same data were also collected from the scans of 8 normal subjects and compared with the data from the zzso zzso 

Our results show that the average number of veins is comparable in the zzso and control groups, and that the number of veins on either side does not differ significantly for both zzso On zzso the size of the veins is approximately the same on either side of the superior zzso zzso for both the control and the zzso zzso It was also observed that regardless of size, most of the zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated no significant anatomical distortion effects on the adjacent zzso structures, with the exception of one zzso zzso with invasion of the superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the draining zzso 

Data from a larger population would have to be collected in order to determine the effect of the growth of these zzso on the surrounding zzso zzso With virtual reality technology, the zzso veins are clearly zzso and knowing their location and relationship to the zzso would contribute towards safe and effective zzso
