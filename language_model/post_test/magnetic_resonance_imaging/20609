zzso the origin of zzso carries important implications for advancing the treatment of these recalcitrant zzso Recent research promotes the hypothesis of a zzso zone zzso origin for the zzso zzso cells identified within human zzso zzso However, conflicting evidence suggests that zzso cells are not uniquely zzso but this capacity may be shared by cycling zzso distributed throughout the zzso white matter zzso 

To review zzso evidence in zzso zzso zzso patients to provide insight into the question of zzso zzso 

We explored whether zzso at first diagnosis demonstrated a pattern of zzso distribution consistent with origin at the zzso through retrospective analysis of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance images in 63 zzso We then examined the relationship of tumor volume, point of origin, and proximity to the zzso using a computer model of zzso zzso 

Fewer than half of the zzso analyzed had zzso portions that contacted the zzso on zzso zzso A strong correlation was found between tumor volume and the distance between the zzso edge of the tumor and the zzso demonstrating that tumors abutting the zzso are significantly larger than those that do zzso The zzso simulated by the computer model validated our assumption that tumors that are zzso distant from the zzso are unlikely to have originated in the zzso and supported our hypothesis that as they grow, the edges of all tumors will near the zzso regardless of their point of zzso 

This work offers further support for the hypothesis that the origins of zzso are at sites distributed throughout the white matter and are not limited to the region of the zzso
