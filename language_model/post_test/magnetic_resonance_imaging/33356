By introducing the conflicting effects of dynamic changes in blood flow, volume, and blood zzso zzso model provides a zzso compelling interpretation of the zzso zzso In order to obtain optimal estimates for both the states and parameters involved in this model, a joint filtering zzso method has been widely zzso However, it is flawed in several aspects zzso zzso or interaction between the states and parameters is incorporated despite its zzso in zzso zzso zzso A joint representation for states and parameters necessarily means the large dimension of state space and will in turn lead to huge zzso cost in zzso Given this knowledge, a dual filtering approach is proposed and demonstrated in this paper as a highly competent alternative, which can not only provide more reliable estimates, but also in a more efficient zzso The two approaches in our discussion will be based on zzso Kalman zzso which has become the zzso of choice in numerous zzso zzso and machine learning zzso
