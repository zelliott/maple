In human face-to-face communication, the content of speech is often illustrated by zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that gestures provide advantages in the comprehension and memory of zzso Yet, how the human brain zzso abstract auditory and visual information into a common representation is not zzso Our study investigates the neural basis of memory for zzso speech and gesture zzso In this zzso study, 12 participants were presented with video clips showing an actor performing meaningful metaphoric gestures zzso zzso free gestures zzso and no arm and hand movements zzso accompanying sentences with an abstract zzso After the zzso session, the participants performed a recognition zzso zzso the participants showed the highest hit rate for sentences accompanied by meaningful metaphoric zzso Despite comparable zzso discrimination performances zzso for the three conditions, we obtained distinct zzso zzso zzso in the inferior frontal zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the middle zzso zzso zzso as well as significant correlations between zzso zzso and memory performance in the metaphoric gesture zzso In contrast, unrelated speech and gesture information zzso was processed in areas of the left zzso and zzso region and the right zzso just like the zzso condition zzso We propose that the specific zzso zzso pattern for the metaphoric zzso sentences reflects semantic integration of speech and zzso These results provide novel evidence about the neural integration of abstract speech and gestures as it contributes to subsequent memory zzso
