zzso or zzso air embolism is a drawback of various zzso zzso zzso aneurysm zzso coils can be sources of such air zzso We therefore assessed the formation of air bubbles during in zzso delivery of various detachable zzso 

A closed circuit simulating a typical zzso zzso procedure was primed with saline solution zzso by a zzso zzso Thirty commercially available detachable coils (7 zzso 4 zzso 5 zzso 7 Target, and 7 zzso zzso were tested by using the standard zzso zzso and delivery techniques suggested by each zzso The emergence of any air bubbles was monitored with a digital microscope and the images were captured to measure total volumes of air bubbles during zzso zzso and detachment and after zzso zzso zzso 

Air bubbles were seen during zzso or removal of 23 of 30 coils zzso with volumes ranging from 0 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Air bubbles were observed most frequently after removal of the zzso zzso zzso larger amounts of air bubbles were observed in Target zzso 

zzso volumes of air bubbles are observed while delivering detachable zzso zzso particularly after removal of the zzso zzso and especially with Target zzso
