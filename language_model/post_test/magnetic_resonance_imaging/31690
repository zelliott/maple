In the present study, we were interested in the zzso representations of ambiguity processing by using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Twelve zzso healthy adults aged between 21 and 29 years (6 male, 6 zzso underwent an ambiguity resolution task with 4 different conditions zzso zzso zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso of the corresponding control task zzso zzso zzso we found significant zzso especially in the zzso and some parts of the zzso zzso zzso nucleus, zzso Our findings zzso a participation of the zzso and other zzso zzso circuits in high level linguistic functions and match with theoretical considerations on this highly controversial zzso zzso neural circuits probably become activated when the language processing system cannot rely entirely on automatic mechanisms but has to recruit controlled processes as zzso Furthermore, we found broad zzso in the inferior zzso zzso the prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso This might reflect a strategic semantic search mechanism which probably can be illustrated with zzso models of language zzso According to this, we zzso a zzso role for the zzso and zzso zzso in regulating and monitoring the release of zzso language segments for motor programming and semantic zzso According to our findings there is strong evidence, that especially the thalamus, the zzso nucleus, the zzso cortex, the inferior zzso zzso and the prefrontal zzso are responsible for an accurate ambiguity resolution in the human zzso
