We present a method to register a zzso MR volume to a sparse set of zzso ultrasound zzso Our aim is to allow the transfer of information from zzso zzso to zzso ultrasound images to aid needle placement during zzso zzso of liver zzso The spatial relationship between ultrasound slices is obtained by tracking the probe using a zzso optical tracking zzso Images are acquired at maximum exhalation and we assume the zzso of the rigid body zzso An initial registration is carried out by picking a single corresponding point in both zzso Our strategy is to interpret both sets of images in an automated zzso step to produce evidence or probabilities of corresponding structure as a zzso or zzso zzso The registration zzso converts the intensity values of the MR and ultrasound images into vessel probability zzso The registration is then carried out between the vessel probability zzso zzso are compared to a zzso zzso registration which is calculated using a manual zzso picking zzso and verified using visual zzso zzso show that our starting estimate is within a root mean square target registration error zzso over the whole zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and this is improved to zzso zzso after running the zzso zzso
