zzso zzso zzso zzso is the second most frequent type of partial zzso and its onset is generally in zzso Though cognitive and zzso zzso have been described as zzso disorders in zzso their extent in zzso particularly in children, remains zzso 

In this study, we assess cognitive skills and zzso in a cohort of zzso zzso zzso 

We measured the performance of 71 children with zzso zzso on intelligence tests, zzso tests, and zzso zzso zzso zzso values were used for zzso zzso were related to zzso including age at zzso zzso duration of zzso seizure frequency, zzso of the zzso focus and drug zzso 

zzso zzso patients performed worse on intellectual and zzso tests compared to reference values, and had a delay in school zzso The performance of patients was typically worse on tasks measuring zzso functions, memory, zzso speed and zzso High seizure frequency was associated with lower scores on the zzso zzso of the intelligence zzso the other zzso had no statistically significant influence on intelligence test or zzso test zzso zzso problems included attention problems, anxiety and zzso zzso These were not significantly related to zzso 

Children with zzso zzso show a broad range of cognitive and zzso zzso compared to reference zzso While high seizure frequency may affect performance on selected cognitive measures, other zzso do not seem to influence zzso and zzso Study of zzso or functional brain abnormalities that zzso these cognitive and zzso zzso are zzso
