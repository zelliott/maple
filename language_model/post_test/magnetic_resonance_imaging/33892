An integrated computer aided zzso aided manufacture system has been used to model the complex geometry of blood vessel zzso Computer models are first constructed with key dimensions derived from zzso images of bypass zzso and from casts of actual blood vessel zzso Physical models are then zzso in one of two ways: the surface geometry data can be used to control the movement of a zzso milling zzso zzso the same data can be exported in a form that can be interpreted by a zzso zzso Both methods produce zzso defined solid investments that can be used in a zzso casting process that yields high-quality physical models for vascular fluid dynamic zzso This technique is useful for zzso zzso
