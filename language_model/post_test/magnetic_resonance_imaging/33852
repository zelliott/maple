On standardized tests of odor identification and odor zzso women tend to score better than men at nearly all age zzso We sought to determine if these findings would translate to differences between the sexes in the volume of activated brain when zzso are presented to subjects as the stimulants for functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The zzso maps of eight right-handed women zzso age zzso years old, range zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with those of 8 right-handed men zzso age zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso given the same zzso nerve stimuli in an zzso experiment at zzso zzso zzso stimuli were delivered to the patients in a passive fashion using a zzso zzso zzso with a nose piece inserted into the patients' zzso We used agents zzso zzso zzso alcohol, or zzso zzso alcohol alternating with hydrogen zzso that were selective for zzso nerve stimulation in the zzso The zzso were delivered to both zzso for 1 s every 4 s during a 30 s zzso During the 30 s zzso the patient received room air at the same flow zzso The women's zzso zzso maps showed up to eight times more activated zzso than men for specific regions of the brain zzso and zzso zzso The left and right inferior frontal regions showed a statistically significant increase in zzso in women at zzso In general, more women showed zzso than zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso maps in subject groups can demonstrate zzso to zzso tests of zzso and zzso one must control for gender when performing zzso zzso zzso
