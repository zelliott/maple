zzso zzso bypass is a useful procedure for the treatment of cerebral vascular zzso or complex zzso We explored the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso instead of digital zzso zzso zzso for the zzso assessment of zzso bypass zzso 

We zzso analyzed a consecutive series of 21 zzso from 17 patients that underwent 25 direct or indirect zzso bypass procedures between April 2003 and November zzso Conventional zzso was available for comparison in 13 zzso zzso used a zzso zzso scanner zzso 64, zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed independently on zzso and zzso by a zzso and a zzso The bypass was considered patent when the entire donor vessel was zzso without zzso from zzso to zzso ends and was visibly in contact with the recipient zzso 

zzso depicted the zzso status in every zzso zzso were patent in 22 cases, zzso in one, and zzso in zzso zzso always confirmed the results of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso and accurate exam to assess the zzso zzso bypass zzso and is a promising technique in routine zzso
