Previous studies demonstrated the usefulness of zzso in the evaluation of zzso zzso in zzso patients with zzso zzso However, these parameters have not been well studied in earlier stages of zzso zzso The present work aimed to study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pulse wave zzso zzso by zzso in zzso patients without advanced zzso zzso 

Eighty consecutive zzso patients were compared with 36 zzso and zzso zzso zzso images at the level of zzso descending and abdominal zzso were used to determine zzso and zzso 

zzso patients (27 zzso age: zzso zzso zzso years; mean zzso root zzso zzso zzso zzso had lower zzso at all levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso descending zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher zzso arch zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso Thirty-five zzso patients had a zzso zzso root zzso zzso root zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In multivariable zzso after adjustment for age, pulse pressure and zzso dimensions, zzso remained lower and zzso higher in zzso zzso even zzso patients with zzso zzso root showed impaired zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso for ascending zzso distinguished zzso patients from controls with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso by zzso were abnormal in the entire zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso patients without zzso zzso root showed clear impairment of zzso zzso which suggests that they may be used as early markers of zzso involvement in these zzso
