People tend to close their eyes when trying to retrieve an event or a visual image from zzso However the brain mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain poorly zzso Recently, we showed that during visual mental imagery, auditory areas show a much more robust zzso than during visual zzso Here we ask whether this is a special case of a more general phenomenon involving retrieval of zzso internally stored information, which would result in zzso zzso in other sensory zzso which are irrelevant to the task at zzso To test this hypothesis, a group of 9 sighted individuals were scanned while performing a memory retrieval task for highly abstract words zzso with low zzso zzso We also scanned a group of 10 zzso blind, which by definition do not have any visual imagery per zzso In sighted subjects, both auditory and visual areas were robustly zzso during memory zzso whereas in the blind the auditory zzso was zzso while visual areas, shown previously to be relevant for this task, presented a positive zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be most prominent in zzso sensory zzso whenever there is a need for retrieval or manipulation of internally stored zzso Thus, there is a zzso balance of zzso and zzso that might allow zzso of resources and filtering out of non relevant information to enable allocation of attention to the required zzso Furthermore, these results suggest that the balance between positive and negative zzso might be crucial to our understanding of a large variety of intrinsic and zzso tasks including high-level cognitive functions, sensory processing and zzso zzso
