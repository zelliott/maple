This study addresses the potential utility of zzso functional imaging with zzso zzso for the selection of zzso patients who are likely to benefit from zzso surgical treatment regarding zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients with zzso adjacent to zzso visual and speech related brain areas were investigated preoperatively with a zzso II zzso In each patient the zzso evaluation was zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and/or of the speech related brain zzso A grading system was then used according to the distance of the zzso zzso sources to the nearest zzso border to determine the further zzso The therapeutic options consisted in conservative treatment, zzso biopsy and/or a radiation and chemotherapy, substantial zzso and the gross total removal of the zzso 

From 119 investigated patients, 55 patients zzso were not considered for surgery due to zzso invasion to functional zzso Sixty four patients zzso were chosen for zzso zzso In the surgical group only four patients zzso suffered from neurological zzso 

zzso source imaging zzso proved to be a valuable help in the clinical decision making process of zzso adjacent to functional important brain zzso The relative high number of patients in whom zzso warns of the zzso crippling zzso may lead to a better selection of patients who benefit from zzso zzso This method may help to find the patients for whom conservative treatment seems to be more zzso concerning quality of life in the surviving zzso
