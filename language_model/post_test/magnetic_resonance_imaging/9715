zzso communication challenges the human brain to integrate information from auditory and visual senses with linguistic zzso Yet the role of bottom-up physical zzso zzso input and zzso linguistic constraints in shaping the neural mechanisms specialized for zzso audiovisual speech signals are currently zzso Participants were presented with speech and zzso speech zzso in zzso zzso and audiovisual zzso Before the zzso study, they were trained to perceive physically identical zzso speech zzso as speech zzso or zzso zzso Comparing audiovisual integration zzso of speech, zzso and zzso revealed a zzso processing zzso within the left superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso integrated audiovisual zzso regardless of zzso structure or speech zzso in left zzso the integration profile was primarily determined by the zzso structure of the zzso more anterior zzso regions discarded zzso structure and integrated audiovisual signals constrained by stimulus zzso and the availability of linguistic zzso In addition to this zzso processing zzso a zzso zzso encompassing zzso zzso and left inferior frontal zzso zzso integrated audiovisual speech and zzso zzso Indeed, dynamic zzso modeling and zzso model comparison provided strong evidence for a parallel processing structure encompassing a zzso and a zzso stream with speech zzso training enhancing the connectivity between zzso and anterior zzso In conclusion, audiovisual speech comprehension emerges in an interactive process with the integration of auditory and visual signals being progressively constrained by stimulus zzso along the zzso and zzso structure in a zzso zzso zzso
