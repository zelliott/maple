Many forms of human zzso are characterized by sustained negative emotional responses to threat and chronic behavioral zzso implicating avoidance as a potential zzso zzso Evidence from both nonhuman zzso and human zzso studies suggests a distributed zzso brain network supports zzso However, our understanding of the zzso dynamics of the network to sustained threat that zzso sustained avoidance is zzso To address this issue, 17 adults were given extensive training on a modified zzso avoidance task in which button pressing avoided money loss during a sustained threat zzso zzso subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing the avoidance zzso In our regions of interest, we observed zzso rather than zzso zzso during sustained threat in zzso and inferior frontal regions, anterior and zzso cingulate, zzso zzso and regions associated with emotion, including the amygdala, zzso zzso zzso and bed nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, trait levels of experiential avoidance were zzso correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest knowledge that one can consistently avoid aversive outcomes is not associated with decreased zzso responses and that individuals with greater experiential avoidance exhibit reduced zzso to initial zzso zzso for understanding brain mechanisms supporting human avoidance and psychological theories of avoidance are zzso
