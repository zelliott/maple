zzso syndrome zzso is a rare zzso disorder characterized by zzso and localized zzso zzso is caused by zzso in zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso and zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso or zzso growth factor 23 zzso zzso 

Our objective was to identify zzso in zzso or zzso and determine serum zzso levels in an zzso zzso 

zzso detection in zzso and zzso was performed by DNA sequencing, and serum zzso zzso were measured by zzso 

A 5-year-old French boy with zzso and his family members zzso 

The patient presented with painful cortical zzso in his zzso zzso of the affected bone showed zzso zzso The zzso tissue comprised zzso of zzso woven bone surrounded by zzso zzso zzso revealed elevated zzso zzso maximum rate for zzso zzso per zzso of zzso zzso and zzso D zzso The patient was a compound zzso for two novel zzso zzso His parents and brother were zzso for one of the zzso and had no zzso zzso zzso zzso level in the patient was low normal, whereas zzso zzso was zzso a pattern similar to zzso 

The presence of zzso zzso and elevated zzso but low intact serum zzso levels in zzso resemble those seen in zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso are different manifestations of the same zzso The absence of zzso abnormalities in the zzso individuals suggests that one normal zzso is sufficient for zzso of intact zzso
