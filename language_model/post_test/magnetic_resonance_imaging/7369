The aim of this study was to look for clinically significant adverse effects of zzso zzso used in a large cohort of infants zzso for magnetic resonance zzso 

Case notes of infants who underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanning from 2008 to 2010 were zzso with patient zzso sedation dose, zzso time to zzso and side effects of sedation zzso 

Four hundred and zzso infants zzso zzso zzso age per weight at scan 42 zzso zzso weeks per zzso g zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso dose 50 zzso zzso In three cases zzso zzso occurred which prompted termination of the zzso One infant zzso was admitted for additional observation following sedation but had no prolonged zzso In 17 zzso cases, infants had zzso which were zzso or responded to additional inspired oxygen such that scanning was allowed to zzso 

When adhering to strict zzso zzso scanning in newborn infants in this cohort was performed using zzso zzso sedation with a relatively low risk of significant adverse zzso
