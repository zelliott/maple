Two procedures were used with one subject to examine changes in the ear canal with jaw zzso zzso ear impressions were examined to measure the effect of jaw zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to define the three-dimensional structure of the canal and zzso key underlying zzso zzso showed that inexpensive impressions can detail changes in the zzso region of the zzso zzso a zzso change in this zzso ear canal with different jaw positions was observed in the zzso plane with essentially no change in the zzso zzso This is likely related to zzso stress from action of the zzso zzso on neighboring zzso zzso Solutions to jaw zzso feedback problems are zzso
