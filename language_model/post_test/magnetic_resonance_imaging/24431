zzso nerve zzso zzso is increasingly diagnosed in children with zzso hearing loss zzso We sought to determine the prevalence of zzso its imaging zzso and correlations with zzso zzso in children with unilateral zzso 

Case series with chart zzso 

zzso pediatric zzso 

In 128 consecutive children with unilateral zzso who underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, the zzso area, and signal intensity of the cochlear nerve zzso were measured and zzso to the zzso facial zzso zzso of zzso was determined by comparison to zzso zzso zzso among hearing loss severity, zzso and nerve size were zzso 

zzso nerve zzso was present in zzso of children with unilateral zzso Its prevalence was higher zzso in severe to profound zzso especially when in infants zzso zzso of the zzso cochlear nerve canal zzso correlated strongly with relative zzso diameter, density, and area (R zzso zzso zzso a narrow zzso zzso zzso strongly predicted zzso zzso of hearing loss modestly correlated with nerve size, although significant zzso was zzso zzso never occurred unless there were other inner ear zzso whereas in the zzso group, it occurred in zzso zzso abnormalities were very common zzso in zzso children, particularly zzso zzso 

zzso nerve zzso is a common cause of unilateral zzso particularly in zzso unilateral zzso zzso of the zzso effectively predicts zzso a finding useful when only zzso zzso imaging is zzso In an ear with zzso hearing can be expected to remain stable over zzso Diagnosis should prompt evaluation by an zzso
