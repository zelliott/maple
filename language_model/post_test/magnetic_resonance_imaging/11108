To analyze the clinical, zzso zzso and molecular genetic differences between idiopathic inflammatory zzso and zzso tumors of the zzso 

209 patients with zzso and 110 patients with zzso tumors seen between January 1, 1978 and December 31, 1999 in zzso zzso Center, Sun zzso University were evaluated zzso 

More patients with zzso tumors had palpable mass than patients with idiopathic zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the percentage of zzso and zzso respectively, whereas more patients with zzso had swollen zzso zzso or zzso congestion, pain, retinal folds or zzso and zzso nerve zzso than patients with zzso tumors, with the percentage of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resonance image zzso scan usually could not differentiate zzso from zzso Nearly one third of patients with zzso could not be easily differentiated zzso from zzso zzso zzso and molecular genetic analyses can differentiate zzso from zzso tumor based on zzso or zzso proliferation of zzso with the zzso being zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso tumor showed distinguishing clinical, zzso zzso and molecular genetic zzso
