To determine whether the mean wall thickness zzso of the common carotid artery zzso measured by zzso is comparable to zzso ultrasound zzso measurement of the zzso thickness zzso an established marker of cardiovascular zzso 

As part of the two-year zzso trial, 43 patients with zzso zzso by duplex US underwent high-resolution zzso and zzso US examinations of their carotid zzso zzso carotid arteries were identified as having both sufficient zzso coverage and adequate image quality of the zzso on zzso and a corresponding zzso A novel zzso utilizing statistical shape modeling was developed to automatically detect and measure zzso to within zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso measurement was zzso as the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were compared via the zzso correlation zzso 

The zzso and zzso had a high zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso difference between readers and between scans was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our automated zzso correctly identified the zzso in 28 cases zzso and the zzso boundary in 26 cases zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso are zzso and have a high correlation with the zzso by zzso zzso
