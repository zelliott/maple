To assess concerns that the European Union Physical Agents zzso zzso zzso on zzso Fields zzso could seriously restrict the use of zzso for research, diagnosis, and treatment, this study was conducted to examine the impact of the zzso zzso on research practice, following a previous survey that assessed its impact on clinical zzso 

Data were collected through an online zzso E-mail invitations were sent to every UK zzso zzso by Cancer Research zzso Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council zzso Medical Research Council zzso and the zzso Trust in the last three years, who use zzso zzso 

A total of zzso of researchers responding to the survey reported that some of their MR research is conducted with at least one researcher in the scanner room during zzso Of those researchers in the scanner room, more than three-quarters are within 1 m of the zzso for any scanner strength, and would therefore exceed the limits set in the zzso Over half of these researchers also reach into the magnet zzso while at least one in five researchers spend over an hour in the scanner room during zzso 

The results suggest the zzso zzso could have a very prohibitive impact on research zzso The current exposure limits would prohibit zzso zzso limit the provision of patient care, and restrict researchers from reaching into the magnet bore to position and check equipment or to provide technical zzso The use of new, more powerful zzso scanners will be particularly zzso
