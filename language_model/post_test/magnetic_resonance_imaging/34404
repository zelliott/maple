The purpose of this study was to determine the MR appearance of zzso zzso zzso with the pathological zzso 

MR findings of two patients with zzso zzso were zzso reviewed and compared with the pathological zzso 

Both tumors were complex masses composed of multiple zzso and solid zzso The size and signal intensity of multiple zzso varied within the zzso zzso zzso areas on zzso images were thought to zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso containing viscous zzso zzso Solid components had as high a signal intensity as did zzso zzso on zzso images and as intermediate a signal intensity as did zzso muscle layer on zzso zzso After intravenous administration of zzso the solid components showed marked contrast zzso There was also zzso fluid associated with zzso and zzso zzso 

The characteristic MR appearance of zzso zzso is thought to be a mixed mass composed of zzso solid components with intense contrast enhancement and multiple zzso zzso areas suggestive of zzso zzso and viscous zzso zzso
