To explore the value of imaging in the zzso evaluation of zzso zzso twins zzso and analyze the significance of imaging for separation surgery plan and zzso 

Imaging data of a case with zzso including zzso zzso CT, zzso were collected from the case with zzso treated in our zzso The features of the images were analyzed for identification of the zzso region, size, and structures and for zzso of other organ zzso and general body zzso 

The zzso region located at the zzso spine of which zzso diameter was zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso were found below zzso in bilateral zzso There were no bone structures but cartilage fusion in spine and zzso The neural structure such as spinal zzso and zzso zzso lower zzso tract and zzso and urinary tract were zzso The zzso zzso were zzso There were zzso in one zzso patent zzso zzso in both zzso The zzso finding matched with imaging zzso Crossing zzso skin zzso was used to cover the wound zzso The zzso of zzso twins were zzso zzso separation of the zzso was zzso There were no complications of infection, zzso fluid leakage and neurological zzso The healing of the skin zzso was zzso With 6 months zzso the growth and neurological function were zzso 

Imaging methods were selected according to the type of zzso twins and the clinical symptoms and zzso The zzso investigation can reveal the structure and size of conjunction zzso Imaging investigation has important significance for the prediction of difficulty in surgery, selection of surgical procedures, and evaluation of zzso
