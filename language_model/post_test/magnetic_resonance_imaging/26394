Two magnetic resonance imaging techniques, diffusion and zzso imaging, are being used increasingly for evaluation of zzso of zzso This article introduces these techniques and reports some initial studies using these approaches, together with conventional zzso magnetic resonance imaging, for investigation of childhood zzso It is shown that the combination of zzso and diffusion images can provide information about the timing of stroke events in childhood, and zzso imaging can detect abnormalities not visible by other magnetic resonance imaging zzso These magnetic resonance methods therefore should play an important role in investigation of children with stroke and could be of particular value in studies of zzso populations of children such as those with zzso cell zzso
