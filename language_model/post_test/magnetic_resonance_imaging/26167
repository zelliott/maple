Most traumatic brain injuries are classified as mild, yet in many instances cognitive deficits zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate possible relationships between quantitative zzso transfer imaging zzso and zzso findings in a cohort of patients with mild head trauma but negative findings on conventional MR zzso 

We examined 13 patients and 10 healthy volunteers with a standard MR protocol including fast zzso and zzso imaging, to which was added quantitative zzso zzso was performed with a modified zzso sequence incorporating zzso zzso zzso Both zzso analysis and zzso plots were obtained from the zzso zzso A zzso of nine patients was examined with a battery of zzso tests, zzso 25 measures of zzso zzso 

The zzso transfer ratio zzso in the zzso of the corpus zzso was lower in the patient group as compared with the control group, but no significant reduction in zzso was found in the zzso Individual regional zzso values were significantly reduced in two cases, and zzso plot analysis revealed focal areas of zzso in the zzso of four zzso All the patients showed impairment on at least three measures of the zzso test battery, and in two cases a significant correlation was found between regional zzso values and zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso and zzso plot analysis may add sensitivity to the MR imaging examination of patients with traumatic brain zzso
