zzso of tumor zzso can be a major barrier to successful drug delivery, particularly for high molecular weight agents such as zzso zzso and their diagnostic or therapeutic zzso In this study, changes in zzso of zzso tumor vessels after radiation treatment were evaluated by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging as a function of time after zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent shown previously to be confined to tumor blood zzso zzso zzso consisted of either single doses zzso zzso or various daily zzso doses (5 zzso A single radiation dose of 15 zzso resulted in significant transient image enhancement of the tumor tissue with a maximum occurring between 7 and 24 hours after radiation zzso No zzso enhancement was recorded for zzso radiation zzso Use of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging coupled with zzso provides an exquisite methodology capable of defining the timing of enhanced zzso of zzso in tumors after zzso Such information might be applied to zzso the efficacy of subsequent or concurrent therapies including zzso zzso or other zzso agents in combination with external beam zzso
