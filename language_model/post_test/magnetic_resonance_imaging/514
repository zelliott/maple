We clinically tested a quantitative zzso method to zzso abnormal variations in zzso fast rhythms to zzso focal zzso zzso assuming altered zzso of zzso receptors in the zzso 

During a zzso zzso at 1 zzso recording zzso were administered to five patients with zzso related zzso associated with an zzso visible focal zzso We determined the zzso dominant spectral zzso using zzso zzso and zzso the symmetry of spatial zzso This was compared to the zzso of the zzso on the zzso zzso 

The principal component was found in the zzso zzso In all patients one region of decreased change was associated with the zzso hemisphere, and overlapped with the site of the zzso in zzso Three patients underwent zzso zzso zzso findings concurred with the area of decreased zzso zzso 

This simple method localized abnormal function associated with zzso zzso Further zzso validation is now zzso Final clinical validation must be done in zzso cases as zzso 

This research may lead to techniques for zzso easy zzso of zzso tissue that is not visible on a structural zzso zzso
