zzso of tool use is a highly sensitive test to detect zzso The relationship to real-life performance is however unclear since zzso patients frequently improve substantially when allowed to actually use zzso In the present study, the neural zzso of zzso and actual tool use were directly compared in healthy subjects using an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso were requested to demonstrate the use of various tools either as zzso or with the tool in zzso Movement and zzso events were zzso The comparison of all conditions versus rest revealed a widespread zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso areas with some characteristic zzso for the different zzso The direct comparison between pantomime and actual use conditions revealed no or only minor differential zzso for zzso zzso During the movement event, actual tool use induced the expected additional zzso in sensory and motor areas, but also representations presumably related to zzso knowledge at zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso The opposite contrast of zzso versus actual tool use revealed differential zzso only in the left zzso zzso in a corresponding zzso zzso We conclude that planning and preparing of either zzso or actual tool use share large parts of a common zzso zzso differences in the zzso and dynamics of both movement conditions may be defined just before or during the initiation of the movement when sensory cues about the tool and environment are available in the actual use zzso zzso and cognitive cues may provide zzso patients the capacity to evoke a correct action program despite impaired zzso
