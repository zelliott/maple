zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso MR imaging is a technique for depicting cerebral zzso without contrast zzso Our purpose was to determine whether zzso at FAIR imaging can be used to assess regional cerebral blood flow zzso in a manner similar to zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso CT zzso 

Nine patients with internal carotid or major cerebral zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso and FAIR imaging zzso section, different zzso zzso zzso at rest and after zzso zzso zzso FAIR and zzso zzso values were compared and zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis was conducted to detect zzso segments on FAIR zzso 

zzso values of normally zzso segments were zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso studies, zzso zzso values for zzso and zzso FAIR images, respectively, were zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of 1200 milliseconds and zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and FAIR results were significantly zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in detecting zzso segments was significantly higher with zzso images zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso and accuracy zzso were higher with all zzso and zzso images (all zzso 

The significant zzso high specificity and accuracy in detecting zzso zzso similar increases in flow on both zzso images, and absence of the need for contrast enhancement suggest that FAIR imaging, like nuclear medicine study, is complementary to routine MR imaging in the assessment of cerebral zzso
