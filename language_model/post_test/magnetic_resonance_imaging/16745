zzso acid zzso is one of the most widely used zzso zzso The aim of the study was to investigate whether zzso in genes related to zzso and zzso pathways of zzso were associated with the large zzso zzso in zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso in six candidate genes were detected in 162 zzso patients under maintenance with zzso zzso and stable seizure control by real-time zzso and zzso zzso of statistical analysis demonstrated that carriers of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tended to require higher zzso zzso and lower zzso ratios zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso carriers also seemed to require higher zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, carriers of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were more likely to require lower zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso carriers also tended to require lower zzso and higher zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso model of zzso of zzso also revealed that genetic zzso in zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso affect zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Although there was a limited sample size, the study identified genetic factors associated with zzso therapy zzso that has not been revealed, and provided useful information for individualized zzso therapy in zzso zzso
