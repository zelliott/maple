In general, zzso zzso to correct zzso is pursued to prevent or address an aesthetic zzso In some cases, however, functional deficits may accompany zzso and may serve as an indication for surgical zzso The authors describe a series of patients with such zzso 

A retrospective review at a zzso health care center of all patients with zzso was conducted to identify a subset of cases in which the zzso was associated with zzso functional deficits that could not be attributed to muscular or neural dysfunction, or soft tissue zzso 

Six patients with either traumatic zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso disease and zzso soft tissue zzso demonstrated zzso zzso dysfunction, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and exposure zzso The symptoms and signs resolved in the three patients who underwent zzso zzso 

In some patients with zzso and globe zzso globe zzso may alter the underlying zzso mechanics or zzso muscle zzso resulting in functional as well as aesthetic zzso In these patients, restoring the native zzso anatomy through zzso zzso can reverse zzso zzso zzso surface exposure, and symptomatic zzso avoiding the need for zzso or zzso zzso
