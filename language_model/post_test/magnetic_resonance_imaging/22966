We demonstrate improved zzso zzso chemical shift correlation experiments for solid zzso utilizing zzso zzso transfer, zzso decoupling and zzso zzso polarization zzso zzso use of selective zzso and a zzso period suppress artifacts with a zzso phase cycle, allowing higher digital resolution in a fixed measurement zzso The novel correlation of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for any zzso reduces measurement time by an order of magnitude without sacrificing digital zzso The experiment retains intensity from zzso carbon zzso whose chemical shift zzso is critical to minimize spectral zzso for large proteins with a predominance of secondary structure, such as zzso rich zzso proteins and zzso membrane zzso We demonstrate the experiment for the zzso zzso binding domain of protein G zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso which is implicated in Parkinson's zzso Selective zzso of duration comparable the zzso period give optimal performance, but must be synchronized with the spinning in zzso ways to minimize chemical shift zzso zzso zzso Soft zzso with a small zzso product are best for exciting the approximately 70 zzso bandwidth required for zzso zzso
