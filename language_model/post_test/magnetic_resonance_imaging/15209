In humans and monkeys the mirror zzso system zzso seen actions into our inner representation of these zzso Here we asked if this system responds also if we see an industrial robot perform similar zzso We zzso the motor areas involved in the execution of hand actions, presented the same subjects blocks of movies of humans or robots perform a variety of zzso The mirror system was activated strongly by the sight of both human and robotic actions, with no significant differences between these two zzso Finally we observed that seeing a robot perform a single action repeatedly within a block failed to activate the mirror zzso This latter finding suggests that previous studies may have failed to find mirror zzso to robotic actions because of the zzso of the presented zzso Our findings suggest that the mirror zzso system could contribute to the understanding of a wider range of actions than previously zzso and that the goal of an action might be more important for mirror zzso than the way in which the action is zzso
