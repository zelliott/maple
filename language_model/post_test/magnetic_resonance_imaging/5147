A growing body of evidence suggests that zzso spectrum disorders zzso are related to altered communication between brain zzso Here, we present findings showing that zzso is characterized by a pattern of reduced functional integration as well as reduced segregation of large-scale brain zzso zzso children with zzso and 25 typically developing matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while passively viewing emotional face zzso We examined zzso functional connectivity of two brain structures previously implicated in emotional face processing in zzso the zzso zzso and the right zzso zzso of the inferior frontal zzso zzso In the zzso group, we observed reduced functional integration zzso less long-range zzso between zzso and secondary visual areas, as well as reduced segregation between zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso For the zzso seed, we observed reduced functional integration with zzso zzso and increased integration with right frontal zzso as well as right nucleus zzso Finally, we observed reduced segregation between zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso We propose that a zzso zzso the integration and segregation of large-scale brain networks in zzso is examined in relation to typical zzso provide a more detailed characterization of the neural basis of zzso
