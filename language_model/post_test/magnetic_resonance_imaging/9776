zzso zzso network analysis has proven a powerful tool to zzso characterize functional zzso of the zzso However, the zzso zzso reliability of graph metrics of functional networks has not been systematically zzso Here, we investigated zzso reliability of zzso metrics of functional brain networks derived from zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Specifically, we evaluated both short-term zzso hour apart) and long-term zzso months apart) zzso reliability for 12 global and 6 local zzso network zzso We found that reliability of global network metrics was overall low, zzso and dependent on several factors of scanning time zzso zzso zzso network membership zzso networks excluding negative zzso including negative zzso and network type zzso zzso zzso zzso The dependence was modulated by another factor of zzso definition zzso zzso The local zzso reliability exhibited large zzso across zzso metrics and a zzso zzso zzso zzso degree was the most reliable metric and varied the least across the factors zzso zzso regions in association and zzso zzso showed moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso reliability was robust to zzso four zzso zzso analysis revealed that global network metrics were extremely sensitive (but varying zzso to noise in functional connectivity and weighted networks generated zzso more reliable results in compared with zzso zzso For zzso network zzso they showed high resistance to noise in functional connectivity and no zzso related differences were found in the zzso These findings provide important implications on how to choose reliable zzso schemes and network metrics of zzso
