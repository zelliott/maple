To describe the MR features of primary central nervous system zzso zzso and to determine whether there is a correlation with zzso zzso 

The MR images, zzso zzso and clinical records of 23 patients with primary zzso zzso were zzso The imaging and zzso characteristics were tabulated and compared by using the standard tests for association in a two-dimensional contingency zzso 

A total of 61 zzso were present in 23 zzso 12 patients zzso had multiple zzso All zzso were zzso or zzso on zzso images, and zzso were zzso or zzso on zzso zzso Twenty patients received intravenous contrast material, and 43 zzso of 47 zzso zzso The three patients who had zzso zzso received steroids before the initial MR zzso Enhancement patterns differed between the zzso and the zzso zzso with the latter group harboring a higher percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were centered in a cerebral zzso and 14 zzso were centered in the central gray zzso There was a statistically significant correlation between a higher degree of necrosis zzso and zzso on zzso MR zzso The degree of necrosis also showed a positive correlation with rim zzso 

zzso zzso zzso has a variable MR appearance that zzso with the severity of zzso zzso These imaging zzso as well as zzso location, mean zzso size, and zzso to harbor zzso are altered in the zzso zzso
