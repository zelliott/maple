The authors performed this study to determine whether, on the basis of the vascular profile, zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso 

The authors used a zzso zzso specific for smooth muscle zzso to stain 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size, zzso zzso from nine zzso Two zzso counted the number of zzso arteries per zzso field in zzso zzso zzso and background zzso zzso zzso by using two techniques zzso and hot zzso 

The number of zzso arteries seen with the conventional counting technique in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean, zzso was significantly greater zzso zzso zzso than that seen in background zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean, zzso Similarly, the number of zzso arteries seen with the hot spot technique in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean, zzso was significantly greater zzso zzso zzso than that seen in background zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean, zzso 

On the basis of the vascular profile, zzso zzso zzso zzso should be considered zzso zzso Further research is needed to help differentiate these zzso from zzso zzso zzso with magnetic resonance zzso
