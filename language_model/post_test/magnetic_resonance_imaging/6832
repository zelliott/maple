To correlate quantitative magnetic resonance zzso imaging data zzso relaxation times and zzso transfer ratios zzso with zzso findings of zzso and zzso disease in cervical spinal zzso specimens from patients with multiple sclerosis zzso and control zzso 

zzso cervical spinal zzso specimens from 11 patients with zzso men and eight women zzso age at death, 66 years zzso zzso zzso zzso two female control subjects without zzso disease zzso and 41 years of age at zzso were examined at zzso zzso zzso time zzso and zzso mapping were zzso zzso included the whole zzso area and zzso zzso zzso analyses included zzso zzso and quantitative zzso zzso 

Compared with control specimens zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso specimens from patients with zzso had smaller zzso areas zzso area, zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso Within zzso zzso zzso of the white matter area displayed signal intensity abnormalities on zzso MR zzso The number of zzso in zzso white matter in zzso specimens was, on average, zzso lower than the number of zzso in white matter in control zzso All quantitative MR parameters correlated well with zzso the correlation with zzso relaxation time was the strongest zzso zzso zzso zzso and Kendall zzso zzso By contrast, quantitative MR parameters correlated less well with zzso zzso the correlation with zzso relaxation time was the strongest zzso zzso zzso zzso and Kendall zzso zzso zzso analysis, corrected for age and zzso zzso could not result in a model explaining zzso density on the basis of quantitative MR parameters when zzso density was included as a zzso 

Changes in quantitative MR imaging parameters in the cervical spinal zzso in zzso are mainly determined by zzso and do not reflect zzso disease zzso
