zzso zzso receptors play a central role in such diverse zzso as Parkinson's disease, zzso and drug zzso We used an zzso challenge combined with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to map zzso zzso in nonhuman primates with high sensitivity and spatial zzso Seven control zzso monkeys and 10 zzso zzso zzso primates were studied zzso using both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso challenge zzso zzso zzso in control monkeys increased relative cerebral blood volume zzso in a number of brain regions not described zzso such as zzso thalamus, zzso zzso and zzso nucleus of the zzso With the high spatial resolution, we were also able to readily identify changes in zzso in the anterior cingulate, zzso zzso zzso zzso area, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and nucleus zzso zzso induced decreases in zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso primates had a prominent loss of response to zzso with relative sparing of the nucleus zzso and zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between zzso loss in the zzso zzso and both PET imaging of zzso zzso and behavioral zzso Monkeys with partial zzso as defined by zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso showed recruitment of zzso and motor zzso after zzso stimulus similar to what has been noted in Parkinson's patients during motor zzso These data indicate that zzso is a powerful tool for assessment of dynamic changes associated with normal and dysfunctional zzso brain zzso in zzso
