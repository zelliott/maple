Spinal zzso zzso zzso is an important complication of zzso prostate zzso We have zzso patients treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital to assess treatment outcome and zzso factors in this patients zzso 

We performed retrospective analysis of 69 patients with spinal zzso zzso and prostate cancer treated at the Royal Marsden zzso 

At presentation 40 zzso patients were zzso and zzso were zzso Diagnosis was established by zzso in zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso of zzso zzso detected significantly more patients with multiple sites of zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso SCC was present at the initial diagnosis of zzso cancer in 13 patients and 17 patients had received no hormone treatment prior to zzso Following treatment 36 zzso patients had a functional improvement of motor power with zzso zzso zzso patients becoming zzso zzso percent of patients who had eventual improvement had some improvement in power within 7 zzso On zzso analysis a single level of zzso no previous hormone therapy and a young age zzso zzso predicted for better zzso When these factors were included an increased radiation dose zzso zzso or the addition of surgery did not improve the functional zzso Following initial zzso there was a zzso risk of developing a further episode of zzso zzso at the same or new site by 2 years with a median time to progression of 236 days zzso zzso zzso The median survival was 115 days zzso zzso zzso with zzso of patients surviving for 2 zzso Patients with no prior hormone therapy had a median survival of zzso days zzso zzso zzso Other zzso of improved survival on zzso analysis were a single site of zzso and a zzso over 12 zzso 

Treatment of SCC in prostate cancer results in improved motor function in the majority of zzso zzso survival is possible, especially in good performance status patients with no prior hormone zzso zzso remain at high risk of subsequent neurological zzso An early improvement in motor power is a strong predictor of subsequent functional zzso zzso detects additional sites of zzso SCC which makes it the investigation of zzso
