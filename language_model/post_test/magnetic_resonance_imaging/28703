The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy and computing time needed for zzso and zzso brain zzso using eight different zzso zzso software from Nuclear zzso Ltd run on a zzso zzso zzso 2) to determine the clinically most suitable zzso zzso zzso was evaluated using phantom zzso To approximate clinical zzso zzso studies, a Hoffman brain phantom was filled with zzso For zzso imaging zzso zzso the phantom was filled with water and doped with zzso for contrast zzso For both zzso phantom images were acquired and reconstructed using a routine clinical zzso zzso and zzso images were matched by zzso zzso zzso of the sum of absolute Count zzso zzso the sum of the Square Root of absolute count differences zzso the zzso in Shape between the zzso masks zzso the number of Sign Changes in the zzso image zzso the zzso of zzso between corresponding zzso zzso the sum of absolute count differences between the zzso and zzso images zzso and, finally, the standard zzso of the zzso Index zzso that is the intensity ratio between zzso corresponding zzso Six degrees of freedom were allowed (three translation and three rotation zzso three zzso parameters were zzso The accuracy of the matching process with these different similarity measures was evaluated via the residual mismatch between external zzso We found that CD, zzso zzso zzso zzso give the most accurate registration compared with the other similarity zzso For the evaluation of zzso zzso five zzso brain zzso zzso scans were performed with a zzso gamma zzso These studies were then manually zzso and subsequently zzso using the methods outlined zzso For this application, CD, zzso and zzso were also found to give the most accurate zzso For all of these zzso the computing time required was clinically acceptable zzso less than 10 zzso
