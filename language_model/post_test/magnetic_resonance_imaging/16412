Abuse of zzso organic zzso by inhalation is a prevalent practice among zzso zzso abuse of zzso causes cognitive zzso The mechanism of cognitive deficits induced by long-term zzso abuse has not yet been zzso In the current study, we assessed the effects of chronic zzso abuse on cortical gray matter volume and the association between cognitive impairment and cortical gray matter volume distribution in chronic zzso zzso 

Fifteen zzso abusers and 20 healthy control subjects matched in sex, age, education level, and zzso were investigated by structural MR zzso The cognitive states of the subjects were assessed by using the third edition of the zzso Intelligence zzso for Children zzso The zzso comparison and correlation analyses of MR images were performed by using zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso abusers had significantly lower gray matter volumes in the bilateral zzso and right zzso zzso In addition, the lower gray matter volumes in the frontal and zzso regions correlated with the duration of zzso zzso There was a positive correlation between the zzso performance scale scores and gray matter volumes in the frontal and zzso zzso of the zzso 

The results of the current study demonstrate that chronic zzso abusers have smaller gray matter volumes than zzso in various regions of the zzso Moreover, the cognitive deficits are associated with the lower gray matter volumes in the frontal and zzso zzso of chronic zzso zzso
