We sought to evaluate the anatomy of the zzso aspect of the knee with zzso zzso MR imaging, MR zzso and zzso zzso 

We assessed the zzso corner of the knee during dissection of one gross zzso zzso MR imaging and MR zzso were performed in seven additional knee zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained in the standard imaging planes as well as in the zzso zzso zzso The specimens underwent zzso zzso MR imaging after administration of zzso contrast material and were zzso into planes corresponding to those of the MR zzso 

At zzso zzso the following zzso structures were zzso the zzso ligament zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its two zzso attachments to the lateral zzso zzso collateral zzso direct and anterior arms of the zzso of the long head of the biceps zzso muscle, and direct and anterior arms of the zzso of the short head of the biceps zzso zzso zzso of MR imaging and zzso findings showed that the zzso ligament and zzso zzso ligament were found in 57% and zzso of zzso zzso At least one of the two limbs of the zzso ligament was identified in zzso of zzso The zzso ligament was not identified on MR images in any of the zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified in all zzso 

The zzso corner of the knee comprises complex and variable zzso zzso zzso of these variations is important in the assessment of MR images of the zzso
