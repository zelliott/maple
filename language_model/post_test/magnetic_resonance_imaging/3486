To examine the association between magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of zzso phalanx zzso disease and the progression of nail pathology in zzso arthritis zzso 

Clinical nail assessment and hand zzso scans were done on 34 patients with zzso Twenty patients had repeat nail assessments after 1 zzso 

zzso with zzso and zzso at baseline were more likely to have corresponding zzso bone erosion and proliferation on zzso zzso bone zzso on baseline zzso was associated with development of zzso and zzso in corresponding zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso inflammation is central in the development of zzso nail zzso
