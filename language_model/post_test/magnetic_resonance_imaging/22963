zzso atoms are often incorporated into drug molecules as part of the lead zzso process in order to improve affinity or modify zzso zzso and zzso zzso From an zzso perspective, the abundance of fluorinated drug leads provides an zzso niche for structural studies using zzso zzso in the drug discovery zzso As zzso has no interfering background signal from biological sources, zzso zzso studies of fluorinated drugs bound to their protein receptors can yield easily zzso and zzso structural zzso zzso can also be selectively incorporated into proteins to obtain additional constraints for structural zzso Despite these advantages, zzso zzso has rarely been exploited for structural studies due to its broad lines in zzso and their zzso complexes, leading to weak signals in zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate several different experimental strategies that use zzso zzso to obtain zzso structural constraints for zzso bound to the zzso protein zzso a drug target for zzso zzso These examples indicate the zzso of these methods to typical structural problems encountered in the drug development zzso
