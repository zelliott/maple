The standard zzso evaluation of left zzso zzso mass, particularly in zzso zzso zzso is challenging because it is based on geometric zzso The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of zzso mass calculation using zzso zzso compared with cardiac magnetic resonance zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in 104 patients zzso age 55 zzso 15 zzso referred for zzso 63 with zzso and 41 with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed using standard commercial tools to obtain zzso zzso zzso mass on zzso showed a higher correlation with zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs r zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso overestimated zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso underestimated zzso mass zzso zzso whereas zzso on zzso showed only minimal bias zzso zzso mass on zzso in zzso showed a significantly higher correlation with zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso vs r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso In zzso the mean difference was zzso g zzso of the zzso with zzso limits of agreement of zzso g zzso of the zzso In zzso the mean difference was zzso g zzso of the zzso with limits of agreement of zzso g zzso of the zzso There was a correlation between the absolute zzso mass differences zzso derived and zzso zzso and zzso percentage zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso images zzso zzso zzso p zzso The net zzso index with zzso was zzso for concentric zzso zzso In conclusion, the most accurate and reliable zzso measurement of zzso mass is zzso but zzso and zzso remain challenges in zzso
