The changes of spontaneous activity from before and after a memory or learning task had been considered to be related to zzso memory consolidation process in human brain by using zzso functional connectivity zzso zzso zzso However, zzso reflects zzso synchronization of zzso of zzso distinct brain regions and therefore could not determine which specific brain region is involved in the memory consolidation zzso Here we used regional zzso zzso a method for measuring local zzso to link the local spontaneous activity change to zzso episodic memory zzso We hypothesized that the spontaneous activity change would be different between people with better memory performance and those with worse performance in zzso zzso All participants completed two zzso sessions, that is, before zzso and after zzso an episodic memory zzso task zzso indoor or outdoor zzso Then, based on the d' of a later surprise memory retrieval test, a zzso group and a zzso group, each consisting of 16 participants, were chosen from whole 58 zzso We defined a zzso ratio, that is, zzso of zzso divided by zzso of zzso as a change induced by memory zzso The zzso group showed a significant higher zzso ratio than zzso group in zzso zzso lobe zzso including zzso and anterior zzso zzso The current results provide zzso evidence supporting that the zzso is involved in zzso memory consolidation of episodic zzso Moreover, this study may provide a paradigm for understanding of episodic memory deficit in Alzheimer's zzso
