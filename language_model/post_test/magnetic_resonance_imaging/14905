The aim of this technical report is to report a new method for zzso zzso shunt placement by determining the angle and distance of the zzso shunt zzso trajectory in the zzso plane using a simple modification of a standard zzso zzso A modified zzso zzso zzso was taken in the zzso plane, which included zzso point and a point zzso anterior to the zzso Using this zzso the trajectory from zzso point to a target in the frontal horn may be determined, and the angle and distance of the zzso shunt zzso trajectory may also be zzso We identified a zzso zzso for zzso zzso which avoided contact with any zzso zzso In addition, the length of the zzso zzso was calculated using the zzso which we defined as the zzso zzso Twenty VP shunt surgeries were performed using an individual safety angle and safety length as determined by a zzso zzso The zzso was successful on the first attempt in all zzso The accurate placement of the zzso zzso was confirmed using a zzso zzso Only one patient demonstrated a track zzso around the zzso path on CT zzso zzso evaluations were performed 3 to 12 months after the shunt zzso The zzso protocol is a simple modification of the standard zzso zzso and may important for the determination of an accurate angle and distance of the zzso zzso during zzso zzso for VP zzso
