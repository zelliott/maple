Because white matter zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso may be linked to geriatric syndromes involving mobility, zzso and zzso we zzso that involvement of areas critical to zzso control could influence urinary zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso individuals zzso zzso were recruited into three groups zzso by age and gender reflecting normal and mildly and moderately impaired zzso zzso zzso status and related symptoms were evaluated in 97 individuals using validated instruments zzso zzso zzso zzso Index, zzso zzso zzso zzso Impact zzso Regional zzso was measured using an zzso brain imaging zzso pipeline and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the participants were zzso mostly with urgency zzso zzso and zzso symptoms zzso zzso zzso individuals were more likely to be women with worse scores for depression and zzso zzso located in right inferior frontal regions predicted zzso severity, with no significant relationship with zzso zzso type, zzso or functional zzso As regards zzso zzso zzso within regions normally occupied by the anterior zzso zzso predicted severity and degree of zzso zzso zzso predicted zzso and severity, whereas zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso predicted zzso 

zzso of zzso in right inferior frontal regions and selected zzso tracts predicts zzso zzso severity, and degree of zzso Our observations support the findings of recent functional zzso studies indicating a critical role for the zzso in zzso control, while also suggesting potential involvement of other nearby zzso tracts such as anterior zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso
