zzso in processing faces is a cornerstone of human social zzso However, the zzso course of many key brain regions supporting face preferential processing in the human brain remains zzso Here, we present findings from an zzso study using a simple viewing paradigm of faces and objects in a continuous age sample covering the age range from 6 years through zzso These findings are the first to use such a sample paired with zzso zzso analyses to investigate development within the core and extended face networks across the zzso spectrum from middle childhood to zzso We found evidence, albeit modest, for a zzso trend in the volume of the right zzso face area zzso but no zzso change in the intensity of zzso From a spatial perspective, the middle portion of the right zzso zzso most commonly found in adult studies of face processing was increasingly likely to be included in the zzso as age increased to zzso Outside of the zzso the most striking finding was that children zzso nearly every aspect of the extended face system relative to adults, including the amygdala, anterior zzso pole, zzso inferior frontal zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, the findings suggest that development is best characterized by increasing zzso of zzso regions throughout the brain to engage only those systems necessary for task zzso
