Recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging has been used as a novel method of evaluating the zzso response to noxious zzso In a previous study, a prolonged noxious zzso stimulus applied to the zzso of the hand produced more than one zzso response that was temporally zzso The two major responses displayed zzso in primary sensory regions zzso pain zzso and regions involved in emotion zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we applied the same zzso stimulus separately to the zzso of the left foot and the zzso of the left hand in the same subjects and compared the zzso responses to evaluate the effects of zzso distance on zzso zzso within these two zzso zzso After stimulus delivery to the foot, the zzso response in primary sensory networks occurs after a delay of zzso zzso zzso s as compared with the response after hand zzso The relative delay of the zzso response in zzso regions is not significantly different between hand and foot stimulation zzso zzso zzso zzso These results within the primary sensory system are consistent with the greater zzso distance of the peripheral nerves from the hand versus the zzso The observation that the response within the zzso pathways occurs with the same rapid zzso characteristics after either hand or foot stimulation supports the notion that the zzso involved in the evaluation of aversive stimuli is rapid in onset and probably represents a major protective mechanism for zzso
