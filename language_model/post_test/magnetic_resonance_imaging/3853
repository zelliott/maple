Over 20,000 MR systems are currently installed worldwide and, although the majority operate at magnetic fields of zzso and below zzso about zzso experience with zzso (in zzso clinical diagnostic imaging and zzso and zzso zzso only) human MR scanners points to a future in functional and zzso MR zzso zzso to previous studies, this review attempts to provide an overview of zzso MR research with special emphasis on emerging clinical applications at zzso We provide a short summary of the technical development and the current status of installed MR zzso The advantages and challenges of zzso zzso and MRS are discussed with special emphasis on zzso zzso relaxation times, zzso improvements, zzso effects, chemical shifts, specific zzso rate and other safety zzso In terms of applications, we focus on the topics most likely to gain significantly from zzso zzso zzso brain imaging and zzso and musculoskeletal imaging, but also body imaging, which is particularly zzso Examples are given to demonstrate the advantages of zzso imaging, zzso MR zzso high-resolution functional zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the human brain, sodium and functional imaging of cartilage and the first results (and zzso using an zzso body zzso suggesting future areas of research that should be intensified in order to fully explore the potential of zzso MR systems for use in clinical zzso
