In recent years, there has been substantial interest in how the human zzso not only supports recollection of past experiences, but also the construction of fictitious and future events, and the leverage this might offer for understanding the operating mechanisms of the zzso Evidence that patients with bilateral zzso damage and zzso cannot construct novel or future zzso has been influential in driving this line of research zzso There are, however, some patients with zzso damage and zzso who retain the ability to construct novel zzso This zzso may indicate that the zzso is not required for scene construction, or zzso there could be residual function in remnant zzso tissue sufficient to support the basic construction of zzso zzso this controversy is central to current theoretical debates about the zzso To zzso we used zzso and a scene construction task to test patient zzso who has dense zzso zzso bilateral zzso volume loss, and intact scene zzso We found that scene construction in zzso was associated with increased activity in a set of brain areas, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that overlapped considerably with the regions engaged in control participants performing the same zzso Most notably, the remnant of zzso right zzso exhibited increased activity during scene zzso This suggests that the intact scene construction observed in some zzso zzso patients may be supported by residual function in their zzso zzso in accordance with theoretical zzso that ascribe a vital role to the zzso in scene zzso
