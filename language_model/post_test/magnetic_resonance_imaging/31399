Brain zzso and functional connectivity were investigated in high functioning zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging in an zzso working memory task involving photographic face zzso The zzso group showed reliably lower zzso compared with controls in the inferior left prefrontal area zzso in verbal processing and working memory zzso and the right zzso zzso area zzso with theory of mind zzso The participants with zzso also showed zzso in a somewhat different location in the zzso area than the control zzso These results suggest that the neural zzso of the brain for face processing in zzso may be analyzing the features of the face more as objects and less in terms of their human zzso The functional connectivity results revealed that the abnormal zzso zzso was embedded in a larger context of smaller and less synchronized networks, particularly indicating lower functional connectivity with frontal zzso In contrast to the zzso with frontal areas, the zzso group showed no zzso among zzso cortical zzso These results extend previous findings of abnormal face perception in zzso by demonstrating that the abnormalities are embedded in an abnormal cortical network that manages to perform the working memory task zzso using a visually zzso zzso processing style that zzso reliance on prefrontal zzso
