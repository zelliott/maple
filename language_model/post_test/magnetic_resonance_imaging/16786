Although numerous studies provide general support for the importance of genetic factors in the risk for alcohol use disorders zzso candidate gene and zzso studies have yet to identify a set of genetic variations that explain a significant portion of the zzso in zzso One reason is that alcohol-related zzso used in genetic studies are typically based on highly zzso diagnostic zzso zzso identifying zzso zzso related to zzso that drive the development of zzso is critical for the future success of genetic and zzso zzso One such zzso zzso is the degree to which exposure to alcohol taste cues recruits the zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, and motor areas, all of which have been shown to have a critical role in addictive behaviors in animal zzso To that end, this study was designed to examine whether zzso responses of these structures are associated with zzso severity in a large sample zzso using zzso and functional connectivity zzso zzso suggested that alcohol cues significantly activated zzso zzso zzso cortex, anterior zzso cortex, and zzso zzso zzso zzso severity was moderately correlated with regions involved in incentive zzso such as the nucleus zzso and amygdala, and stronger relationships with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The findings indicate that zzso are related to zzso in these regions and that these measures may represent important zzso zzso for subsequent genetic zzso
