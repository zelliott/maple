Motor impairment represents the main clinical feature of Parkinson's disease zzso zzso deficits are also frequently observed in patients with zzso with a prominent involvement of executive functions and zzso zzso We used zzso functional zzso zzso and a paradigm based on visual attention and motor zzso zzso to investigate brain zzso in 13 patients with early zzso in comparison with 11 healthy zzso The two groups did not report zzso differences in task zzso During motor zzso zzso zzso patients compared to controls showed an increased zzso in the prefrontal zzso and in the zzso zzso They also showed a reduced and less coherent zzso response in the zzso zzso These results indicate that specific zzso functional changes, involving not only the zzso network but also the zzso cortex, are already present in patients with early zzso and no clinical evidence of cognitive zzso We discuss our findings in terms of zzso mechanisms zzso zzso and zzso signs of zzso deficits and visual zzso
