The zzso zzso is an uncommon zzso zzso In most reported cases, it has been operated on via a zzso approach using a zzso despite the fact that the zzso is usually located zzso to the spinal zzso Reports have shown that early zzso results have been good with the zzso approach, but very few studies of the long-term zzso recurrence of zzso zzso have been zzso Here, we report on a case of zzso zzso zzso that was operated on using an anterior zzso 42-year-old woman presented with a cervical zzso zzso that had recurred eight years after its partial removal via a zzso zzso The patient complained of pain on the lateral side of her upper arms, and an magnetic resonance imaging showed that the zzso zzso was located zzso to the spinal zzso and compressed the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The patient was operated on via an anterior approach using a zzso at the lower half of zzso and the upper half of zzso The zzso was attached to the spinal zzso firmly and was zzso removed, with the thickest portion adhering to the zzso not being zzso The zzso end of the zzso was observed with the assistance of a rigid zzso zzso zzso may recur after partial zzso and the patient's condition may deteriorate during zzso zzso The anterior surgical approach provides good zzso and zzso safe removal of the zzso
