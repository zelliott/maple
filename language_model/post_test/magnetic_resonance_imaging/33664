An zzso probe for magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis has been developed that takes advantage of the zzso spatial characteristics of a zzso zzso The probe consists of an zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso operating in zzso zzso The zzso circuit is mounted on a solid rod, is encased in zzso and has been used to obtain detailed images of pelvic anatomy in a male zzso The approximate zzso symmetry of the external sensitivity profile of this type of circuit, employed in an zzso application, demonstrates the potential superiority of this type of probe design over zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR images, obtained with 8 and 16 zzso fields of view, are presented to illustrate the advantages of this type of zzso probe compared with conventional zzso zzso The zzso described in this report has been designed for clinical use in human subjects and is currently undergoing testing to determine its efficacy in the evaluation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
