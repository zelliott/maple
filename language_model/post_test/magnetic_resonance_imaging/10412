We sought to assess whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso T detects more brain zzso in acute zzso zzso zzso than zzso at zzso zzso 

zzso patients with acute ON were scanned at both zzso using zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso density and zzso zzso spin zzso and zzso spin echo after zzso In addition, zzso rapid acquisition zzso echo zzso was obtained after contrast at zzso zzso zzso number and volumes were assessed by an observer blind to patient identity and field zzso 

zzso at zzso T showed a significantly increase in number of zzso detected on zzso images zzso zzso zzso relative to scanning at zzso zzso zzso proved to be suitable for detecting enhancing zzso in zzso 

The zzso protocol at zzso T was more sensitive to zzso brain zzso in ON than the standard zzso protocol at zzso zzso
