The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate reward processing in zzso major depressive disorder zzso Specifically, we investigated whether adults with zzso demonstrated zzso in zzso brain regions and/or zzso in cortical brain regions involved in conflict monitoring using a zzso of Fortune task designed to probe responses during reward selection, reward zzso and reward zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data indicated that the zzso group was characterized by reduced zzso of zzso reward regions during reward selection, reward zzso and reward feedback, supporting previous data indicating zzso of reward systems in zzso Support was not found for zzso of cognitive control regions during reward selection or reward zzso Instead, zzso participants showed zzso in zzso cortex, a region associated with assessment of risk and zzso during reward selection, as well as decreased zzso of the middle frontal zzso and the zzso zzso zzso during reward selection and zzso Finally, depression severity was predicted by zzso in bilateral zzso zzso during reward zzso zzso indicate that zzso is characterized by zzso zzso and that future studies of zzso treatments that seek to improve responses to rewarding stimuli should assess zzso zzso
