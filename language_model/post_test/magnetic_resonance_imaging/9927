This study was designed to explore causes for local recurrence of zzso zzso after intended zzso surgery and discuss prevention zzso 

Medical data of zzso zzso in our hospital from January 2001 to September 2009 were zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso findings, and zzso zzso 

Of 39 patients (29 women and 10 zzso with zzso zzso who ranged in age from 14 to 71 zzso zzso years, 7 patients were diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso pelvic zzso pelvic CT, and zzso zzso zzso were performed in 23, 22, and 8 cases, zzso zzso showed that five cases had two zzso zzso and three cases had zzso or zzso shaped zzso all of which were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso suspected involvement of the zzso wall in three zzso zzso to the zzso wall in two cases, and tumor invasion in the remaining zzso During the operation, 26, 8, and 2 cases were zzso by the zzso zzso and combined zzso approach, zzso Four patients underwent simultaneous zzso and three patients received simultaneous zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso partial zzso of the invaded zzso colon or zzso was performed in two patients, zzso By zzso pathological examination, three cases were found to have zzso zzso zzso three had previous zzso zzso history, and five had infected zzso 

zzso zzso are likely to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and adhesive to the zzso and zzso which contribute to the high local recurrence zzso zzso zzso and careful zzso exploration are required to direct surgical treatment and to reduce local zzso zzso selection of surgical approach also is very important to reduce local zzso zzso zzso attached to the zzso or zzso require simultaneous partial zzso of the zzso or zzso to reduce local zzso
