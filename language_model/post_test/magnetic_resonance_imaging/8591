The zzso inferior frontal zzso zzso and anterior inferior zzso zzso zzso form the core regions of the human zzso zzso zzso that matches an observed movement onto its internal motor zzso We used zzso functional zzso to examine whether simple zzso finger movements evoke zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso In separate sessions, participants either merely observed zzso stimuli or responded to them as quickly as possible with a zzso compatible finger zzso A picture of a relaxed hand with zzso dots on the tip of the index and little finger was continuously presented as high-level zzso Four types of stimuli were presented in a zzso order: a color change of a zzso a moving finger, a moving zzso or a simultaneous zzso zzso zzso movements were zzso and zzso matched to finger zzso Participants were faster at imitating a finger movement than performing the same movement in response to a moving dot or a color change of a zzso Though zzso responses were zzso zzso revealed no additional zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso during the observation or zzso of finger movements as opposed to observing or responding to a moving zzso Mere observation of a finger movement alone failed to induce significant zzso of the zzso and zzso The lack of a signature of zzso zzso zzso in the inferior zzso zzso is presumably due to specific features of the task which may have favored zzso mapping based on common spatial zzso We propose that the responsiveness of human zzso mirror zzso areas to simple zzso movements critically depends on the experimental zzso
