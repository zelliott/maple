We used zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso water in 20 patients with complex partial zzso to compare zzso metabolism and blood flow in zzso lobe zzso zzso identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism was measured 20 minutes after blood flow without moving the patient from the zzso We also studied 11 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both local cerebral zzso rate of zzso zzso and regional cerebral blood flow zzso were significantly decreased in zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso However, zzso was reduced by zzso in inferior lateral and zzso in inferior zzso zzso zzso and zzso by only zzso and zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso was significantly reduced in inferior lateral zzso zzso zzso to the zzso focus zzso zzso zzso Moreover, using standardized criteria, blinded zzso found that 16 of 20 patients had focal zzso zzso all in the zzso zzso 10 of 20 had focal zzso water PET zzso but it was falsely zzso in two of these 10; and five of 11 had focal zzso zzso zzso but it was falsely zzso in two of these zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso metabolism and blood flow may be zzso in zzso zzso
