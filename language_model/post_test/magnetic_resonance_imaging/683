zzso zzso was used to examine the neural basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso spatial zzso Shifts of attention were induced by central zzso or peripheral zzso zzso zzso times on subsequently presented targets showed the expected pattern of zzso and zzso in both zzso No difference in brain activity was observed when the two zzso conditions were contrasted with a liberal zzso showing that both forms of zzso were zzso by the same neural zzso Compared to zzso control trials, both zzso and zzso zzso activated a zzso network consisting of zzso cortex, zzso zzso cortex, zzso frontal zzso and right inferior frontal zzso Within these regions, equally strong zzso was observed for both zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by the same large-scale network of frontal and zzso brain zzso
