To examine the relationship between commonly used screening cognitive measures with gray and white matter integrity in patients with mild to moderate zzso 

New zzso techniques, such as zzso zzso zzso make it possible to study the relationship between structural brain integrity and cognitive functioning in zzso 

Gray and white matter integrity was evaluated using zzso in zzso patients with mild to moderate zzso zzso and zzso scores were also performed as part of the baseline assessment for a larger clinical trial in the zzso zzso zzso between cognitive measures and zzso were zzso 

Both the zzso and the zzso showed a similar relationship with gray matter zzso reflecting greater cognitive impairment with decreased gray matter in the left zzso zzso However, the zzso score was much more reflective of underlying white matter changes than zzso scores, particularly in zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso and zzso reflect different aspects of the underlying brain changes observed in zzso The zzso was more specific to gray matter integrity whereas the zzso reflected a more global reduction in both gray and white zzso 

These results support using zzso markers of neural integrity as an important consideration when evaluating treatment zzso Furthermore, zzso analyses such as zzso help to evaluate neural systems that are not necessarily targeted by the zzso
