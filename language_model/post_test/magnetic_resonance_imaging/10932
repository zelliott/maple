This contribution provides an overview and zzso basic knowledge on pertinent technical developments in magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso zzso zzso respiratory zzso parallel imaging, and 3 zzso zzso zzso sequences can be used as zzso zzso sequences for analyzing dynamics of contrast enhancement or as zzso sequences for MR zzso zzso improvements in respiratory triggering make it possible to obtain good image quality on zzso scans even in patients unable to hold their zzso Parallel imaging as a universal technique to accelerate image acquisition is particularly appropriate for zzso of the liver, and it has been shown that the reduced acquisition time is not achieved at the expense of image zzso Further progress in zzso of the liver can be expected with use of the zzso systems, but zzso irrelevant problems must still be zzso zzso the innovations presented here, applied alone or in zzso facilitate zzso zzso and high-quality zzso diagnostic assessment of the zzso
