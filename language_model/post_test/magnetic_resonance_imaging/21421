With the advent of zzso considerable progress has been made in uncovering the neural network involved in the perception of emotional zzso However, the exact zzso zzso of the emotional zzso perception process remain zzso Furthermore, it is unclear what the zzso basis might be of the relative zzso specialization for emotional zzso perception that has been found previously in the zzso zzso In an attempt to shed light on these issues, quantitative zzso of the zzso literature were performed to investigate which brain areas are robustly associated with zzso and zzso perception of emotional zzso Also, zzso analyses were performed to investigate whether statistically reliable zzso specialization across studies can be found in these zzso A bilateral zzso network was found to be implicated in emotional zzso perception, generally supporting previously proposed models of emotional zzso zzso zzso convergence across studies was found in zzso auditory processing areas, suggesting that the right zzso specialization for emotional zzso perception reported previously in the zzso literature might be driven by zzso specialization for zzso fundamental acoustic dimensions of the speech zzso
