The authors analyzed the long-term outcomes of gamma knife surgery zzso for residual or zzso zzso after zzso and the effects of dose zzso 

A total of 107 patients with zzso were treated with zzso at zzso City Hospital during the past 12 years, and 98 patients were followed up for 6 to 148 months zzso zzso zzso The mean tumor diameter and volume were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These tumors were treated with a zzso dose of zzso zzso and a tumor margin dose of zzso zzso by using a mean of zzso zzso Final overall response rates were as zzso complete response zzso partial response zzso tumor control zzso and tumor progression zzso zzso the tumor margin dose resulted in decreased therapeutic response and increased tumor zzso although the rate of visual and zzso function loss also zzso Among the factors zzso age (for zzso and the nature of the tumor zzso or zzso were statistically significant favorable and zzso zzso factors, zzso The zzso zzso and 10-year survival rates were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso survival rates were zzso and zzso zzso Patient outcomes were reportedly excellent in 45 cases, good in 23, fair in four, and poor in zzso 16 patients zzso zzso both in vision and zzso functions were documented as side effects in six patients zzso 

zzso zzso is safe and effective, in the long term, as an zzso or boost therapy for residual or zzso zzso after surgical removal and has minimal side zzso New treatment strategies must be devised to manage these zzso
