zzso scalp zzso zzso allow the study of zzso networks and more generally, of the zzso between zzso activity and zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso has greater sensitivity and spatial specificity than scalp zzso but limited spatial zzso We performed simultaneous zzso and functional zzso recordings in zzso patients to study the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two patients undergoing zzso with zzso and depth zzso as part of the zzso assessment of their zzso zzso participated in the zzso They were scanned on a zzso T MR scanner following a strict safety zzso zzso recordings of zzso and zzso were obtained at zzso zzso were subsequently visually identified on zzso and their zzso zzso were mapped using a general linear model zzso On scalp zzso recordings performed prior to the zzso no zzso were zzso zzso was well tolerated and no adverse health effect was zzso zzso zzso was comparable to that obtained outside the zzso In both cases, significant zzso changes were revealed in relation to zzso both close to the most active zzso contacts and at distant zzso In one case, results showed an zzso network including regions that could not be sampled by zzso in agreement with findings from zzso offering some explanation for the persistence of zzso after zzso zzso zzso allows the study of zzso human zzso networks with unprecedented sensitivity and zzso This could help improve our understanding of zzso networks with possible implications for zzso zzso
