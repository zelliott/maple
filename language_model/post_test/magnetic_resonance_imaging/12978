Alternative dosing schedules of zzso may improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed zzso zzso by increasing the therapeutic index, overcoming common mechanisms of zzso resistance, or zzso The goal of this zzso phase II study was to evaluate two different zzso regimens in the zzso treatment of newly diagnosed zzso 

Adult patients with newly diagnosed zzso were randomly assigned to receive standard zzso with concurrent daily zzso followed by six zzso cycles of either zzso zzso zzso days 1 to 7 and 15 to zzso or zzso zzso zzso continuous zzso zzso Maintenance doses of zzso acid were then administered until tumor zzso The primary end point was overall survival zzso at 1 zzso zzso tissue was zzso to determine zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso 

zzso eligible patients were zzso 42 were randomly assigned to zzso and 43 to zzso zzso The zzso survival rate was zzso for the zzso arm and zzso for the zzso zzso median zzso was zzso months zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso months zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The most common zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso and elevated liver zzso zzso was observed in 37% of zzso patients and may have had an impact on estimates of zzso survival zzso months in the zzso arm and zzso months in the zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso zzso regimens were well tolerated with modest zzso The zzso regimen appears promising, with zzso survival of zzso
