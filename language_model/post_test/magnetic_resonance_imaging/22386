Patients with zzso zzso zzso develop in zzso a zzso zzso tumor called zzso zzso zzso We report in this study on benign zzso zzso observed in patients investigated for zzso 

Between September 1990 and December 2001, zzso patients were screened for zzso zzso had zzso 77 unilateral zzso The median age at diagnosis of zzso was 7 months zzso zzso Treatment included zzso local treatment with zzso or zzso zzso chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, rarely, external beam radiation zzso 

zzso was found in zzso patients zzso with bilateral zzso Interestingly, five other patients zzso presented a zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso No zzso were recorded in the 77 patients with unilateral zzso This difference was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso The median age at diagnosis of the zzso zzso was 26 months zzso zzso much younger than reported in literature for healthy zzso Four of five patients with zzso died of the disease, while all the patients with zzso zzso remained stable and zzso during a median follow-up of 41 months zzso zzso 

This report describes benign zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso suggesting a benign zzso of zzso zzso possible zzso mechanisms are zzso
