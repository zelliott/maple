Our two closest living zzso relatives, chimpanzees zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibit significant behavioral differences despite belonging to the same zzso and sharing a very recent common zzso zzso have been reported in multiple aspects of social behavior, including zzso sex, play and zzso However, the zzso basis of these differences has only been minimally investigated and remains zzso Here, we present the first ever comparison of zzso and zzso brains using diffusion zzso imaging, supplemented with a zzso analysis of zzso images to specifically compare neural zzso implicated in social zzso We find that zzso have more gray matter in brain regions involved in zzso distress in both oneself and others, including the right zzso zzso and right anterior zzso zzso also have a larger zzso linking the zzso with the zzso anterior zzso cortex, a zzso implicated in both zzso control of aggressive impulses as well as bottom-up biases against harming zzso We suggest that this neural system not only supports increased zzso sensitivity in zzso but also behaviors like sex and play that serve to zzso tension, thereby limiting distress and anxiety to levels conducive with zzso zzso
