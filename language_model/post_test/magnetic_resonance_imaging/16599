Low brain tissue zzso due to abnormal zzso drainage is thought to be a central mechanism of brain damage in zzso Here, zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso abnormalities and to correlate these with brain zzso and clinical zzso 

Fourteen children (age range, zzso zzso with unilateral zzso underwent MR imaging zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the affected zzso and in zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso for each zzso zzso was correlated with age, brain zzso and motor and seizure variables as well as zzso 

Increased zzso was seen in the affected zzso in 5 children and decreased zzso in 9 zzso Brain zzso was more severe in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and was related to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso Older children had lower zzso values on the affected side zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso duration of zzso was related to lower zzso (more negative zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso on the affected zzso Lower zzso was associated with more frequent zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Increased zzso in the affected cerebral zzso may indicate an early stage of zzso without severe brain zzso zzso zzso is associated with frequent seizures, long duration of zzso and brain zzso
