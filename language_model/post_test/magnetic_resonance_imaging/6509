The benefit of carotid zzso in symptomatic high-grade zzso has long been zzso The role of zzso as an alternative is still a matter of zzso We compared the occurrence of zzso zzso signals and zzso zzso between carotid zzso zzso and carotid zzso with zzso placement zzso without a protection zzso 

88 patients who underwent a zzso and 41 patients who underwent zzso were zzso zzso One day before and after the intervention diffusion weighted zzso were zzso In 21 zzso and 18 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso monitoring was performed during the procedure to detect zzso signals zzso 

zzso could be detected after intervention in zzso of the zzso patients compared with zzso of the zzso patients zzso The median zzso volume was zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso complications consisted of 2 strokes zzso with symptoms lasting more than seven days in the zzso group and 1 stroke zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The median number of zzso in the zzso group was 17 versus 61 in the zzso group zzso No significant correlation was found between the total number of zzso and zzso zzso in either zzso 

A larger number of zzso particles with smaller volume is detached during zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in different territories after zzso but not after zzso Conventional zzso zzso detection is not useful to compare zzso therapies of the carotid zzso
