Treatment decisions for zzso zzso depend largely on qualitative data, including a description of tumor anatomy and the experience of the treating zzso Currently characterization of zzso tumor anatomical elements is descriptive and lacks zzso zzso decision making and data set comparisons would be significantly enhanced by a consistent, zzso system that zzso the pertinent characteristics of localized zzso zzso We have developed and propose a standardized zzso scoring system zzso zzso zzso to zzso the anatomical characteristics of zzso masses on computerized zzso resonance zzso 

The zzso score is based on 5 critical and zzso anatomical features of solid zzso zzso Of the 5 components 4 are scored on a 1, 2 or 3-point scale with the 5th indicating the anterior or zzso location of the mass relative to the zzso plane of the zzso We applied the zzso zzso zzso to 50 consecutive masses zzso at Fox Chase Cancer zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso size as zzso zzso zzso properties of the zzso zzso of tumor deepest portion to the collecting system or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso relative to the polar zzso The zzso h zzso is assigned to tumors that abut the main zzso artery or zzso The zzso scoring system accurately classified the complexity of 50 consecutive tumors undergoing zzso at our zzso 

zzso reporting of zzso tumor size, location and depth is essential for decision making and effective zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso standardized zzso system that zzso the salient anatomy of zzso zzso This novel approach for the systematic characterization of zzso tumors provides a tool for meaningful comparisons of zzso masses in clinical practice and in the zzso zzso
