We studied the interaction between responses to zzso and zzso stimuli in the human second zzso zzso zzso by recording zzso evoked magnetic fields zzso from 8 healthy subjects with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Right zzso and left zzso median nerves were zzso zzso at the zzso at zzso exceeding the motor zzso In each stimulus zzso the four zzso pairs zzso zzso zzso zzso were presented in a random order once every 2 zzso with a zzso zzso zzso within the zzso The responses were zzso with a zzso model, with current zzso located in the zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso The zzso responses peaked around zzso zzso and responses to the 1st zzso stimulus on the pair were on average 2 zzso zzso earlier and about 3 zzso times stronger for zzso than zzso zzso zzso of the condition, the 2nd response always peaked later than the 1st; the mean delay was 16 zzso The responses to the 2nd stimulus depended only slightly on the type of the zzso the zzso increased more and the zzso decreased less after different than identical 1st zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso due to zzso and zzso stimuli overlap strongly in the human zzso zzso
