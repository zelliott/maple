The zzso zzso zzso in adults is a rare zzso We report various MR imaging features of the adult zzso 

Ten patients were included in this retrospective zzso All patients had undergone magnetic resonance zzso imaging with a surface zzso that used two different zzso MR zzso All patients had undergone initial and follow-up MR imaging with contrast enhancement using zzso zzso Three patients underwent additional MR imaging using the zzso spatial zzso of zzso zzso zzso If a shift in tagging band during the zzso phase was less than half of the band space, it was defined as a zzso zzso Two zzso independently reviewed these images, while clinical symptoms and outcomes were statistically analyzed between the treated and zzso zzso 

All cases presented an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and showed the same signal intensity as zzso Three zzso had zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were zzso confirmed after zzso two of these were associated with zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso zzso of 3 patients demonstrated zzso fluid motion within the zzso In the treated group, clinical symptoms improved better than the zzso zzso 

The adult VT shows some unusual imaging features, including zzso zzso zzso and coexistence of a spinal zzso as well as the typical zzso zzso maneuvers may be considered as a treatment option in adult VT with progressive neurological zzso
