To develop a simple correction approach to mitigate zzso in 3 zzso zzso breast zzso 

A slightly modified breast receive zzso zzso which we termed field shaping array zzso was shown to mitigate breast zzso at zzso In this zzso one zzso element was selectively zzso and tuned off the zzso frequency during the transmit zzso zzso The current flowing in this element during zzso created a secondary transmit field; the zzso addition of this field and the one created directly by the body zzso resulted in a more uniform zzso profile over the entire breast zzso The receive zzso element was returned to its intended tuning during the zzso phase, ensuring zzso signal zzso 

Using the zzso improved zzso field zzso better fat suppression, increased image zzso and reduced power deposition was seen in all volunteers zzso 

A simple modification of a standard breast zzso zzso converting it to a field shaping zzso was shown to mitigate breast zzso in all volunteers zzso
