zzso is characterized by an abnormal appearance of the brain white matter on zzso Its zzso is still a matter of zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso clinical and pathological zzso of zzso 

The study population consisted of 93 deceased zzso The zzso zzso magnetic resonance images were evaluated for the presence and grading of zzso The clinical and pathological characteristics based on the clinical charts and autopsy reports were zzso zzso specimens of the blocks of 19 brains that demonstrated severe zzso and those of five control brains were excised and zzso 

The variables found to be significantly associated with zzso were age and a clinical history of Parkinson's zzso Other risk factors and pathological markers of zzso were not significantly correlated with zzso No significant difference was found between the scoring of the zzso integrity, zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster of differentiation 68 and smooth muscle zzso There was a significant difference with respect to zzso of vessels zzso 

Our pathological results indicate that structural vascular abnormalities characterized by vessel wall zzso are associated with zzso supporting the assertion that vascular changes and zzso generate zzso The relations between zzso and zzso may be zzso through vascular effects on the zzso of the zzso zzso
