zzso evidence suggests that zzso breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso might not improve surgical outcomes in the general breast cancer zzso To determine if patients zzso benefit from breast zzso we examined surgical zzso mastectomy, zzso and final mastectomy zzso patients grouped by zzso zzso We identified women diagnosed with zzso breast cancer from 2004 to 2007 in the zzso zzso We classified patients as having invasive zzso zzso zzso invasive zzso zzso zzso mixed zzso zzso zzso or other zzso zzso Medicare claims were used to identify breast zzso and definitive surgeries during the initial surgical treatment zzso We used propensity score methods to account for the differential likelihood of exposure to zzso Of the zzso patients who met our inclusion criteria for this study, zzso had a zzso breast zzso Patients with zzso as compared to other zzso groups were most likely to receive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the propensity zzso zzso breast zzso was associated with an increased likelihood of an initial mastectomy for all patients and among all zzso zzso Among patients with zzso having a breast zzso was associated with lower odds of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an equal likelihood of a final mastectomy compared to similar patients without a breast zzso zzso and among patients with zzso and zzso breast zzso was not significantly associated with a likelihood of a zzso but was associated with greater odds of a final zzso Our study provides evidence in support of the targeted use of zzso breast zzso among patients with zzso to improve surgical zzso it does not provide evidence for the routine use of breast zzso among all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients or among patients with zzso
