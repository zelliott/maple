We have zzso the melting and dissolution processes of xenon zzso ice into different zzso using the methods of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging, and time resolved zzso imaging by means of zzso zzso Starting from the initial condition of a zzso solid zzso layer frozen on top of an ethanol zzso ice block we measured the zzso phase transitions as a function of time and zzso In the pure ethanol sample, pieces of zzso ice first fall through the viscous ethanol to the bottom of the sample tube and then form a thin layer of liquid zzso The xenon atoms are trapped in this liquid layer up to room temperature and keep their zzso over a time period of 11 zzso In the zzso mixture zzso zzso most of the polarized zzso liquid first stays on top of the zzso ice block and then starts to penetrate into the pores and cracks of the zzso ice zzso In the final stage, nearly all the zzso polarization is in the gas phase above the liquid and trapped inside the zzso zzso zzso of homogeneous samples of pure ethanol containing zzso polarized zzso and the zzso images of the melting process show that very high zzso of zzso zzso (about half of the density of liquid zzso can be stored or delivered in pure zzso
