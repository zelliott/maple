zzso performance in verbal zzso tasks is an often zzso finding in zzso In functional zzso studies, this dysfunction has been linked to signal changes in prefrontal and zzso zzso Since schizophrenia has a high zzso it is of interest whether zzso genes for the disorder, such as zzso zzso verbal zzso performance and its neural zzso Four hundred zzso healthy individuals performed a semantic and a zzso verbal zzso zzso A zzso of 85 subjects performed an overt semantic verbal zzso task while brain zzso was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso status was determined and correlated with verbal zzso performance and brain zzso For the behavioral measure, there was a linear effect of zzso status on semantic but not on zzso verbal zzso Performance decreased with number of zzso In the zzso experiment, decreased zzso in the left inferior frontal and the right middle zzso zzso as well as the anterior zzso zzso was correlated with the number of zzso in the semantic verbal zzso zzso zzso zzso does influence language production on a semantic level in conjunction with the underlying neural zzso These findings are in line with results of studies in schizophrenia and may explain some of the cognitive and brain zzso variation found in the zzso More generally, zzso might be one of several genes that influence semantic language zzso
