Conventional MR imaging does not provide specific information that can be reliably associated with the zzso zzso and clinical status of patients with multiple sclerosis zzso Our goals were 1) to determine whether the zzso averaged water diffusion zzso zzso can be used to distinguish between plaques of different severity in these patients and 2) to assess possible correlations between zzso values and disease zzso Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso score, and signal intensity on zzso MR zzso 

Twenty patients (10 with zzso zzso and 10 with zzso zzso and 11 healthy volunteers underwent a combined conventional and zzso MR study of the zzso zzso a zzso that is zzso to the trace of the diffusion zzso was zzso by averaging the apparent diffusion zzso measured in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained for selected areas of white matter zzso zzso in zzso among the three groups were tested using analysis of zzso 

zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and both values were higher than zzso in normal white matter zzso zzso zzso There was a significant negative correlation between zzso and the degree of zzso on zzso images, and a positive correlation between zzso and both zzso score and disease zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso is useful for distinguishing zzso zzso of different zzso which are associated with different degrees of clinical zzso
