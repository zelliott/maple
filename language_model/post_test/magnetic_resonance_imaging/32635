zzso resonance imaging zzso of the zzso wall has emerged as a viable technology for characterizing zzso zzso in zzso especially within carotid arteries and other large zzso This capability has facilitated the use of carotid zzso in clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso is specifically able to characterize three important aspects of the zzso size, composition and biological zzso zzso size, expressed as a total wall volume, may be more sensitive than zzso vessel narrowing zzso as a measure of therapeutic effects, as it reflects changes along the entire length of the zzso and accounts for vessel zzso zzso composition zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may reflect therapeutic effects that do not alter zzso size or zzso but cause a transition from a vulnerable plaque composition to a more stable zzso Biological activity, most notably zzso is an emerging target for imaging that is thought to destabilize plaque and which may be a systemic marker of zzso The ability of zzso to characterize each of these features in carotid zzso zzso gives it the potential, under certain circumstances, to replace traditional trials involving large numbers of subjects and hard zzso attacks and zzso smaller, shorter trials involving imaging zzso In this review, the state of the art in zzso of zzso is presented in terms of hardware, image acquisition protocols and zzso Also, the results of validation studies for measuring zzso size, composition and inflammation will be zzso Finally, the status of several clinical trials involving zzso of zzso will be zzso
