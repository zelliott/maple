To investigate whether zzso language dominance in zzso patients is related to zzso and type of zzso 

Four hundred and zzso zzso patients received bilateral Wada zzso Language was classified as left zzso right zzso zzso zzso speech arrest after left and right zzso or zzso zzso no speech arrest after either zzso Groups were compared regarding zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso were classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso and zzso sclerosis zzso 

Of all patients, zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with left zzso did not differ from those without zzso zzso with normal zzso did not differ from zzso zzso with early left zzso were most likely R zzso zzso with late zzso left zzso were most likely BD zzso those with left HS were most likely BD zzso or L zzso In both latter groups, R language was rare zzso and zzso zzso 

The data support the notion that R dominance may indicate development of functional language areas in the right zzso following an early zzso BD language may signal defective maintenance of right zzso language caused by a late left zzso insult at a time when left dominance has already started to zzso In contrast, zzso language may represent a zzso with functional language representation in both zzso
