In an zzso study, 20 younger and 20 healthy older adults were scanned while performing a spatial zzso task under two levels of zzso On a separate occasion, the same subjects underwent PET zzso using the zzso zzso zzso to determine zzso zzso zzso binding potential zzso in zzso nucleus and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso The zzso study revealed a significant load zzso of brain activity zzso zzso zzso in frontal and zzso regions for younger, but not older, zzso The PET zzso showed marked age-related reductions of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso control of zzso and zzso zzso binding eliminated the age-related reduction in zzso zzso signal in left frontal cortex, and attenuated greatly the reduction in right frontal and left zzso zzso These findings suggest that age-related zzso in zzso zzso may contribute to zzso of zzso brain regions during zzso performance in old zzso
