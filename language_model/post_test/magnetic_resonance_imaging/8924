The onset of adolescence is a time of dramatic changes, including changes in sleep, and a time of new health concerns related to increases in zzso sensation zzso depression, substance use, and zzso As part of a larger study examining zzso changes in adolescents' zzso brain function, the current article focuses on the relationship between functional zzso measures of reward and measures of zzso 

A total of 58 healthy participants zzso years of age completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan using a guessing task with monetary rewards and 4 days of at-home zzso and zzso sleep zzso Sleep variables included zzso measures of mean weekend minutes zzso sleep onset time, and sleep offset time, as well as zzso sleep zzso 

During reward zzso less zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was associated with fewer minutes zzso later sleep onset time, and lower sleep zzso During reward outcome, less zzso zzso was associated with later sleep onset time, earlier sleep offset time, and lower sleep zzso 

It has been hypothesized that adolescents' low zzso in zzso brain areas could lead to zzso increases in zzso zzso This study's findings suggest that sleep could contribute to such zzso Because decreased sleep has been associated with risky behavior and negative mood, these findings raise concerns about a negative spiral zzso the effects of zzso and sleep deprivation may have synergistic effects on reward processing, contributing to adolescent behavioral and emotional health zzso
