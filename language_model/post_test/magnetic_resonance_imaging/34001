The purpose of this work was to assess the changes of signal intensity on constructive interference in steady state zzso zzso zzso transformation zzso zzso after administration of zzso and to evaluate the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso to depict the seventh and eighth zzso nerves affected by zzso zzso 

All scans were carried out on a zzso T MR zzso First, an experimental study was conducted to evaluate the changes in signal intensity of the zzso sequence in relation to the concentration of contrast zzso Second, nine consecutive patients with 11 zzso zzso underwent zzso imaging before and after contrast agent zzso Signal zzso of the tumors and nerves were measured and compared between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the facial and cochlear nerves was rated on zzso and zzso zzso imaging zzso 

On the phantom study, the zzso sequence showed a constant increase in signal intensity as the concentration of zzso zzso The contrast between the nerves and tumors significantly increased after contrast agent administration (from zzso to zzso as mean zzso zzso The ability to depict the nerves was also significantly higher for zzso zzso imaging than for zzso 

Although the zzso sequence offers similar contrast as other heavily zzso zzso the signal intensity of zzso tumors increased on zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was valuable for evaluating the seventh and eighth zzso nerves affected by zzso zzso
