Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso can reveal the chemical constituents of a complex mixture without resorting to chemical zzso zzso or other zzso Recently, we and others have developed magnetic resonance agents that report on the presence of dilute zzso by zzso altering the response of a more abundant or easily detected species, a form of zzso One example of such a sensing medium is xenon gas, which is chemically zzso and can be zzso zzso a process that enhances its zzso signal by up to 5 orders of zzso Here, we use a zzso synthetic approach to produce xenon magnetic resonance sensors that respond to small zzso zzso The sensor responds to the zzso by producing a small chemical shift change in the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate this technique for the zzso zzso zzso for which we have an independent optical zzso to verify zzso We thus demonstrate that specific binding of a small zzso can produce a xenon chemical shift change, suggesting a general approach to the production of xenon sensors targeted to small zzso zzso for in zzso zzso or molecular imaging in zzso
