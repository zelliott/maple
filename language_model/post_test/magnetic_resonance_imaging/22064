Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of zzso zzso MR imaging in staging zzso zzso and zzso by zzso with zzso zzso 

Thirty-five patients underwent zzso MR imaging on a zzso zzso unit using zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a dynamic zzso zzso zzso fast zzso shot zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso For all patients, zzso correlation was available from biopsy zzso zzso zzso or surgical zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso unaware of each other's interpretations of the scans interpreted each case from which we evaluated qualitative and quantitative zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified when imaging revealed an intact zzso zzso a homogeneous internal structure, and high contrast enhancement of the zzso zzso staged as zzso by zzso criteria zzso zzso 6) were best revealed by dynamic zzso fast zzso shot zzso in which an intact zzso zzso could be zzso zzso of enhancing tumor tissue in the zzso zzso indicated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso zzso 5) and T4 zzso zzso 4) zzso were correctly staged with dynamic and zzso MR zzso The stage revealed by MR imaging correlated well with zzso staging results in zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso 2) of zzso However, when interpreting MR imaging, observers tended to zzso and never zzso 

zzso zzso MR imaging provided reliable information in staging patients before surgery and in evaluating zzso zzso and zzso
