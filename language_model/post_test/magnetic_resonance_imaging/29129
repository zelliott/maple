zzso transfer imaging provides information about the structural integrity of zzso zzso such as zzso Our objective was to use this imaging technique and zzso plotting to characterize and to define the extent of white matter zzso in multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain zzso 

zzso transfer imaging was performed of 30 multiple sclerosis plaques and 10 traumatic white matter zzso zzso transfer ratios zzso were calculated for the zzso for the zzso or zzso surrounding white matter, and for remote zzso white zzso zzso zzso plots were constructed about these zzso 

The zzso plot appearance of zzso plaques differed from that of traumatic white matter zzso There was a gradual increase in zzso values at points at increasing distances from the center of the zzso zzso this was true for those zzso with and without surrounding zzso signal zzso zzso In contrast, there was an abrupt transition in zzso values between traumatic zzso and zzso surrounding white zzso Additionally, the size of the zzso zzso exceeded the size of the zzso signal zzso for the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso plots permit characterization and border definition of white matter zzso Analysis of the zzso plots suggests that zzso is a zzso process with the lowest zzso within the center of the zzso In contrast, traumatic white matter injuries are discrete zzso with abrupt transitions between the abnormal zzso and normal zzso
