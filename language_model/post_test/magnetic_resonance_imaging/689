zzso the number of subjects required for an zzso functional imaging study is critical for ensuring sufficient statistical zzso We report an empirical investigation of this issue by employing a zzso approach to the data of 58 subjects drawn from four previous zzso zzso Using zzso measures and setting the zzso map from the complete sample to be a zzso zzso analyses revealed the statistical power to be surprisingly low at typical sample sizes zzso zzso zzso However, zzso that were significantly active from smaller samples tended to be true zzso that is, they were typically active in the gold standard map and correlated well with the gold standard zzso zzso The numerous false zzso that resulted from the lower zzso of the smaller samples drove the poor statistical power of those zzso zzso the sample into two groups provided a test of the zzso of zzso maps that was assessed using an alternative measure that zzso the distances between zzso of activated zzso These analyses revealed that although the zzso overlap may be poor, the locations of activated areas provide some optimism for studies with typical sample zzso With zzso zzso 20 in each of two groups, it was found that the zzso for zzso of activated areas fell within 25 zzso of each zzso The reported zzso by zzso the spatial zzso for various sample sizes performing a typical zzso cognitive task, thus provide an empirical measure of the disparity to be expected in comparing zzso zzso
