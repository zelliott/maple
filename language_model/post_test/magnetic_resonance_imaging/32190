The potential zzso effects of zzso oxygen (HBO) were tested in an zzso model of focal cerebral zzso with partially spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) were subjected to zzso middle cerebral artery zzso zzso and diffusion weighted zzso zzso was performed at zzso 1, 3, and 6 h after zzso to determine the zzso viability threshold yielding the zzso volumes that best zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes at 24 h zzso zzso For assessment of zzso effects, rats were treated with zzso oxygen at zzso zzso absolute zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso room air zzso zzso zzso for 60 zzso beginning 180 zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso started within zzso h after zzso and was continued 5 zzso 24 h zzso and zzso zzso and zzso h zzso zzso zzso volume was calculated based on zzso at 24 h zzso 1) or zzso h zzso 2) zzso zzso evolution was zzso between 3 and 6 zzso In experiment 2, the relative regional cerebral blood volume zzso of both groups showed similar incomplete spontaneous zzso in the zzso zzso HBO reduced zzso volume to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso As shown by zzso and zzso HBO treatment demonstrated significant zzso at 5 h after zzso focal cerebral zzso that lasted for zzso zzso
