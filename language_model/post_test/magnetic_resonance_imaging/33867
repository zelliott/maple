zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with high acquisition rate was performed during the intentional zzso of words to specify which zzso zzso lobe structure is important in determining what words are subsequently remembered in a zzso test and to characterize the time course of zzso in that zzso zzso images of six healthy young subjects were analyzed by two zzso and zzso statistics: First, to identify brain areas zzso engaged in zzso of words, brain activity during zzso visually presented words and watching a fixation cross was compared by a zzso statistic zzso Second, to identify brain areas whose activity zzso with memory zzso success, a Kendall's correlation was calculated between signal intensity at study and performance in a subsequent zzso zzso zzso signal zzso were plotted as a function of time to depict the time course of brain activity detected by both statistical zzso The level of slowly zzso sustained activity in zzso area 28 zzso zzso did not respond zzso as study words appeared, but did correlate positively with subsequent test zzso More left than right activity in zzso area 45 zzso prefrontal zzso and bilateral activity in zzso area 44 zzso zzso exhibited transient zzso responses that did not show any relation to subsequent memory zzso Thus, the study identified a novel pattern of slowly modulated brain activity in human zzso zzso that may represent a zzso memory zzso state whose level predicts whether experiences will be remembered or zzso
