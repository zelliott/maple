zzso zzso and Imaging have been applied to study preparation processes of ceramic porous zzso zzso analysis gives a clear characterization of the materials, with high zzso zzso in the method of preparation and steps as low as 25 degrees C in the firing temperatures are well zzso Furthermore, the images permit distinguishing the different zzso The effects of the contrast in relaxation times dominate those due to the different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso confirms the interpretation that the changes in relaxation times are due to different pore space structures associated with the different firing zzso The higher the firing temperature, the larger are the pores and the higher is the amount of zzso zzso zzso leading to higher relaxation zzso
