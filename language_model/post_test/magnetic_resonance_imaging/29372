Although magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso zzso and other spinal zzso have been well zzso the role of contrast enhancement in this diagnosis has been zzso We describe such a case and correlate the zzso findings with the zzso 

A zzso woman was admitted with of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso spine showed degenerative changes with zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso was performed and the mass zzso The zzso diagnosis was consistent with a zzso zzso zzso zzso the patient's symptoms resolved zzso
