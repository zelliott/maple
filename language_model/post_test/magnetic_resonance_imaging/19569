To assess the performance of three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the pelvis and lower zzso in patients without acute deep zzso zzso by using a lower zzso vascular zzso and pedal injection of zzso contrast zzso 

Conventional and MR zzso were performed in 35 legs in 25 patients referred for evaluation of zzso zzso zzso 8) and zzso changes zzso zzso 7) and assessment of the great zzso veins prior to bypass surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso of 120 zzso of diluted zzso zzso zzso into a pedal vein was performed manually at a rate of 1 zzso and zzso zzso echo data sets of the upper and lower veins were zzso Conventional and MR zzso images were analyzed separately in a blinded zzso 

MR image quality was comparable to that of conventional zzso zzso changes of the great and small zzso veins zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were assessed as reliably as their status before bypass surgery zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso changes were diagnosed with a sensitivity of zzso zzso of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso MR zzso zzso displays the lower zzso zzso system and permits assessment of zzso and zzso changes and the bypass suitability of the zzso zzso
