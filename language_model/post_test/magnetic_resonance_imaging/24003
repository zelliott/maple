In imaging of zzso noble zzso a knowledge of the diffusion zzso zzso is important both as a contrast mechanism and in the design of pulse zzso We have made diffusion zzso maps of both zzso zzso and zzso in guinea pig zzso Along the length of the zzso zzso D values were on average zzso zzso closely zzso calculated values for free gas zzso zzso The zzso D values measured perpendicular to the length of the trachea were approximately a factor of two less, indicating restriction to zzso Further evidence of restricted diffusion was seen in the zzso pulmonary zzso as the average zzso D was zzso zzso An additional cause for the smaller zzso D in the lung was due to the presence of air, which is composed of heavier and larger zzso The zzso results show similar trends, with the trachea D averaging zzso zzso and the lung D averaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
