Investigation has shown that the most useful zzso finding for the detection of breast cancer is enhancement following in zzso zzso However, many widely different imaging protocols have been zzso The purpose of this study is to zzso factors that affect the signal intensity of breast zzso after intravenous zzso 

A computer model was developed using equations based on published zzso The effect of zzso on breast zzso was calculated using the model with appropriate values for baseline tissue relaxation times, zzso of zzso at the given field strength and concentration of zzso based on published data, for the zzso zzso flip angle and field strength of several published sequences used for enhanced breast zzso 

The computer model allows comparison of the performance of different zzso which can be displayed zzso These vary in their performance, largely dependent on zzso zzso Enhancement is also affected by the baseline of the zzso of the zzso and sensitivity of the sequence to zzso zzso zzso demonstrate greater observed enhancement than predicted when assuming zzso distribution of contrast, indicating there is greater zzso of zzso accounting for the differential enhancement between benign and zzso zzso 

zzso sequences vary greatly in their demonstration of enhancement after intravenous zzso zzso zzso diagnostic criteria such as % signal intensity change must be interpreted with care when using a different sequence than that on which the criterion was zzso There is zzso greater zzso of contrast in zzso zzso whether due to zzso or altered zzso
