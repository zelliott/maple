Although there are a number of functional zzso studies that have investigated zzso and zzso movements, data directly comparing right and left hands in this context are very zzso The goal of this study was to further understand the role of the zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso in the realm of zzso and zzso right and left hand zzso Young healthy right-handed adults performed random, follow and repeat conditions of a finger moving task with their right and left hands, while being scanned with functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso was observed when comparing the zzso movements with the repeated control and zzso movements when using either hand in agreement with its role in zzso The zzso nucleus zzso was found during zzso conditions compared with the control condition when either hand was used, showing that it is particularly involved when a new movement needs to be zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in all zzso contrasts except for the zzso zzso control condition when using the left zzso Furthermore, greater zzso zzso was found for the left zzso the right hand during the control condition, but for the right zzso the left hand zzso for the zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso is particularly involved in the execution of zzso movements, especially if those are zzso Furthermore, we propose that, for right-handed people performing fine movements, as far as zzso involvement is concerned, the lack of proficiency of the zzso hand may prevail over other task zzso
