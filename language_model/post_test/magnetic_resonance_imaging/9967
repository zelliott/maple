We observed the response of a magnetic resonance signal to zzso activity in dissected snail zzso to investigate faster responding components than the blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso To eliminate the zzso component completely from the magnetic resonance zzso we used dissected snail zzso which have zzso zzso other than zzso as an oxygen carrying zzso To activate the snail zzso in synchronization with the magnetic resonance signal zzso we applied 30 zzso electrical stimulation with a pulse zzso of 2 s to the zzso just before the 90 degrees zzso zzso The increase of zzso activity in the snail zzso after the electrical stimulation was confirmed with zzso potential zzso The magnetic resonance signal intensity, measured with the volume selection pulse sequence in a zzso T zzso decreased by about zzso zzso zzso when the zzso were activated by the electrical zzso We think that the zzso signal decrease is partly due to the magnetic field produced by the zzso current and partly due to the zzso force exerted on the zzso when they were zzso
