We compared the sizes of the zzso zzso among conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso loaded zzso and upright zzso in patients with zzso spinal canal zzso zzso 

To determine whether zzso loaded zzso can demonstrate similar zzso changes of the zzso zzso size as were detected by upright zzso in zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is worsened and symptoms are aggravated during standing or zzso To disclose such zzso changes, upright zzso has been widely zzso Recently, zzso loaded zzso which can simulate a standing position, has been zzso However, there has been no study to compare the zzso zzso size between zzso loaded zzso and upright zzso 

zzso patients underwent conventional zzso zzso loaded zzso and zzso zzso and zzso diameters and the zzso areas of the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso were zzso zzso correlations of the diameters between the zzso and the zzso were zzso On the basis of the zzso all disc levels were divided into severe and zzso zzso zzso In each group, the diameters and the zzso areas were zzso zzso and specificity to detect severe zzso were calculated for the conventional and zzso loaded zzso 

zzso and zzso diameters at zzso in the zzso loaded zzso and zzso were significantly smaller than those observed in the conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso areas in the zzso loaded zzso were significantly smaller than those in the conventional zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Between the zzso loaded zzso and the zzso zzso correlation zzso of the zzso and zzso diameters were zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso which were higher than those for conventional zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sizes in the zzso loaded zzso were more evident in the severe zzso zzso The zzso loaded zzso detected severe zzso with a higher sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso than the conventional zzso 

The zzso loaded zzso demonstrated a significant reduction in the zzso zzso size and significant correlations of the zzso zzso diameters with the upright zzso Furthermore, the zzso loaded zzso had higher sensitivity and specificity than the conventional zzso for detecting the severe zzso observed in the zzso zzso the zzso loaded zzso can be used to represent zzso changes of the zzso zzso size detected by the upright zzso in patients with zzso
