It is unclear whether impaired cardiac and/or vascular function contribute to exercise intolerance in patients with type 2 zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to determine whether reductions in cardiac output and/or zzso zzso blood flow contribute to reduced zzso capacity in patients with type 2 zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso blood flow zzso scans were performed at rest and during zzso leg exercise in eight patients with type 2 diabetes and 11 healthy zzso zzso zzso capacity zzso zzso and zzso oxygen pulse were also determined in all zzso 

V zzso zzso was zzso lower and zzso oxygen pulse was zzso lower in patients with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso heart rate was the same between zzso zzso exercise induced a zzso increase in heart rate and cardiac output as well as a zzso increase in zzso blood flow in both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso to thigh lean mass was reduced during exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with healthy zzso Stroke volume zzso to zzso mass was lower in patients with type 2 diabetes, but greater heart rate allowed cardiac output to be maintained during zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that impaired zzso zzso blood flow, an indirect marker of muscle zzso affects zzso exercise performance in patients with type 2 zzso However, because of lower exercising stroke volume, we propose that zzso zzso blood flow and, zzso cardiac zzso limit V zzso zzso in patients with type 2 zzso
