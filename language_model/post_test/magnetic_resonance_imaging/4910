The aim of the study was to assess the value of in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in diabetic mice at zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These conditions might provide electrical zzso which is a zzso for zzso zzso mapping has been proposed to zzso diffuse zzso zzso in cardiac diseases but has several zzso zzso measurement may represent an alternative for zzso zzso at high magnetic zzso 

A magnetic resonance imaging protocol including in zzso zzso zzso at zzso T was performed in 9 male zzso mice after 8 weeks of zzso diabetes and in 9 control zzso zzso zzso stimulation was performed in both zzso zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso of zzso using zzso red zzso 

zzso zzso was significantly lower in diabetic mice zzso zzso zzso zzso than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was a good correlation between zzso and zzso area obtained by zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso During programmed zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso were induced in diabetic mice versus none in the control zzso 

The in zzso zzso relaxation time strongly correlated with zzso zzso area assessed with zzso zzso in diabetic zzso
