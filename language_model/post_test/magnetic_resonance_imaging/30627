zzso resonance imaging zzso provides insights into the dynamics of focal cerebral zzso Usually, experimental stroke is induced outside the magnet zzso preventing investigators from acquiring zzso images for later zzso comparisons and from studying the earliest changes in the zzso phase of zzso zzso we introduce a new and easy to apply zzso zzso protocol based on the zzso zzso of ceramic zzso zzso zzso filled with saline and six zzso zzso zzso in zzso was placed into the internal carotid artery zzso of zzso zzso zzso The animals were transferred into an zzso scanner zzso zzso and baseline zzso imaging zzso and zzso was zzso Then the zzso were injected into the internal artery to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was started immediately zzso The apparent diffusion zzso zzso (a marker for zzso brain zzso and zzso time (a marker for zzso brain zzso were determined in the zzso zzso and compared to the unaffected zzso zzso significantly declined within the first zzso zzso after stroke zzso zzso time increased as early as at the first zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso After 150 zzso of zzso the zzso covered zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The model failed in one out of nine animals zzso This model allows zzso from the initial minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso It does not permit zzso This technique might provide information about the zzso processes in the zzso phase of zzso
