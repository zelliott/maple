Both zzso and zzso dysfunction have been observed in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso dysfunction is related to disturbances in relaxation and zzso zzso 

To zzso cardiac zzso regional zzso and zzso relaxation in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso rotation and relaxation in controls and patients with chronic zzso zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso tagging is based on magnetic resonance imaging and allows us to label specific zzso regions for imaging cardiac motion zzso translation and zzso zzso A zzso grid was placed on the zzso zzso equatorial and zzso zzso zzso of each of 18 patients with chronic zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso zzso change in area and zzso of circumference were determined in each zzso 

The left zzso in controls performs a zzso wringing motion with a zzso rotation at the base and a zzso rotation at the zzso when viewed from the zzso During relaxation a zzso motion in the opposite direction zzso zzso can be zzso In patients with zzso zzso there is less zzso rotation at the zzso and zzso zzso is delayed and prolonged in comparison with zzso In the presence of a left zzso aneurysm zzso zzso 4) zzso rotation is completely zzso There is less zzso of circumference in zzso and remote zzso 

The wringing motion of the zzso might be an important mechanism involved in maintaining normal cardiac function with minimal expenditure of zzso This mechanism no longer operates in patients with left zzso zzso and operates significantly less than normal in those with zzso zzso zzso zzso is significantly delayed and prolonged in patients with zzso zzso which could explain the occurrence of zzso dysfunction in these zzso
