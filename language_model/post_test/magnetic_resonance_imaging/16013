zzso in the human motion complex zzso is related to the perception of motion, be it either real surface motion or an illusion of motion such as apparent motion zzso or motion zzso zzso It is a long-lasting debate whether zzso zzso zzso in zzso represent the motion itself or attention to zzso We have asked whether zzso responses to zzso are present when shifts in zzso are suppressed and attention is focused on concurrent motion versus zzso zzso zzso enhancement of zzso activity was observed during zzso when attention was focused either on concurrent spatial angle or color zzso This observation was confirmed by direct comparison of adapting zzso zzso versus zzso zzso In contrast, this effect was diminished when subjects had to report on zzso speed changes of superimposed zzso The same finding was observed for zzso zzso real motion zzso suggesting that selective attention to concurrent zzso or real motion was interfering with the zzso of zzso signals in zzso We conclude that zzso changes in the global activity of zzso are present provided selective attention is not focused on an interfering feature such as concurrent zzso zzso there is a genuine zzso motion signal in zzso that is neither explained by shifts in zzso nor by selective zzso
