The original cohort of zzso patients was zzso to zzso 44 or 22 zzso three times weekly zzso or to zzso after 2 years, patients on zzso were zzso to active treatment and the blinded study continued for a further 4 zzso The zzso visit was scheduled 7 to 8 years after zzso

Despite the limitations inherent in any long-term study (for example, potential differences between returning and zzso zzso these results indicate that patients with zzso multiple sclerosis can experience sustained benefit over many years from early zzso zzso subcutaneous therapy three times weekly compared with patients whose treatment is zzso This effect was more apparent in the patients receiving the higher zzso
