zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso at rest and during zzso infusion was used to study wall motion abnormalities in patients with severe coronary artery zzso proven by coronary zzso Sixteen patients without zzso zzso but at least one major coronary artery with zzso or zzso zzso diameter narrowing were zzso zzso zzso assessment of wall motion, as well as quantitative measurement zzso zzso changes zzso were compared using receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also studied for zzso Using qualitative analysis, coronary artery disease detection rate was comparable when assessing wall motion abnormalities with zzso zzso and with zzso zzso defects with zzso zzso Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity for identification of all diseased coronary territories were comparable for both imaging zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The quantitative method has a substantially higher sensitivity than the qualitative method in identifying all diseased territories zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, we demonstrated that the quantitative method had higher performance than the qualitative one in identifying the diseased vessels territories related to zzso zzso and each of individual coronary artery zzso
