While zzso magnetic resonance imaging promises improved image quality and faster scan time, it is affected by zzso flip angle zzso and unsafe specific zzso rate levels within the patient, as a result of the complicated zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso study explored the possibility of using a single mechanically rotating zzso zzso for zzso zzso and specific zzso rate management applications at 7 zzso In particular, this new approach (with three different zzso zzso element zzso was compared against both an zzso parallel zzso array and a zzso volume zzso with and without zzso current zzso The evaluation was conducted using an in-house developed and validated zzso zzso method in conjunction with a zzso human head zzso It was found that, without current zzso the rotating zzso zzso method produced a more uniform flip angle distribution and a lower maximum global and local specific zzso rate compared to the zzso parallel zzso array and zzso zzso In addition, due to the large number of degrees of freedom in the form of rotated sensitivity profiles, the rotating zzso zzso approach exhibited good zzso zzso and specific zzso rate management zzso This suggests that the proposed method can be useful in the development of techniques that address contemporary zzso issues associated with zzso magnetic resonance zzso
