Spinal range of motion is evaluated in assessing patients with back problems and monitoring zzso as well as in general fitness zzso Yet, zzso of the substantial zzso variation in spinal range of motion are not well zzso zzso genetic effects on global measures of range of motion and zzso have been suggested from earlier studies, but genetic influences specifically on spinal range of motion have not been previously zzso The objectives of the present study were to investigate the relative role of genetic and environmental influences on zzso range of motion in adult men and the pathways through which genes may influence range of zzso Thus we conducted a classic twin study of 300 zzso and zzso male twin pairs with consideration of zzso using standard statistical zzso All subjects underwent a clinical examination, including general zzso zzso range of motion, and zzso zzso to assess disc zzso as well as an extensive interview on environmental and behavioral zzso and back pain zzso We found the proportion of zzso in zzso range of motion attributable to genetic influences zzso zzso to be zzso The extent of zzso range of motion in zzso was predominantly determined by genetic influences zzso while extension was influenced to a somewhat greater degree by environmental and behavioral zzso zzso significant zzso genetic correlations were found between zzso extension and disc zzso variables zzso zzso zzso to zzso and between zzso and body weight zzso zzso zzso suggesting two pathways through which genes influence zzso range of zzso
