The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of clinically recognized zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in 70-year-old subjects, assessed with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to relate the findings to cardiac function and zzso 

Late enhancement zzso identifies zzso scars and thereby has the potential to detect zzso 

zzso zzso was performed on 259 randomly chosen 70-year-old zzso Late enhancement and zzso sequences were acquired, and the ejection fraction and left zzso zzso mass were zzso Late enhancement involving the zzso layer was considered to represent zzso zzso zzso zzso and their volumes were zzso Information on cardiac morbidity and risk factors was collected from medical records and from a health zzso zzso with zzso zzso with or without a hospital diagnosis of zzso were classified as zzso or zzso zzso 

The images from 248 subjects zzso women, 125 zzso were zzso zzso zzso scars were found in 60 subjects zzso in 49 of whom zzso they were zzso The volumes of the zzso were significantly smaller than those of the zzso There was an increased frequency of chest pain symptoms among the subjects with zzso or zzso compared with those without zzso zzso zzso fraction was significantly lower and zzso mass significantly larger in the subjects with zzso or zzso than in those without zzso zzso 

zzso zzso detected with zzso was more frequent than expected in 70-year-old zzso The subjects displaying these zzso may represent a previously unknown potential risk group for future cardiovascular zzso
