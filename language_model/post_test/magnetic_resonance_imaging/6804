The therapeutic potential of administering stem cells to promote zzso and zzso tissue zzso after zzso has recently been zzso Given the advantages of using embryonic stem cells and mouse models of zzso zzso for zzso the development of this therapeutic approach, the purpose of this study was to determine if embryonic stem cells could be loaded with zzso iron oxide zzso particles and zzso in a mouse model of zzso zzso over time using zzso Mouse embryonic stem cells were labeled with zzso zzso When incubated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells took up increasing amounts of iron zzso zzso stem cells loaded with zzso compared to zzso cells had similar viability and proliferation profiles for up to 14 zzso Free zzso injected into zzso zzso was not zzso within 12 zzso after zzso After injection of three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the mouse embryonic stem cells were zzso and could be seen for at least 5 weeks after zzso These findings support the ability of zzso to test the long-term therapeutic potential of embryonic stem cells in small animals in the setting of zzso zzso
