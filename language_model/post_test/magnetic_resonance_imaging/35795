The zzso strengths of knee zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscles were compared in a group of 6 male subjects aged zzso zzso zzso area zzso of E and F was evaluated from zzso zzso of Nuclear zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso scans, carried out at five levels along the zzso zzso zzso for E was found at 2/3 upper zzso height and at 1/3 lower zzso height for zzso zzso zzso force zzso of E was found to be zzso greater than that of zzso The maximum zzso of E was found to be zzso larger than zzso of zzso The calculated mechanical advantage of the zzso was estimated to be zzso higher than that of the knee zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, when zzso of E and F were zzso for their respective zzso no significant difference was found between their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for E and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso From the present study, it is concluded that no significant difference exists between the maximum stress of knee zzso and zzso muscles despite large differences in their absolute values of force and zzso and that the zzso imaging technique enables accurate zzso determination of the zzso of individual zzso
