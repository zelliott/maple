The goal of this work was to analyze asymmetry of zzso formation in zzso zzso The objects of the analysis were 10 zzso scans of patients with zzso with established cognitive function zzso zzso scans were obtained using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The measurement of zzso formation dimensions, and comparisons between the right and the left side were done using evaluate - distance program on the zzso instrument of the Institute of zzso at zzso zzso zzso We tested 20 patients with zzso zzso years of average age with standard zzso of zzso zzso Based on the analysis of our results regarding the size of zzso formation in all the three projections zzso zzso and zzso in the group of patients with zzso we can the make the following zzso zzso In zzso slice the length of zzso formation measured on the left and right side is significantly zzso in all zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso formation measured on the left side is in many cases longer than in the right - 50 zzso In zzso slice no significant differences were found in the proportion of patients according to zzso of zzso formation zzso on the left and zzso zzso The difference in average size of zzso formation between the left and right side measured in zzso and zzso slices is not statistically zzso but it is significant in zzso zzso So, the results of this new research, showed smaller zzso dimensions in zzso as measured using zzso We have to be careful about what projection we are refusing to as being watched zzso formation because the results will depend on zzso We suggest that future studies be done in more projections because of the importance of statistically significant zzso zzso - zzso zzso have their zzso
