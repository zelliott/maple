The present study aimed to test the feasibility of a novel zzso technique, that is, zzso sparse cortical current density zzso imaging algorithm, in zzso zzso location and extent of zzso sources from zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 108 zzso spikes from 3 partial zzso patients were selected to perform zzso source zzso zzso sources were identified at spike peaks, rising zzso and entire zzso respectively, from all zzso spikes in each patient, to estimate source locations and zzso and validated using zzso evaluation zzso Other source analysis methods, that is, minimum norm estimate and sparse source imaging were also performed for zzso 

zzso sources reconstructed by zzso that are consistent with clinical zzso evaluation outcomes have detection rates of zzso at spike peaks, zzso during rising zzso and zzso in entire zzso zzso zzso patterns of reconstructed cortical sources were also obtained using zzso which provide more insights about the formation and propagation of zzso zzso zzso 

Our present results suggest that the zzso technique has the capability in zzso location and extent of zzso sources of zzso spikes and is promising to become a valuable zzso tool in assisting zzso planning for partial zzso zzso
