zzso zzso evidence suggests that in migraine executive functions zzso may be affected during zzso zzso 

To evaluate the functional connectivity of the zzso networks zzso known to be associated with zzso in migraine without aura zzso patients, in the zzso period, in comparison to healthy controls zzso 

Using zzso functional zzso zzso we compared functional connectivity within the zzso in 14 patients with zzso versus 14 zzso and zzso zzso and assessed the correlation between functional connectivity within zzso clinical features of zzso patients, and zzso We used zzso zzso to assess whether zzso differences in functional connectivity were dependent on structural zzso 

zzso data revealed no significant executive dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso patients, compared to zzso had significant functional connectivity reduction within the right zzso and specifically in the middle frontal zzso zzso and the zzso anterior zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso reduced connectivity was zzso correlated with the pain intensity of migraine zzso There were no structural differences between the two zzso 

Our data suggest that, even in the absence of clinically evident zzso deficits, zzso is associated with reduced zzso functional zzso This study provides further insights into the complex scenario of migraine zzso
