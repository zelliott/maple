Our objective was to establish the role of zzso zzso techniques in the management of brain zzso in zzso 

A retrospective analysis was conducted of all zzso procedures performed in a single zzso between 1996 and zzso The success rates of achieving zzso diagnosis and a correlation between zzso and zzso diagnosis were zzso 

There were 7 boys and 7 girls with a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso Under general zzso 15 procedures were performed in 14 zzso 12 diagnostic and 3 zzso 10 with CT and 5 with zzso zzso 10 zzso were zzso and 4 were in the zzso A definitive zzso diagnosis was established in 10 of the 12 cases zzso yield zzso The zzso zzso diagnosis was accurate for zzso type in only zzso of the zzso In 3 patients zzso aspiration was zzso zzso the zzso size was decreased in 2 and unchanged in zzso zzso and acute confusion following biopsy of a zzso zzso occurred in 1 zzso zzso scans were performed in 7 patients and in 2 we noted small, clinically zzso zzso at the biopsy zzso There was no mortality and morbidity was zzso 

This small series confirms that zzso procedures in children are safe, well zzso with a high diagnostic yield, which could be improved with the use of zzso zzso zzso
