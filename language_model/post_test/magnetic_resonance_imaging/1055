Selective attention operates in visual zzso by zzso processing of selected stimuli and by filtering out unwanted information from nearby zzso over circumscribed regions of visual zzso The neural representation of unattended stimuli outside this focus of attention is less well zzso We studied the neural fate of unattended stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging by zzso the activity evoked by attended zzso stimuli presented to the periphery of a visual zzso and unattended zzso stimuli presented simultaneously to a corresponding location of the zzso zzso zzso covertly directed attention to a series of target stimuli and performed either a low or a high zzso search task on a stream of otherwise identical zzso With this task, zzso activity increased with increasing zzso load, whereas zzso activity decreased with increasing load in areas zzso and zzso but not in early areas zzso and zzso This finding presents evidence for a zzso zzso mechanism of selective attention that operates over large portions of the visual field at intermediate processing zzso This mechanism appeared to be controlled by a distributed zzso network of brain areas that reflected processes related to target selection during zzso directed zzso
