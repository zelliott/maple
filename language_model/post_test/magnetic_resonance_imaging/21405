zzso has proven zzso effects, but the mechanism by which zzso delays the development of zzso and zzso after peripheral nerve injury remains zzso zzso cells, in particular zzso are critical components of the response to nerve zzso Using zzso zzso iron zzso resonance imaging zzso to monitor zzso trafficking, the purpose of this project is to determine whether zzso zzso zzso trafficking to the site of nerve injury in zzso and, in turn, results in altered pain zzso 

Animal experiments were approved by Stanford zzso A model of zzso pain was created using the zzso Nerve zzso zzso model that involves zzso of the left zzso nerve in the left thigh of adult zzso zzso Animals with zzso and zzso animals were then injected zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nerves were scanned with a volume zzso in a zzso magnet zzso after zzso zzso zzso MR images were zzso and zzso were placed on bilateral zzso nerves to zzso signal zzso zzso behavior zzso by zzso was measured using the Von Frey filament zzso zzso nerves were ultimately harvested at day 7, fixed in zzso zzso zzso and stained for the presence of iron zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso in the zzso pain model while the zzso and zzso injured group had significantly higher paw withdrawal thresholds zzso zzso MR signal is observed in the zzso group that received zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso group that received zzso zzso and zzso group that did not receive zzso zzso zzso zzso of harvested zzso nerve specimens confirmed the presence zzso at the nerve injury site in the zzso group without zzso zzso 

Animals with zzso pain in the left zzso show increased trafficking of zzso zzso to the site of zzso nerve zzso zzso to zzso the migration of zzso to the nerve injury site, which may partly explain its zzso zzso zzso is an effective in zzso imaging tool to study the role of zzso in the development of zzso zzso
