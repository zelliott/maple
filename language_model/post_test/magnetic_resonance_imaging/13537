The choice of the therapeutic strategies in patients affected with zzso cancer is strictly dependent by the tumor zzso So, in order to obtain an improvement in zzso staging zzso new imaging zzso are now under zzso The aim of this work is the evaluation of zzso zzso in the local staging of zzso zzso 

zzso patients affected with zzso proven zzso cancer, have been evaluated by an zzso strength magnet zzso zzso In zzso patients zzso zzso chemotherapy had been previously zzso In all cases zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences and zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso with and without fat suppression, were zzso Basing upon the zzso staging system and the previously reported zzso signs the local extent of the tumor was zzso focusing about the zzso wall zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso All the patients underwent surgery and a comparative evaluation of zzso and pathological staging was zzso 

At zzso the tumor was detected in zzso zzso In evaluating wall zzso the zzso results agreed with pathological results in zzso of patients and showed zzso accuracy in zzso stage and zzso in zzso In evaluating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso 

The poor accuracy of CT and zzso zzso in evaluating wall involvement in patients with zzso cancer is mainly related to their inability to demonstrate the single layers of the zzso zzso So zzso ultrasound is now the first choice zzso in local staging of zzso zzso However zzso ultrasound showed low sensitivity in detecting zzso zzso zzso zzso and low accuracy in evaluating the patients previously undergone to zzso chemotherapy or zzso On the other hand the improvement of zzso sequences and the availability of the zzso coils allowed to zzso the single layers of the zzso wall so making the zzso zzso a reliable imaging technique to stage zzso zzso The results of our work demonstrate a good diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso in local staging of zzso cancer, in particular the degree of zzso wall zzso was well demonstrated, while the zzso zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated with less zzso The long examination time, the costs and the zzso zzso are the main limits of zzso In particular the zzso artifacts sometime do not allow the zzso of the wall layers so lowering the diagnostic accuracy in demonstrating the tumor wall zzso In conclusion, even though zzso zzso zzso proved to be a reliable imaging technique in local staging of zzso cancer, at present we are not able to state what may be its real role in diagnostic evaluation of the patients with zzso cancer, in particular if compared to zzso zzso Further, comparative studies, based upon larger patients series are probably needed to draw a definitive zzso
