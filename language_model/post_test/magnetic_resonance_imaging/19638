Using zzso magnetic zzso we studied the role of the primary motor zzso zzso in repetitive movements, examining whether the functional contribution of this region is associated with controlling response timing, response zzso or zzso In two experiments, participants performed a rhythmic tapping task, attempting to produce zzso intervals zzso of zzso zzso while stimulation was applied over zzso or a control zzso zzso stimulation was associated with increased zzso of the zzso intervals zzso and, by manipulating stimulation intensity, we identified two distinct changes in zzso a generalized increase in zzso zzso and a delay in the subsequent response when the pulse fell within a restricted window prior to movement zzso Using a series of simulations, we demonstrate that the general increase in zzso and the temporally specific delay reflect disruption of response zzso processes rather than an increase in noise associated with response zzso
