zzso overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction zzso and zzso zzso are characterized by greatly reduced sensitivity to motion, compared to their zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso This is due to the inherent zzso and motion correction of zzso zzso However, it is unknown how various acquisition parameters that determine zzso sampling affect the accuracy of motion correction in zzso and zzso zzso The goal of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of motion correction in both techniques, to identify an optimal rotation correction approach, and determine acquisition strategies for optimal motion zzso It was demonstrated that zzso with multiple lines allow more accurate zzso of motion than zzso with fewer zzso Also, it was shown that zzso zzso is less sensitive to motion than zzso Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the number of zzso does not significantly affect motion zzso Finally, clinically appropriate acquisition strategies that zzso motion correction are discussed for zzso and zzso zzso
