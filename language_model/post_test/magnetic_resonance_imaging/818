Insight problem solving has been the topic of much zzso It is believed widely that insight critically contains the process of breaking one's mental zzso Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso research on puzzle solving showed that insight was associated with activities in anterior zzso zzso zzso and other areas zzso and Niki zzso zzso zzso We proposed zzso might mediate processes of breaking one's mental set, given its well-known role in cognitive zzso In the present research, zzso zzso zzso zzso were recorded to examine the zzso zzso of insight problem zzso One hundred zzso interesting Chinese zzso zzso difficult and half zzso were adopted as zzso For each trial, subjects were either given an easy puzzle followed by a zzso that was consistent with the zzso initial thinking zzso zzso or a difficult puzzle followed by a zzso that was consistent with an unusual zzso so that it broke the zzso initial mental set zzso zzso zzso from 14 subjects showed that zzso answers zzso a more negative zzso zzso than did zzso answers in the time window from zzso zzso after onset of the zzso The zzso difference wave zzso minus zzso zzso showed the maximum zzso over the central site zzso with a peak zzso of 380 zzso zzso zzso and current density maps of the difference wave showed strong activity and current density in the zzso zzso zzso analysis localized the generator of the zzso in the zzso zzso therefore probably reflects an zzso effect, and the zzso generator may be involved in the breaking of mental zzso
