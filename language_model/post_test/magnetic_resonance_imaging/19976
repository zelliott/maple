Muscle zzso is clearly related to a loss of muscle torque, but the reduction in muscle size cannot entirely account for the decrease in muscle zzso zzso neural input to muscle has been proposed to account for much of the remaining zzso deficits after disuse or zzso The purpose of this investigation was to assess the relative contributions of voluntary muscle zzso failure and muscle zzso to loss of zzso muscle zzso after zzso Nine subjects zzso zzso years with unilateral ankle zzso fractures were treated by open zzso fixation and 7 weeks of cast zzso zzso participated in 10 weeks of rehabilitation that focused on both strength and endurance of the zzso zzso resonance imaging, zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed at 0, 5, and 10 weeks of zzso Following zzso voluntary muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and peak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were all significantly decreased ( p zzso zzso compared to the zzso limb zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During 10 weeks of rehabilitation, muscle zzso alone accounted for zzso of the zzso in zzso ( p zzso zzso and muscle zzso alone accounted for zzso of the zzso in zzso ( p zzso zzso Together, zzso and muscle zzso accounted for zzso of the zzso in zzso ( p zzso zzso The greatest gains in muscle zzso were made during the first 5 weeks of zzso Both increases in voluntary muscle zzso and muscle zzso contributed to the recovery in muscle strength following zzso with large gains in zzso during the first 5 weeks of zzso In contrast, muscle zzso showed fairly comparable gains throughout both the early and later phase of zzso
