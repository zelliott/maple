zzso zzso zzso zzso are rare, zzso approximately zzso of all zzso zzso zzso The management of these zzso is challenging, and their optimal surgical treatment is zzso This study evaluates the role of zzso in the treatment of zzso in children, focusing on some factors or technical aspects that might influence the zzso 

zzso children with symptomatic zzso were the subject of this zzso The group included 10 boys and 8 girls, with a mean age of zzso zzso All patients had zzso zzso treatment included zzso zzso zzso zzso third zzso zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso (2 zzso and removal of zzso malfunctioning zzso shunt (4 zzso 

zzso clinical improvement occurred in 15 cases zzso zzso zzso showed a reduction in the zzso size in 14 cases zzso whereas in the remaining 4 cases zzso the zzso size was zzso A zzso decrease in zzso size was encountered in 16 cases zzso Minor zzso bleeding occurred in 1 case zzso which stopped spontaneously without any zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in 3 cases zzso and required a zzso shunt in 2 zzso During follow-up zzso zzso zzso a repeat zzso procedure was performed in 7 patients (all 4 patients with a prior shunt and 3 patients without a prior zzso and new shunt placement was required in 5 patients (all 4 patients with a prior shunt and 1 patient without a prior zzso Thus, none of the patients with a prior shunt was able to become shunt independent, whereas zzso of patients without a prior shunt were able to avoid shunt zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the associated zzso can be effectively treated by zzso The procedure is simple, minimally zzso and associated with low morbidity and mortality zzso The fact that all patients who previously received zzso required a repeat zzso procedure and that none of these patients was able to become shunt independent makes it clear that zzso treatment should be considered the first choice in the management of patients with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
