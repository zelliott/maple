zzso of pancreatic zzso with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso enables their zzso monitoring by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Although the zzso are incorporated into zzso cells in culture, little is known about their fate in zzso We studied the zzso of labeled zzso after zzso aiming to identify the zzso contrast particles and their relationship to transplantation zzso zzso zzso labeled with the zzso were transplanted into the liver or under the kidney capsule of zzso and zzso zzso After in zzso zzso zzso was studied by light, zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso of zzso zzso transplanted beneath the kidney capsule vs into the liver was zzso Iron particles were almost completely eliminated from the zzso cells and remained located in zzso zzso surrounding the vital zzso for the entire study zzso In the zzso model, zzso lost their function and were completely rejected within nine days following transplantation in both transplant zzso However, zzso transport of the zzso particles and subsequent zzso findings was different in the liver and zzso In the liver, the decreasing number of zzso zzso spots corresponded with clearance of iron particles in rejected zzso in contrast, with zzso transplants extensive iron deposits with a high effect on zzso signal persisted in zzso cells beneath the zzso We conclude that zzso detection of the iron contrast agent zzso with zzso survival and function in zzso transplantation into the liver, while it does not correlate in the case of transplantation beneath the zzso zzso
