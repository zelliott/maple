In the last decade, zzso magnetic stimulation zzso has been used increasingly as a tool to explore the mechanisms and consequences of cortical plasticity in the intact human zzso Because the spatial accuracy of the technique is zzso we refer to this as plasticity at a regional zzso Currently, zzso is used to explore regional reorganization in three different zzso First, it can map changes in the pattern of connectivity within and between different cortical areas or their spinal zzso Important examples of this approach can be found in the work on motor zzso representations following a variety of interventions such as zzso skill zzso or zzso Second, zzso can be used to investigate the zzso relevance of these zzso By applying zzso in its zzso zzso mode, it is possible to interfere with cortical function and ask whether plastic reorganization within a distinct cortical area improves zzso Third, zzso can be used to promote changes in cortical zzso This is achieved by using repetitive zzso zzso to induce short-term functional reorganization in the human zzso The magnitude and the direction of zzso plasticity depend on zzso factors zzso the variables of stimulation such as intensity, frequency, and total number of zzso and intrinsic factors zzso the functional state of the zzso targeted by zzso Since conditioning effects of zzso are not limited to the zzso zzso but give rise to functional changes in interconnected cortical areas, zzso is a suitable tool to investigate plasticity within a distributed functional zzso Indeed, the lasting effects of zzso offer new possibilities to study dynamic aspects of the zzso of a variety of diseases and may have therapeutic potential in some zzso zzso
