It has long been thought that word problems are more difficult to solve than zzso zzso However, recent findings have begun to bring this broadly believed idea into zzso The current study examined the processing differences between these two types of zzso The behavioral results presented here failed to show an overwhelming advantage for number zzso In fact, there were more errors for the number problems than the word zzso The zzso results reported demonstrate that there is significant overlap in the processing of what, on the surface, appears to be completely different problems that elicit different problem-solving zzso Word and number problems rely on a general network responsible for problem-solving that includes the superior zzso zzso cortex, the horizontal segment of the zzso zzso which is hypothesized to be involved in problem representation and calculation as well as the regions that have been linked to executive aspects of working memory such as the zzso and zzso zzso While overlap was observed, significant differences were also found primarily in language processing regions such as zzso and zzso areas for the word problems and the horizontal segment of the zzso zzso for the number zzso
