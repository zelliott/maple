The purpose of this study was to ascertain current zzso safety practices in Australia regarding permanent zzso temporary pacing zzso cerebral aneurysm clips, implants of unknown zzso safety status, and use of metal zzso with respect to adherence to published zzso 

A questionnaire was distributed to more than 100 zzso facilities in zzso 

zzso responses, representing 102 zzso systems, were zzso zzso from approximately one in 15 sites were aware they had inadvertently zzso a patient who had a permanent zzso zzso zzso One of these episodes led to a zzso Use of modified request forms, on which referring physicians are asked for zzso safety information, was incomplete zzso zzso Four facilities deliberately zzso zzso zzso zzso of 89 facilities responded that they do not image patients with temporary pacing zzso zzso clips were accepted by most sites zzso and only one site associated with a zzso service refused such zzso zzso of 71 facilities required written identification of the clip zzso Most zzso of the sites reported delays due to the unknown zzso safety status of zzso Only four of 92 sites reported routine use of a metal zzso The guidelines of the American College of zzso and of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of zzso were equally influential zzso zzso Only 10 of 90 respondents reported use of external audits of safety zzso 

zzso vigilance is required for avoiding zzso of patients with zzso particularly when information from the patient is unreliable or zzso zzso referring physicians to provide zzso safety information may help to minimize zzso
