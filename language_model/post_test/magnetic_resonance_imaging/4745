zzso of the zzso zzso a region on the zzso surface of the zzso lobe involved in the production and comprehension of language, is a notable feature of the normal human zzso Several attempts have been made to measure it using both zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso methods, but previous approaches made inadequate allowance for the convoluted nature of the zzso The current study used rigorous criteria to define the zzso and examined three separate approaches for its measurement on zzso zzso A method involving zzso of the surface consistently gave larger values for the surface area of the zzso suggesting that this method takes account of the convoluted nature of the zzso
