Treatment resistance affects up to one third of patients with schizophrenia zzso A better understanding of its biological underlying processes could improve zzso The aim of this study was to compare cortical thickness between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients and healthy controls zzso 

zzso zzso scans were obtained from 3 groups of zzso 61 treatment resistant zzso individuals, 67 zzso zzso and 80 healthy zzso Images were analyzed using cortical surface zzso zzso in zzso zzso to identify group differences in cortical zzso zzso significant differences were identified using zzso simulation method with a corrected zzso 

Patients in the zzso group showed a widespread reduction in cortical thickness in zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions zzso zzso group had reduced zzso in two regions zzso superior frontal zzso and left zzso middle frontal zzso zzso group also showed decreased thickness in the left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso when compared with patients from zzso zzso 

The reduction in cortical thickness in zzso indicates a more severe form of the disease or a specific finding for this zzso zzso in this region should be explored as a putative marker for treatment zzso Prospective studies, with individuals being followed from first episode psychosis until zzso is zzso are needed to clarify these zzso
