We investigated the difference between brain activities in zzso and precisely timed responses to identical visual stimulus using zzso zzso used was a row of seven light-emitting zzso zzso zzso up one after another with constant speed within a trial but with various speeds between zzso zzso were asked to execute zzso tapping with the right hand in response to the onset of the first LED light in the reaction time zzso task and in anticipation of the onset of the last zzso zzso LED light in the timing zzso In control condition, they were asked to passively view the stimulus without motor zzso zzso showed that various zzso areas including zzso zzso motor zzso were commonly activated for both tasks relative to the control condition, suggesting these structures are involved in general perception and response execution rather than specific function for zzso or precisely timed zzso In the zzso task, the zzso motor area extending to the zzso zzso was activated more strongly than in the timing task probably to focus attention to the onset of the first LED light unpredictably presented after random zzso The lateral zzso area extending to the zzso junction was activated more strongly in the timing task than in the zzso zzso the same area was zzso in the zzso task relative to the control zzso zzso areas were also zzso in the both zzso This zzso and zzso zzso modification including zzso underscores significance of the context for perception and action and can have an important role in zzso or skilled zzso
