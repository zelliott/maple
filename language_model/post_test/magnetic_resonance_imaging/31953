To report the clinical and zzso features of 2 patients with zzso zzso zzso associated with severe acute zzso zzso The first patient had zzso 4 zzso zzso but no zzso enhancement, in contrast to the second patient who was zzso for zzso but had clear zzso enhancement on magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso laboratory, and zzso analysis of 10 patients presenting with features compatible with an zzso disorder, 2 of whom developed acute zzso zzso 

zzso ward at the Department of zzso Hadassah zzso 

Patients admitted during a zzso period with features compatible with an zzso zzso 

Medical histories and imaging data were reviewed and serum samples were analyzed for the presence of zzso 

Clinical and zzso evidence of brain zzso 

Of 10 patients tested, 5 were positive for zzso One zzso and 1 zzso patient had an acute zzso zzso zzso In both cases, the clinical, laboratory, and zzso findings supported a diagnosis of acute zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated extensive bilateral white matter zzso in both zzso zzso in the zzso patient were notably lacking in enhancement following zzso injection, whereas robust zzso enhancement was observed in the zzso zzso 

Acute zzso zzso without zzso enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging may represent a childhood manifestation of zzso zzso The lack of enhancement suggests an intact zzso barrier and supports a unique mechanism of zzso induction due to dysfunction of water zzso
