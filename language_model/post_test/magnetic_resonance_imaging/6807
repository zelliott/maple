There is considerable interest in performing zzso acquisitions of the heart in order to obtain high-quality images without the need for zzso long zzso In this article a zzso zzso method is described that is based on image registration of zzso data and zzso slice zzso A number of fast zzso zzso images are acquired, each of which is free of motion zzso Initially, zzso zzso and zzso motion between each image was corrected before combining the data to give a fully sampled zzso At the next stage, correction of zzso zzso in addition to translations and zzso was performed in the image zzso zzso zzso motion was compensated using a zzso echo to move the acquisition zzso Using this method, information on the motion of the heart was captured at the same time as acquiring the image zzso No motion model, assumptions about the motion, or training data are zzso The method is demonstrated on phantom data and cardiac images acquired on zzso zzso
