We assessed the value of magnetic resonance zzso zzso in diagnosing zzso by using a combination of oral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso fast zzso shot sequences were made in 22 patients in resting and straining states in the zzso position before and after administration of oral zzso zzso Twelve patients received zzso zzso solution in addition to contrast, and 10 received contrast zzso The zzso line was the reference used for diagnostic zzso The quality of each sequence was zzso zzso zzso test, zzso test, and the zzso test were applied for statistical zzso 

The results of zzso images were zzso There was a statistically significant difference between MR imaging diagnosis of zzso in patients in the straining position without and with contrast ( p zzso zzso and the difference was more prominent in patients using zzso zzso solution ( p zzso zzso Using oral contrast plus zzso zzso produced significantly better MR examinations in the resting and straining positions ( p zzso zzso 

The combination of oral contrast and zzso zzso solution improves the diagnostic value of MR zzso and is particularly useful when zzso examinations are zzso
