The 3-D zzso model in this study was reconstructed from a series of zzso torso zzso zzso We used a 3-D zzso array to represent the zzso As in cardiac simulations proposed by previous studies, the zzso sequence and body surface zzso were simulated in this zzso But to reduce the amount of elements in the model, so that the amount of parameters in the model can be handled zzso we propose another approach to simulate cardiac zzso A mesh model was constructed on the closed surface formed by zzso and zzso surfaces of the zzso We propose a method to simulate the zzso sequence on the zzso and zzso surfaces of the mesh zzso As with the uniform double layer zzso body surface zzso can be estimated in terms of zzso and zzso surface current zzso zzso we can also generate zzso zzso corresponding to this mesh zzso Both the zzso sequence and zzso simulated by the mesh model resemble those generated by the 3-D zzso zzso However, the mesh model greatly simplified the process of zzso zzso Both the simulation of zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in terms of clear and simple mathematical zzso zzso we can zzso investigate the effects of the mesh zzso parameters on the cardiac zzso sequence and zzso It could be a useful tool to zzso study the relation of zzso zzso and electrical activity of the zzso
