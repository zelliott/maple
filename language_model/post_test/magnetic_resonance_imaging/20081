To zzso determine if zzso artifacts from internal metallic spinal fixation devices and hip zzso limit the depiction of vascular anatomy and zzso abnormalities during magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso 

This study was approved by the Committee on Human Research of the Institutional Review Board, which zzso the requirement for informed consent and deemed the study to be zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso MR zzso examinations were performed by using a zzso zzso in 41 patients (16 men, 25 zzso mean age, 57 years; range, zzso zzso 33 of these examinations included both MR zzso and MR zzso zzso On the basis of resolution, images for which more than 3 zzso of vessels were affected by zzso artifacts were considered zzso The odds of obtaining an zzso image due to metallic artifacts were zzso and a zzso analysis was employed to determine zzso 

Total hip zzso and spinal hardware that terminated above the zzso level did not generate any appreciable artifacts at MR zzso zzso zzso zzso or MR zzso zzso zzso zzso In patients with hardware that extended to the zzso zzso of MR zzso were of diagnostic quality zzso zzso zzso but only zzso of MR zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso limited the evaluation of the inferior zzso zzso and common zzso veins near the zzso 

zzso MR zzso and MR zzso can be obtained in patients with artificial hip zzso and spinal hardware terminating above the zzso level, but there is zzso likelihood of obtaining a zzso MR zzso in patients with internal spinal fixation devices that extend to the zzso
