With the potential uses of zzso therapy zzso in cancer treatment with excellent zzso and the growing concerns about the zzso of zzso agents such as carbon zzso and zzso zzso the importance of searching for a zzso zzso agent cannot be emphasized too zzso In this work, a novel promising zzso agent employing magnetic zzso particles with fairly low toxicity was zzso This zzso agent showed rapid heat generation under zzso zzso After modification with zzso zzso zzso the obtained zzso particles could disperse zzso in PBS and serum without any zzso The modification of zzso could decrease the zzso of bovine serum zzso zzso and improve the cellular zzso In a comparative study with hollow gold zzso zzso zzso particles exhibited a comparable zzso effect and fairly low zzso The in zzso magnetic resonance zzso images of mice revealed that by attaching a magnet to the zzso zzso particles accumulated in the tumor after intravenous injection and showed a low distribution in the zzso After being exposed to a zzso zzso laser for 5 zzso at a low power density of zzso W zzso the tumors on zzso mice reached a temperature of zzso zzso and were completely zzso Thus, a kind of zzso magnetic zzso with extremely low toxicity and a simple structure for simultaneous MR imaging, targeted drug delivery and zzso therapy can be easily zzso
