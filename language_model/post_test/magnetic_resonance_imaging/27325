zzso deficits are core features in zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been associated with executive dysfunction in animals and zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of compromised zzso pathways on executive versus zzso cognitive functions of patients with zzso 

62 patients with schizophrenia and 62 zzso and zzso zzso control subjects zzso were assessed and compared zzso clinical measures, cognitive measures of global zzso executive function, and zzso and an zzso visual rating scale that zzso damage zzso localized within the zzso zzso 

11 of the 62 patients with schizophrenia zzso and 6 of the 62 controls zzso had compromised zzso zzso These proportions were not statistically zzso Patients and controls with compromised zzso pathways were more impaired on measures related to executive function than patients or controls without compromised zzso 

Patients with schizophrenia have worse executive function than zzso zzso zzso pathways appear to zzso the executive dysfunction observed in zzso If these preliminary findings are zzso they could lead to the identification of a zzso of patients with schizophrenia who could specifically benefit from interventions enhancing zzso zzso
