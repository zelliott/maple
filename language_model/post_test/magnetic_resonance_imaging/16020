This study proposes a technique for determining effective connectivity among brain regions which operates at the level of zzso zzso We propose an alternative zzso dynamic zzso model zzso where zzso dynamic activity zzso based on generalized dynamic neural networks zzso The identification of brain architecture connectivity is carried out based on a least squares criterion and on a global search zzso Computer simulations carried out in the paper show that zzso may provide multiple solutions, zzso a set of different zzso all of which approximate the data equally zzso zzso comparisons between zzso and zzso are also zzso In order to determine the unique zzso structure of brain regions, we apply an additional zzso zzso an zzso of zzso error, known from the theory of neural zzso Computer simulations also confirm the zzso of our zzso
