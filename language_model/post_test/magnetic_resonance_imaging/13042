zzso cuff zzso and zzso zzso syndrome present complex zzso situations, frequent difficulties in clinical diagnosis and lack of effectiveness in zzso Based on clinical experience, we have therefore considered the existence of another pathological entity as the possible origin of pain and zzso The hypothesis of this study is to relate zzso zzso syndrome zzso with zzso pain syndrome zzso since zzso trigger points zzso cause pain, functional zzso lack of coordination and zzso in quality of movement, even prior to a zzso zzso can coexist with any degenerative zzso zzso If they are not taken into consideration, they could perpetuate and aggravate the problem, hindering diagnosis and making the applied treatments zzso aims and methods of this study are related with providing evidence of the relationship that may exist between this condition and zzso in the diagnosis and treatment of rotator cuff zzso and/or zzso 

A descriptive zzso study will be made to find the correlation between the diagnosis of zzso and rotator cuff zzso positive provocation test responses, the existence of active zzso and the results obtained with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Imaging zzso A zzso double blinded clinical trial will be carried out in experimental conditions: A zzso treatment based on active and passive joint zzso stabilization exercises, stretching of the zzso shoulder muscles and zzso zzso zzso The previously described zzso treatment, with the addition of dry needling applied to active zzso with the purpose of zzso the efficacy of dry needling in zzso 

This study aims to provide a new vision of shoulder pain, from the perspective of zzso This syndrome can, by itself, account for shoulder pain and dysfunction, although it can coexist with real conditions involving the zzso
