This study attempted to validate MR zzso zzso of the zzso joint zzso in detecting the position, integrity and relations of the zzso disc and zzso zzso 

A total of 20 zzso from 10 patients with severe zzso dysfunction underwent zzso and zzso A zzso contrast medium was injected into the upper joint compartment to observe possible zzso and/or leakage into the lower zzso 15 zzso were surgically or zzso explored and zzso 

zzso was approximately in the same diagnostic value as zzso when locating position, but superior in detecting disc zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso appearing together in four zzso Surgery confirmed zzso findings in all but one case, where zzso and surgery failed to confirm a disc zzso indicated by zzso 

zzso zzso may simultaneously reveal zzso and zzso zzso and the probability of zzso results require further zzso
