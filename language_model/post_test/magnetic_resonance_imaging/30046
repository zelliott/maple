Stress reactions and stress fractures in the lower zzso occur frequently in military and athletic zzso As the clinical symptoms of stress fracture may mimic other less severe musculoskeletal injuries, the diagnosis of stress fracture can often be zzso The following article reviews the zzso advantages and disadvantages of the various imaging tools available to detect stress fracture of the lower limbs in order to clarify their utility when diagnosing this zzso Plain zzso the primary imaging tool for diagnosing suspected stress injuries, may not detect stress fracture injury until fracture healing is well zzso In some cases of suspected stress zzso this delay in diagnosis can lead to catastrophic fracture and surgical zzso Bone zzso has long been recommended for the diagnosis of stress zzso claiming that skeletal zzso is zzso sensitive for the detection of stress zzso However, there is a potential for a false negative examination and findings might be zzso as zzso or infections may mimic stress zzso In addition, bone zzso involves zzso radiation and it should not be used whenever there is an zzso zzso zzso zzso provides exquisitely fine zzso detail, but should be reserved only for specific indications because it also involves zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging, which is zzso has no zzso radiation, is more rapidly performed than bone zzso and should be the method of choice for stress fracture diagnosis whenever it is zzso However, using MR imaging demands an experienced zzso in order to decrease reported zzso zzso The zzso technique, which is being used increasingly in the evaluation of the musculoskeletal system has recently been shown to have some potential in the diagnosis of stress zzso however, currently the imaging zzso are zzso The peripheral quantitative CT zzso device, which has been developed to specifically assess skeletal status of the zzso provides data on bone zzso strength and zzso However, the zzso needs further evaluation prior to being considered for use in diagnosis stress changes in zzso This article reviews the utility of each of the imaging zzso currently available to detect stress fracture injuries of the lower zzso as well as other zzso factors, which include exposure to zzso radiation, the ability to detect zzso and late-stage reactions in the bone and surrounding soft zzso and the ability to differentiate between different types of bone zzso
