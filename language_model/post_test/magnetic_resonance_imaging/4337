We are usually unaware of the motion of an image across our zzso that results from our own zzso For instance, during zzso eye movements we do not mistake the shift of the image projected onto the zzso for motion of the world around us, but instead perceive a stable zzso Following early suggestions by von zzso it is commonly believed that this spatial stability is achieved by zzso the retinal motion signal from an internal reference zzso such as a copy of the movement command zzso zzso Object motion is perceived only if the two zzso Although this concept is widely accepted, its anatomical underpinning remains zzso Here we describe the case of a patient with bilateral zzso zzso zzso suffering from false perception of motion due to an inability to take eye movements into account when faced with zzso retinal image zzso This is indicated by the fact that during zzso eye movements, he perceives motion of the stationary world at a zzso that zzso to the zzso of his eye zzso that is, he perceives the raw retinal image slip zzso for his own eye zzso We suspect that this zzso reflects damage of a distinct zzso region that zzso zzso and zzso induced visual motion by comparing retinal signals with a reference signal zzso eye movements and possibly zzso in zzso
