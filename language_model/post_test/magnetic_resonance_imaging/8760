In this study, we evaluated patients with pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso and impaired right zzso zzso We used cardiac zzso for the detection of zzso delayed enhancement zzso and its possible association with other clinical zzso 20 patients (6 males and 14 zzso aged zzso years; 15 New York Heart Association class III, 5 class zzso with known zzso (13 zzso 7 resulting from chronic pulmonary zzso were evaluated for the detection of zzso zzso zzso images of the heart were made for zzso function assessment using a zzso free zzso zzso For zzso zzso a zzso zzso inversion recovery sequence was performed 10 zzso after intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso Right zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, RV enlargement and RV zzso were present in 20 patients zzso ejection zzso zzso RV zzso diameter, zzso zzso RV wall zzso zzso zzso 13 of the 20 patients zzso were positive for zzso (10 zzso 12 zzso All 13 positive patients with zzso demonstrated small zzso areas at the zzso points of the RV free wall in the zzso zzso We found no significant correlation between zzso and ejection fraction or other zzso zzso In this study, zzso correlated positively only with the duration of zzso We found that zzso zzso can be present in patients with zzso and impaired zzso zzso However, further studies are necessary to investigate this possible association and its zzso zzso
