To investigate the correlation between zzso and zzso findings in children with the childhood cerebral zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso and to identify early cognitive markers that may predict disease progression in zzso children with zzso 

The few published zzso studies on zzso suggest a correlation between the pattern of cognitive deficit and zzso zzso however, zzso performance in zzso children with zzso has not been zzso 

The authors assessed cognitive function and cerebral zzso findings in seven zzso and eight zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso children's cognitive skills were severely compromised, especially zzso and executive zzso Visual perception, short-term memory, and language were generally zzso except that naming was severely zzso All had extensive zzso white matter zzso The zzso children had relatively intact zzso performance, but their verbal zzso was compromised and naming severely zzso All except one had mild white matter zzso For all the children, the majority of zzso test performance correlated significantly with extent of white matter zzso 

The pattern of cognitive deterioration in children with zzso and the significant correlation of zzso test performance with extent of white matter zzso indicate a white matter zzso similar to that observed in adults with zzso zzso The deficits found in zzso children, despite their normal intelligence, suggest that careful zzso investigation can identify early signs of zzso These may be markers of disease progression useful for selecting children for bone zzso zzso although this will require confirmation by prospective zzso zzso
