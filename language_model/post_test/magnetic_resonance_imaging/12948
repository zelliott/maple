To evaluate the effect that variations in the enhancement threshold have on the diagnostic accuracy of two zzso detection zzso systems for magnetic resonance based breast cancer zzso 

zzso consent was obtained from all patients participating in cancer screening and this study was approved by the participating institution's review zzso This retrospective study was zzso in a zzso zzso zzso breast screening study involving dynamic zzso magnetic resonance zzso Only those screening examinations zzso zzso zzso for which a zzso diagnosis was available were zzso Two zzso methods were zzso the signal enhancement ratio zzso and support zzso machines zzso zzso analysis was performed by tracking changes in each zzso zzso diagnostic accuracy zzso zzso characteristic zzso curve area, maximum possible zzso with changes in the enhancement zzso 

The enhancement threshold plays a significant role in affecting a zzso zzso potential sensitivity, zzso curve area, and number of assumed true and zzso predictions per zzso zzso A high threshold can also limit the zzso detection of the full size of a zzso 

Enhancement thresholds can limit a zzso zzso ability to diagnose a zzso full size and as such should not be raised above zzso The clinically used zzso method exhibits a high rate of false zzso at low enhancement thresholds and as such the threshold should not be set lower than zzso The zzso method yielded better results in our study than the zzso method at clinically realistic enhancement zzso
