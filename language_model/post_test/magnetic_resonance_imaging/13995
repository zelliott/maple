To evaluate the effects of a zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso on tumor zzso zzso a proposed indicator of zzso and tumor growth in a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique, permitting zzso in zzso and in zzso assessment of potential therapeutic effects, was used to measure tumor zzso characteristics and zzso zzso a cell line derived from a human zzso zzso was implanted zzso into brains of zzso zzso nude zzso 

Treatment with the zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso significantly inhibited tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the control, zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly suppressed tumor growth zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrate that tumor vascular zzso and tumor growth can be inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso and suggest that zzso with the maintenance of zzso zzso requires the presence of zzso within the tissue zzso Changes in tumor vessel zzso and tumor volumes as measured by zzso zzso provide an zzso that could prove useful for clinical monitoring of zzso therapies in brain zzso
