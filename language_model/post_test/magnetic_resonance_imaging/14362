A brief overview of the history of the application of phase shifts in zzso and in particular zzso imaging, is zzso The imaging methods include direct phase zzso zzso flow imaging (where the flow data are zzso transformed into one dimension of an zzso and alternative methods, where zzso phase shifts are zzso for flow measurement from the magnitude of the zzso A discussion then follows of the principal errors that can affect the accuracy of the various flow imaging techniques, with particular reference to the phase mapping methods that have been used extensively in our zzso The results from a number of experiments are included to illustrate the extent of the errors and methods of removing or minimizing these effects are zzso
