zzso in the interactions between functionally linked brain regions have been suggested to be associated with the clinical zzso observed in zzso spectrum disorders zzso We investigated functional connectivity within the zzso system during face zzso a primary component of social zzso in 19 zzso adults with zzso and 21 zzso zzso control zzso zzso during identification of previously viewed faces and houses using a zzso paradigm was zzso The zzso face area zzso was individually localized in each participant and used as the seed point for functional connectivity zzso The degree of correlation between zzso and the extended neural zzso involved in face identification was zzso A whole brain analysis was also conducted in order to determine whether connectivity from the zzso to zzso brain locations was present in the zzso zzso zzso of clinical severity zzso social score and zzso social zzso were included as independent variables into the functional connectivity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity was found in both the zzso and control zzso However, the control group had significantly increased connectivity to the left zzso and the zzso zzso compared to zzso Post hoc analyses additionally found increased connectivity to the zzso in the zzso A significant relationship between abnormal functional connectivity and clinical severity in the zzso group was zzso Specifically, greater social impairment was associated with reduced zzso connectivity and increased zzso inferior frontal zzso These results suggest that abnormal neural connections within the zzso system may contribute to the social zzso observed in zzso
