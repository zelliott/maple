In the present study, brain zzso were measured using zzso zzso zzso zzso over the course of zzso Fourteen right-handed participants were scanned during six zzso periods of practice tracing a zzso maze design with their eyes zzso zzso decreases were found in the right zzso and zzso zzso zzso and left zzso increases in the supplementary motor area zzso and primary motor zzso The decrease in right zzso activity and the increase in zzso was significantly correlated with a decrease in the number of stops, zzso involvement in learning and storing the movement zzso The significant correlation between decreases in errors and left zzso and right zzso zzso activity suggests a role in zzso zzso of the primary motor zzso in motor execution is suggested by the correlation of increased zzso and movement zzso These results suggest that different neural structures zzso a zzso zzso play a role in a sequential maze learning zzso
