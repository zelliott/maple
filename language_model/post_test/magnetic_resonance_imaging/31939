zzso resonance imaging zzso of a target in zzso depends on the surface, size, and particle zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso Here a new method for decorating very small iron oxide particles zzso with zzso zzso is zzso The method is based on the zzso attraction of the strongly positively charged zzso zzso to the zzso zzso shell of the zzso stabilized zzso The zzso coat allows linkage chemistry and zzso technology to zzso zzso or other negative charged surfaces with zzso zzso A5 zzso utilizing zzso chemistry was generated to couple biologically active zzso to zzso for in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso comprises five zzso molecules per iron oxide zzso with a high zzso particle zzso of 180 zzso zzso zzso yet small zzso diameter of only zzso zzso beneficial for in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
