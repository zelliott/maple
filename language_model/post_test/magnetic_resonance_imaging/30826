zzso brain tumors present a major therapeutic challenge because no selective or efficient treatment is zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso administration of human zzso made lethal to tumor cells zzso zzso survival in a human zzso zzso zzso model, by selective induction of tumor cell zzso zzso is a zzso complex that is formed from zzso when the protein changes its zzso zzso and binds zzso acid as a zzso zzso zzso zzso in a wide range of tumor cells in zzso but the therapeutic effect in zzso has not been zzso In this study, zzso growing human zzso tumors were established in nude rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by transplantation of human zzso biopsy zzso After 7 days, zzso was administered by zzso zzso delivery for 24 h into the tumor area; and zzso the native, folded zzso of the same zzso was used as a zzso zzso reduced the zzso tumor volume and delayed the onset of pressure symptoms in the zzso zzso After 8 weeks, all zzso rats had developed pressure symptoms, but the zzso rats remained zzso zzso resonance imaging scans revealed large differences in tumor volume zzso versus 63 zzso zzso caused zzso in zzso in the tumor but not in adjacent intact brain tissue or in zzso human zzso and no toxic side effects were zzso The results identify zzso as a new candidate in cancer therapy and suggest that zzso should be additionally explored as a novel approach to controlling zzso zzso
