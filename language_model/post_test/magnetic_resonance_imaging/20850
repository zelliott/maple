To critically review data on the use of zzso tools in the clinical diagnostic investigation of zzso 

For many years, the use of zzso tools in the evaluation of zzso has been restricted to excluding zzso zzso that may account for the cognitive zzso However, modern zzso extends beyond this traditional role of excluding other conditions and has a key role in the clinical investigation of Alzheimer's disease and of other degenerative cortical zzso zzso PET with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso markers of neural damage and enable the identification of specific zzso patterns that characterize Alzheimer's disease and other cortical zzso More recently, PET zzso markers have enabled the zzso assessment of zzso load, a key feature in the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso 

The combined use of zzso examinations with clinical, zzso and zzso fluid markers can improve the specificity of the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, even at early stages of the zzso In the following years, progress in research will provide standardized and validated imaging markers of Alzheimer's disease and other zzso which may increase their application in clinical zzso
