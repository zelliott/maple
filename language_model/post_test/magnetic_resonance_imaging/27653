To define the zzso zzso network of zzso zzso 

We analyzed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data in a unique patient with reading zzso zzso affected by frequent zzso zzso zzso triggered by reading zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and revealed activity extending zzso into zzso area zzso zzso zzso blood oxygen zzso zzso signal changes in the left deep zzso zzso zzso and left zzso preceded zzso and occurred before zzso changes were observed in zzso and right inferior frontal zzso zzso Dynamic zzso modeling provided evidence of a zzso link between zzso changes in the left zzso and zzso zzso 

Our findings support the important role of deep cortical and zzso structures, in particular the frontal zzso as key regions in initiating and modulating seizure zzso In our patient with zzso zzso appeared to be the area linking cognitive zzso and seizure zzso
