To determine the recurrence and zzso free survival time and associated factors with recurrence and zzso transformation of patients with zzso zzso after primary surgical zzso 

The present study was zzso Patients who underwent surgery and were diagnosed with zzso zzso between January 2000 and October 2009 were zzso Time to recurrence and zzso transformation were analyzed using zzso method and zzso Cox zzso hazard zzso zzso 

zzso patients underwent surgery for zzso zzso The pathological reports were diffuse zzso in 55 patients zzso zzso in 19 patients zzso and zzso in three patients zzso The types of tumor zzso were biopsy in 39 patients zzso zzso zzso 34 patients zzso and total zzso in four patients zzso The overall mean time to follow-up was 40 months, the median recurrence and zzso transformation times were 14 and 24 zzso The zzso recurrence-free and zzso survival rate was 50% and zzso zzso associated with tumor recurrence were age, sex, presenting symptoms, zzso zzso performance status zzso score, tumor volume, and contrast zzso None of these factors showed statistically significant association with zzso zzso 

One fourth of the patients had tumor recurrence and zzso transformation in a short period of zzso Delayed recurrence and zzso transformation after primary zzso are associated with several zzso The type of surgery especially zzso zzso might favor zzso
