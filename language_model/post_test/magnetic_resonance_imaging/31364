For patients with zzso disease zzso of the zzso zzso imaging to detect and evaluate the extent of an underlying zzso can facilitate appropriate treatment zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of breast zzso in this zzso 

Using zzso codes for zzso zzso we identified zzso patients without a current cancer diagnosis seen at our institution zzso to zzso zzso patients zzso had zzso changes suspicious for zzso as the only physical zzso zzso biopsy confirmed zzso in 39 of 69 zzso zzso Thirty-four patients were eligible for zzso 

zzso pathology identified cancer in 32 of 34 zzso patients (7 invasive zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were confined to the central zzso of the breast zzso zzso imaging zzso 34 of 34, zzso 13 of 34) detected 15 of 32 zzso zzso zzso detected 11 zzso accurately demonstrating extent of disease in 9 of 11 zzso zzso detected seven zzso accurately demonstrating extent of disease in six of seven zzso After positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) did not change zzso After negative zzso zzso zzso 23), zzso zzso zzso 8) detected otherwise zzso disease in 4 of 8 patients, accurately demonstrating extent of disease in 4 of 4 patients and ruling out an underlying cancer in 1 of 1 zzso 

zzso percent of patients with zzso zzso as the only physical finding had an underlying cancer and 59% had zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging did not reliably exclude an underlying cancer, but the increased sensitivity of zzso detected otherwise zzso zzso In the setting of negative zzso zzso can facilitate treatment planning for patients with zzso
