To answer the following questions: whether reliable detection of zzso is possible in zzso zzso Open zzso zzso equipped with currently available zzso and software components in comparison to high field system zzso Impact zzso zzso Furthermore, whether zzso of zzso suspect in zzso can be realized in MR system of low field zzso Open zzso zzso 

In 11 patients, suspect zzso were diagnosed in diagnostic zzso acquired with high field system zzso Impact zzso zzso and were compared to low field zzso of zzso T zzso Open zzso zzso In six of the 11 patients a suspect zzso was localized using wire zzso 

All zzso considered suspect in diagnostic zzso zzso Impact zzso zzso were also clearly identified in the zzso T system zzso zzso In six cases wire marking was performed without any complications and with an accuracy of zzso or zzso zzso zzso distance to the zzso 

Although studies in the zzso T system clearly showed inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to studies with the high field system, all zzso considered suspect in diagnostic zzso were reliably identified also in zzso T zzso Due to its open construction permitting permanent access to the breast and due to sufficient image quality, the zzso Open is suitable for interventions on the zzso
