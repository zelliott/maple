Recent advances in magnetic resonance zzso technology have allowed for high-resolution ex zzso zzso on small, intact tissue zzso We examined the capability of zzso magnetic resonance magic angle spinning zzso to correctly characterize zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from human samples, compared with standard zzso and zzso zzso 

A minimum of two, zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained from ten zzso zzso tumors at a mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients were considered free of disease by zzso zzso zzso A portion of each sample was immediately frozen at zzso degrees C for zzso and the remainder used for pathological zzso zzso zzso was performed blinded with a zzso field zzso Prior zzso zzso from zzso tissue were used as positive controls for the spectral zzso zzso between, zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso All zzso was processed with zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of all ten zzso zzso demonstrated no cancer or viable zzso All zzso spectral zzso for each biopsy were consistent with necrosis and, more importantly, indicated an absence of small zzso zzso characteristic of both normal and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso confirmed, in each case, the conventional zzso zzso determination of complete zzso 

MR zzso can correctly diagnose the molecular absence of disease in zzso tissue zzso This proof of principle study warrants in zzso evaluation to confirm the clinical zzso of this zzso
