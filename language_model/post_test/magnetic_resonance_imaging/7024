We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to zzso the brain areas involved in the imagery analogue of the verbal transformation effect, that is, the zzso changes that occur when a speech form is zzso in rapid and continuous mental zzso Two conditions were zzso a baseline condition involving the simple mental repetition of speech zzso and a verbal transformation condition involving the mental repetition of the same items with an active search for verbal zzso Our results reveal a predominantly zzso network of cerebral regions activated by the verbal transformation task, similar to the neural network involved in verbal working memory: the left inferior frontal zzso the left zzso zzso the left superior zzso zzso the anterior part of the right zzso cortex, and the zzso cortex, zzso Our results strongly suggest that the imagery analogue of the verbal transformation effect, which requires zzso analysis, form zzso and zzso maintenance of verbal material, relies on a working memory module sharing common components of speech perception and speech production zzso
