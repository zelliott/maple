To zzso investigate whether combined interpretation of dynamic and zzso phase magnetic resonance zzso images can improve the accuracy of zzso zzso MR imaging in the detection of zzso zzso zzso compared with either dynamic MR or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were zzso zzso patients zzso men, 13 zzso mean age, 68 years; range, zzso zzso suspected of having zzso underwent zzso zzso MR imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso Images were zzso analyzed independently by three observers in three separate reading zzso The alternating zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso method was used to analyze the zzso zzso in sensitivity and positive zzso values were calculated at a statistical significance of P zzso zzso 

A total of 67 zzso were detected in 36 zzso The mean area under the zzso curve zzso was significantly higher for either the combined interpretation of dynamic and zzso phase MR images zzso zzso zzso or dynamic MR images alone zzso than for CT images zzso zzso zzso zzso for both zzso The mean sensitivity of combined interpretation of MR images zzso was significantly higher than those of dynamic MR images alone zzso and zzso CT images zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mean positive zzso value was not significantly different among the three imaging zzso 

The combined interpretation of dynamic and zzso phase MR images improves diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso MR imaging for the detection of zzso compared with either dynamic MR or zzso zzso CT images zzso
