zzso arthritis zzso is associated with premature zzso and increased prevalence of cardiovascular zzso The objective of this review is to zzso current and emerging imaging zzso for the evaluation of zzso zzso in zzso with an emphasis on potential application of novel zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso as screening tools for early cardiovascular disease risk zzso 

A zzso literature search was undertaken using the search terms zzso zzso AND zzso zzso OR zzso OR zzso and including all relevant terms for imaging zzso 

Two zzso imaging zzso have been widely adopted for direct zzso of zzso zzso carotid zzso and cardiac zzso zzso Published studies in the zzso population using these 2 zzso are zzso Novel cardiovascular imaging zzso are zzso with an emphasis on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso Emerging research tools in vascular imaging, including dynamic and cardiac stress zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, are zzso The incremental imaging capabilities to characterize plaque composition and vessel wall inflammation as well zzso abnormalities and published studies are systematically zzso 

An increasing number of cardiovascular imaging zzso with improved characterization of features associated with plaque vulnerability have been zzso Given the heightened cardiovascular risk profile of the zzso population, these novel imaging zzso offer promise for risk zzso and drug safety zzso
