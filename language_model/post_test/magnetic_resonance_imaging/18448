The purpose of our study was to assess the utility of CT and zzso in the staging of zzso zzso The overall accuracy of MR is in the range of 66 to zzso zzso weighted and zzso zzso weighted images allow one to differentiate zzso from zzso type of zzso zzso fat invasion is well shown with zzso images while pelvic wall invasion is better seen on zzso The overall accuracy of CT ranges from 64 to zzso CT cannot distinguish stage zzso from stage zzso tumors CT is accurate for demonstrating zzso fat zzso In the assessment of zzso zzso zzso CT and zzso have low sensitivity but high zzso zzso zzso is more accurate than CT and zzso in the staging of zzso invasion and it permits the differentiation between zzso zzso and zzso stages even though the distinction between zzso and zzso type of tumors is not always zzso zzso zzso is not useful in assessing zzso extension and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is the method of choice for evaluating zzso zzso CT and MR are very accurate for evaluating zzso fat invasion and are also quite accurate for evaluating zzso zzso zzso is superior to CT in distinguishing tumors limited to superficial muscle from those that invade deep zzso zzso can also be helpful in distinguishing the tumor from zzso and zzso
