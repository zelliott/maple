zzso zzso zzso have been traditionally considered as zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast zzso However, it has been suggested in some recent articles that zzso may have a zzso potential, but most of these reports are zzso However, the evaluated contrast agents, their doses, and the tests used to determine the kidney function were not consistent across zzso We aimed to investigate the effect of magnetic field and an zzso contrast agent, zzso zzso zzso on zzso functions in patients at high risk for acute kidney injury zzso 

We designed a prospective zzso study with 2 zzso and zzso groups of patients at high-risk for zzso zzso for each zzso Patients in Group 1 received a fixed dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients in Group 2 received zzso without zzso Before the zzso and at 6, 24, 72, and zzso hours after the zzso zzso tests, estimated zzso zzso rate zzso zzso ratio in spot zzso and early zzso zzso zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso ratio, and zzso were not different between Group 1 and 2 zzso There were no significant changes in zzso function tests and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso C, zzso and zzso for either groups 6, 24, 72, and zzso hours after the procedures zzso 

zzso without contrast agent and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are not zzso procedures for patients at high risk for zzso
