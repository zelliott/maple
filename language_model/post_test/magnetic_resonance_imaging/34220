The zzso characteristics of the zzso response in zzso and auditory zzso were measured in subjects performing finger tapping while listening to metronome pacing zzso A repeated trial paradigm was used with stimulus zzso of 167 zzso to 16 s and zzso times of 30 zzso Both cortical systems were found to be zzso in that the response to a long stimulus could not be predicted by zzso the zzso response with a zzso zzso In the zzso regime, the zzso of the response varied only slowly with stimulus zzso It was found that this character was predicted with a modification to zzso balloon zzso Wiener zzso was used to zzso the response to zzso short episodes of finger tapping at different zzso zzso and at rates from 1 to 4 zzso While the measured response zzso were distorted by overlap between the individual episodes, the zzso response at each rate was found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual zzso Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the response to fully overlapping zzso linear zzso is effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 zzso The zzso filter must be measured for each subject using a zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso may be effective in diminishing the zzso imposed zzso blurring and may have potential applications in zzso responses in zzso zzso
