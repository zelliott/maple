PET and zzso studies have revealed that zzso of the zzso system by caloric or zzso stimulation not only activates the zzso zzso zzso but also zzso zzso the zzso visual zzso Likewise, visual motion stimulation not only activates the visual zzso but also zzso the zzso zzso zzso These findings are functionally consistent with the hypothesis of an zzso zzso zzso interaction for spatial orientation and motion zzso zzso zzso interaction between the two zzso was found by using zzso visual motion zzso zzso of zzso areas zzso and zzso of the primary visual zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The functional significance of these zzso and zzso interactions could be that they zzso allow a shift of the zzso weight between two zzso sensory zzso and zzso ensure a correspondence of the two zzso during evaluation of contradictory motion stimulation of the right and left zzso In terms of mathematical zzso these findings may reflect the concepts of a sensory conflict mechanism or a mismatch between expected and actual sensory zzso
