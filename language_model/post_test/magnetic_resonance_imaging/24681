To investigate the association between zzso zzso in blood pressure and cognitive function in old age zzso zzso 

Prospective cohort zzso 

zzso zzso Study of zzso in the zzso at zzso study, a collaboration between zzso in Ireland, Scotland, and the zzso 

zzso participants, mean age zzso years, who were at risk of cardiovascular zzso Blood pressure was measured every three months during an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso in blood pressure was defined as the standard zzso of blood pressure zzso between zzso 

Four zzso of cognitive function, testing selective attention, processing speed, and immediate and delayed zzso In a magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso participants, structural brain volumes, cerebral zzso zzso and white matter zzso were zzso 

Participants with higher zzso zzso in zzso blood pressure had worse performance on all cognitive zzso attention zzso difference high versus low zzso zzso seconds zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso processing speed zzso digits coded zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso immediate memory zzso pictures remembered zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and delayed memory zzso pictures remembered zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso Furthermore, higher zzso in both zzso and zzso blood pressure was associated with lower zzso volume and cortical zzso and higher zzso in zzso blood pressure was associated with cerebral zzso (all zzso All associations were adjusted for average blood pressure and cardiovascular risk zzso 

Higher zzso zzso in blood pressure independent of average blood pressure was associated with impaired cognitive function in old zzso
