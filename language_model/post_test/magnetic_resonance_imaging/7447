Voluntary action control requires selection of appropriate responses and stopping of inappropriate zzso zzso and stopping are often investigated zzso but they appear to recruit similar brain regions, including the zzso motor area zzso and inferior frontal zzso We therefore examined the evidence for overlap of selection and stopping using two zzso a zzso of existing studies of selection and zzso and a novel zzso zzso study in which action selection and a stop signal task were combined zzso The novel zzso study also permitted us to investigate hypotheses regarding a common mechanism for selection and zzso The zzso was identified by both methods as common to selection and zzso However, stopping a selected action did not recruit zzso more than stopping a specified action, nor did stop signal reaction times differ significantly across the two zzso These findings suggest that the zzso supports both action selection and zzso but the two processes may not require access to a common zzso zzso Instead, the zzso might represent information about potential actions that is used in both action selection and stopping in order to resolve conflict between competing available zzso
