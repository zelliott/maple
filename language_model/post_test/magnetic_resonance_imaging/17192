Conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has routinely been used to improve the accuracy of multiple sclerosis zzso diagnosis and monitoring, detect the effects of zzso therapy, and refine the utility of clinical zzso However, conventional zzso measures, such as the use of zzso volume and count of zzso and zzso zzso have insufficient sensitivity and specificity to reveal the true degree of pathological changes occurring in zzso Newer metrics of zzso analysis, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and central nervous system zzso zzso measures, are able to capture a more global picture of the range of tissue zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso loss, and zzso There is mounting evidence that these zzso measures correlate well with existing and developing neurological impairment and zzso In so doing, these zzso techniques can help zzso the mechanisms underlying the zzso and natural history of zzso The current understanding is that zzso black holes and zzso zzso more accurately reflect the neurodegenerative and destructive components of the zzso disease zzso zzso the short and long-term studies that aim to measure the degree and severity of the neurodegenerative zzso disease process should incorporate these zzso metrics as part of their standard routine zzso zzso
