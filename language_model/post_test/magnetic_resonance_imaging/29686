zzso inversion recovery zzso has shown promise in the detection of zzso space zzso The exact role of zzso in the diagnosis of meningitis has not been zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso in the detection of meningitis in comparison with zzso zzso images zzso in a zzso zzso We describe zzso zzso zzso on zzso sequence in meningitis in relation to zzso fluid zzso protein and effective echo time zzso 

Two observers blinded to clinical information reviewed magnetic resonance zzso images of patients with the diagnosis of meningitis and those of zzso zzso The diagnosis was confirmed from chart review and zzso zzso zzso images were obtained with 2 different TE values of 120 milliseconds and 150 zzso zzso changes were correlated with zzso protein concentration and zzso zzso 

zzso MR images of meningitis patients were zzso There were 23 abnormal MR images including 16 abnormal zzso scans with zzso zzso and 23 with zzso enhancement on zzso zzso HS on zzso correlated with zzso enhancement on zzso zzso Four viral and 1 bacterial meningitis had normal MR images zzso and zzso zzso Two different TE values were zzso 120 milliseconds zzso zzso zzso and 150 milliseconds zzso zzso zzso All patients with effective TE of 150 zzso and zzso protein of more than 132 zzso had zzso zzso whereas patients with effective TE of 120 milliseconds and zzso protein of zzso zzso or more had zzso 

The sensitivity of zzso zzso was higher than zzso HS on zzso correlated with contrast enhancement on zzso However, the sensitivity of zzso depends on zzso protein concentration threshold for zzso zzso for a given effective zzso zzso cannot replace zzso zzso in diagnosing zzso
