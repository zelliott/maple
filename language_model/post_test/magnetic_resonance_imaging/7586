The key to successful management of patients with zzso zzso zzso is to diagnose adverse local tissue reactions zzso zzso zzso have been described in zzso patients with resurfacing zzso Whether this concerning finding applies to modular zzso zzso is zzso 

We zzso determined the prevalence of zzso in zzso patients with modular zzso zzso zzso described any differences in the appearance of these zzso between symptomatic and zzso patients, and zzso analyzed potential zzso factors for any associations with zzso zzso 

We evaluated 114 patients with modular zzso zzso who had zzso with metal artifact reduction sequence software and metal zzso laboratory results at a mean of 57 months zzso There were 83 zzso and 31 symptomatic zzso We defined zzso as abnormal fluid collections, solid or zzso zzso or muscle or bone zzso Ion levels, zzso size, and cup abduction angles were zzso 

Twenty-six zzso zzso patients had zzso zzso all of which were in the greater zzso zzso Most zzso in symptomatic patients also were in that location, but there was more diversity of location in this zzso The cup position among patients with zzso was generally good; the average abduction angle for the zzso patients with zzso was zzso In 24 zzso and 22 zzso of 26 zzso patients with zzso respectively, zzso and zzso levels were below the zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso of zzso fluid collections in zzso patients with modular zzso zzso is alarming and calls into question any zzso approach dependent on zzso The presence of pain was insufficient to identify patients at risk for zzso To determine whether routine zzso imaging of all zzso patients with zzso implants is necessary will require a larger study zzso longer zzso and clearer understanding of the natural history of zzso zzso in these zzso
