zzso imaging has proven successful in the evaluation of zzso heart zzso primarily with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and color zzso ultrasound zzso However, the relationship between the zzso of zzso flow in zzso and zzso as a function of zzso parameters zzso pressure difference, zzso size, compliance, zzso is not zzso The goals for this work were: 1) to develop a computer-controlled zzso cardiac valve zzso compatible with zzso zzso and MR imaging, 2) to create zzso zzso in the phantom which appear similar to those detected zzso 3) to produce and measure zzso pressure differences between chambers, zzso and zzso zzso as seen in mild, moderate, and severe zzso Mean chamber pressure differences ranged from zzso zzso over the range of diseases zzso Similarly, zzso flow rates ranged from approximately zzso zzso Compliance values ranged from zzso to zzso zzso No coherent or incoherent artifacts were observed in zzso or zzso zzso Images show a high degree of similarity to zzso zzso detected with each zzso confirming that all design goals were zzso The system should allow extensive comparative analysis of zzso ultrasound and zzso flow jets under a wide range of zzso zzso conditions in future zzso
