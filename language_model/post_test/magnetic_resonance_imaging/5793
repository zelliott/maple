zzso of the jugular bulb in relation to the zzso carotid artery and zzso turn of the zzso was zzso in each zzso 

Three patients with large symptomatic cholesterol zzso were zzso Conventional CT demonstrated extensive bone erosion involving the jugular zzso in each zzso The location of the jugular bulb and its proximity to the zzso carotid artery and zzso turn of the zzso could not be determined with conventional zzso bone CT and magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso provided the exact location of the jugular bulb in all 3 zzso The favorable position of the jugular bulb in all 3 cases permitted drainage of these zzso using an zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso provided invaluable information in 3 patients with large symptomatic cholesterol zzso All 3 patients were previously thought to be zzso candidates for an zzso or zzso approach because of the unknown location of the jugular zzso
