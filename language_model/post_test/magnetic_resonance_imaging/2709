Drug therapy to the central nervous system is complicated by the presence of the zzso zzso The development of new drug delivery techniques to overcome this obstacle will be aided by a clear understanding of the transport processes in the zzso A rigorous theoretical framework of the transport of drugs delivered locally to the zzso has been developed using the finite element zzso zzso resonance imaging has been used to track the transport of zzso contrast markers in the zzso The information obtained by zzso zzso zzso and zzso density images has been used to refine the mathematical model that includes realistic brain geometry and salient zzso features and allows for two-dimensional transport of chemical species, including both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the effects of regional differences in tissue properties, zzso boundary, and zzso on the transport have been zzso The model has been used to predict transport of zzso in the brain and study the major zzso of zzso at both early and late times after drug zzso
