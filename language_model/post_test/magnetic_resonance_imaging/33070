We examined the influence of a single exercise session on quantitative muscle fat fraction zzso zzso Ten healthy volunteers were scanned on a zzso body scanner before and after a session of bilateral zzso until muscular zzso zzso zzso and opposed phase images were acquired at a fixed distance from the knee joint and fat zzso were calculated using a 2-point Dixon technique as well as muscle cross zzso area at the same zzso After the squat session, calculated fat fraction in the zzso zzso appeared to be significantly zzso while all but one zzso muscles showed no zzso In conclusion exercise might modify the measured apparent fat zzso Trials using quantitative zzso should consider the timing of scanning sessions and physical examinations to avoid bias caused by the influence of exercise on zzso
