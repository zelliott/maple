zzso zzso of the spinal tumors is particularly important for differential diagnosis and zzso zzso it was attempted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of zzso in zzso the spinal tumors zzso zzso cases of spinal zzso tumors, being localized in the zzso zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso spaces, were studied with zzso zzso zzso tumors showed small zzso spaces just below and above the tumor which were demonstrated as zzso intensity on zzso and zzso weighted zzso Although zzso tumors did not show zzso spaces, there was zzso sign or zzso density between the tumor and the spinal zzso zzso and zzso tumors were outlined as having both zzso Signal zzso of the spinal tumors were not characteristic for specific zzso zzso was quite useful for accurate zzso of the zzso In comparison with zzso zzso was superior to zzso in zzso tumors and equally useful for zzso and zzso tumors, but it was less diagnostic in zzso zzso zzso In general, zzso was quite useful in zzso the spinal tumors exactly and the accuracy of zzso was quite zzso In the near future this technique will replace zzso and other zzso zzso
