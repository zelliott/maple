The transient phase of zzso zzso free zzso zzso sequences exhibits an often striking complexity and is not only important for zzso applications zzso rapid zzso but can also cause severe artifacts in conventional zzso In both cases, balanced zzso sequences are practically (with regard to preparation zzso and zzso zzso the theoretical understanding of the zzso easier to handle their unbalanced counterparts, for which currently no theory is zzso Based on a decomposition of zzso pathways into zzso zzso an exact mathematical solution to the transient phase of unbalanced zzso sequences is presented in this article, which also includes the known results for balanced zzso and the steady state of arbitrary zzso sequences as special zzso As an application, it is shown that the familiar zzso expression for the accelerated zzso recovery in zzso sequences is only valid for zzso In addition to zzso zzso systematic zzso from the zzso zzso are observed for zzso zzso 0 as a consequence of memory zzso
