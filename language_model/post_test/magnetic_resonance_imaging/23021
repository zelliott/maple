The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso response of zzso brain zzso zzso from zzso lung cancer zzso to zzso systemic zzso 

From 1990 to 2003, 181 consecutive patients with zzso were enrolled onto this zzso Patients were examined by a neurologist on a regular zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso of the brain was performed routinely before (at diagnosis of zzso and after zzso systemic zzso Patients were treated with combination chemotherapy consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso manifest zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso The response rate zzso of zzso was assessed by changes in the size or the number of enhanced zzso on zzso using standard zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were found in 24 zzso patients zzso In six zzso of the 22 zzso patients, the zzso zzso responded to systemic zzso A systemic response was found in 16 patients zzso All patients became symptomatic during zzso The zzso survival did not differ between zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso from zzso to systemic chemotherapy is zzso and evidently lower than the systemic zzso Future studies should focus on the possible beneficial effect of zzso for patients with zzso zzso zzso
