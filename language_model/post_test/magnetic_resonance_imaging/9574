The high zzso of zzso zzso tears after repair of massive cuff zzso is prompting the research of materials aimed at mechanically or biologically reinforcing the zzso Among the materials studied zzso now, the zzso zzso zzso scaffolds of human origin have proved to be the safest and most efficient, but the current laws about zzso and transplants zzso their use in zzso In order to overcome this condition in 2006, we started a project regarding the production of an zzso scaffold of human origin which could be implanted in Europe zzso In 2009, the clinical study began with the zzso of zzso zzso scaffolds in 7 middle-aged patients affected with zzso cuff zzso and zzso zzso Out of 5 cases, followed for at least 1 year in which the scaffold was employed as an zzso device, there were 3 patients with complete healing, 1 partial zzso and 1 total zzso The absence of adverse inflammatory or septic complications allows to continue this line of research with a prospective controlled study in order to define the real advantages and correct indications offered by scaffold zzso
