In a sample of right-handed adults, zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to zzso zzso and zzso differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso exist with a zzso zzso asymmetry consistently reported in zzso zzso These zzso zzso may reflect zzso allocation of adjacent zzso with some investigators zzso a relationship with zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso is more zzso than the anterior zzso zzso differences have also been reported with reduced zzso in women relative to zzso 

Using in zzso zzso surface zzso zzso zzso were studied in a group of consistently right-handed men zzso zzso zzso and women zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lengths were zzso 

Overall, there was a significant zzso asymmetry of the horizontal zzso zzso and zzso in men and zzso Whereas there was a significant zzso asymmetry of the zzso zzso there was no significant asymmetry of the anterior zzso There was an increase in the zzso zzso anterior to the zzso ascending zzso zzso in the left zzso and zzso to the zzso in the right zzso when zzso zzso were zzso with the length of the anterior zzso zzso positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso 

These findings demonstrate that the zzso is zzso but that clear sex-related effects do not exist in consistently right-handed zzso
