A compact mouse zzso has been developed using a zzso zzso permanent magnet and portable zzso zzso The entire system was installed in a space measuring 2 m zzso 1 zzso The imaging region was the zzso volume (35 zzso diameter, 50 zzso zzso at the center of the magnet and was used for zzso or body imaging of zzso zzso imaging took less than 90 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso images with zzso slice thickness and zzso zzso zzso Body imaging took less than 30 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso images with zzso to zzso slice thickness and 250- to zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso of the system, the mouse zzso has several advantages over zzso zzso animal zzso systems in its accessibility to the zzso similarity to clinical zzso in image contrast, capacity for biological isolation, and zzso The results obtained demonstrate the potential of this new system for routine imaging in biomedical zzso
