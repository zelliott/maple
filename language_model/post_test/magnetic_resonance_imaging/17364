To implement and evaluate a zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso paradigm designed to effectively and efficiently activate several zzso regions for use with zzso zzso Both overt and covert response conditions were zzso 

The zzso experiments compared the traditional silent zzso condition versus an overt one as they engage frontal language regions zzso 1) and silent versus overt semantic association conditions as they engage multiple language processing regions zzso zzso 

In zzso 1, the overt condition yielded greater magnitude of zzso but not volume of zzso in the left inferior frontal and insular zzso than did the silent condition for most, but not all, zzso zzso 2 demonstrated that the zzso of multiple established language processing regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be achieved in a significant number of participants, particularly under overt semantic association conditions and that such zzso varies in predictable zzso 

The traditional silent response condition cannot be considered as equivalent to the overt response condition during word generation or semantic zzso The zzso imaging method introduced here was sensitive to processing robust zzso zzso and semantic regions, particularly under the overt response zzso
