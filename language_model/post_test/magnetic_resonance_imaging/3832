zzso of interactions between the zzso electromagnetic field in magnetic resonance scanners and zzso zzso material surrounded by tissue plays an increasing role for magnetic resonance zzso Testing of zzso implants or instruments is usually performed by standardized experimental zzso and temperature zzso at distinct geometrical points, which cannot always reflect worst-case zzso A finite element method based on zzso (The zzso zzso zzso and the finite element method program zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso highly variable mesh size solving Maxwell's zzso equations was applied for a comprehensive simulation of the complete geometrical arrangement of typical zzso zzso coils loaded with small zzso structures in a zzso zzso zzso implants like rods of variable length and closed and open ring structures, partly exhibiting electromagnetic resonance behavior, were modeled and evaluated regarding the distribution of the zzso and zzso induced currents and specific zzso zzso zzso simulations corresponded well with experiments using a zzso sequence for zzso of marked zzso zzso Even resonance effects in zzso rods and open rings with suitable geometry were depicted zzso The proposed method has high potential for zzso or even replacement of common experimental magnetic resonance zzso zzso
