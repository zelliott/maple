Formerly zzso women demonstrate cerebral white matter zzso zzso several years following the index zzso The zzso is unclear and may be related to the predisposition for zzso disease in such women and/or the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso syndrome whilst zzso The aim of this study was to assess the presence and severity of zzso and their relationship with the severity of the neurological symptoms during the index pregnancy and several current cardiovascular risk factors in formerly zzso zzso 

This was a retrospective cohort zzso 

The zzso Centre at the School for zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso 

zzso formerly zzso women were matched for age zzso zzso 6 zzso and elapsed time since index pregnancy zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso control zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed on cases and zzso zzso were rated by a zzso blind to the patient zzso 

The presence and severity of cerebral zzso 

Formerly zzso women had zzso significantly more often zzso and more severely zzso zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso than controls zzso P zzso zzso mean, zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso P zzso zzso Current hypertension and a history of zzso zzso zzso weeks) were independently associated with the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso might be a risk marker for early cerebrovascular zzso The predisposition of formerly zzso women to later cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease may be an important factor for the development of cerebral zzso Whether a history of zzso zzso zzso syndrome may be an additive risk factor for the development of these zzso remains zzso
