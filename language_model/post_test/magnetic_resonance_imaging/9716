To describe clinical features in a large series of zzso syndrome zzso cases, investigating whether specific zzso patterns of disease may provide further insight into zzso zzso 

zzso prospective zzso 

Fifty-five affected zzso 

To make an zzso diagnosis, the criteria recommended in the First Scientific Conference on zzso zzso were zzso Patients who did not meet the minimal criteria were classified as zzso cases and were considered zzso Complete zzso zzso zzso zzso presence of abnormal zzso and zzso zzso also were zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso visual function zzso and zzso and tearing zzso 

zzso sporadic cases of true zzso were identified, with 3 specific patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso A, consisting of zzso in primary position with a complete zzso in both abduction and zzso zzso movements, was found in zzso of zzso zzso B, with zzso zzso crossed zzso and a relative sparing of convergence and zzso was documented in 50% of zzso zzso C, characterized by a zzso zzso in primary position with zzso absence of zzso and vertical eye zzso was present in the minority of the patients zzso zzso complete facial nerve zzso with zzso was present in zzso of zzso zzso showed abnormalities in zzso of zzso Visual acuity was good or impaired only moderately in all tested zzso zzso function was testable in 31 of 46 patients, and all of them showed a complete absence of zzso with zzso zzso 

Based on the observed 3 different zzso zzso zzso patterns, the most compatible site and extension of the zzso damage was zzso Each pattern may reflect a different type of injury likely occurred during zzso The comparison of the characteristics of this series with those reported in different geographic areas supports the evidence that zzso does not differ zzso zzso 

The zzso have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this zzso
