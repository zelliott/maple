To determine the relative accuracy of CT and zzso in characterization of solid pancreatic masses zzso or zzso zzso and useful imaging appearance for zzso small pancreatic duct zzso zzso from other small solid pancreatic zzso 

CT and zzso scans of 46 patients with evidence of small pancreatic solid tumor were zzso zzso who underwent CT zzso zzso zzso or both zzso Two gastrointestinal zzso independently recorded specific zzso features of tumors and the most likely zzso 

With respect to specific zzso zzso CT and zzso were equally zzso The mean number of correct diagnoses made by the two zzso was zzso zzso of 42 cases for CT compared to 12 zzso of 16 cases for zzso zzso zzso in the pancreatic head zzso presence of zzso of zzso zzso presence of zzso of zzso zzso and enhancement pattern zzso were statistically significant for zzso zzso from the other small solid pancreatic tumors, while pancreatic zzso zzso was statistically inadequate for zzso although it gave a zzso specificity for the diagnosis of zzso 

CT and zzso are similarly accurate in the characterization of small solid pancreatic zzso Small zzso has characteristic CT and zzso findings that differentiate it from other small solid zzso
