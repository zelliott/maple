The aim of this study was to evaluate zzso enhancement zzso and zzso ratio zzso properties of zzso a new intermediate zzso high zzso zzso contrast agent at 3 zzso in a rat brain zzso model, and to compare this contrast agent with a high zzso zzso compound zzso and a standard zzso zzso zzso 

Seven rats with experimental induced brain zzso were evaluated using 3 different contrast agents, with each MR examination separated by at least 24 zzso The time between injections assured sufficient clearance of the agent from the zzso before the next zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a new compound from zzso zzso are zzso and high zzso contrast agents with no protein zzso and were compared with the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso echo sequences zzso 200 zzso zzso flip angle zzso 90 degrees , acquisition time: zzso zzso zzso size: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso acquisition zzso 256 zzso zzso were acquired before and at 5 consecutive time points after each intravenous contrast injection in the identical slice orientation, using a dedicated zzso head array animal zzso The order of contrast media injection was randomized, with however zzso used either as the first or second contrast zzso zzso agent dose was adjusted to compensate for the different zzso zzso of the 3 zzso zzso ratio, zzso and zzso were evaluated using zzso zzso A veterinary zzso confirmed the presence of a zzso in each subject, after completion of the imaging zzso 

zzso showed significantly less zzso as compared with zzso within the first 7 minutes after contrast agent injection zzso zzso zzso with, however, reaching comparable zzso values at 9 minutes after injection zzso zzso zzso However, zzso provided significantly less zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso for all examination time zzso zzso provided comparable but persistent zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated significantly greater zzso and zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant differences between zzso values for zzso and zzso were noted for all examination time points zzso zzso zzso with zzso administered at zzso the dose as compared with zzso 

The zzso contrast medium zzso showed significantly less zzso and zzso in comparison to zzso and zzso suggesting that it does not show marked zzso from tumor zzso and does not significantly cross the disrupted blood zzso in this rat zzso zzso In distinction, zzso provides comparable enhancement properties at a field strength of 3 zzso to the zzso contrast agent zzso using the adjusted dose, suggesting that it crosses the disrupted zzso and tumor zzso most likely based on the decreased molecular weight as compared with zzso At the same time, the high zzso of this compound allows for decreasing the injected zzso dose by a factor of 4 whereas providing comparable enhancement properties when compared with a standard zzso zzso zzso at a dose of zzso zzso body zzso
