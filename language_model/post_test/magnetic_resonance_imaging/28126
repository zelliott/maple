We present techniques of automatic zzso transformation of MR images zzso or zzso A neural network automatically finds the corresponding parts between the zzso brain images and the standard zzso By zzso operations, the network generates a set of zzso zzso to realize a plastic zzso For precise matching, a set of markers can be placed manually before starting the transformation on landmarks of the images, zzso on the zzso zzso line and on the central zzso
