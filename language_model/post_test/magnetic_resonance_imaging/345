The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of quantitative imaging of zzso metabolism with zzso zzso zzso zzso using kinetic analysis for zzso between high-grade zzso and central nervous system zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso zzso scans obtained in 20 patients with high-grade zzso (World Health Organization grade III, five zzso grade IV, 15 zzso and in 12 patients with zzso zzso (16 zzso were zzso zzso zzso a zzso model, zzso images of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and cerebral zzso rate of zzso zzso were zzso 

On visual analysis, one grade III zzso zzso showed an increase of zzso zzso and zzso values as observed on their respective zzso Four grade IV zzso zzso showed an increase of zzso and zzso 11 of zzso and six of zzso on their respective zzso Fourteen zzso zzso zzso showed an increase of zzso 16 of zzso two of zzso and 14 of zzso Both zzso and zzso values zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly higher than those of the normal gray matter zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of grade III zzso and grade IV zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of grade III zzso and grade IV zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The value of zzso of zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of grade IV zzso zzso 

The direct measurement of the regional rate zzso by kinetic analysis might be useful for the zzso of zzso zzso and for differential diagnosis of high-grade zzso and zzso zzso
