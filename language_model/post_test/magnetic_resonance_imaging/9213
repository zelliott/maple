The relationship between white matter zzso zzso and the zzso E zzso has been controversial from zzso studies and no zzso finding has been zzso We investigated whether the zzso E zzso influences baseline and evolution over zzso follow-up of zzso volumes in a zzso sample of zzso zzso subjects aged 65 to 80 years old at zzso 

The sample consisted of zzso study participants who had 2 cerebral zzso at entry and at zzso zzso zzso volumes were estimated using a fully automatic zzso We performed analysis of zzso to evaluate the relationship between zzso E zzso and zzso load and zzso 

zzso analyses showed that zzso individuals had both significantly higher zzso volume at baseline and higher zzso increase over zzso follow-up than zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso E zzso 

These findings suggest it might be important to take into account zzso severity when assessing the relationship between zzso E and zzso
