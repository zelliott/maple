Some surfaces present folding patterns formed by zzso of zzso and valleys as, for example, the cortical surface of the human zzso The fundamental problem with zzso is to find a correspondence among and analyze the zzso among zzso Many techniques to achieve these goals exist but use zzso zzso zzso maps are used to efficiently project the geometry of folds into a zzso function in the case where a natural projection plane zzso However, in most cases of curved surfaces, there is no natural projection plane to represent folding zzso This paper studies the problem of shape matching and analysis of folding patterns by extending the notion of depth maps when no natural projection plane zzso The novel depth measure is called a depth potential zzso The depth potential function zzso the information known from the zzso of the surface into a zzso zzso zzso The main advantage of the depth potential function is that it is zzso by solving a time independent zzso zzso The zzso equation zzso our surface representation with a significant zzso advantage that makes it orders of magnitude faster to zzso compared with other available surface zzso The method described in this paper was validated using both synthetic surfaces and cortical surfaces of human brain acquired by magnetic resonance zzso On average, the improvement in shape matching when using the depth potential was of zzso which is zzso
