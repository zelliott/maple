Changes of zzso relaxation times zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied in patients with brain zzso following administration of zzso zzso zzso times of zzso tended to decrease following infusion of zzso zzso In most patients zzso changes of relaxation times tended to achieve their lowest value at zzso minutes after zzso However, the changes of relaxation times were not zzso In some patients, relaxation times continued to decrease for more than 2 hours, while in other patients relaxation times which had earlier decreased subsequently had increased at 2 zzso The peak of water zzso obtained by zzso zzso Imaging by zzso zzso zzso method was observed to change as did relaxation zzso Changes of relaxation times and the peak of water zzso obtained by zzso zzso Imaging by zzso zzso zzso method was observed to change as did relaxation zzso Changes of relaxation times and the peak of water component may vary depending upon factors including the kinds of zzso causing zzso phase of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso relaxation times and the peak of water component obtained by zzso MRS were useful in evaluating the changes of zzso zzso
