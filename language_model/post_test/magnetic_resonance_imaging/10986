A magnetic resonance zzso imaging method with the potential for assessing zzso iron overload from zzso of zzso magnetic zzso in zzso is zzso Using the blood in the portal and zzso veins as an internal reference, this technique uses the orientation dependence of signal phase to measure the zzso of the liver zzso Computer simulations were done to investigate the requirements on spatial resolution and contrast ratio between the vessels and the background liver tissue for data zzso zzso studies were conducted using zzso gel zzso doped with zzso from 0 to 10 zzso zzso to mimic healthy and zzso zzso The phantom zzso were conducted without motion and flow, under zzso zzso motion, and with zzso Studies on six normal human subjects demonstrated excellent zzso and zzso All images were collected at zzso T using a zzso zzso zzso field echo sequence for inflow MR zzso with full flow compensation and capable of cardiac zzso zzso zzso and motion zzso
