Both white matter zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been associated with the development of depression in older subjects, although the relative importance of the two and the influence of zzso location and zzso vascular disease are zzso This study investigates the relationship between location and burden of zzso and zzso on depressive features in older zzso 

In a zzso zzso study of zzso older subjects, the authors examined the relationship between regional magnetic resonance imaging white matter zzso number of zzso zzso depressive symptoms as assessed by the zzso geriatric depression scale zzso cognitive status zzso zzso zzso hypertension, and zzso health quality of life zzso 

The authors found depressive symptoms to be correlated with zzso rating in the frontal zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso p zzso but not zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were only zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in other regions showed no zzso In a zzso zzso zzso model zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso age, and with an interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the absence of hypertension independently predicted zzso whereas neither history of stroke nor number of zzso zzso zzso The authors compared zzso versus zzso zzso and found no effect of zzso on depressive zzso 

The results suggest that in this population of nondisabled older people, zzso have a greater influence on depressive symptoms than zzso
