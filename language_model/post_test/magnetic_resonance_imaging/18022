The presence of zzso forward flow zzso in the pulmonary arteries is commonly regarded as a hallmark of restrictive physiology of the right zzso zzso which, in turn, has been associated with a better long-term prognosis in patients after zzso zzso However, controversy persists over the beneficial clinical consequences of restrictive zzso We aimed at determining the clinical relevance of restrictive physiology late after zzso zzso 

Fifty magnetic resonance examinations of 50 patients (age zzso zzso zzso years, 26 zzso with repaired zzso were zzso The patients were divided zzso zzso with and zzso without zzso zzso with smaller zzso zzso zzso and zzso with larger zzso zzso 170 zzso zzso oxygen consumption as percent of predicted zzso at a recent exercise test was zzso 

zzso and 2 did not differ with regard to their right zzso zzso volume, pulmonary zzso volume, or zzso zzso Patients in zzso had a higher zzso than patients in zzso zzso versus zzso of predicted, zzso In zzso versus 2A zzso zzso with and without zzso this difference persisted, but in Group B there was no difference in zzso between patients with and without zzso The flow volume of zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso forward flow measured by magnetic resonance is present in patients with small and large zzso The presence of zzso is associated with better exercise zzso but only in patients with relatively small zzso
