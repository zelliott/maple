To characterize the zzso profile of vascular cognitive impairment zzso and vascular zzso zzso 

The authors examined 170 patients with stroke or zzso at 3 to 6 months after the vascular event, and 96 zzso healthy controls, with detailed zzso and zzso zzso with a majority zzso undergoing zzso brain zzso The subjects were diagnosed as having zzso VCI, or no cognitive impairment by zzso The zzso tests were classified into cognitive zzso and composite zzso adjusted for age and zzso 

zzso subjects had zzso in all cognitive zzso with verbal memory, especially zzso being less zzso VCI subjects had similar but less severe zzso The zzso that best zzso cognitively impaired from zzso patients were zzso mental flexibility, information processing speed, and working zzso zzso impairment had a significant correlation with deep white matter zzso but not with volume and number of zzso even though the zzso subjects had larger zzso volumes than VCI zzso The zzso variables did not provide additional discrimination between zzso 

The cognitive deficits in zzso and VCI are characterized by zzso of frontal functions, with less verbal memory zzso zzso and VCI differ in severity but not pattern of zzso The brain zzso that best account for these deficits are zzso zzso white matter and gray matter changes due to zzso The picture of zzso presented shows zzso deficits embellished by cognitive deficits from cortical zzso
