To determine whether specialist zzso zzso review of outside zzso imaging affects patient zzso 

Five hundred and zzso patients attending a regional zzso zzso had review of outside zzso imaging over a zzso zzso The number of examinations per patient, time zzso between examination and review request, and examination technical zzso were recorded in each zzso More detailed evaluation of 124 patients included comparison of outside and review reports for major differences in interpretation by a medical zzso who also evaluated the effect of the review on patient zzso zzso resulting in major report discrepancies were subjected to independent zzso zzso 

Eighty-one percent of examinations were reviewed within 3 months of being performed and zzso were considered technically zzso The hard copy images provided were incomplete in zzso of cases and a zzso rule was absent in zzso There was a major difference in interpretation in zzso of zzso the most common cause being differences in interpretation of zzso zzso particularly in the zzso zzso Other problems identified were the failure to record disease dimensions and absence of specific information on key zzso in the outside zzso Specialist zzso review changed zzso staging in zzso of patients, affected management in zzso of patients and resulted in a change in treatment in zzso There was no correlation between management change and any particular zzso zzso In zzso of cases, treatment decisions had been made before the review was zzso 

Specialist zzso zzso review of outside zzso imaging changed zzso staging in zzso of cases but had little impact on patient zzso zzso zzso imaging techniques in the North West of England are of high quality, probably helped by recent zzso zzso
