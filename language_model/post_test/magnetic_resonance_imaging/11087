zzso event complexes zzso are stored representations of sequential event knowledge, and represent sequences of activities that have been described elsewhere as scripts or zzso Previous studies have shown that the prefrontal zzso is involved in zzso zzso The present study investigates the involvement of the prefrontal zzso in zzso order and membership judgments of script and category items by using functional magnetic resonance zzso In this experiment, stimuli were either script events or category zzso In experimental trials, subjects classified stimuli according to zzso order or membership zzso zzso show that the script order task and the zzso order task zzso to their respective memberships zzso were associated with different patterns of zzso zzso Both order tasks activated the middle frontal zzso zzso however, script order tasks showed additional zzso in right inferior frontal zzso and the zzso order tasks in left inferior frontal zzso These results suggest that while the middle frontal zzso are activated zzso in both script and zzso zzso ordering tasks, there are different, though largely zzso neural zzso for script and zzso representations during zzso zzso
