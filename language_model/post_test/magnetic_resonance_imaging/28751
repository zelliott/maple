Three experiments are reported examining zzso of the zzso of a stick in a patient with unilateral neglect after right zzso zzso zzso previous data zzso zzso zzso showed more evidence of neglect when pointing rather than when a grasp response was used zzso 1), particularly when pointing preceded grasp zzso zzso zzso also increased for longer sticks and when sticks fell in the patient's left zzso the effects of stick length and zzso were additive with those of response zzso vs zzso zzso 3 showed that the advantage for grasp over pointing responses occurred only when performance was guided by zzso visual feedback, and it emerged only during the end part of the reach zzso The results are discussed in relation to the role of visual feedback in movement zzso
