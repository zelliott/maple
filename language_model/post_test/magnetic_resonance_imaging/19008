To compare zzso zzso zzso and CT with respect to accuracy of zzso acute cerebral zzso sensitivity, zzso and zzso reliability for identifying more than one-third middle cerebral artery zzso territory zzso and correlation of acute zzso volume with final zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive stroke patients underwent CT and zzso within 7 hours of stroke onset and a follow-up zzso examination 36 hours after symptom zzso which served as the zzso zzso for zzso location and extent of zzso zzso Each scan was evaluated for acute zzso zzso by two experienced zzso After 30 days, zzso zzso was obtained for assessment of the final zzso zzso 

The acute CT and zzso scans were obtained on average zzso and zzso hours after symptom zzso On zzso the acute zzso was identified correctly in all instances and on CT it was identified correctly in 42 to zzso of zzso zzso for detection of more than zzso zzso involvement was better for zzso zzso to zzso than for CT zzso to zzso whereas specificity was excellent for zzso zzso reliability was moderately good for both zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso A positive correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso existed between zzso volume on acute zzso and final zzso volume, whereas no correlation was found between CT volume and final zzso zzso 

When compared with CT, zzso was more accurate for identifying acute zzso and more sensitive for detection of more than zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso volume on acute zzso but not on acute CT, correlated strongly with final zzso zzso Additional studies are required to demonstrate whether these advantages of zzso are clinically relevant in the management of patients with acute zzso
