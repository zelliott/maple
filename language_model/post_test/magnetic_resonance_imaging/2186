A detailed quality assurance zzso program is essential for high precision single dose zzso The accuracy of zzso zzso is limited by the errors of each step in the chain for optimal treatment beginning with the diagnostic imaging and target zzso leading to the dose planning and ending up with the treatment of the zzso Two main goals were followed on the way to finding a concept for a suitable and sufficient quality assurance zzso First, the chain of items in terms of a complete patient simulation should be followed and second, the zzso MR image data should be verified against a reference in our case zzso zzso projection zzso Target point zzso were performed using the zzso unknown target method based on zzso CT, and zzso projection zzso A marked zzso film, embedded between zzso of the phantom is fixed parallel to either the zzso or the zzso plane of the zzso coordinate zzso After imaging and planning, the phantom is adjusted and zzso At the end, the film, dyed by the radiation field around the zzso zzso is zzso The measured distance between the unit center point zzso and the zzso of the marked film leads to the zzso to be zzso This is referred to as the displacement zzso The results, evaluating 170 system tests within 5 zzso show that the mean displacement zzso of the complete system is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso having a significant influence on the overall accuracy are associated with zzso zzso Test results based on zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are significantly superior to zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further on, the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is significantly superior to the zzso weighted zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Given the high mechanical accuracy of the zzso gamma knife, the most sensitive technical factor having an influence on the overall precision of zzso is the zzso zzso However, using the appropriate imaging sequences and parameters the dislocation error zzso by zzso can be kept very low and restricted to the rare patient inherent distortion zzso With these precautions in mind, zzso is recommended as the imaging method of choice in zzso
