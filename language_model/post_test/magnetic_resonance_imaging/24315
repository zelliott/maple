Severe COPD can lead to zzso zzso and zzso and is associated with impaired left zzso zzso zzso We evaluated whether zzso and zzso obstruction would be associated with changes in right zzso zzso structure and function and whether these associations would differ by smoking zzso 

The Multi-Ethnic Study of zzso zzso performed cardiac zzso on zzso participants without clinical cardiovascular disease aged 45 to 84 zzso RV and zzso measures were available for zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as the percentage of zzso below zzso zzso units in the lung windows on cardiac CT zzso zzso additive models were used to control for zzso and adjust for respective zzso zzso 

Participants consisted of zzso current smokers, zzso former smokers, and zzso never zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with RV zzso volume, stroke volume, cardiac zzso and mass prior to adjustment for zzso zzso After adjustment for zzso zzso volume, greater percent zzso was associated with greater RV zzso volume zzso zzso zzso among current smokers, smaller RV zzso volume zzso zzso zzso among former smokers, and similar changes among never zzso 

zzso zzso was associated with smaller RV volumes and lower zzso The relationship of zzso to cardiac function is complex but likely involves increased pulmonary vascular resistance, predominantly with reduced cardiac zzso pulmonary zzso and accelerated zzso zzso
