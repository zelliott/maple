We investigated the neural zzso of motor resonance during the observation of natural zzso actions and determined how the zzso perspective zzso the neural zzso zzso right-handed participants observed right and left hand tool grasping actions from a first-person or zzso perspective while undergoing zzso A zzso analysis of zzso over the zzso region revealed no main effects of hand identity or perspective, but unveiled a hand by perspective interaction zzso The first-person perspective zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to the performing hand as if the zzso action was zzso with the same anatomical zzso In the zzso perspective, zzso zzso zzso to the zzso hand was found, indicating a zzso strategy, rather than an anatomical zzso Motor resonance was zzso in three zzso in the superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso that have been associated with zzso zzso Our results suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed to elicit motor zzso such as motor imagery and zzso zzso can adjust their spatial frame of reference according to the zzso they intend to zzso
