The zzso origin for zzso vowel acoustic differences between male and female subjects remains zzso The purpose of this study is to examine zzso sex differences in vocal tract zzso length and its oral and zzso zzso 

Nine VT variables were measured from zzso imaging studies zzso resonance imaging and zzso zzso of subjects between birth and age 19 zzso Given sex differences in growth rate zzso et zzso zzso assessment of sex differences was done through use of a localized comparison window of 60 zzso Analysis entailed applying this comparison window first to 4 discrete age zzso followed by a progressive assessment in which this comparison window was moved in zzso increments from birth across all zzso 

zzso document significant zzso sex differences in both the oral and zzso portions of the zzso They also document periods of significant zzso sex differences in the oral region first, followed by segments in the zzso zzso 

Assessment of zzso sex differences using localized age ranges is effective in unveiling sex differences that growth rate differences may zzso zzso on the presence of zzso sex differences in the oral region of the VT may zzso in part, the zzso basis of documented zzso acoustic zzso
