zzso of the spatial sensitivity functions of zzso zzso is a crucial element in parallel magnetic resonance imaging zzso The most common approach has been to measure zzso sensitivities directly using one or more zzso images acquired before or after accelerated data zzso However, since it is difficult to ensure that the patient and zzso array will be in exactly the same positions during both zzso scans and accelerated imaging, this approach can introduce sensitivity zzso errors into zzso zzso This work shows that it is possible to extract sensitivity zzso images directly from a fully sampled central region of a zzso zzso zzso These images have all the features of traditional zzso sensitivity zzso and therefore may be used for any zzso reconstruction technique without zzso Because these zzso data are acquired simultaneously with the data to be zzso errors due to sensitivity zzso are zzso In zzso zzso of zzso parallel imaging using a flexible zzso array are demonstrated in abdominal imaging and in real-time cardiac imaging zzso
