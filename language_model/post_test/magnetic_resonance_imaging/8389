Experimental and clinical evidence indicates that pain can affect cognitive zzso but the cortical networks involved in zzso interactions are zzso In this study, we determined the effect of pain on the activity of cortical areas involved in zzso acting as a whole zzso a zzso zzso underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while engaged in an zzso cognitive task zzso interference zzso of varying difficulty and simultaneously receiving painful stimuli at varying zzso The control zzso condition was simple finger tapping that had minimal cognitive demands and without zzso zzso connectivity analysis revealed a cortical network consisting of two zzso zzso a zzso part zzso zzso cortex, zzso frontal and inferior zzso the activity of which correlated zzso with the cognitive task and positively with the control zzso and a zzso part zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso the activity of which correlated positively with the cognitive task and zzso with the zzso Independent components analysis revealed these opposing networks were operating at a low frequency zzso zzso The functional connectivity of the zzso network was increased by cognitive demand and by zzso We suggest this zzso network balances the needs of general self-referential and environmental awareness versus focused attention to salient zzso We zzso that pain affects cognitive ability by its reliance on this common zzso zzso These data provide evidence that pain can zzso a network presumed to be involved in focused attention, suggesting a mechanism for the interference of pain on cognitive ability by the consumption of zzso zzso
