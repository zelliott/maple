In this report, a zzso method using zzso zzso zzso zzso with limited spatial and zzso resolution is zzso The total flow rate in a vessel zzso to the first moment of the zzso zzso of spins in the vessel, whereas the spin density of flowing spins is the zzso zzso Because the measured zzso using zzso is distorted by zzso zzso effects, the zzso zzso effects are first estimated and then accurately compensated by acquiring five zzso zzso The spatial resolution in each image can be relatively low because all stationary spins zzso in the zzso flow zzso In a phantom study, the errors in measured flow rates were within zzso even when the zzso size was greater than the vessel zzso This method was also successfully applied to measure flow in the zzso zzso In general, this method constitutes a basis for analyzing multiple zzso images and is particularly useful for zzso slow flow or flow in small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
