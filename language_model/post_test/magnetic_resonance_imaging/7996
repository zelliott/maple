We aim to report a series of cases that presented as zzso swelling and pain following anterior cruciate ligament zzso reconstruction using zzso fixation zzso 

All zzso reconstructions done between 2007 and 2010 were reviewed zzso to identify complications related to zzso fixation zzso We performed 273 zzso reconstructions over a period of three years from 2007 to 2010 using a zzso screw for zzso fixation of the quadrupled hamstring zzso 

Fourteen patients zzso at mean age of 30 zzso zzso years, presented to us at a mean zzso period of 26 months zzso zzso with zzso pain and swelling over the zzso screw zzso All of them had normal inflammatory zzso All of these patients underwent surgical zzso which revealed remnants of screw and zzso zzso There was no evidence of infection in the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso appearance and surrounding zzso zzso zzso of screw debris and zzso of the tunnel resulted in complete recovery of all patients at a mean follow up of 12 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso along with other adverse biological response should be considered as a possible complication in zzso zzso We report an zzso of zzso of zzso reaction in patients undergoing zzso reconstruction with zzso interference screw fixation for the zzso zzso
