We sought to determine whether zzso zzso images without zzso selection can adequately characterize the components of human zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso imaging zzso has the potential to identify lipids in zzso plaques but has not yet produced detailed images of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso we examined zzso components of diseased and normal arteries to determine water relaxation zzso zzso and zzso as well as the relative content of mobile zzso zzso times were also measured at zzso and zzso zzso Sections of arteries with zzso zzso of graded severity were zzso at zzso and zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso was used to assess zzso zzso In the zzso core, the water zzso signal zzso over that of zzso zzso ratio, zzso At zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso for the zzso core, zzso zzso for the zzso cap, and zzso zzso for normal zzso This results in a high zzso on zzso zzso images for zzso core compared with the zzso cap and normal zzso A similar contrast was measured at lower field zzso zzso do not generate appreciable signal due to their low water content but can be detected on zzso zzso zzso The water zzso contrast allows discrimination of the zzso zzso core from zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso sequences permits in zzso identification of the zzso core, zzso cap, zzso media, zzso and zzso zzso The discrimination of collagen fibers that zzso zzso deposits permits study of plaque protection and stability at all field strengths and may provide the basis for in zzso zzso of human zzso
