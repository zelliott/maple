zzso research has yielded conflicting results regarding the architecture of short-term memory zzso Whereas a consensus has emerged that within zzso a single chunk within the focus of attention zzso has a privileged status, it is unclear whether further distinctions zzso One proposal is that outside of zzso memory is all of one sort with a continuous progression from zzso to long-term memory zzso On the other hand, sharp performance zzso when zzso is loaded with more than zzso items suggest distinctions between zzso and zzso We use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to zzso between these zzso A neural triple zzso provided evidence for a zzso model of zzso zzso prefrontal zzso was selectively enhanced to retrieval from activated portions of zzso whereas the zzso was associated with retrieval of items within putative zzso capacity zzso We zzso that the zzso properties of the zzso serve to zzso information actively maintained in zzso which not only promotes strong zzso but also lays the foundations for subsequent zzso By contrast, information not actively maintained in mind requires zzso retrieval processes zzso by the prefrontal zzso These data provide key insights into the architecture of zzso and its relationship to zzso
