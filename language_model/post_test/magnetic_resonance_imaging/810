zzso reconstruction of the zzso arch following zzso arch surgery is zzso The placement of an zzso zzso bypass has been proposed for these difficult zzso This approach is not ideal in children due to possible long-term zzso This study presents the results of our policy to reconstruct the zzso arch in zzso obstruction in children, which are not amenable to balloon zzso 

Seven children with a median age of 8 years zzso 1 zzso zzso were operated for zzso arch obstruction following correction of an zzso zzso Six children presented another zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso 2 zzso 1 zzso zzso of the left main coronary artery, and 1 zzso valve zzso The surgical approach involved a zzso zzso support using two zzso inflow zzso (one above and one below the zzso zzso and moderate zzso Enlargement of the zzso arch was performed by a sliding zzso in four patients and by a patch zzso in three zzso Associated cardiac defects were corrected as zzso 

It was technically possible to perform the planned operation in all zzso All patients survived and none presented significant zzso zzso There were no residual zzso in six patients and a zzso of 10 zzso in one patient zzso One patient showed transient zzso nerve zzso which recovered within 6 zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed a normal appearing zzso arch with zzso zzso 

Although more zzso an anatomical reconstruction of the zzso arch can be performed in infants and children with zzso obstruction of the zzso arch with excellent initial zzso This approach may prove superior to an zzso bypass in the zzso
