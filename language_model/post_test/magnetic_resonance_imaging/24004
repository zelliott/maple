The zzso relaxation time, T zzso of zzso zzso gas in the lung in zzso is an important zzso for pulse sequence zzso and image zzso We obtained T zzso maps of zzso zzso and zzso in guinea pig lungs zzso zzso 17) and in human zzso Eight different sets of zzso guinea pig studies were acquired, with variation of slice selection, tidal volume, and oxygen zzso For example, for a zzso tidal volume of 3 zzso and no slice selection, the average T zzso in the trachea was zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The equivalent zzso experiment yielded an average T zzso of zzso zzso in the trachea and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The average zzso T zzso in the human zzso zzso was zzso zzso The relaxation behavior was predicted by treating the lung as a porous zzso resulting in good agreement between estimated and measured T zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
