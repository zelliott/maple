Conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso images are susceptible to motion induced artifact, which is exacerbated by zzso zzso zzso moment zzso can reduce motion artifact but lengthens the minimum zzso degrading the zzso zzso zzso We designed a pulse sequence capable of zzso zzso density and zzso contrast while suppressing zzso signals and motion induced zzso zzso density weighting was obtained by rapid zzso zzso reversal immediately after the zzso zzso pulse, within a conventional zzso zzso By analyzing the behavior of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso flip angle, we suppressed zzso contribution to the image, thereby enhancing zzso density and zzso contrast with a two- to zzso reduction of repetition zzso This permitted an increased number of averages to be used, reducing motion induced zzso Fat suppression in the presence of motion was investigated in two groups of 8 volunteers each by zzso modified Dixon technique, zzso selective zzso and zzso hybrid of zzso zzso of fat signal by the first technique was relatively uniform across the field of view, but it did not fully suppress the ghosts originating from fat zzso Selective zzso while sensitive to the main field zzso largely eliminated the ghosts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso The hybrid of both techniques combined with bandwidth zzso however, showed the best results zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso imaging allows zzso of image contrast which, along with averaging and effective fat suppression, significantly improves zzso and zzso imaging, particularly in the presence of zzso
