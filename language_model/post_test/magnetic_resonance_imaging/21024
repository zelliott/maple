At the zzso Hospital, zzso County, Hungary, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been routinely used since July, zzso In the majority of cases this method has been applied for the assessment of zzso viability in patients with chronic zzso heart disease and, in a smaller number of cases, for the evaluation of patients with zzso zzso and zzso with uncertain zzso in young zzso 

The aim of the study was to analyze the clinical value of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in assessing the viability of affected zzso regions due to chronic zzso of major coronary zzso 

zzso cardiac magnetic resonance examination was performed in 88 patients who had 103 zzso regions affected with chronic zzso of the coronary zzso The number of affected zzso regions which proved to be zzso with coronary artery intervention and the number of regions where zzso strategy was based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings were zzso 

Based on findings from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, zzso strategy was set up in 88 zzso regions corresponding to zzso of all affected zzso regions included in this zzso 

zzso cardiac magnetic resonance imaging appears to be a powerful tool to choose the optimal zzso strategy in patients with chronic coronary zzso Although this diagnostic method is relatively expensive, its accuracy regarding the features of zzso viability such as zzso extension of the zzso within the affected region is higher than that of other methods zzso zzso zzso or stress zzso
