In multiple zzso the relationship between conventional zzso findings and the clinical evolution of the disease is zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso can provide markers reflecting the more disabling features of multiple sclerosis zzso The aim of the present study was to assess the value of zzso zzso quantities and their short-term changes in predicting the long-term zzso of disability in multiple sclerosis zzso Conventional and zzso zzso scans of the brain were obtained at baseline and after 12 months in 73 patients, who were followed zzso with clinical visits for a median period of 8 zzso At baseline and at 12 months, zzso and zzso zzso volume, zzso brain volume zzso zzso zzso and white matter zzso zzso and average zzso zzso ratio zzso were zzso At the two time points, metrics derived from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso A zzso analysis, adjusted for follow-up zzso was performed to establish which variables were significant zzso of long-term neurological zzso At the end of zzso 44 patients zzso showed a significant disability zzso A multivariable model included baseline zzso zzso zzso peak height zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso and average zzso zzso percentage change after 12 months zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso as independent zzso of disability worsening at 8 years zzso zzso zzso The discriminating ability of such a model in predicting the individual patients' outcome was zzso zzso zzso provides useful zzso markers for the prediction of the long-term evolution of multiple zzso This study also suggests that zzso damage is one of the key factors associated with disability zzso in this zzso zzso zzso
