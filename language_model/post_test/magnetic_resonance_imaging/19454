zzso assessment of cartilage properties, specifically water content, could prove helpful in the diagnosis of early degenerative joint zzso zzso relaxation times zzso of human zzso cartilage zzso cartilage slices of three zzso were measured on a zzso basis in a clinical whole body MR system in zzso In zzso feasibility to measure quantitative zzso maps was shown for human zzso zzso The relaxation times of cartilage with collagen in the zzso zone oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field increased from approximately 10 zzso near the bone to approximately 60 zzso near the zzso zzso zzso water content of the zzso plateau and zzso zzso could be determined from the correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso with an error of approximately 2 zzso In zzso directional variation would need to be zzso If confirmed in zzso zzso zzso could potentially serve as a zzso tool for the evaluation of the status and distribution of water content in zzso zzso
