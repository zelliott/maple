Adolescent women with a parental history of depression are at high risk for the onset of major depressive disorder zzso zzso theories suggest this vulnerability involves deficits in cognitive control over emotional zzso Among adolescent women with and without a parental history of depression, we examined differences in connectivity using resting state functional connectivity analysis within a network associated with cognitive control over emotional zzso 

zzso zzso adolescent women underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso They were assigned to high-risk zzso and low-risk zzso groups based their parents' depression zzso zzso based functional connectivity analysis was used to examine group differences in connectivity within a network associated with cognitive zzso 

zzso adolescents had lower levels of connectivity between a right inferior prefrontal region and other critical zzso of the attention control network, including right middle frontal zzso and right zzso zzso Further, greater severity of the parents' worst episode of depression was associated with altered cognitive control network connectivity in their adolescent zzso 

zzso parents may transmit depression vulnerability to their adolescent daughters via zzso in functional connectivity within neural circuits that zzso cognitive control of emotional zzso
