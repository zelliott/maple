zzso of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso time zzso directly or through characteristic features such as the zzso with the experimental protocol zzso been extensively used for the identification of active regions in the zzso Both approaches have zzso zzso of the time series themselves may identify zzso with similar zzso behavior that is unrelated to the zzso whereas zzso requires knowledge of the stimulus presentation zzso In this paper we propose the use of zzso structure zzso idea borrowed from zzso this approach does not suffer from the deficits associated with previous zzso zzso We first formalize the traditional zzso methods as three steps: feature zzso choice of zzso metric and choice of zzso zzso The use of different characteristics to effect the zzso zzso zzso and so zzso relates to the first of these three zzso We then demonstrate the efficacy of zzso zzso on a simple visual task and on resting zzso A byproduct of our analysis is the finding that masking prior to zzso as is commonly done, may degrade the quality of the discovered zzso and we offer an explanation for this zzso
