The evaluation of candidate optical contrast agents for brain tumor zzso in ex zzso models may not accurately predict their activity in zzso This study describes an in zzso model system designed to assess optical contrast agents for brain tumor zzso The brain tumor window zzso model was created by performing zzso zzso on zzso zzso rats, injecting zzso zzso cells into the zzso and bonding a cover slip to the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso growth was followed serially and occurred in an exponential zzso Once tumors on the cortical surface achieved a zzso zzso intravenous contrast agents were injected while the appearance of the cortical surface was zzso zzso image analysis was used to zzso evaluate visible differences between tumor and normal zzso zzso margins became readily apparent following contrast administration in the zzso zzso Based on red component intensity, tumor zzso improved fourfold at 50 zzso zzso administration in the zzso model zzso In zzso window placement zzso an implanted zzso is technically possible and well tolerated in the zzso The zzso model is a valid system for assessing the in zzso activity of optical contrast zzso
