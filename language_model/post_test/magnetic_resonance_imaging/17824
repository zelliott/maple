To characterize the effect of a zzso zzso on dose to zzso during external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer and to assess for factors correlated with zzso dose zzso 

zzso patients at 4 institutions were enrolled into a prospective pilot clinical zzso Patients underwent baseline scans and then were injected with zzso spacing zzso and zzso zzso modulated radiation therapy plans were created on both scans for zzso The objectives were to establish rates of creation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and decrease in zzso zzso of zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso and changes in plan zzso zzso volume, zzso volume, zzso zzso planning target volume zzso and zzso zzso zzso gel volume, gel zzso length of zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso 

zzso resulted in zzso zzso separation in zzso of zzso zzso had decreased zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a mean reduction of zzso zzso There were no significant differences in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Plan zzso were significantly different before versus after injection zzso plans with worse conformity indexes after injection compared with before injection zzso still had improvements in zzso zzso In multiple zzso analysis, greater zzso reduction in zzso was associated with decreased relative zzso plan conformity zzso zzso in zzso did not significantly vary by institution, despite significant zzso variations in plan zzso There were no significant relationships between reduction in zzso and the other characteristics zzso 

zzso of zzso into the zzso interface resulted in dose reductions to zzso for zzso of patients zzso zzso sparing was statistically significant across a range of 10 to 75 zzso and was demonstrated within the presence of significant zzso zzso in plan zzso target zzso and injection zzso
