The human visual system exploits zzso in natural scenes to derive useful zzso Such zzso is frequently associated with either contours or textures within zzso In this study we use zzso to evaluate how the total amount of zzso contained in contours and textures within natural images affect responses in visual zzso We used both the entire natural image and parts of it containing predominantly zzso or texture zzso We modified these natural images in order to match other image properties that are known to affect cortical responses as closely as zzso These modified natural images, zzso zzso images, remain highly zzso We also used synthetic images without recognizable content but with closely matched image zzso We report that most of the primary visual zzso zzso signal variations are explained by the total amount of zzso in the zzso zzso visual cortex, on the other hand, is driven strongest by images containing sparsely distributed zzso independent of zzso amount or recognizable image zzso These results provide evidence for an initial representation of natural images in zzso based on local oriented zzso Later visual zzso (and to a modest degree zzso incorporates a zzso of zzso structure and zzso interactions that effectively amplify zzso information within natural zzso
