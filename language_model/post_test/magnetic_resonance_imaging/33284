Current theories of classical conditioning assume that learning depends on the zzso relationship between events, not just on their zzso zzso Here we employ the classic experiment zzso this zzso blocking zzso combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate whether human zzso responses in aversive learning conform to these zzso In accordance with zzso we demonstrate that significantly stronger behavioral and zzso responses are evoked by zzso stimuli that are zzso of the zzso stimulus than by zzso stimuli that have received the same pairing with the zzso zzso yet have no zzso zzso When studying the development of this effect, we not only observed that it was related to the strength of previous zzso responses, but also that zzso compared with zzso zzso stimuli received more overt attention, as measured by zzso eye zzso and that this went along with enhanced zzso zzso We zzso observed that prefrontal regions play a role in the development of the blocking effect: zzso prefrontal zzso zzso anterior zzso only exhibited responses when zzso stimuli had to be established as zzso for an outcome, whereas zzso prefrontal zzso also showed responses when zzso stimuli had to be established as zzso Most importantly, zzso prefrontal zzso connectivity to zzso zzso switched between positive and negative zzso depending on the requirements posed by zzso zzso Together, our findings highlight the role of zzso value in explaining zzso responses and identify mechanisms that shape these responses in human fear zzso
