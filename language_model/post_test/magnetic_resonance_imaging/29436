The purpose of our study was to determine the accuracy of zzso for diagnosing tears of the hip zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to evaluate various signs of zzso zzso 

We zzso evaluated zzso of 74 hips (in 45 zzso that were obtained using zzso to zzso fields of view and interpreted using primary and secondary signs of zzso zzso Fifteen hips had surgically proven zzso zzso tears, and 59 hips were either zzso or had surgically confirmed intact zzso zzso findings were scored by two zzso through consensus and then again independently by a third zzso to determine zzso zzso 

The accuracy of zzso for the diagnosis of tears of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso significant associations were found between tears of the zzso zzso and areas of high signal intensity superior to the greater zzso on zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and areas of high signal intensity lateral to the greater zzso on zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement was good to zzso 

zzso showed good accuracy for the diagnosis of tears of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The identification of an area of zzso zzso superior to the greater zzso had the highest sensitivity and specificity for tears at zzso and zzso zzso
