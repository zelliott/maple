We evaluated the accuracy of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the staging of prostate zzso 

We zzso reviewed 32 patients who underwent zzso MR prostate prior to radical zzso The zzso stage based on MR imaging was compared with the zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso MR prostate in the evaluation of zzso extension zzso of the zzso were then zzso 

MR correctly diagnosed 17 cases of zzso prostate zzso and 2 cases of locally advanced zzso In the evaluation of zzso zzso MR achieved a high specificity of zzso low sensitivity of zzso and moderate accuracy of zzso 

zzso MR prostate has high specificity for the detection of zzso It is useful in the local staging of prostate cancer in patients with intermediate risk as this helps to ensure that few patients will be deprived of potentially zzso zzso
