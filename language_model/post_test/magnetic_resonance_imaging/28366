The zzso response of the zzso to zzso zzso electrical stimulation zzso of the spinal zzso at zzso and above, zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso over the motor zzso and zzso zzso electrical stimulation of the zzso nerve in the neck zzso was recorded in six normal subjects at the zzso chest zzso The compound motor evoked zzso zzso recorded in response to both zzso and zzso were facilitated to a similar extent during zzso zzso this zzso was greater than any change seen in response to zzso with zzso The results show that zzso of the response in the zzso to zzso during zzso inspiration is due to increased zzso at zzso associated with the spinal zzso pool, but they do not exclude a component due to increased higher zzso zzso We conclude that it is unsafe to assign a cortical contribution to zzso inspiration on the sole basis of zzso of the zzso response in the zzso to zzso
