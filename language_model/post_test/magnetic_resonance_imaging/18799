The purpose of this study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to probe the neural zzso associated with zzso to negative and positive affective stimuli in patients with major depressive disorder before treatment and after 2 and 8 weeks of treatment with zzso Relations between baseline neural zzso and response to treatment were also zzso 

Patients with major depressive disorder zzso and healthy comparison subjects zzso were scanned on three occasions, during which trials of alternating blocks of affective and neutral pictorial visual stimuli were zzso zzso were evaluated at each testing occasion, and both groups completed self-report measures of zzso zzso zzso mapping was used to examine the zzso data with a focus on the zzso zzso 

Patients showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms with zzso zzso interactions in response to the negative versus neutral stimuli were found in the left insular zzso and the left anterior zzso At zzso both groups showed bilateral zzso in the visual zzso lateral prefrontal cortex, and zzso in response to the negative versus neutral zzso with patients showing greater zzso in the visual zzso and less zzso in the left lateral prefrontal zzso Patients with greater relative anterior zzso zzso at baseline in response to the negative versus neutral stimuli showed the most robust treatment zzso 

The findings underscore the importance of the neural zzso activated by negative affect in depression and indicate that components of this zzso can be changed within 2 weeks of treatment with zzso zzso
