To investigate the accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso zzso compared to conventional cerebral and carotid zzso zzso 45 patients underwent zzso within one week after zzso The zzso involves a zzso zzso imaging steady zzso pulse sequence base on three-dimensional zzso phenomena at zzso zzso zzso time of zzso zzso echo time of zzso zzso and a flip angle of zzso degrees were used to zzso the depiction of blood flow as high zzso Volume data were then submitted to a maximum intensity projection zzso and viewed at multiple arbitrary projection angles rotating through the three zzso zzso zzso structures were suppressed with a zzso slab superior to the area of zzso All significant zzso and zzso at the carotid zzso and circle of Willis were zzso Other than the carotid siphon zzso the rest of the arteries have above zzso complete agreement between zzso and zzso The carotid zzso and zzso artery show complete agreement of zzso and zzso respectively, making zzso a simple sensitive screening zzso This report shows that MR zzso has an important role in the evaluation of blood flow in the head and neck zzso
