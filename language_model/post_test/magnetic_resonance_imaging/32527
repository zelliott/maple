zzso was used to zzso neural responses temporally associated with the zzso experience of emotion from those associated with the perception of zzso stimuli in order to better define the zzso functions of the amygdala, lateral zzso frontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso viewed aversive pictures followed by an extended zzso period of sustained zzso zzso Brain regions showing zzso zzso the period of sustained zzso emotion were distinguished from those showing zzso limited to the period of aversive picture zzso zzso results showed that zzso ratings of emotion remained elevated for 20 s after offset of the aversive zzso zzso results showed that viewing aversive pictures activated the amygdala, lateral zzso and zzso zzso emotion zzso both during and after aversive zzso was temporally associated with zzso in the right lateral zzso and left zzso but not the zzso Ratings of zzso emotion were correlated with zzso in the right lateral zzso and left zzso The results support direct zzso involvement in emotion perception but suggest that zzso zzso is not temporally associated with zzso emotion that occurs after the offset of zzso zzso The results are consistent with a general role for the lateral zzso in monitoring or reflecting on internal experience and show that zzso zzso is sustained during a period of zzso emotion, possibly related to enhanced memory zzso for the aversive zzso
