zzso zzso screw fixation is an effective procedure for zzso an unstable motion zzso however, it has generally been considered too risky due to the potential for injury to zzso structures, such as the spinal cord, nerve roots or zzso zzso Since 1995, we have treated 144 unstable cervical injury patients with zzso screws using a zzso zzso axis view zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of this technique in accurately placing zzso screws to treat unstable cervical injuries, and the ensuing clinical outcomes and zzso The accuracy of zzso screw placement was zzso examined by zzso zzso zzso scans and zzso zzso Solid zzso zzso fusion without secondary zzso was accomplished in zzso of all zzso Of the zzso cervical zzso screws zzso 57 zzso demonstrated screw exposure zzso of the screw outside the zzso and 24 zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso of the screw outside the zzso There was one case in which a probe penetrated a zzso artery without further complication and one case with transient zzso zzso and zzso zzso was required in 20 zzso of the 144 zzso However, the zzso were easily performed, because those patients underwent zzso surgery alone without zzso external zzso The placement of cervical zzso screws using a zzso zzso axis view technique provided good clinical results and a few complications for unstable cervical injuries, but a careful surgical procedure was needed to safely insert the screws and more improvement in imaging and navigation system is zzso
