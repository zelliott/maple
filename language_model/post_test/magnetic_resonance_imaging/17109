To investigate the zzso mechanism of retrieval of long-term digital memory in healthy volunteers, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique was used in the zzso Twenty-two right-handed volunteers were subjected to a long-term digital memory test with zzso The memory task and control task were adopted in the experiment zzso The zzso data were recorded by a zzso zzso MR machine and analyzed by zzso The activated brain regions were shown in the zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso area zzso 9 region in left middle frontal zzso was the most activated zzso during the long-term digital memory zzso The left zzso frontal zzso left inferior frontal zzso right inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso left inferior zzso zzso left superior zzso zzso right superior zzso zzso right middle zzso zzso left zzso zzso left middle zzso zzso right middle brain, zzso and right zzso nucleus tail were also zzso The zzso in zzso showed obvious left zzso It is suggested that a series of brain regions with left predominance are involved in long-term digital zzso Left lateral frontal zzso would be the most important structure for information zzso while the other zzso and their connections may be important for processing and long-term storage of digital zzso
