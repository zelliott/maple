A basic feature of many clinical trials is the collection of zzso data on individual zzso Analysis of such data is often based on zzso over zzso This allows use of standards methods to assess treatment effects but sacrifices information on patterns over time as well as potential greater efficiency of zzso The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the utility of the generalized zzso equations zzso approach to the analysis of zzso zzso count, and continuous responses for the frequent magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of the zzso pivotal trial of zzso zzso b in zzso multiple zzso
