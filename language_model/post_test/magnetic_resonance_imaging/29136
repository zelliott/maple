zzso of cerebral cortical development are common anomalies of the brain, typically causing zzso delay or zzso that are classically thought to begin in zzso We present clinical and MR imaging data of 16 patients with cortical zzso in whom evidence of zzso dysfunction was first noted in adulthood, and attempt to determine whether these zzso had any zzso features from those presenting in zzso 

Imaging studies and clinical records of 16 patients with zzso zzso dysfunction were reviewed zzso The patients ranged in age from 17 to 64 years zzso age, 35 zzso at the time of zzso Imaging findings were correlated with seizure zzso 

Fourteen patients had zzso zzso zzso women, seven zzso and two patients had zzso zzso Eleven patients had zzso with age of onset ranging from 14 to 45 years zzso age, 22 zzso four of them were successfully controlled by zzso The remaining five patients had no seizure zzso All patients, except one, had normal zzso The zzso or zzso of location of zzso was not associated with the presence or absence of seizures, seizure frequency, or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and small zzso zzso may have minor clinical manifestations that are not evident until adulthood, or may, occasionally, never cause zzso signs or symptoms zzso
