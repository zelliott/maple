To describe the zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in zzso proven zzso cerebral zzso We zzso reviewed the zzso zzso findings in patients with zzso cerebral zzso Images were reviewed for size, location, and characteristics of signal intensity abnormalities and zzso zzso Images were also assessed for mass effect, zzso cyst, zzso cortical zzso and zzso The individual imaging characteristics were correlated with clinical and treatment zzso There were 44 zzso zzso percent had a zzso all patients had received radiation, and 57% had received chemotherapy in close proximity to zzso All images demonstrated contrast enhancement, predominantly in the white zzso Enhancement was present in the zzso region in 50% of cases and the corpus zzso in zzso The most common pattern of zzso peripheral enhancement was zzso zzso and of interior enhancement was zzso zzso zzso The enhancing zzso was single in zzso of zzso Mass effect was present in zzso of zzso zzso and patterns of enhancement were significantly associated with the zzso from brain radiation to the diagnosis of zzso cerebral zzso tumor zzso patient age, type of radiation, and administration of systemic zzso This is the largest study of the zzso conventional zzso findings in zzso confirmed zzso cerebral zzso We characterized the imaging findings in a variety of tumor types following a variety of radiation treatments and other zzso zzso These findings may be of value in identifying zzso cerebral necrosis in patients treated for a brain zzso
