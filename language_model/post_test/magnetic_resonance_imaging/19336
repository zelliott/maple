Various authors have developed criteria to zzso MR imaging findings that suggest the possibility of multiple zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the capacity of three sets of MR imaging criteria for predicting the conversion of isolated zzso syndromes to clinically zzso multiple zzso 

zzso patients with clinically isolated zzso symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis were zzso studied with MR zzso The MR imaging findings were evaluated by two independent zzso who were blinded to clinical follow-up zzso Based on the clinical outcome at follow-up zzso of a second attack that established clinically zzso multiple zzso the sensitivity, zzso zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value of the criteria proposed by zzso et zzso zzso et zzso and zzso et al were zzso 

zzso zzso multiple sclerosis developed in 22 zzso patients after a mean follow-up time of zzso zzso The criteria proposed by zzso et al and those proposed by zzso et al showed identical zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value, zzso and negative zzso value, zzso The criteria proposed by zzso et al showed the zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value, zzso and negative zzso value, zzso 

The four zzso MR imaging parameters proposed by zzso et al are more specific and accurate than the criteria proposed by zzso et al or zzso et al for predicting conversion to clinically zzso multiple zzso
