The zzso zzso of the cervical spine was evaluated using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

To investigate the effect of degenerative changes in the functional spinal unit on cervical zzso by using zzso 

Few studies have, thus far, by using MR images, described the contribution of degenerative changes in the functional spinal unit to cervical zzso however, the exact cervical zzso remains zzso 

A total of zzso consecutive symptomatic patients underwent dynamic cervical zzso in zzso neutral, and extension zzso All digital zzso and calculations of the variations in zzso angular motion were automatically performed by an MR zzso using true MR images with 77 predetermined points marked on each zzso Each segment was assessed based on the extent of zzso disc zzso zzso zzso and cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso observed on zzso MR zzso 

The zzso mobility of the segments with severe zzso zzso and moderate disc zzso tended to be lower than that of the segments with severe zzso zzso and severe disc zzso and a significant difference was observed in the zzso mobility of the zzso zzso Moreover, in all segments with moderate disc zzso the zzso mobility was significantly reduced in the presence of severe zzso zzso as compared with no zzso However, in segments with severe disc zzso no significant differences were observed between the zzso mobility of the zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that cervical zzso zzso may cause deterioration of cervical zzso function and zzso changes in the cervical zzso We zzso that the spinal zzso may potentially protect its functions from dynamic mechanical zzso zzso by restricting zzso motion, and these mechanisms may be closely related to the zzso zzso
