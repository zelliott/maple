To locate motor functional area of patients who undergone modified anatomical zzso in order to analysis the plasticity of upper limbs zzso 

The patients who undergone modified anatomical zzso were performed zzso zzso to locate functional cortical areas in their residual zzso 

6 patients have performed examination of zzso sequences by zzso zzso of them obtained zzso upper limb motor areas in their residual brain, and 3 of them obtained zzso and zzso upper limb motor area map in zzso The zzso upper limb motor areas in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The patients who undergone modified anatomical zzso is an excellent model to investigate mechanism of plasticity in the developing zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso provided fine spatial detail of brain responses, would describe the motor functional area of cortical zzso These patients exist zzso motor areas in their residual zzso zzso The study indicated there maybe have somewhat extent of correlation between the surgical procedure and the outcome of zzso
