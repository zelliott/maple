Although zzso and zzso tests are potentially useful to distinguish zzso zzso zzso from progressive zzso zzso zzso little is known about the diagnostic value of zzso zzso for their zzso We assessed the value of zzso for zzso zzso from zzso 

We reviewed conventional zzso recorded at an early stage of disease in 10 zzso patients and 14 zzso zzso We focused on slowing of background activity zzso frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity zzso and focal slow waves zzso zzso analysis was performed by zzso exact zzso 

zzso was observed in 1 zzso patient and 2 zzso zzso zzso were found in 8 zzso patients zzso but only 2 zzso patients zzso zzso they appeared zzso to the zzso side in 6 of 8 zzso patients, and zzso to the side with most zzso on zzso in 7 of 8 zzso zzso zzso was observed in 2 zzso patients zzso and 5 zzso patients zzso zzso 

zzso are characteristic of zzso but zzso was not zzso 

zzso on zzso in addition to clinical criteria, yield useful supplementary information to distinguish between these diseases at early zzso
