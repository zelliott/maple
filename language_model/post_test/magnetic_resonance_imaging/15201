Studies of mouse cerebral zzso to date have focused on the circle of Willis without examining the zzso distribution of blood vessels through the rest of the zzso Since mouse models are frequently used in zzso studies, there is a need for a comprehensive cerebral zzso zzso for the mouse with an emphasis on the location of vessels with respect to zzso structures, the watershed regions associated with specific zzso as well as a consistent nomenclature of the cerebral zzso This article describes such an atlas, based on a combination of magnetic resonance and zzso zzso technology to yield high-resolution zzso and zzso data on zzso zzso This three-dimensional zzso zzso provides an anatomical resource for future mouse zzso
