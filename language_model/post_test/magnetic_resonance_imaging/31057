The positive zzso zzso oxygen zzso response zzso in human visual zzso by a localized visual stimulus is accompanied by a reduction in the zzso response in regions of the visual zzso that represent zzso locations in the visual zzso We have suggested previously that this negative zzso reflects zzso suppression of neural activity, but it might also be explained in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso changes that have no neural zzso We distinguish two possible zzso effects of this zzso zzso blood flow reduction caused by locally reduced pressure in vessels that share their blood supply with nearby zzso zzso and zzso blood flow reduction caused by active zzso of vessels under neural zzso The first is ruled out as an explanation of negative zzso by showing that a visual stimulus that stimulates primary visual zzso in one zzso can cause extensive suppression in the other zzso zzso it is not a local zzso zzso zzso most likely reflects suppression of neural activity, but could also reflect an active blood flow control zzso
