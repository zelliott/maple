zzso zzso of the zzso zzso body zzso zzso are rare, and most information about them has come from single case zzso This study was undertaken to review the zzso experience with a series of patients with acquired zzso of the zzso to delineate the clinical and zzso features of these tumors, and show how they differ from zzso body zzso 

A zzso review was conducted on acquired tumors of the zzso that were evaluated by the authors and a review of the English language literature was zzso The data from the zzso cases were compared with previously reported zzso 

The authors had personal experience with nine patients with acquired tumors of the zzso and found 18 other patients with these tumors in the zzso Of the zzso patients, all tumors were predominantly zzso and were white to zzso in zzso Associated clinical findings included signs of zzso inflammation in all patients, secondary cataract in eight zzso and zzso of the lens in six zzso Eight of the tumors were managed successfully by local zzso and one by zzso zzso the tumors showed considerable variation from patient to zzso Seven tumors were classified as benign zzso and two as zzso zzso There was no local recurrence or systemic zzso Although tumors of the zzso historically have been zzso clinically as zzso body melanoma, our study suggests that they have some characteristic features that severe to differentiate them from melanoma and other zzso body zzso In contrast to melanoma, acquired zzso of the zzso are zzso and are more likely to have an irregular surface, associated inflammatory signs, to transmit light well during zzso and show high internal zzso with zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso have characteristic clinical and zzso features that should suggest the zzso Due to their anterior location in the zzso body, local zzso (rather than zzso is usually the treatment of zzso The visual prognosis is fair, and the systemic prognosis is zzso
