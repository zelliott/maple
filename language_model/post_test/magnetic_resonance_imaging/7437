zzso evidence suggests that functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies rarely consider statistical power when setting a sample zzso This raises concerns since undersized studies may fail to detect effects of interest and encourage data zzso Although sample size methodology in this field exists, zzso requires specifications of estimated effect size and zzso zzso We therefore systematically evaluated how often estimates of effect size and zzso components were reported in zzso zzso studies involving clinical human participants published in six leading journals between January 2010 and December zzso A random sample of 100 eligible articles was included in data extraction and zzso Two independent zzso assessed the reporting of sample size calculations and the data components required to perform the calculations in the zzso zzso One article zzso reported sample size zzso The reporting of zzso estimates for effect size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Three articles zzso reported Cohen's d or F effect zzso The majority zzso reported peak or average zzso zzso or F zzso The zzso agreement was very good, with a zzso zzso zzso zzso value greater than zzso We concluded that sample size calculations were seldom reported in zzso zzso Moreover, omission of zzso estimates for effect size, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso could limit zzso ability to perform power analyses for new zzso We suggest routine reporting of these zzso and recommend strategies for reducing bias in their reported zzso
