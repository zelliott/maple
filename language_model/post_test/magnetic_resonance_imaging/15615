Liver transplantation zzso represents a zzso treatment for small zzso zzso zzso Potentially zzso zzso zzso patients are denied zzso due to the lack of cancer markers that predict progression and zzso 

zzso candidates for zzso with zzso C virus zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Gene expression zzso analysis of tumor samples was performed using zzso 

Twenty patients underwent zzso 13 progressed while waiting for zzso 4 are alive awaiting zzso and 1 died without progression while waiting for zzso zzso in zzso among patients who underwent zzso or did not progress zzso versus those whose disease progressed while waiting for zzso zzso were zzso Thus, 54 probe sets zzso were significantly zzso zzso Among zzso patients, 10 zzso were zzso expressed between zzso patients with the same zzso stage that recurred zzso versus zzso patients who did not recur zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with survival at the zzso zzso 

Here, we have identified genes associated with zzso progression in zzso patients awaiting zzso zzso A limited number of genes were related to overall survival and zzso survival after zzso zzso of these molecular markers could help to improve organ allocation for zzso zzso
