The aim of this study was to compare MR imaging and zzso zzso zzso for the local staging of zzso zzso zzso patients were examined on a zzso MR unit using either a pelvic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone or combined with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences with zzso fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso techniques were zzso The zzso technique was performed using a flexible zzso The results were compared with findings at zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso on MR correlated with zzso in 32 of 49 patients and on zzso in 29 of 49 zzso The zzso on MR correlated with zzso in 22 of 49 patients and on zzso in 26 of 49 zzso zzso penetration of the zzso wall was predicted by MR with 86 % sensitivity and 65 % zzso and by zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered to 40 of the patients after the examinations which may explain some of the zzso by MR and zzso Three patients with surgically and zzso confirmed invasion of zzso zzso in the pelvis were detected preoperatively on MR but none on zzso zzso penetration of the zzso wall and local zzso zzso zzso cannot accurately be predicted with MR or zzso zzso zzso however, seems to be more useful for zzso identification of clinically zzso advanced zzso
