To determine the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso in the diagnosis of zzso in a large group of patients with zzso duct stones confirmed at direct zzso Also, to compare zzso duct stones confirmed at direct zzso Also, to compare zzso duct stone characteristics using the three different zzso zzso retrograde zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

191 patients zzso zzso mean age, 66 years; range, zzso zzso were investigated by direct zzso zzso and zzso Their final diagnosis as determined at direct zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso strictures zzso zzso zzso and normal ducts zzso zzso zzso The direct zzso methods used for diagnosis of zzso were zzso zzso zzso 29), zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso duct stone characteristics were compared using zzso zzso and US in the 29 patients in whom stones were exclusively diagnosed by zzso 

Compared with the final diagnosis, zzso had a sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the diagnosis of zzso zzso resulted in three zzso and three zzso findings, four of which occurred due to confusion with zzso at the zzso US had a sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the diagnosis of zzso zzso diagnosed more stones and the stones were more zzso distributed within the zzso duct at zzso when compared with zzso 

zzso has a high diagnostic accuracy zzso similar to that at direct zzso in the diagnosis of zzso It has the potential to replace diagnostic zzso and select patients with zzso for therapeutic zzso
