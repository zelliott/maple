The lack of electron density information in magnetic resonance images zzso poses a major challenge for zzso zzso treatment planning zzso In this study the authors convert zzso intensity values into zzso units zzso in the male pelvis and thus enable accurate zzso zzso for prostate cancer patients with varying tissue anatomy and body fat zzso 

zzso zzso intensity values and standard zzso zzso zzso image zzso in the male pelvis were analyzed using image data of 10 prostate cancer zzso The collected data were zzso to generate a dual model zzso conversion technique from zzso intensity values of the single image set separately within and outside of contoured pelvic zzso Within the bone segment local zzso intensity values were converted to zzso by applying a zzso zzso zzso This model was tuned for each patient by two zzso zzso MR signal zzso to correct shifts in absolute intensity level and application of a zzso value to accurately represent low density zzso tissue zzso For soft zzso such as fat and muscle, located outside of the bone zzso a zzso zzso method without requirements for any zzso adjustments was introduced to convert zzso intensity values into zzso The dual model zzso conversion technique was implemented by constructing zzso images for 10 other prostate cancer zzso The feasibility of these images for zzso was evaluated by comparing zzso in the generated zzso images with those in standard CT images, and by determining zzso in zzso dose zzso compared to those in CT images with zzso intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso arc therapy zzso with the zzso zzso Carlo zzso 

The average zzso differences between the constructed zzso images and standard CT images of each test patient ranged from zzso to 5 zzso and from 22 to 78 zzso in soft and zzso zzso zzso The average local absolute value differences were 11 zzso in soft zzso and 99 zzso in zzso The planning target volume doses zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso images were within zzso compared to those in CT images in all of the 20 treatment zzso The average zzso was zzso With all the test patients over zzso zzso and zzso zzso of dose points within body zzso than zzso of maximum dose zzso passed the 1 zzso and zzso zzso gamma index zzso The statistical tests zzso and zzso showed significantly improved zzso zzso zzso zzso and dose calculation zzso with the soft tissue conversion method instead of homogeneous representation of these zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

This study indicates that it is possible to construct high quality zzso images by converting the intensity values of a single zzso series into zzso in the male zzso and to use these images for accurate zzso prostate zzso dose zzso
