To investigate the utility of zzso inversion recovery zzso imaging for diagnosing multiple system zzso zzso 

We zzso evaluated 49 subjects (19 with zzso including 11 with zzso disease, 15 with Parkinson's disease and 15 matched zzso in order to compare the diagnostic value of zzso imaging to detect a zzso zzso rim zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso imaging, zzso imaging detected zzso more conspicuously in the 19 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso this trend was also observed in 11 zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso imaging tended to increase sensitivity of detecting zzso compared with zzso imaging (all zzso 89 zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso imaging might be more useful for detecting zzso in zzso patients, even though they are at an early zzso
