The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques for evaluation of zzso stimuli has great potential for understanding neurotransmitter dynamics for a number of brain disorders, such as drug abuse, zzso zzso or zzso Unfortunately, blood zzso zzso zzso imaging at common fields strengths, such as zzso or 3 zzso has very low sensitivity and zzso ratios zzso We demonstrate here the utility of using an zzso zzso iron oxide contrast agent with a long plasma zzso for evaluation of zzso changes related to zzso stimuli using zzso or the cocaine analog zzso zzso We refer to this technique as increased relaxation with iron oxide zzso zzso zzso obtained here show that even at field strengths as high as zzso zzso one can obtain increases in zzso by factors of 2-3 over zzso imaging that lead to greater than an order of magnitude increase in statistical power with greatly increased sensitivity to zzso changes in brain regions difficult to observe using zzso zzso Furthermore, use of the zzso contrast agent allows for a meaningful zzso zzso to be measured zzso cerebral blood volume zzso compared to conventional zzso zzso
