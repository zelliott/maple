The zzso nucleus zzso is a major target for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulation zzso zzso recording zzso is used in many cases to identify the target zzso A real-time procedure for identifying the entry and exit points of the zzso would improve the outcome of this targeting zzso We used the zzso root mean square zzso of a short (5 zzso zzso sampled signal and the estimated anatomical distance to target zzso as the basis for this zzso zzso tip location was defined zzso by an expert zzso to be before, zzso or after the zzso Data from 46 zzso of 27 patients were used to calculate the zzso zzso probability of being in each of these locations, given zzso pair zzso We tested our predictions on each trajectory using a zzso technique, with the rest of the zzso serving as a training set and found the error in predicting the zzso entry to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso exit point, which yields a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso target zzso The simplicity and zzso ease of zzso zzso its spike zzso nature and tolerance to zzso parameters of this zzso zzso can lead directly to the development of a fully automated zzso zzso procedure for the refinement of imaging estimates of zzso zzso
