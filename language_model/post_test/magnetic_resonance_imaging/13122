Relative reward value is important for the choice between a set of available zzso and absolute reward value for stable and consistent economic zzso It is unclear whether in the human brain zzso absolute value representations can be zzso from relative reward value zzso Using zzso we investigated how the zzso zzso of an odor is influenced by whether the odor is presented in the context of a relatively more pleasant or less pleasant zzso We delivered two of a set of four zzso separated by a delay of 6 zzso with the instruction to rate the zzso of the second zzso and searched for brain regions where the zzso were correlated with the absolute zzso rating of the second zzso and for brain regions where the zzso were correlated with the difference in zzso of the second from the first zzso that is, with relative zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso tracked the relative zzso zzso whereas zzso in the anterior zzso tracked the relative zzso zzso In contrast, in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso tracked the absolute zzso of the zzso Thus, both relative and absolute zzso value signals which provide important zzso to decision-making processes about which stimulus to choose are separately and simultaneously represented in the human zzso
