With in zzso zzso zzso of several zzso were simultaneously measured in cerebral zzso and adjacent normal zzso 15 patients with zzso brain zzso all zzso verified were monitored with zzso and zzso before and after zzso 11 patients were zzso zzso technique evolved from single volume zzso to one zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso In all patients zzso signals were decreased in zzso areas compared to the normal brain zzso No recovery was seen after zzso zzso signals were increased in zzso margins of high grade zzso and more zzso in low grade zzso In 5 patients the zzso resonance decreased after zzso accompanied by a shrinkage of zzso diameter on zzso zzso signals were present in high grade and unspecified zzso and absent in most low grade zzso In 3 patients the zzso signal disappeared after zzso These observations indicate the feasibility of zzso in monitoring zzso responses on zzso of brain zzso
