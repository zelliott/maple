CT and MR imaging are useful for evaluating the extension of zzso in the face and zzso We evaluated the involvement by zzso arising from the zzso zzso zzso zzso by using CT and MR zzso 

We zzso examined 122 patients with zzso cell zzso zzso in the lower zzso zzso and upper zzso zzso zzso Extension of zzso into the spaces of the face and neck was evaluated with CT and MR imaging, and findings were surgically zzso 

zzso into the face and neck spaces occurred in zzso of zzso The zzso space was the most common site of spread, occurring in zzso of the lower and of zzso of the upper zzso zzso zzso into the zzso space occurred from the lower zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso but not from the anterior zzso zzso space involvement from the upper zzso was rare zzso The zzso triangle and zzso space immediately anterior to the zzso served as a corridor for cancer extension from the lower zzso into the zzso zzso The zzso space zzso was a less common site of spread from the lower zzso 

zzso zzso spread into the zzso zzso and zzso spaces depending on the primary sites in the oral zzso An understanding of the face and zzso anatomy is important in diagnosing cancer extension in the oral cavity zzso and in treating patients with such zzso
