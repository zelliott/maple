We aimed to determine the frequency and time course of the enlargement of zzso cerebral zzso following human stroke and to study the effect of the state of zzso on zzso zzso Acute zzso volumes were measured on zzso magnetic resonance images and compared with zzso volumes measured on zzso images at 7 days or zzso zzso zzso were performed between 2 and 53 hours after stroke onset in 28 zzso Thirteen patients also had magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso In 12 zzso of 28 patients the initial zzso volume increased by zzso or zzso The number of studies showing enlargement of the zzso zzso volume ranged from 12 zzso of 28 at or after 2 hours to 10 zzso of 26 at or after 6 hours, 5 zzso of 15 at or after 24 hours, and 2 zzso of 6 at or after 48 zzso In 7 of the 10 patients in whom the zzso volume acutely exceeded the volume of the zzso on zzso images, zzso volume increased by zzso or zzso This study provided evidence that substantial enlargement of human cerebral zzso zzso volumes can occur beyond the first 6, 12, or 24 hours after zzso A mismatch acutely between the region of zzso zzso and the region of diffusion zzso zzso may be zzso of zzso zzso zzso
