To evaluate the relationship between zzso levels and disease activity and the spinal inflammation detected by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with AS were randomly assigned in a zzso ratio to receive infusions of zzso or 5 zzso zzso at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12 and zzso zzso were collected for zzso analysis at weeks 0, 2 and 24 and were zzso for levels of zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso protein zzso Bath zzso zzso Disease zzso Index zzso scores and zzso and zzso zzso and short zzso inversion recovery zzso were collected at baseline and week zzso 

zzso greater reductions in zzso zzso and zzso were observed at weeks 2 and 24 in the zzso group compared with the zzso group (all zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso were associated with increased rates of clinical response after 24 zzso Multiple zzso analyses showed that reductions from baseline to week 2 in zzso but not zzso or zzso were significantly associated with reductions in zzso activity and zzso scores from baseline to week 24 in the zzso group zzso 

zzso reductions in zzso zzso and zzso were observed with zzso compared with zzso High levels of baseline zzso and zzso were associated with clinical response after zzso zzso Early reductions in zzso were significantly associated with improvements in disease activity and the spinal inflammation detected by zzso
