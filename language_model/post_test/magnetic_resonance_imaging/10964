The goal of this study was to zzso 1) if the presence of significant coronary zzso in patients presenting with zzso zzso acute coronary syndromes zzso can be predicted by cardiac magnetic resonance zzso zzso and 2) if the analysis of several zzso methods improves its diagnostic yield compared with analysis of individual zzso 

With modern acquisition techniques, several zzso methods for the assessment of coronary artery disease zzso can be combined in a single zzso scanning zzso Such a zzso zzso examination has not previously been applied to a large patient population, in particular those with a high prevalence of zzso in an acute zzso 

zzso patients presenting with zzso underwent zzso imaging of zzso function, zzso zzso and zzso viability (by late contrast zzso and coronary artery zzso Visual analysis of zzso was carried zzso First, all zzso data were reviewed in combination zzso zzso In further separate zzso each zzso method was analyzed zzso The ability of zzso to detect coronary zzso zzso on X-ray zzso was zzso 

Comprehensive zzso analysis yielded a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso to predict the presence of significant coronary zzso and was more accurate than analysis of any individual zzso zzso zzso was significantly more sensitive and accurate than the zzso In zzso zzso risk score zzso zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging accurately predicts the presence of significant zzso in patients with zzso In this study, a comprehensive analysis of several zzso methods improved the accuracy of the zzso
