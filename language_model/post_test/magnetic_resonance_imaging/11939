A series of zzso tests examining early and later aspects of zzso processing were conducted in a patient with bilateral zzso involving the zzso visual zzso affecting the lateral zzso zzso and the underlying white matter (as shown by magnetic resonance imaging studies and confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso Visual zzso form discrimination, color, and zzso discrimination were normal whereas spatial zzso line zzso depth, and zzso zzso were severely zzso Performance on early motion tasks was very zzso These include seeing coherent motion in random noise zzso & zzso zzso speed discrimination, and seeing two-dimensional form from relative speed of zzso However, on zzso motion tasks the patient was able to identify actions from the evolving pattern of dots placed at the zzso of a human actor zzso zzso as well as discriminating three-dimensional structure of a cylinder from motion in a dynamic zzso zzso The pattern of these results is at odds with the hypothesis that precise zzso comparison of early motion zzso is necessary for zzso zzso from zzso zzso
