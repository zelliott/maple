zzso zzso is a key feature of borderline personality disorder zzso with altered zzso functions having suggested as being zzso The anterior zzso zzso and further prefrontal brain regions are crucial for response zzso The regulation of emotions is ensured via zzso control over the zzso The present study aimed to investigate neural zzso of response zzso in zzso by using an emotional zzso paradigm extending the task to word stimuli which were related to stressful life zzso 

Twenty zzso patients and 20 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while performing the individual emotional zzso zzso A block design was used with the following word type conditions: neutral words, general negative words, and individual negative zzso The individual negative words were recruited from a prior interview conducted with each zzso 

While zzso patients had overall slower reaction times in the zzso task compared to healthy controls, there was no increased slowing with emotional zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso blood zzso zzso signal increases in the anterior zzso zzso as well as in frontal zzso contrasting generally negative zzso neutral and individual negative zzso neutral conditions, zzso zzso patients did not show equivalent signal zzso 

These results provide further evidence for a dysfunctional network of brain areas in zzso including the zzso and frontal brain zzso These areas are crucial for the regulation of stress and emotions, the core problems of zzso zzso
