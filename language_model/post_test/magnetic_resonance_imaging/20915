The behavioral and zzso consequences of zzso often include performance enhancements and recruitment of zzso regions for zzso zzso How the zzso changes resulting from this sensory loss relate to these functional changes is, however, less zzso Previous studies using cortical thickness zzso measures have shown thicker zzso zzso in zzso zzso individuals compared with sighted zzso We hypothesized that this finding reflects the zzso plasticity often observed in blind individuals and thus could reflect behavioral zzso To address this issue, CT measures in blind zzso and zzso and sighted subjects were obtained along with several auditory behavioral measures in an attempt to relate behavioral and zzso zzso Group contrasts confirmed previous results in showing thicker zzso zzso in the zzso zzso analyses between CT measures across the whole brain of all blind individuals with the behavioral scores from 2 tasks in which zzso subjects were superior zzso and melody zzso showed that CT of zzso areas was directly related to behavioral zzso These findings constitute a compelling demonstration that anatomical changes in zzso areas are directly related to heightened behavioral abilities in the blind and hence support the idea that these anatomical features reflect zzso zzso zzso
