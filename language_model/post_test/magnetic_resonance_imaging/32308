The purpose of this study was to determine whether prenatal zzso provides additional information about fetal zzso zzso compared with prenatal zzso 

Twenty-two pregnant women with fetal zzso zzso underwent prenatal zzso zzso zzso age, 23 zzso The size, location, mass zzso and zzso effects of the tumors were determined and correlated with zzso and zzso zzso 

Based on the zzso findings, the following American Academy of Pediatrics, zzso Section zzso were zzso type I in six patients, type II in 12, and type III in zzso No type IV tumors were zzso The zzso zzso appeared entirely zzso in five zzso zzso in one, mixed zzso and solid in 12, and solid in zzso The diagnosis of zzso zzso was accurate in all cases assessed at our center using both zzso and zzso Two additional patients initially referred with the diagnosis of zzso zzso had a different diagnosis at zzso at our institution zzso zzso zzso 1; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was superior to zzso for detecting displacement of the colon zzso zzso zzso urinary tract zzso zzso zzso zzso hip dislocation zzso zzso zzso zzso extension zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In fetuses with zzso zzso types II and III, zzso better showed the zzso extent of the tumor compared with zzso zzso findings were confirmed at surgery or autopsy in all zzso Three fetuses with high output cardiac physiology underwent open fetal zzso of the tumor at zzso zzso and zzso zzso age with two zzso 

Our results show that zzso fetal zzso is a useful adjunct to the prenatal evaluation of fetal zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso more accurately characterized the zzso and abdominal extent of the tumors and provided more information on zzso of adjacent zzso The additional zzso resolution provided by zzso resulted in more accurate prenatal counseling and improved zzso planning for surgical zzso
