Maintaining attention and performance over time is an essential part of many activities, and zzso cognitive control is required to avoid vigilance zzso and interference from zzso zzso at or near right middle frontal zzso zzso area zzso zzso as well as in other prefrontal and zzso areas, are often activated in studies of sustained attention zzso zzso and zzso zzso Kim et zzso 2006; Lim et zzso zzso This zzso has often been interpreted as representing the engagement of cognitive control zzso However, such studies are typically implemented at one level of task difficulty, without an experimental manipulation of control zzso The present study used the zzso condition sustained attention task zzso which has been used extensively in animals to determine the role of zzso systems in zzso performance, to test the hypotheses that BA 9 is sensitive to changes in the demand for cognitive control and that this sensitivity reflects an increased engagement of zzso zzso Continuous zzso spin labeling zzso was used to measure neural activity in zzso healthy, young adults performing a sustained attention task under standard conditions and under a distraction condition that provided an experimental manipulation of demands on cognitive zzso The zzso impaired behavioral performance and increased zzso in right middle frontal zzso zzso increases in right middle frontal zzso activity were associated with greater behavioral vulnerability to the zzso These findings indicate that while right middle frontal zzso regions are sensitive to demands for zzso effort and control, they may not be sufficient to maintain performance under zzso In addition, they demonstrate the sensitivity of zzso methods to variations in task demands, and suggest that the zzso may be a useful tool for zzso zzso and clinical zzso
