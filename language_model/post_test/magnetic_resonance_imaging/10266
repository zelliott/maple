The role of language in performing zzso zzso has been a topic of special interest in zzso The zzso Code zzso proposes the existence of a zzso verbal code involved in retrieving zzso facts related to addition and zzso and a zzso analog magnitude code zzso tasks such as number comparison and zzso zzso studies have shown zzso between dependence of zzso zzso involving exact and approximate processing on zzso zzso However, a direct manipulation of language using different zzso tasks is necessary to assess the role of language in forming zzso representations and in solving problems in different zzso In the present study, 20 zzso zzso were trained in two unfamiliar zzso tasks in one language and scanned using zzso on the same problems in both languages zzso and zzso For the exact zzso zzso task, language switching effects were found in the left inferior frontal zzso zzso and left inferior zzso zzso extending to the angular zzso In the approximate zzso zzso task, language switching effects were found predominantly in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso slightly zzso to the zzso zzso seen for the zzso addition zzso These results considerably strengthen the notion that exact processing relies on verbal and zzso networks, whereas approximate processing engages zzso circuits typically involved in zzso zzso
