zzso expressions of fear are universally recognized signals of potential zzso zzso may have evolved specialized neural systems for responding to fear in the absence of conscious stimulus zzso We used functional zzso to establish whether the zzso and the zzso prefrontal regions to which it projects are engaged by subliminal fearful faces and whether responses to subliminal fear are distinguished from those to zzso zzso We also examined the time course of zzso prefrontal responses to zzso and subliminal zzso zzso were fearful and neutral baseline faces, presented under subliminal zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses zzso were recorded simultaneously as an objective index of fear zzso zzso was used to undertake search zzso zzso analyses for the zzso and zzso prefrontal (including anterior zzso cortex, and complementary zzso zzso Time series data were extracted from zzso to examine activity across early versus late zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso activity were enhanced in response to both subliminal and zzso fear zzso Time series analysis showed a trend toward greater right zzso responses to subliminal fear, but zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso subliminal fear was distinguished by right zzso anterior zzso activity and zzso fear by zzso anterior zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso Although zzso zzso activity was relatively persistent for subliminal fear, zzso fear showed more sustained cortical zzso The findings suggest that zzso processing of fear may occur via a direct zzso zzso zzso without the need for conscious zzso whereas zzso of consciously attended signals of fear may rely on zzso processing within a zzso zzso zzso
