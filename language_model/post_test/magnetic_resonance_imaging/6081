To assess the accuracy of four fat zzso methods at zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in zzso fatty liver disease zzso by using MR zzso as the reference zzso 

In this institutional review zzso zzso prospective study, 110 subjects (29 with zzso zzso 50 overweight and at risk for zzso and 31 healthy zzso zzso age, zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso gave informed consent and underwent MR zzso and zzso MR imaging of the zzso zzso involved a long repetition time (to suppress zzso zzso and multiple echo times (to estimate zzso zzso the reference fat fraction zzso was calculated from zzso fat and water spectral peak zzso Imaging involved a low flip angle (to suppress zzso zzso and multiple echo times (to estimate zzso zzso imaging zzso was calculated by using four analysis methods of progressive zzso dual zzso triple zzso zzso and zzso All methods except dual echo corrected for zzso zzso The zzso method corrected for multiple spectral interference effects of zzso For each method, the accuracy for diagnosis of fatty liver, as defined with a zzso zzso was assessed by zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso accuracy was assessed by comparing imaging and zzso zzso values by using linear zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods had a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso slope and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method had high zzso accuracy without statistically significant error zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methods had statistically significant error zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso fat zzso at zzso zzso zzso MR imaging provides high diagnostic and zzso accuracy in zzso
