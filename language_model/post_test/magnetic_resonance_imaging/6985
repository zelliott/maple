The correlations in the fluctuations in the blood zzso zzso zzso zzso signal between zzso distinct regions of the zzso that are known components of functional systems have been previously studied as possible indicators of functional zzso The objective of this study was to examine the effect of zzso brain activity, as assessed by zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso on functional connectivity zzso in the same zzso zzso of zzso for sequential finger motion were determined using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso connectivity zzso based on zzso correlations were acquired at rest and during zzso sequential finger zzso zzso zzso were determined using zzso mean correlations within and between three regions of interest activated for the finger motion zzso zzso zzso were also determined for a control region that was not activated for the zzso Continuous motor tasks performed during zzso zzso did not significantly affect the functional connectivity as compared to the connectivity at rest within or between regions known to be activated by the zzso However, there appeared to be a trend suggesting a slight reduction in connectivity zzso during the motor zzso The connectivity within and between those areas not activated for the task remained unchanged between zzso These results suggest that in the motor system investigated, the recruitment of zzso to perform a specific task may moderately reduce the degree of zzso zzso within and between zzso
