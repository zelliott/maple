Directing attention to some acoustic features of a sound has been shown repeatedly to zzso the zzso neural zzso On the contrary, little is known about the zzso impact of auditory attention when the auditory scene remains zzso We performed an experiment in which subjects had to detect a sound emerging from silence (the sound was zzso after different zzso of zzso Two frontal zzso zzso zzso prefrontal and inferior zzso were found, regardless of the side where sound was searched for, consistent with the well established role of these regions in zzso zzso The main result was that the superior zzso zzso showed zzso zzso to the side where sound was expected to be zzso The area extended from the vicinity of zzso zzso to the surrounding areas zzso zzso lateral zzso The effect consisted of both an increase in the response to a sound delivered after attention was directed to detect its emergence and a baseline shift during the silent zzso Thus, in absence of any acoustic zzso the search for an auditory input was found to activate the auditory zzso
