zzso resonance guided focused ultrasound surgery provides a minimally invasive controlled method for selectively destroying zzso zzso A zzso analysis of focused ultrasound provides an estimate of the zzso temperature distribution and zzso dose required for ultrasound zzso The temperature distribution is estimated by accumulating heat sources, considering the effects of zzso zzso heat content, and zzso In this study, both gel zzso and excised in zzso bovine muscle specimens were zzso in a zzso T MR system while heated with a 5 zzso diameter, 10 zzso focal zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso the zzso effects were observed with zzso pulse zzso Below a critical temperature, the heat zone appeared as a dark spot that moved with the focal zzso Above a critical zzso dose, the in zzso tissue was zzso altered and the focal zzso was observed on both the MR image and the zzso zzso
