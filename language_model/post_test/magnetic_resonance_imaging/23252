To demonstrate clinical characteristics of symptomatic spinal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and different spreading mechanisms relating to zzso cell zzso we present an extraordinary case of a 47-year-old patient with rapid progressive zzso due to zzso zzso and zzso dissemination of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of our patient were analyzed for zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Furthermore, we present 19 additional cases of zzso zzso with symptomatic spinal seeding, identified through literature zzso zzso expression was high in zzso and zzso tumors, but low in zzso dissemination of our zzso Mean patient age was 45 zzso Mean zzso between identification of spinal zzso and death was zzso zzso Mean overall survival was zzso zzso zzso of symptomatic spinal zzso was more frequently zzso zzso zzso than zzso (7 zzso The case presented zzso supports the hypothesis of higher zzso of low zzso expression in zzso cells in zzso manifestations after primary zzso zzso Because of the proposed tendency for early zzso spread from primary tumors with low zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso patients with these tumors should be followed more closely to identify zzso tumor progression early zzso Early identification of zzso spread could enable these patients to benefit from radiation therapy before they develop severe neurological deficits, which might translate into longer acceptable quality of life for these mostly young zzso This is an important finding, but further prospective studies are needed to verify our zzso
