Imaging and zzso studies provide zzso evidence that patients with schizophrenia have a zzso zzso trajectory of frontal lobe zzso The hypothesis that typical and zzso medications may zzso impact brain zzso in adults with schizophrenia was previously assessed with inversion recovery zzso zzso Increased white matter zzso volume suggestive of increased zzso was detected in the patient group treated with an zzso antipsychotic compared to a typical zzso 

In a follow-up zzso of zzso images from the original study, we used a novel method to assess whether the difference in zzso volumes could be caused by a differential effect of medications on the zzso zzso zzso 

Two different male zzso of healthy controls ranging in age from zzso years were compared to zzso of subjects with schizophrenia who were treated with either oral zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

A novel zzso method that combines the distinct tissue contrasts provided by zzso and zzso density zzso images was used to estimate zzso zzso zzso zzso 

When compared with their pooled healthy control comparison group, the two groups of schizophrenic patients differed in the frontal lobe ICM measure with the zzso group having significantly higher zzso 

The data suggest that in adults with schizophrenia antipsychotic treatment choice may be specifically and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso can be used to dissect subtle differences in brain tissue characteristics and thus help clarify the effect of zzso treatments on zzso and zzso zzso
