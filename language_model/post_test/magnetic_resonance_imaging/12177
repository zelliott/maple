Four zzso imaging zzso were used to zzso evaluate and compare zzso zzso healing in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were the four techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed in 32 dogs divided into four zzso The zzso were stabilized with a zzso gap using unilateral external skeletal zzso Dogs were zzso zzso with the four zzso techniques, and killed at zzso zzso zzso techniques were used to zzso 1) the zzso properties of the zzso and 2) the local zzso properties and calcium content within the zzso The techniques which had the strongest associations with the zzso properties of the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso Generally, zzso and zzso had marginally stronger correlations than zzso but, overall, there were no differences between the zzso zzso had the poorest associations with the zzso properties of the zzso Generally, zzso had the strongest correlations with local material properties, such as zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso had the second strongest correlations with calcium content and had the third strongest correlations with zzso zzso behind zzso zzso had the third strongest correlations for calcium zzso With the exception of some of the correlations with zzso zzso zzso had the poorest associations with the local parameters zzso
