To compare the zzso of fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in evaluating head and neck disorders, the authors evaluated 46 zzso in 23 consecutive zzso zzso zzso were related to zzso 19 zzso resulted from zzso zzso or zzso zzso Conventional zzso zzso and zzso images were obtained in all zzso The zzso and zzso images were zzso compared in an zzso manner for zzso of zzso margins and zzso zzso imaging improved zzso of 22 zzso zzso and showed equal zzso of 18 zzso zzso imaging proved most useful for small zzso with long zzso relaxation times that were surrounded by zzso zzso imaging improved visibility of small zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso zzso peripheral nerve tumors, and small zzso zzso Early changes secondary to spread of tumor across zzso planes were also well zzso with zzso zzso In six zzso zzso that did not have long zzso relaxation times, the zzso images provided better zzso The authors conclude that by improving zzso of small zzso adjacent to or surrounded by fat, zzso sequences can supplement zzso sequences in imaging the head and zzso
