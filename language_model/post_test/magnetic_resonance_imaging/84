zzso anomalies are common in patients with zzso zzso and are a known risk factor for neurological zzso Smaller but zzso spinal cords have not been described in association with zzso zzso nor have they been considered to be an anomaly with a similar neurological zzso We previously reported on small spinal cords associated with zzso zzso We hypothesized that patients with zzso zzso zzso would similarly have smaller spinal cords as compared with normal controls, with a potentially increased risk for zzso 

We reviewed thirty patients with zzso zzso (including zzso patients with failure of zzso formation and zzso with failure of zzso zzso All patients had adequate zzso zzso digitally zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans that were suitable for zzso zzso zzso areas of the spinal zzso and spinal canal at each of the twelve zzso levels were calculated three times by a blinded observer, and the average values were compared with zzso from zzso normal zzso 

We observed a significantly smaller mean zzso area at all levels of the spinal zzso in the study group as compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso When the pathological segments were zzso both with and without the inclusion of the adjacent normal zzso the spinal zzso was smaller for the study group zzso zzso zzso Within the study group, small spinal cords were observed in patients with failed zzso formation as well as in patients with failed zzso zzso but without an identifiable difference between these two zzso The spinal canal was also smaller for the patients in the study group, but not in all zzso No patient showed a reduction of, or encroachment on, the space available for the spinal zzso Spinal zzso size increased with age in both the study group and the control group but remained consistently smaller in the study zzso Within the study group, the presence of zzso anomalies did not appear to influence the spinal zzso zzso 

The spinal zzso is significantly smaller in patients with zzso zzso zzso than in normal zzso Because small spinal cords have been reported to be associated with neurological zzso we advise that the diminished spinal zzso size be considered an important component of zzso anomalies associated with zzso zzso
