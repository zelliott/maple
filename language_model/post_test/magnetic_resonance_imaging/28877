We report a zzso study of the induced electric fields and specific zzso rate zzso produced by zzso radiation from a zzso zzso near tissue models, and the resulting transient and zzso temperature zzso Several models were zzso including a uniform zzso plane of zzso uniform sphere, a phantom model of the head filled with zzso material, a zzso model of the head with uniform zzso properties zzso from a digitized zzso zzso zzso and a zzso model of the head with different zzso properties corresponding to various zzso The electromagnetic calculations were performed for zzso zzso radiating at 900 and zzso zzso at various distances from the model, using the zzso zzso zzso The resulting temperature rises were estimated by finite element solution of the zzso zzso The calculated zzso values agree well with an empirical correlation due to zzso If the limiting hazard of such zzso is associated with excessive temperature increase, present exposure limits are very conservative and guidelines that are easier to implement might provide adequate zzso
