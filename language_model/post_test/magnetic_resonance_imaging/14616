To compare zzso zzso chamber shape in zzso to that in zzso 

Both eyes of 55 adult subjects were zzso 27 with zzso zzso zzso error zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and 28 with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso refraction was measured with a zzso Nippon zzso and anterior chamber depth and zzso length with a zzso zzso zzso zzso chamber shapes were determined from zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso using procedures previously reported by our zzso zzso surface model coordinates were assigned to zzso zzso superior, and inferior zzso and plotted in two dimensions to illustrate the composite shape of respective zzso zzso to the second zzso zzso zzso zzso of chamber shape were constructed to compare relative zzso between zzso groups and zzso 

zzso in shape occurred in the region zzso to points of maximum globe zzso and were thus in general zzso with an equatorial model of zzso zzso Shape in zzso is zzso distinctly as that of an zzso zzso and in zzso as an zzso zzso of significantly less degree such that it zzso to a zzso There was zzso between shape and zzso projection of respective zzso into right, left, superior, and inferior visual zzso 

zzso zzso zzso chamber shapes were rarely found in zzso and we propose that zzso shape in zzso may constitute a zzso limitation on further zzso zzso zzso of zzso shapes with zzso projection suggests that zzso growth is coordinated by processes that operate beyond the zzso zzso
