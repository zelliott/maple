The control of zzso attention zzso the joint contribution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the neural bases of the interplay between these two zzso To address this issue, we presented zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso visual cues zzso within the same trial zzso zzso during zzso crossing zzso the zzso of the two zzso We found that both zzso and zzso cues affected behavioral performance, zzso or zzso target discrimination when valid and zzso zzso Despite the zzso paradigm zzso the interplay between zzso and zzso factors, the two types of cue affected responses in an independent manner without any significant effect of zzso The imaging data revealed increased zzso in separate cortical areas following invalid zzso and invalid zzso zzso A zzso system was activated during invalid zzso trials, whereas a region at the zzso junction was activated during invalid zzso zzso Within both zzso activity was unaffected by the zzso of the other zzso These results indicate the existence of separate, zzso neural circuits for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
