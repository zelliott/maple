Various lines of evidence indicate that men generally experience greater sexual zzso zzso to erotic stimuli than zzso Yet, little is known regarding the zzso processes underlying such a gender zzso To investigate this issue, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare the neural zzso of zzso in 20 male and 20 female zzso Brain activity was measured while male and female subjects were viewing erotic film zzso zzso showed that the level of perceived zzso was significantly higher in male than in female zzso When compared to viewing emotionally neutral film excerpts, viewing erotic film excerpts was zzso for both zzso with bilateral blood oxygen level dependent zzso signal increases in the anterior cingulate, zzso zzso zzso insular, and zzso zzso as well as in the zzso and the zzso zzso Only for the group of male subjects was there evidence of a significant zzso of the zzso and zzso a sexually zzso area of the brain known to play a pivotal role in zzso zzso and sexual zzso When directly compared between zzso zzso zzso was found to be significantly greater in male zzso Furthermore, for male subjects only, the magnitude of zzso zzso was positively correlated with reported levels of zzso These findings reveal the existence of similarities and zzso in the way the brain of both genders responds to erotic zzso They further suggest that the greater zzso generally experienced by men, when viewing zzso may be related to the functional gender difference found here with respect to the zzso
