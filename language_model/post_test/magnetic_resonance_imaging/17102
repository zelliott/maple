zzso in visual perception and working memory are commonly observed in zzso disorders and have been investigated using functional zzso zzso However, interpretation of differences in brain zzso may be zzso with differences in task performance between zzso zzso in task difficulty across conditions may also pose zzso issues in studies of visual processing in healthy zzso 

To address these concerns, the present study characterized brain zzso in tasks that were zzso matched for zzso zzso was used to assess brain zzso in 10 healthy subjects during discrimination and working memory judgments for zzso and moving zzso For all task conditions, performance accuracy was matched at zzso 

Areas associated with V2 and zzso in the zzso stream were activated during motion processing tasks and zzso in the zzso stream were activated during form processing zzso zzso areas associated with working memory were also statistically significant during the working memory zzso 

Application of zzso methods to equate task demands provides a practical method to equate performance levels across conditions in zzso studies and to compare healthy and cognitively impaired groups at comparable levels of zzso These zzso matched tasks can be applied to patients with a variety of cognitive disorders to investigate dysfunction of multiple a zzso defined brain zzso zzso the changes in typical zzso patterns in patients with these diseases can be useful for monitoring disease zzso evaluating new drug treatments, and possibly for developing methods for early zzso
