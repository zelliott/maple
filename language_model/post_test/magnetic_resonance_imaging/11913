zzso was applied to investigate the transport pathways in Morning Glory plant zzso The study was carried out on living plants without affecting their zzso The architecture of a zzso plant was deeply zzso the root system structure and the vascular bundle location were identified, the presence of central voids caused by cell maturation and loss were observed in the zzso zzso transport components were zzso by observing the concentration profile of a zzso which changed with time after its zzso by the plant zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of an zzso transport as the progress of the zzso front through the vascular zzso and a zzso molecular transport from the vascular zzso toward the surface of the zzso As a result, the zzso molecular transport formed the zzso zzso front zzso A model was built up through the analysis of the zzso that consisted of an zzso front at the peak position and a zzso front at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed differences between the zzso transport zzso in the zzso and the zzso directions in the plant zzso The model revealed that the zzso of the zzso tail reflected the zzso of diffusion and zzso of the zzso in the plant zzso
