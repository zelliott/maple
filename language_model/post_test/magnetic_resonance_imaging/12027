Nine patients had magnetic resonance imaging studies to aid in the diagnosis of wrist pain in the zzso zzso Six had positive magnetic resonance imaging studies with a decrease in signal intensity from the area of the zzso one had an zzso zzso and two had negative zzso Among the six patients with a diagnosis of zzso disease by magnetic resonance imaging, four patients had collapse of the zzso on plain zzso and the other two patients had normal wrist zzso zzso resonance imaging studies showed a substantial decrease in the signal intensity on zzso and zzso images of the entire zzso in three patients, and three patients had focal areas of decreased signal zzso All of the patients had a biopsy of the zzso at the time of zzso The zzso of the zzso of the zzso appeared to zzso to the magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso bone specimens from the patients with zzso disease showed marked zzso in three patients, focal areas of zzso in two patients, and alternating areas of zzso with dramatic areas of new bone formation in one zzso Although in four patients the diagnosis was obvious by plain zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies were essential in confirming the diagnosis in two patients and were helpful in ruling out the diagnosis in three zzso
