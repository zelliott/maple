To investigate if magnetic resonance zzso zzso can be performed routinely and to compare MR zzso findings with those of conventional zzso or zzso 

MR zzso was zzso performed in 30 patients with symptoms of inflammatory zzso disease or zzso obstruction zzso A zzso solution was used to zzso the small zzso To monitor dynamic changes in the small zzso a zzso fast zzso zzso sequence was zzso For zzso assessment, zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained without and with zzso zzso Image quality and degree of zzso zzso were zzso MR imaging findings and degree of zzso were compared with findings at conventional zzso zzso zzso 25) or surgery zzso zzso zzso 

MR zzso was well tolerated and provided adequate image quality and sufficient zzso zzso zzso grade based on MR zzso images zzso zzso 10) was identical to that based on conventional zzso images zzso zzso 6) or surgical findings zzso zzso zzso There was exact agreement between MR zzso and retrospective findings in all five patients who underwent surgery, and MR findings were identical to those at zzso in 18 patients, superior in six patients, and inferior in one zzso 

MR zzso can be performed routinely with adequate image quality and sufficient zzso zzso The functional information provided by MR zzso is identical to that provided at conventional zzso
