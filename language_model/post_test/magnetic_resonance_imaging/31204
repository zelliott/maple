Increased brain volume in zzso appears to be driven mainly by an unexplained white matter enlargement, and we have reported a similar phenomenon in zzso language disorder zzso zzso of this enlargement would strongly guide research into its cause, tissue basis, and functional zzso We zzso a white matter zzso technique that divides cerebral white matter into an outer zone containing the radiate compartment and an inner zone containing zzso and bridging system zzso In both zzso zzso and zzso enlargement localized to the radiate white matter (all zzso in zzso all but zzso in zzso whereas inner zone white matter compartments showed no volume differences from zzso Furthermore, in both zzso and zzso later or zzso regions showed greater volume increases over zzso Neither group showed cerebral cortex, corpus zzso or internal capsule volume differences from zzso zzso white matter zzso later than deep white zzso this pattern of enlargement thus is consistent with striking zzso head circumference zzso increases reported in zzso These findings suggest an ongoing zzso process in both zzso and zzso that is probably intrinsic to white matter, that primarily affects zzso and zzso connections, and that places these two disorders on the same zzso
