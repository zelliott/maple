zzso zzso is an zzso complication of severe zzso resulting from zzso bleeding in the same zzso Open zzso has been used since 1969 to prevent zzso zzso of target zzso Between 1988 and 1993 we performed open zzso of the ankle in five zzso aged 6 to 9 years with zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging proved very useful for evaluating the severity of joint damage, usually underestimated on plain zzso for determining the degree of zzso membrane zzso which is a critical factor in the decision to perform zzso for planning the surgical procedure and for explaining treatment zzso A decrease in the frequency of zzso episodes occurred in all five zzso A repeat zzso was needed in one case and in another patient the frequency of zzso episodes increased somewhat after the fourth zzso There was no loss of range of zzso Our data suggest that open zzso is effective and safe for reducing the frequency of zzso and that magnetic resonance imaging should be routinely performed before the zzso
