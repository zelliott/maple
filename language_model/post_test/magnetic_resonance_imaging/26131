To document clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso characteristics of a large cohort of primary and transitional progressive multiple sclerosis zzso and zzso zzso patients over one zzso 

Patients with zzso or zzso zzso have been shown to have low brain zzso and zzso zzso loads and slow rates of new zzso formation with minimal zzso enhancement, despite their accumulating zzso zzso evaluation of these patients is needed to zzso the pathological processes responsible for disease progression and to identify clinical and zzso measures which can monitor these processes in treatment zzso 

zzso recruited from six European zzso underwent two assessments on the expanded disability status scale zzso and zzso of the brain and spinal cord, 1 year zzso 

Of the 167 patients studied zzso with zzso zzso and 30 with zzso zzso 41 zzso 35 zzso and six zzso showed a one step increase in the zzso The mean number of new brain zzso seen was zzso in the zzso group and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Both groups demonstrated change in zzso zzso load over the year zzso or zzso with median percentage changes of zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso group also showed a significant change in zzso load zzso zzso median change zzso The number of new zzso zzso seen was small zzso of zzso in the zzso group and no new zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Both groups demonstrated a decrease in zzso cross zzso area zzso zzso median changes; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but only the zzso group showed evidence of significant brain zzso zzso zzso 

Although the monitoring of disease progression in this patient group is difficult, this study demonstrates changes in both zzso load and zzso which, if shown to correlate with clinical change over a longer time will facilitate therapeutic trial zzso
