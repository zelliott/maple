Chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso zzso is a molecular imaging method that has previously been successful at reporting variations in tissue protein and zzso contents and zzso We have implemented zzso zzso transfer zzso a specific form of chemical exchange zzso transfer imaging, at high field (7 zzso and used it to study healthy human subjects and patients with multiple zzso The effects of zzso field zzso were zzso using a water zzso shift zzso method to center each zzso on a zzso zzso zzso to results obtained at lower fields, zzso imaging at 7 T revealed significant contrast between white and gray matters, with a higher zzso signal apparent within the white zzso zzso studies of multiple sclerosis showed that the zzso asymmetry varied with the type of zzso zzso An increase in zzso asymmetry relative to healthy tissue was found in some zzso These results indicate the potential utility of zzso at high field as a zzso zzso of white matter pathology, providing complementary information to other zzso methods in current clinical zzso
