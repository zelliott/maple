In this study, we investigated the zzso value of zzso contrast enhancement zzso at the time of zzso diagnosis specifically in a selected population of WHO grade II zzso We reviewed zzso zzso proven WHO grade II zzso for which zzso MR images were available at the time of zzso zzso zzso patterns were classified into three zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso progression over time was recorded before zzso treatment on successive MR images, when zzso zzso was present in 143 cases zzso with 93 zzso and zzso 50 zzso and no zzso zzso zzso areas were time progressive before zzso treatment in 35 of the 56 available cases zzso Regardless of its pattern, the presence of zzso was not significantly associated with a worsened prognosis zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Only the zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the available zzso proved to be statistically associated with survival since first zzso zzso The present results show the necessity, in cases of WHO grade II zzso to study zzso at the time of zzso diagnosis and, whenever possible, to follow its progression over time before zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are associated with a worsened zzso both suggesting zzso zzso even though zzso examination cannot initially disclose signs of zzso in those zzso
