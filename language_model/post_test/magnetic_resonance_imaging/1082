zzso resonance imaging zzso was tested for evaluation of the soft tissue structures of the zzso zzso in 16 zzso derived from three adult zzso horses and two newborn zzso zzso The following measuring sequences were used in zzso zzso and zzso zzso spin zzso zzso zzso inversion zzso The images were made with a zzso zzso zzso scanner in a zzso circular zzso To compare the zzso of the same tissue structures in adult and in newborn cases the limbs were zzso with the routinely used zzso sequences that are used for mature zzso In newborn zzso the zzso zzso could not be determined with the used zzso For both the adult and newborn limbs the most zzso of the same tissue structures including the fluid spaces and growth plates were taken by the inversion recovery zzso zzso sequence was very zzso in adult cases but moderately in newborn zzso
