Childhood adversity increases the risk of zzso but the zzso mechanisms underlying this vulnerability are not zzso In animal models, early adversity is associated with dysfunction in zzso zzso regions involved in reward processing, but this relationship has not been established in zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine zzso zzso responses to: 1) cues signaling possible monetary rewards and zzso and 2) delivery of monetary gains and penalties, in 13 young adults who experienced zzso before age 14 years and 31 zzso control zzso 

Relative to control subjects, individuals exposed to childhood adversity reported elevated symptoms of zzso and depression, rated reward cues less zzso and displayed a weaker response to reward cues in the left zzso zzso There were no group differences in right zzso zzso zzso response to reward cues or in zzso zzso response to loss cues, zzso cues, gains, or zzso 

zzso indicate that childhood adversity in humans is associated with blunted zzso responses to zzso cues as well as dysfunction in left zzso zzso regions implicated in zzso learning and zzso This dysfunction might serve as a zzso that contributes to the multiple negative outcomes and zzso associated with childhood zzso The findings suggest that interventions that target motivation and zzso action might be useful for reducing the negative consequences of childhood zzso
