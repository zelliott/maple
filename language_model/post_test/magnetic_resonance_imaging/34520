To evaluate the feasibility of magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging in the human lung to help detect zzso defects zzso to suspected pulmonary zzso 

Seven patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism first underwent zzso lung zzso followed by MR zzso imaging with rapid acquisition of two sets of dynamic images in the zzso and zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso per zzso of body weight zzso zzso or zzso was zzso Single images obtained in each section that showed peak signal intensity from the first passage of contrast material were evaluated zzso An analysis of change in signal intensity over time was performed both on a zzso basis and in selected regions of zzso 

In the seven patients, a total of 18 regions of lung tissue with zzso defects were shown on the zzso zzso In 16 of these regions, MR zzso images showed a reduced peak signal intensity during first passage of the contrast zzso zzso defects could be detected in both the zzso and the zzso planes on MR zzso zzso 

MR zzso imaging was feasible for detection of zzso defects zzso to a pulmonary zzso
