zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sterling zzso is a magnetic zzso zzso contrast agent which contains 500 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso sodium zzso A study was conducted to evaluate clearance of drug in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso divided into three groups of six animals each, were administered zzso zzso zzso at dose levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The concentration of zzso in serum was determined in a monkey zzso acid zzso by zzso plasma atomic zzso zzso zzso The zzso method was demonstrated to be valid for sensitivity, precision, zzso and zzso The dynamic range was linear from 0 to 50 zzso zzso and the limit of zzso was 24 zzso zzso The measured zzso concentration in monkey serum ranged from 0 to 339 zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dose group, from 0 to zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and from 0 to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso dose zzso zzso was not detected after zzso zzso in any of the serum samples from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso dose groups after the administration of zzso zzso All the monkeys in the zzso zzso zzso dose group, with one exception, required zzso zzso for clearance of the drug from the zzso The drug was completely cleared from serum in all monkeys within 24 zzso
