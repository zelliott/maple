To describe the clinical and zzso features and zzso mapping of a novel zzso dominant disease affecting the zzso zzso 

The authors characterized a large family with zzso dominant zzso zzso disease zzso clinically and by zzso MR zzso zzso and zzso The authors performed a whole zzso genetic linkage scan to map the underlying genetic zzso 

The main clinical features of the disease are zzso and gait zzso without any apparent reduction in life zzso zzso demonstrated a distinctive zzso pattern restricted mainly to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso linkage analysis localized the zzso genetic zzso to a zzso zzso candidate region on zzso zzso 

zzso is an zzso dominant zzso zzso disease mapping to zzso zzso
