To evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in diagnosing structural injury in zzso women at risk for pelvic floor zzso 

This was an zzso study of 77 women who underwent zzso zzso after zzso Women were zzso defined as high risk zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso muscle tears zzso factors: second-stage labor zzso 150 zzso or zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maternal age zzso 35 years and birth weight zzso zzso zzso or low risk zzso zzso zzso zzso delivered without these risk factors zzso zzso zzso delivered by zzso section after second-stage labor zzso 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso or delivered by zzso section without labor zzso zzso zzso All women were zzso using zzso zzso zzso Two musculoskeletal zzso reviewed images for bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso showed zzso bone fractures in 38% of women at high risk for pelvic floor injury and in zzso of women at low risk for pelvic floor injury zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle tears were present in zzso of the high-risk women and in zzso of the low-risk women zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Bone zzso zzso in the zzso bones was present in zzso of women studied across delivery zzso Complex patterns of injury included combinations of bone zzso zzso fractures, zzso zzso tears and zzso zzso zzso No zzso injuries were present in zzso of women at high risk and zzso at low risk for pelvic floor injury zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso identifying zzso women at risk for pelvic floor injury can predict increased risk of bone and soft tissue changes at the zzso zzso zzso zzso has utility for differential diagnosis of structural injury in zzso zzso
