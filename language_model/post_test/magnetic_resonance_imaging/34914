The authors evaluate the feasibility of performing magnetic resonance zzso procedures on a zzso zzso system combined with conventional zzso zzso 

A zzso MR imaging system was combined with a conventional zzso zzso unit in one zzso The two systems were connected via a floating table zzso Twenty-six zzso procedures zzso zzso zzso alcohol injection, laser zzso fluid zzso and breast zzso were performed in 22 patients under zzso zzso control, or zzso For MR guidance, fast zzso echo sequences were used, initiated from a panel at the front of the zzso Images were displayed on an liquid crystal display screen positioned on the zzso 

All zzso procedures were performed successfully without zzso The addition of zzso zzso was useful for bone interventions and zzso All diagnostic zzso yielded sufficient amounts of tissue for zzso zzso In breast zzso the target identified on dynamic MR imaging was marked correctly in each zzso In zzso laser zzso the laser effect could be zzso and in zzso ethanol injection the distribution of the alcohol could be zzso Both imaging systems worked without image zzso and high-quality MR images were zzso 

The combination of a zzso MR zzso with a zzso zzso system seems to be a promising technical solution for performing zzso MR zzso
