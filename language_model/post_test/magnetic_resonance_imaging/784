The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of complex zzso flow zzso with the currently available zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso 

A zzso realistic in zzso aneurysm model, in which detailed flow zzso analysis had already been conducted using laser zzso zzso was used for this in zzso zzso zzso so that the results of zzso zzso zzso could be compared with the previous reliable zzso On a zzso unit, three zzso components of zzso were obtained using a standard two-dimensional fast zzso shot flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow structures recorded during one cardiac cycle were depicted in one zzso and three zzso zzso planes with the aid of gray scale zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maps and secondary flow zzso were also created based on the zzso zzso maps by using zzso zzso The zzso contours in those three zzso sections could demonstrate the shapes of inward and outward flow areas and their zzso over one cardiac zzso The secondary flow zzso demonstrated twin zzso within the outward flow area adjacent to the boundary layer of inward and outward flow in all zzso zzso 

The zzso MR imaging method was able to depict the complex zzso zzso flow structures in the in zzso aneurysm zzso zzso zzso zzso flow information will be zzso in zzso after improvements are made in spatial resolution, which is expected in the near zzso The capability to zzso zzso flow structures directly with the use of zzso MR imaging technology will have a positive impact on future clinical zzso
