zzso following zzso zzso artery bypass zzso is difficult to predict and leads to increased zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso magnetic zzso findings would predict resource zzso in zzso zzso Over a 12-month period, patients requiring zzso zzso were invited to undergo zzso 1 day prior to zzso zzso zzso was performed using a zzso inversion recovery sequence on a zzso zzso scanner zzso zzso Clinical data were collected zzso Admission costs were zzso based on standardized actual zzso Admission cost greater than the median was defined as zzso Of zzso zzso zzso cases, 45 zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso characteristics zzso zzso age, 64 zzso years, mortality zzso and median zzso zzso admission zzso 7 zzso zzso were similar in patients who did or did not undergo zzso In the patients undergoing zzso eight zzso and 11 zzso patients had reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso function by zzso zzso zzso ejection zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso was detected in 17 zzso zzso The average zzso was zzso The median zzso zzso admission cost was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted increased admission zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tended to predict actual admission cost zzso but zzso by zzso zzso and zzso function by zzso zzso did zzso In conclusion, in this exploratory investigation, zzso zzso findings predicted admission duration and increased admission cost in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in risk zzso in zzso zzso surgery merits prospective zzso
