Although physical therapy is known to be effective in treating zzso pain zzso there is considerable individual variation in the treatment zzso It is unclear why some patients benefit from a specific treatment while others do not experience zzso This study, using a prospective study design, aims to identify factors that could predict the short-term functional outcome and account for the variation frequently seen in the outcome after conservative treatment of zzso 

zzso patients (20 female and 16 male with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso zzso followed a physical therapy rehabilitation program of 7 zzso Before this treatment, all patients were evaluated on zzso symptoms zzso on visual analog scales in zzso and functional performance zzso test expressed as highest level, zzso hop test in zzso and zzso test in zzso The concentric and eccentric knee zzso strength at zzso and zzso zzso were measured as well as the zzso muscle size by calculating the zzso area zzso with magnetic resonance zzso The success of the treatment was evaluated by the functional zzso anterior knee pain zzso A linear zzso model was used to identify zzso factors for the functional zzso 

The total zzso zzso area zzso zzso zzso the eccentric average peak zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and the frequency of pain at baseline zzso zzso zzso have been indicated as zzso variables in the short-term functional outcome after a physical therapy rehabilitation program for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with a greater zzso muscle size, lower eccentric knee strength, and less pain have a better short-term functional outcome after conservative treatment for zzso
