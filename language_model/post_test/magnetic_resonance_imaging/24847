The high prevalence of zzso cancer and its recurrence make it an important target for zzso About half of invasive zzso tumors have zzso in zzso We determined the zzso efficacy of a zzso agent, zzso in a transgenic zzso mouse model of zzso transitional cell zzso zzso that strongly resembles human zzso After zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso were fed control zzso or experimental diets containing 150 or 300 zzso of zzso for 34 zzso zzso of zzso cancer growth was monitored by magnetic resonance zzso At 40 weeks of age, all mice were killed; urinary zzso were collected to determine zzso tumor zzso and zzso There was a significant increase in zzso weights of transgenic versus zzso mice zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso female: zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso A significant decrease in the zzso tumor weights (by zzso P zzso zzso in males and by zzso P zzso zzso in zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in transgenic mice fed control zzso Both male and female mice exposed to zzso showed zzso of invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso completely blocked invasion in female zzso zzso analysis of the zzso tumors showed an increase in zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a decrease in vascular zzso growth factor in transgenic mice fed zzso These results suggest that zzso agents can serve as potential zzso agents for zzso zzso
