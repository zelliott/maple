A zzso of corpus zzso zzso is a rare injury of the erect zzso The present study describes the role of zzso for diagnosis and follow-up of this zzso Four patients with clinically suspected acute penile fractures underwent zzso Imaging findings were confirmed at zzso In three patients, follow-up zzso was also available at 1, 6 and 16 weeks after surgical zzso In all patients zzso zzso images zzso clearly disclosed zzso of zzso which depicted as zzso of low signal intensity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso were well zzso both on zzso zzso and zzso images, whereas zzso in zzso were zzso demonstrated on zzso zzso On follow-up zzso all fractures presented similar healing zzso Shortly after the repair, the zzso zzso showed an increase in signal intensity on zzso zzso and was strongly enhanced with the administration of contrast zzso Then the tear site gradually recovered low signal intensity on all zzso sequences by 4 months after zzso These serial findings may suggest the formation of zzso zzso tissue during zzso zzso resonance imaging is of great value for the diagnosis and follow-up in patients with penile zzso
