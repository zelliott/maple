As yet, human zzso zzso studies have not taken advantage of direct magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso zzso in individual zzso In the present study, zzso weighted imaging zzso was used to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in patients with chronic focal zzso Fifteen patients with zzso zzso either due to stroke or tumor surgery underwent zzso imaging using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were seen as zzso in all zzso Three of the patients underwent additional zzso imaging at zzso and zzso Compared to zzso zzso of the zzso wall was seen with greater precision and the zzso zzso part was seen more zzso zzso mapping was performed based on the zzso MR zzso Patients were divided into two groups with and without upper limb zzso A zzso zzso technique was used which had initially been developed by zzso et zzso zzso for functional zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Compared to conventional zzso of the zzso overlap of zzso zzso improved and lead to increased sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the more zzso and zzso parts of the zzso zzso were related to upper limb zzso zzso were in good accordance with the zzso hand area shown in recent zzso zzso These data provide evidence that direct identification of zzso zzso together with the zzso zzso technique allows for improved zzso mapping at the level of the zzso zzso already at conventional zzso zzso field zzso
