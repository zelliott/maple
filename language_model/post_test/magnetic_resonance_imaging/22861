zzso resonance imaging zzso is the imaging zzso of choice for brain tumors and other zzso of the central nervous zzso However, this procedure is zzso in patients with zzso metallic foreign zzso In such cases, the usual clinical strategy is to manage the patient without the benefit of zzso scans and, instead, to rely on less sensitive imaging zzso in particular zzso zzso zzso 

Two patients, one with a zzso zzso mass and one with suspected central nervous system lymphoma, were seen at our zzso zzso scanning was recommended, but had been precluded in both patients by the presence of metal fragments in the zzso 

In each case, the zzso foreign body was successfully localized and zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning confirmed complete zzso zzso scanning was then performed without zzso The first patient underwent zzso zzso zzso and removal of the zzso which proved to be a zzso The second patient was found to have evidence of zzso in the zzso base and zzso and was treated with zzso and systemic and zzso zzso zzso scanning provided superior diagnostic information and spared both patients the risks and discomfort of zzso and exposure to zzso radiation from multiple computerized zzso zzso 

Two patients with central nervous system tumors underwent removal of a metal zzso in the orbit for the specific purpose of zzso zzso zzso This is a practical, straightforward concept, which should be considered when zzso scanning is needed for optimal patient zzso
