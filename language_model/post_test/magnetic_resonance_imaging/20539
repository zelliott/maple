zzso zzso are potent zzso drugs that have revolutionized the treatment of zzso arthritis zzso Delayed zzso zzso of cartilage zzso is a zzso method to study cartilage quality, in particular the zzso zzso zzso 

To evaluate knee cartilage quality before and after treatment with a zzso inhibitor zzso in patients with zzso using zzso and to study clinical parameters and serum cartilage zzso protein zzso after the same zzso 

Seven patients with chronic zzso received infusions of 3 zzso zzso at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and zzso Clinical examination, serum zzso level, and zzso scans zzso zzso were performed at baseline and after 7 zzso The zzso index zzso reflecting cartilage zzso content, was calculated using an inversion recovery sequence in the zzso zzso zzso Seven years after treatment, charts were reviewed regarding joint replacement surgery zzso 

Clinical parameters showed an improvement for all patients after the zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso decreased from zzso to zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso index was lower at follow-up than at zzso zzso and zzso zzso mean zzso zzso respectively zzso indicating loss of zzso The two patients with the lowest zzso index had received a zzso 7 years after zzso 

This zzso study indicates a substantial zzso loss from the knee cartilage zzso in patients with chronic zzso Treatment with zzso does not seem to protect the cartilage from further deterioration despite improvements in clinical parameters and decreased serum zzso
