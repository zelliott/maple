The purpose of this study was to clarify the change in the zzso area zzso of a zzso zzso graft after anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso and its relationship with zzso knee zzso Forty patients zzso men and 15 zzso were included in this zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed with an zzso zzso while a magnetic resonance imaging zzso evaluation was zzso for the assessment zzso For zzso zzso the average zzso of a zzso wide zzso zzso graft was zzso zzso zzso zzso while the average zzso measured at follow-up zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso showing a significant mean increase ratio of zzso This value corresponded to zzso of the native zzso The average zzso measured in 30 patients at 6 months was zzso zzso almost equal to the value at the final follow-up zzso zzso in the same patient zzso Among potentially influential factors, zzso notch zzso (available space for the zzso zzso had significant correlation with the zzso of the graft at zzso Finally, both zzso and zzso zzso values did not correlate with zzso knee zzso indicating that a bigger graft does not guarantee a better zzso
