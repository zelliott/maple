zzso recognition can be based on recollection of contextual details, on a sense of recent encounter, or some combination of the zzso According to several cognitive models, selectively attending to these distinct aspects of memory may require different retrieval zzso and result in different neural responses depending upon whether or not retrieval is zzso Using zzso zzso we examined retrieval orientation by having subjects discriminate between two test words in one of two zzso During source recollection, they selected the member of the pair previously associated with a particular zzso zzso In contrast, zzso judgment required selection of the most recently encountered item of the pair, regardless of how it had been zzso Furthermore, successful and unsuccessful trials within each retrieval task were contrasted to determine whether retrieval success effects occurred in overlapping or dissimilar neural populations compared to those associated with each retrieval zzso The results revealed distinct lateral prefrontal and zzso zzso that distinguished attempted source recollection from judgments of relative zzso these orientation effects were largely independent of retrieval zzso In contrast, zzso zzso lobe structures zzso and zzso zzso were zzso more active during successful recollection of zzso context, showing similar reduced responses during failed source recollection and judgments of zzso These results indicate that different memory zzso recruit distinct prefrontal and zzso networks and that the recovery of episodic context is associated with the zzso and surrounding zzso zzso zzso
