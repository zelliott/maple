zzso phantom perceptions are associated with zzso of the central auditory zzso zzso guided repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso of the area of increased activity was demonstrated to reduce zzso zzso The study aimed at developing an easy zzso standard procedure for zzso magnetic stimulation of the primary auditory zzso and to investigate this zzso positioning strategy for the treatment of chronic zzso in clinical zzso The left zzso of zzso was targeted in 25 healthy subjects using a zzso zzso zzso Based on individual scalp coordinates of the zzso a positioning strategy with reference to the zzso system was zzso Using this zzso positioning approach we started an open treatment zzso 28 patients with chronic zzso received 10 sessions of zzso zzso zzso of motor zzso 1 zzso 2000 zzso Being within a range of about 20 zzso diameter, the scalp coordinates for stimulating the primary auditory zzso allowed to determine a standard procedure for zzso zzso Clinical validation of this zzso positioning method resulted in a significant improvement of zzso complaints zzso The newly developed zzso positioning strategy may have the potential to offer a more zzso stimulation approach for treating chronic zzso as compared with highly zzso imaging guided treatment zzso
