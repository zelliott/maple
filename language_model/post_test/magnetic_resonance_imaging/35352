The diagnosis of zzso elbow fracture in children is often challenging due to zzso or negative repeated zzso zzso 

To evaluate the potential diagnostic role of US in children who have sustained elbow trauma with an elbow joint zzso but no fracture seen on initial zzso 

The study included 14 consecutive children (age range zzso zzso with elbow trauma whose elbow zzso showed an zzso without fracture who underwent emergency imaging zzso the first 72 zzso with US and zzso The aim of US was to demonstrate a zzso in relation to a cortical zzso MR imaging was used as the reference to differentiate fracture from bone or muscle zzso 

In seven children US demonstrated a zzso and zzso demonstrated a cortical fracture in all these zzso zzso among the seven children with simple zzso seen on zzso zzso did not identify a cortical fracture in six and demonstrated a cortical fracture in zzso 

zzso elbow joint zzso in children is not always related to a cortical zzso US appears to be a reliable, accurate, widely available and effective low-cost tool in these zzso The diagnostic clue is the detection of a zzso in the zzso zzso
