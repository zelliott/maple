Complex visual scenes require that a target for an impending zzso eye movement be selected from a number of possible zzso We investigated whether changing the number of stimuli from which a target would be identified altered the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and how such changes might contribute to changes we observed previously in the superior zzso zzso One, two, four, or eight visual stimuli appeared on random trials while monkeys fixated a centrally located zzso After a zzso one of the stimuli in the array changed zzso indicating that it was the zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso that had a pause in zzso activity after target onset and when the zzso was made to the target showed a zzso of activity during the zzso zzso Because the number of stimuli in the array increased from one to eight, the initial pause after the onset of the visual stimulus zzso zzso during the zzso delay was reduced but was independent of the number of possible targets zzso When one of the stimuli was identified as the zzso target, but before the zzso was made, we found a sharp decline in zzso This decline was related to the monkey's selecting the target rather than the zzso change identifying the target, because on error trials, when the zzso changed but a zzso was not made to the target, the activity did not zzso The decline for the preferred target location was also accompanied by a lesser decline for adjacent zzso Our findings indicate that zzso activity changes with target selection as it does with zzso initiation and that the zzso could make substantial, direct contributions to the SC at both zzso The pause in zzso activity with target selection is consistent with the hypothesis that zzso provide a zzso for the selection of desired zzso
