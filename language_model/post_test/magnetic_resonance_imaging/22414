A zzso zzso zzso the anatomy of cardiac structure, and a zzso relationship is needed to determine if the zzso zzso band model defines this spatial zzso This report explores how studies of zzso phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging zzso for zzso motion and fiber tracking zzso that imply fiber zzso can zzso zzso regional zzso wall motion of the entire heart, zzso determine if these motion of implied fiber orientation link with the zzso heart model, and zzso reveal if this new knowledge zzso with imaging information from other different imaging zzso 

zzso left zzso motion patterns that accurately differentiate zzso zzso contraction and zzso zzso zzso twisting and zzso and zzso zzso lengthening and zzso motion components are correlated with zzso data achieved by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso fiber tracking to determine fiber orientation and cardiac motion during the ejection and rapid filling zzso of the cardiac cycle corresponded to zzso force displayed by zzso zzso placed into the zzso of the presumed functional units of the descending and ascending segments of the zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso band, and motion by zzso zzso These integrated findings imply a zzso interaction of zzso with the zzso orientation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These composite findings indicate that phase contrast zzso techniques for high zzso resolution zzso mapping during cardiac motion and zzso fiber tracking confirm other technologies, and centralize the capacity of zzso to link other imaging methods together relative to a single zzso structural zzso The close agreement amongst a spectrum of imaging studies provide a very powerful integration that transcends a single zzso the same thing is observed by each component of global technology, thereby zzso that the zzso zzso band is the structural basis for these functional zzso
