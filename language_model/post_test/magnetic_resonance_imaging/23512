zzso tears have been linked to knee zzso zzso presumably by impaired load zzso How zzso tears affect zzso is zzso zzso examination may help to zzso whether the impact is zzso This study examined the association between a tear within a specific zzso segment and subsequent zzso cartilage loss in zzso that the torn segment zzso 

Participants with knee zzso underwent bilateral knee zzso at baseline and 2 zzso Mean cartilage thickness within each zzso was zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso equations were used to zzso the relationship between baseline zzso tear in each segment and baseline to zzso cartilage loss in each zzso adjusting for age, zzso body mass index, tear in the other two segments and zzso 

261 knees were studied in 159 zzso zzso zzso body tear was associated with cartilage loss in external zzso and in central and anterior zzso zzso and zzso horn tear specifically with zzso zzso zzso zzso these relationships were independent of tears in the other segments and persisted in zzso zzso after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso body and zzso horn tear were also associated with cartilage loss in underlying zzso but not after adjustment for zzso zzso loss in the internal zzso not covered by the zzso was not associated with zzso tear in any zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso effect of zzso tears is not zzso uniform across the zzso and zzso cartilage surfaces and that some of the effect is experienced zzso
