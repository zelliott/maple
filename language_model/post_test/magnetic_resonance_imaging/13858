The detection of zzso zzso zzso is an important step in tumor staging and is significant for therapy zzso zzso zzso contrast agents can raise the sensitivity and specificity of modern diagnostic zzso This study investigated the suitability of the zzso contrast agent zzso in magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso imaging and compared three different zzso in such an zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso body weight were zzso injected into the hind legs of dogs; the signal zzso of two successive zzso zzso groups zzso and zzso were then recorded up to 120 minutes after zzso 

zzso induced a strong increase in signal intensity of the examined zzso zzso zzso At 15 minutes zzso the enhancement increased by zzso to zzso depending on the zzso The maximum enhancement was zzso to zzso at 60 to 90 minutes zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed comparable results; even the lowest dose zzso zzso zzso enhanced the contrast of the zzso zzso zzso in 4 of 5 animals and the zzso zzso zzso in three of five zzso zzso the minimum effective dose of zzso in this study was approximately zzso zzso zzso 

This study revealed the excellent suitability of the zzso contrast agent zzso for MR imaging of the zzso system zzso zzso and zzso zzso
