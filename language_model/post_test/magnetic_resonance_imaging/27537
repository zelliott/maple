We performed a zzso task to investigate the neural zzso of zzso visual working memory with zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 young subjects zzso age: zzso years; zzso zzso were instructed to study a list of either 1, 2 or 3 zzso nonsense line drawings for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso the screen went blank for zzso zzso zzso or zzso and then displayed a probe stimulus for zzso in which subjects indicated with a differential button press whether the probe was contained in the studied zzso or not zzso zzso or zzso zzso Trend zzso zzso Analysis zzso et zzso zzso was performed to identify spatial zzso patterns that showed a zzso increase in expression with memory load during all task zzso Reliable zzso patterns were identified in the stimulus and retention phase zzso while no significant pattern could be discerned during the probe zzso zzso zzso patterns that were obtained from an earlier version of this task zzso et zzso zzso using 1, 3, or 6 letters zzso zzso were also zzso applied to their corresponding task zzso in the current zzso task zzso Interestingly, subject expression of zzso patterns from both verbal and zzso retention zzso correlated positively in the zzso task for all memory loads zzso Both patterns also involved similar zzso brain regions that were increasing in activity with memory load, and zzso and zzso regions that were zzso Mean subject expression of both patterns across memory load during retention also correlated positively with recognition accuracy zzso in the Shape task zzso These findings point to similarities in the neural zzso of verbal and zzso rehearsal zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, are critically dependent on the zzso material, and seem to zzso zzso neural zzso
