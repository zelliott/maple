The mechanisms of action underlying zzso including acupuncture point zzso are not well zzso In the previous decade, an increasing number of studies have applied zzso to investigate brain response to acupuncture zzso Our aim was to provide a systematic overview of acupuncture zzso research considering the following aspects: 1) differences between zzso and sham zzso 2) differences due to various methods of acupuncture zzso 3) differences between patients and healthy volunteers, 4) differences between different acupuncture zzso 

We systematically searched English, Chinese, Korean and Japanese databases for literature published from the earliest available up until September 2009, without any language zzso We included all studies using zzso to investigate the effect of acupuncture on the human brain (at least one group that received zzso zzso zzso papers were identified, 149 met the inclusion criteria for the descriptive analysis, and 34 were eligible for the zzso From a descriptive perspective, multiple studies reported that acupuncture zzso activity within specific brain areas, including zzso zzso zzso system, zzso zzso brain zzso and zzso zzso for zzso acupuncture stimuli confirmed brain activity within many of the regions mentioned zzso zzso between zzso and sham acupuncture were noted in brain response in middle cingulate, while some zzso was noted for other regions depending on how such zzso were performed, such as zzso zzso zzso regions, and zzso 

Brain response to acupuncture stimuli encompasses a broad network of regions consistent with not just zzso but also affective and cognitive zzso While the results were heterogeneous, from a descriptive perspective most studies suggest that acupuncture can zzso the activity within specific brain areas, and the evidence based on zzso confirmed some of these zzso More high quality studies with more transparent methodology are needed to improve the consistency amongst different zzso
