zzso resonance imaging of the brain has been of limited usefulness in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso on zzso images have been zzso but these are neither highly sensitive nor zzso 

To determine whether zzso magnetic resonance images might be useful in the evaluation of zzso zzso 

A zzso woman with rapidly progressive zzso was referred for zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso images were obtained as part of the zzso Brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of zzso disease zzso 

The zzso magnetic resonance brain images demonstrated zzso symmetrical marked increase in signal intensity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and right inferior frontal zzso The apparent diffusion zzso map showed zzso low diffusion in these regions (as low as zzso of normal in the zzso zzso This suggests that there is restricted diffusion in these zzso The zzso images demonstrated slightly increased signal zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso These findings indicate that diffusion magnetic resonance imaging might be a sensitive means of imaging the abnormalities seen in zzso zzso
