The failure of the zzso zzso of a totally zzso artificial heart zzso was due mainly to zzso zzso in the zzso of the conventional zzso zzso To overcome this zzso zzso a custom design and fabrication process was designed using the rapid zzso zzso zzso After three zzso reconstruction of magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso cavity and vascular remnants of the recipient, study of zzso fit was done using the reconstructed zzso model and three zzso computer aided design zzso zzso The direction of the inflow and zzso zzso of the blood zzso was changed with a zzso zzso The zzso model of the designed chamber was zzso and examined for zzso zzso Through this approach, the minute directional mismatch of the inflow and zzso zzso was zzso Thus, a new custom designed moving zzso Korean zzso with zzso and zzso techniques was zzso
