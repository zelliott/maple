zzso heart defects zzso are the most prevalent zzso disease, with zzso of deaths resulting from a zzso zzso due to a cardiac zzso zzso significant zzso permit survival upon birth, but may become immediately life zzso Advances in surgical intervention have significantly reduced zzso zzso but the outcome for many zzso is zzso Furthermore, patients living while tolerating a zzso often acquire additional complications due to the long-term systemic blood flow changes caused by even subtle anatomical zzso zzso diagnosis of defects during fetal development is critical for zzso planning and improving patient zzso Advances in zzso zzso imaging are necessary to uncover the basic scientific and clinically relevant zzso changes and associated zzso consequences influencing normal and abnormal heart zzso zzso is the most widely used clinical imaging technology for assessing fetal cardiac zzso zzso fetal assessment zzso include motion mode zzso two zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso can be combined with zzso fluid dynamics analysis to yield zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additional imaging zzso however, are available to study basic mechanisms of zzso including optical zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso Each imaging technology has its advantages and disadvantages regarding resolution, depth of zzso soft tissue contrast considerations, and zzso In this review, we analyze the current clinical and scientific imaging technologies, research studies utilizing them, and appropriate animal models reflecting clinically relevant zzso and cardiac zzso We conclude with discussing the zzso impact and future opportunities for cardiovascular development imaging zzso
