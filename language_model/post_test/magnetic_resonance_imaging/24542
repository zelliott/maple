zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have shown dysfunction in key areas associated with the zzso circuit in patients with zzso This study examined the functional connectivity involving the zzso zzso during a spatial zzso task in 18 zzso patients with schizophrenia and 38 healthy zzso zzso connectivity was analyzed by assigning seed regions (in the zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso anterior nucleus zzso the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso areas 9 and zzso and the zzso and zzso their respective activity with that in the zzso regions zzso zzso connectivity analysis demonstrated that functional connectivity was significantly impaired in patients, zzso between the right zzso and regions such as the prefrontal and zzso zzso and the zzso On the other hand, enhanced functional connectivity was found in patients, zzso between the AN and regions such as the prefrontal and zzso zzso In addition, the patients had significantly lower task performance and less (but zzso brain zzso than those of zzso These results revealed disturbed functional integration in zzso and suggested that the functional connectivity abnormalities in the zzso circuitry, especially the zzso circuitry, may zzso the attention deficits in schizophrenia zzso Further, this study suggested that functional connectivity analysis might be more sensitive than brain zzso analysis in detecting the functional abnormalities in zzso
