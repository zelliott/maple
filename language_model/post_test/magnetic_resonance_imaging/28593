The early clinical experience with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Echo sequence with fat suppression in the evaluation of breast masses is zzso Ten female patients with breast zzso were zzso evaluated with this sequence and the results compared with the pathological zzso The scanning protocol included a zzso sequence followed by an immediate zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso after intravenous contrast zzso and a delayed zzso Images were assessed for maximum zzso and zzso enhancement, zzso size and additional enhancing zzso In six patients, zzso masses enhanced zzso on the immediate zzso sequence with zzso enhancing zzso on delayed zzso In three cases, there was preferential enhancement of zzso zzso over normal zzso but to a similar degree on both zzso zzso In one case, both the zzso and zzso enhanced zzso on the delayed zzso zzso resonance assessed zzso size accurately and also detected satellite zzso in one zzso However, zzso grade, associated in zzso zzso and zzso invasion did not impact on zzso zzso In this small series, a zzso zzso 3-D zzso Echo zzso detected breast zzso with high zzso The technique holds promise but further evaluation is zzso
