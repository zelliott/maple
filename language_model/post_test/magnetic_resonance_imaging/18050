zzso features derived from the cortical surface provide important information in detecting changes related to the progression of Alzheimer's disease zzso Recent widespread adoption of zzso has allowed researchers to study zzso data in zzso We adopted cortical thickness and zzso depth, zzso by three-dimensional zzso from magnetic resonance imaging as the surface zzso The cortical feature is zzso and it is difficult to use directly with a zzso because of the zzso sample zzso zzso We applied zzso learning to reduce the zzso of the feature and then tested the usage of the zzso reduced feature with a support zzso machine zzso Principal component analysis zzso was chosen as the method of zzso zzso zzso was applied to a region of interest within the cortical zzso We used 30 normal, 30 mild cognitive impairment zzso and 12 conversion cases taken from the zzso zzso The zzso was trained using the cortical features extracted from normal and zzso zzso The zzso was tested for the 12 conversion patients only using the imaging data before the actual zzso The conversion was predicted early with an accuracy of zzso
