We investigated the degree to which the distributed and overlapping patterns of activity for working memory zzso maintenance of objects and spatial locations are functionally zzso Previous studies of the neural system responsible for maintenance of different types of information in zzso have reported seemingly contradictory results concerning the degree to which spatial and zzso information maintenance leads to distinct patterns of zzso in prefrontal zzso These inconsistent results may be partly attributable to the fact that different types of objects were used for the zzso zzso zzso across zzso In the current study, we directly compared the patterns of response during zzso tasks for face identity, house identity, and spatial location using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Furthermore, independence of the neural resources available for spatial and object zzso was tested zzso using a zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that the mechanisms for the maintenance of house identity information are distributed and overlapping with those that maintain spatial location information, while the mechanisms for maintenance of face identity information are relatively more zzso There is, however, a consistent functional topography that results in superior prefrontal zzso producing the greatest response during spatial zzso tasks, and middle and inferior prefrontal zzso producing their greatest responses during object zzso tasks, independent of the object zzso These results argue for a zzso functional organization for spatial and zzso zzso However, objects may contain both spatial and zzso information and, thus, have a distributed but not zzso representation across both zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso
