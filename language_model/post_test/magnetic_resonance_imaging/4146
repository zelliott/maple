An experimental design for functional zzso zzso is presented whose conceptual units of analysis are behavioral trials, in contrast to blocks of zzso This type of design is referred to as a zzso zzso zzso zzso It is explained how zzso designs can afford the ability to: zzso zzso the presentation of behavioral trials and zzso zzso zzso zzso in uncontrolled behavioral measures to examine their functional zzso A particular type of zzso design that involves modeling zzso zzso responses with one or more shifted impulse response functions is zzso This design is capable of discriminating functional changes occurring during temporally separated behavioral zzso within zzso An example of such a design is implemented and its statistical zzso functional sensitivity, and functional specificity are zzso
