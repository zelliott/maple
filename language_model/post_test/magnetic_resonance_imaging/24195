A prospective zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso study of stroke patients zzso zzso zzso at five distinct time points was performed to evaluate zzso evolution and to assess whether zzso and zzso can accurately and zzso demonstrate the degree of zzso deficits within hours after stroke zzso Patients were scanned first within 7 hours of symptom onset and then subsequently at 3 to 6 hours, 24 to 36 hours, 5 to 7 days, and 30 days after the initial zzso zzso evolution was dynamic during the first month after zzso Most patients (18 of 19, zzso showed increased zzso volume over the first week and then decreased at 1 month relative to 1 week (12 of 14, zzso Overall, zzso growth appeared to depend on the degree of mismatch between diffusion and zzso at the initial zzso zzso volumes on the acute zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlated well with initial National Institutes of Health zzso stroke scale scores, outcome zzso stroke scale scores, and final zzso zzso zzso and zzso can provide an early measure of zzso and zzso zzso and thus can improve our understanding of the evolution and outcome after acute zzso zzso
