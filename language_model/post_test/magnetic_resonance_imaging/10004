zzso hypersensitivity in irritable zzso syndrome zzso patients has been documented by evaluation of perceived zzso that can reflect abnormalities of both sensory zzso and cognitive zzso The presence of actual zzso in human beings has not been documented zzso Because subliminal zzso are free from the influence of zzso cognitive zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso cortical response to these stimuli can be considered a measure of activity of the neural zzso zzso The aim of this study was to compare zzso the cerebral cortical zzso activity response to equal subliminal zzso between zzso patients and zzso zzso 

We studied 10 zzso patients and 10 healthy controls using a computerized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity volume and percent maximum signal intensity change for equal subliminal zzso pressures were compared between controls and zzso 

Three levels of subliminal zzso pressures zzso 10, 15, and 20 zzso zzso were represented in both controls and patients and were analyzed for zzso zzso In all 3 zzso levels the zzso activity volume in zzso patients was significantly larger than zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso zzso The percent maximum signal intensity change was similar between zzso patients and zzso 

The volume of cerebral cortical activity response to equal subliminal zzso pressures in zzso patients is significantly larger than in controls, documenting the existence of hypersensitivity of the neural zzso in this patient group irrespective of zzso cognitive zzso
