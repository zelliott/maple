zzso pain often follows spinal zzso injury zzso 

To compare the effect of repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso applied over different motor zzso targets zzso vs leg zzso versus sham stimulation on zzso pain and local zzso changes in patients with zzso 

A total of 16 patients with complete or incomplete motor zzso and chronic zzso pain participated in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Three single sessions of sham or active zzso (10 zzso total of 2000 zzso were applied in random order over the hand or leg area with a minimal zzso zzso THE MAIN zzso zzso were the zzso rating scale for pain sensation and parameters derived from motor mapping of the first zzso zzso muscle, including zzso zzso of evoked response as well as map area, volume, and zzso 

zzso applied to either the hand or the leg area, but not sham zzso induced a significant but equivalent reduction in pain for the first 48 hours zzso zzso zzso zzso Participants with an incomplete zzso showed greater analgesia than those with a complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The main change observed for motor map zzso was an increase in zzso zzso after stimulation of the hand area zzso zzso zzso but not for the other zzso 

zzso applied over the hand or leg motor zzso decreased zzso pain regardless of any change in cortical zzso suggesting that the zzso effect is not associated with local changes at the motor zzso level zzso
