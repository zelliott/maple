A total of zzso children referred for severe to profound zzso between January 2002 and June zzso 

zzso of the following were zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso test, zzso 26 sequencing, genetic consultation, and zzso zzso 

zzso yield of each test was zzso 

Each diagnostic test or consultation was completed by at least zzso of patients for whom it was zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed abnormalities explaining zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed inner ear anomalies in zzso of zzso zzso zzso 26 zzso were found in zzso Renal ultrasound found anomalies in zzso of zzso zzso found zzso of patients with prolonged zzso zzso Fluorescent zzso zzso zzso test result was positive in zzso zzso consultation found a genetic cause for hearing loss in zzso zzso consultation found abnormalities associated with hearing loss in zzso 

zzso zzso imaging is the highest yielding test for evaluating children with zzso zzso 26 sequencing identifies a nearly zzso subset of children compared with zzso zzso zzso particularly from a clinical zzso can improve diagnostic zzso Other tests, although of lower diagnostic yield for zzso can identify important diseases that significantly affect patient zzso
