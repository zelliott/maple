zzso zzso of zzso stimuli is suggested to involve representations of summary statistics, including risk and expected value zzso A more complex, but ecologically more common, context is when multiple risky options are evaluated zzso However, it is unknown whether zzso related to option evaluation in these situations involves similar zzso Here we employed zzso during a task that zzso manipulated zzso and risk in two simultaneously presented zzso both of which contained either gains or zzso We found representations of zzso in zzso prefrontal zzso and anterior zzso an zzso that was dependent on which option was chosen zzso chosen and zzso zzso and whether the choice was over gains or zzso zzso activity reflected whether the riskier or surer option was selected, whilst activity in a network of regions that also included zzso zzso reflected both combined risk and difference in risk for the two zzso Our findings provide support for the idea that summary statistics zzso a representation of zzso zzso and further that these summary statistics undergo distinct forms of zzso
