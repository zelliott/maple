zzso therapy zzso has been developed recently to improve the use of the affected upper zzso after zzso zzso uses musical instruments, an electronic piano and an electronic drum set emitting piano sounds, to zzso fine and gross movements of the zzso upper zzso In this paper, we first describe the rationale underlying zzso and we review the previous studies conducted on acute and chronic stroke patients using this new zzso zzso Second, we address the neural mechanisms involved in the motor movement improvements observed in acute and chronic stroke zzso Third, we provide some recent studies on the involvement of zzso zzso in the zzso in chronic stroke patients using functional zzso Finally, these ideas are discussed and focused on understanding the dynamics involved in the neural circuit underlying zzso zzso and how functional connectivity could help to explain the zzso changes observed after therapy in stroke zzso
