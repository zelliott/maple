zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in seven healthy volunteers in order to analyze the zzso and zzso patterns of visual motion, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso areas by means of zzso during coherent visual motion zzso zzso signal decreases zzso were found in the first and second long insular zzso and zzso areas (the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the visual zzso zzso area in the zzso of both zzso extending into the zzso zzso zzso and zzso parts of the superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso at two separate sites zzso 4 and zzso Further zzso were found in zzso parts of the superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and the adjacent inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and corpus zzso Most of these zzso signal decreases involved parts of the zzso zzso cortical zzso These findings support the concept of a zzso zzso zzso interaction that has now been demonstrated not only for zzso visual motion stimulation that zzso zzso (without eye zzso but also for zzso induced eye movements (without zzso The functional significance of this concept may be related to the perception of zzso since both zzso visual motion stimulation and zzso zzso are linked to the visual control of zzso With respect to zzso of the cortical zzso motor system two separate and distinct areas of zzso were delineated in the zzso zzso of both zzso one zzso (in BA 9) and the other zzso at the junction of the superior frontal zzso with the zzso zzso (in BA zzso Both probably zzso to different zzso of the frontal eye field and the zzso zzso for the zzso motor performance of zzso
