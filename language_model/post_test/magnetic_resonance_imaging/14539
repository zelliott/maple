In zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso functional connectivity measures can be influenced by the presence of a strong global zzso A widely used zzso method for reducing the contribution of this component is global signal regression, in which a global mean time series signal is projected out of the zzso time series data prior to the zzso of connectivity zzso However, the use of global signal zzso is controversial because the method can bias the correlation values to have an approximately zero mean and may in some instances create zzso negative zzso In addition, while many studies treat the global signal as a zzso confound that needs to be removed, evidence from zzso and zzso measures in primates suggests that the global signal may contain significant neural zzso In this study, we used simultaneously acquired zzso and zzso zzso measures of zzso activity to assess the relation between the zzso global signal and zzso measures of vigilance in zzso We found that the zzso of the global signal zzso as the standard zzso of the global zzso exhibited a significant negative correlation with zzso vigilance across subjects studied in the zzso zzso In addition, increases in zzso vigilance due to the zzso of caffeine were significantly associated with both a decrease in global signal zzso and an increase in the average level of zzso between the default mode network and the zzso zzso
