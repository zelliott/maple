The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic ability of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso in the detection of zzso from zzso primary bone tumors compared with conventional zzso 

In 27 patients (6 zzso 21 Ewing's zzso 41 zzso examinations performed for diagnosis or exclusion of zzso disease were zzso Conventional imaging techniques consisted of magnetic resonance imaging of the primary tumor site, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bone zzso The reference methods were the zzso analysis and/or the clinical and imaging zzso 

In 25 examinations reference methods revealed 52 sites of zzso disease zzso zzso zzso 7; zzso zzso zzso zzso 22, pulmonary zzso zzso 13, soft tissue zzso zzso zzso On an zzso analysis zzso had a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso zzso values for conventional imaging were zzso zzso and zzso 

The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of zzso in the detection of zzso from zzso zzso are zzso On an zzso analysis, zzso had a not significantly lower sensitivity in comparison with conventional zzso However, zzso showed a small advantage in the detection of zzso and zzso zzso compared with conventional zzso
