zzso of liver volume using magnetic resonance zzso images has been described zzso We have, however, not found a gold standard study, which analyzes the effect of section thickness on the zzso of liver zzso In the present study, five normal zzso zzso were scanned in the horizontal plane using a zzso T MR machine zzso zzso zzso General zzso Wisconsin, zzso zzso sections at a thickness of 10, zzso 5 and zzso zzso were used to estimate the total volume of the zzso by means of the zzso zzso The point counting and zzso were used for the volume zzso With a view to evaluating the accuracy of two techniques, all the zzso were done by the same zzso The estimated volumes zzso with the actual volume of the zzso obtained by the fluid displacement technique zzso zzso zzso However, the section thickness has an zzso or zzso effect on the estimated zzso The obtained volume zzso results were analyzed to reveal the zzso principles of the estimates based on the section zzso The most suitable section thickness for the liver volume zzso was assessed to be 4-5 zzso There were no significant differences between the zzso results of two methods zzso zzso zzso The zzso technique did, however, take less time than zzso for zzso liver volume from MR zzso zzso also showed that the effect of section thickness on volume estimates using the two approaches could not be omitted and the values obtained could be zzso using the proposed zzso formula presented in this zzso
