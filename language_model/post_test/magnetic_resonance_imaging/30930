The aim of this study was to identify metabolically abnormal zzso brain regions in patients with zzso lobe zzso with zzso and without zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso evidence for zzso sclerosis zzso and to assess their value for focus zzso by using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso 

zzso in combination with tissue zzso was performed on 14 zzso and seven zzso and 12 zzso zzso In controls, zzso + zzso zzso of all zzso of a given lobe was expressed as a function of white matter content to determine the zzso prediction zzso for any additional zzso of a given tissue zzso zzso with zzso below the lower limit of the zzso prediction zzso were defined as zzso in patients and zzso zzso were used to identify regions with a higher percentage of pathological zzso than those in zzso 

zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and frontal zzso zzso abnormalities identified the zzso focus in zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso abnormalities identified the zzso focus in zzso of zzso but in only zzso of zzso 

zzso is associated with zzso reductions of zzso in several zzso consistent with those brain areas involved in seizure zzso zzso and zzso zzso reductions might be helpful for focus zzso
