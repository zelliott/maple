Brain dysfunction in prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contributes to habitual drug zzso These regions are constituents of brain networks thought to be involved in drug zzso To investigate whether networks containing these regions differ between nicotine dependent female smokers and zzso female zzso we employed functional zzso zzso at zzso 

Data were processed with independent component analysis zzso to identify resting state networks zzso We identified a zzso zzso network and three discrete zzso zzso a zzso prefrontal zzso zzso network and right and left zzso zzso networks common to all zzso We then compared these zzso between smokers and zzso using a dual zzso zzso 

Smokers had greater zzso versus zzso between left zzso and zzso zzso Smokers with the greatest zzso zzso zzso had the most zzso smoking cue zzso as measured during an zzso smoking cue zzso zzso This may be important because the zzso plays a critical role in maintaining zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso network zzso was greater in zzso 

Our results suggest that prefrontal brain networks are more strongly coupled in smokers, which could facilitate zzso zzso Our data also are the first to document greater zzso network zzso zzso in zzso Our findings suggest that resting state zzso network interactions and zzso network zzso can differentiate zzso smokers from controls, and may serve as zzso for nicotine dependence severity and treatment zzso
