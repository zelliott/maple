We assessed the performance of zzso fusion zzso based on zzso zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso maps derived from zzso zzso for the identification of primary prostate zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were performed in 17 patients with zzso primary prostate cancer, followed by zzso Registration of in zzso imaging with zzso was achieved using a zzso objective function and by performing ex zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso and zzso zzso with zzso photography as intermediate zzso Data analysis included zzso registered zzso zzso with zzso scoring, zzso and zzso data zzso at zzso zzso Volumes of interest were defined on the basis of zzso proven tumor tissue to calculate zzso prostate background ratios zzso for zzso zzso and a derived fusion zzso zzso calculating the zzso of zzso over zzso zzso 

Fifty-one tumor zzso were identified at zzso The zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in prostate zzso with a zzso score of zzso + 4 than with a zzso score of zzso + 3 disease and zzso For zzso zzso 3 + 4, the zzso zzso were significantly lower than controls and zzso zzso 3 + 3 disease zzso zzso zzso The absolute value of zzso obtained from zzso zzso 3 + 4 zzso increased from zzso to zzso zzso and from zzso zzso to zzso with each step being statistically zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso zzso using zzso improves zzso contrast zzso of zzso zzso 3 + 4 disease, compared with zzso zzso or zzso zzso and thus hold promise that zzso imaging performed on hybrid zzso may further improve identification and zzso of significant primary prostate zzso
