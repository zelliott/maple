To test the feasibility of applying the magnetic resonance zzso zzso technique to map the elastic zzso of the zzso fat pads in diabetic and zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso imaging apparatus was used to produce quantitative maps of the heel fat pad in a pilot study of 12 volunteers and 4 patients with diabetes with zzso zzso images corresponding to zzso maps allowed precise selection of regions of interest in the zzso 

zzso resonance zzso of the heel fat pads were successfully zzso mean zzso in the volunteers and the diabetic patients were zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

It is feasible to perform zzso on the zzso fat pads and to produce elasticity zzso The trend toward stiffer fat zzso as demonstrated in patients with diabetes, suggests that the fat pads were zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso offers great potential to investigate the mechanical properties of soft zzso in zzso zzso
