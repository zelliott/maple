New imaging techniques have been introduced to assess the extent and severity of disease in multiple myeloma zzso zzso The aim of our study was to compare newer imaging zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso assess their relative contribution in the evaluation of zzso patients at zzso 

zzso newly diagnosed patients with zzso were zzso zzso Diagnosis and staging were made according to standard zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the spine and pelvis within 10 zzso and imaging findings were zzso 

zzso zzso was positive in 32 patients (16 focal zzso 3 diffuse zzso 13 focal and diffuse zzso zzso was positive in 30 patients (6 zzso 11 zzso 13 focal and diffuse zzso and zzso of the spine and pelvis was positive in 27 patients (6 zzso 13 zzso 8 focal and diffuse zzso zzso zzso showed a total of 196 focal zzso zzso in bones and 18 in soft zzso of which 121 were in districts other than the spine and zzso whereas zzso zzso 63 focal zzso zzso in bones and 3 in soft zzso of which 53 were in districts other than the spine and zzso In the spinal and pelvic regions, zzso zzso detected 75 focal zzso (35 in spine and 40 in zzso zzso zzso 10 focal zzso (1 in spine and 9 in zzso and zzso detected 51 focal zzso (40 in spine and 11 in zzso 

In zzso analysis, zzso zzso performed better than zzso in the detection of focal zzso whereas zzso was superior in the zzso of diffuse zzso In the spine and zzso zzso was comparable to zzso zzso and zzso in the detection of focal and diffuse disease, zzso Because zzso zzso may often occur out of spinal and pelvic regions, zzso should be reserved to the evaluation of bone zzso involvement of these districts, whereas zzso zzso can significantly contribute to an accurate zzso evaluation of zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso despite its limited capacity in detecting focal zzso may be an alternative option when a PET facility is not zzso
