To evaluate the safety and utility of zzso zzso as a magnetic resonance zzso contrast agent in patients with acute zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred three patients with acute zzso received intravenous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during MR zzso Dynamic and delayed zzso zzso zzso images were compared with zzso images, zzso resting zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso was well zzso Dynamic imaging with zzso zzso was more sensitive zzso vs zzso than delayed spin echo imaging zzso zzso zzso No difference in specificity was seen zzso vs zzso zzso zzso was a sensitive zzso test, but was not specific zzso zzso was not sensitive zzso but was specific zzso 

The intravenous use of zzso zzso at a zzso dose of zzso zzso is safe in patients with an acute zzso Dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for demonstrating zzso
