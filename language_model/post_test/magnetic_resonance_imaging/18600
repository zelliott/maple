zzso ambiguity exists about the generators of the scalp recorded zzso despite a vast body of research employing a diverse range of zzso Previous investigations employing source zzso techniques have been limited largely to equivalent current zzso models, with most studies identifying zzso zzso and/or zzso sources, but providing little information about the contribution of other cortical regions to the generation of the scalp recorded zzso zzso zzso zzso were recorded from 5 subjects using a zzso sensor array during the performance of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso boundary element modeling was used to identify the cortical generators of this target zzso in individual zzso zzso generators of the zzso were localized principally to the zzso zzso zzso and surrounding superior zzso zzso zzso zzso in all subjects, though with some zzso across zzso Two subjects also showed activity in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A group cortical surface was calculated by zzso zzso of each zzso segmented zzso followed by averaging and creation of a group zzso zzso activity identified across the group reflected the individual subject zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso primarily on the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is interpreted to reflect the role of this region in working memory and related attention processes and zzso zzso The activity in left zzso zzso zzso is taken to reflect zzso of regions associated with zzso analysis of visual word zzso
