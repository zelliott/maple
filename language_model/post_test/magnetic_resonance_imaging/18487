zzso enhanced dynamic MR studies were evaluated in six patients with zzso zzso associated with portal vein tumor zzso The portal vein tumor zzso was clearly zzso as a low intensity zzso The zzso segment supplied by the portal vein showed high intensity, probably due to decreased portal blood flow and zzso zzso blood zzso zzso located in this segment were shown as areas of relatively low intensity compared with zzso high intensity zzso Thus dynamic MR study was found to be a useful method for zzso the tumor from the surrounding zzso tissue with decreased portal blood zzso
