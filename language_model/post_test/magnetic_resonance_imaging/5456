zzso evidence implicates the zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso signaling via zzso zzso receptors as essential zzso of anxiety zzso Assuming a functional zzso of these zzso we hypothesized that a zzso behavioral zzso due to bilateral zzso of the zzso would be associated with significant zzso zzso zzso Thus, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso referenced to zzso plasma levels and corrected for partial volume effects to zzso the spatial distribution of zzso zzso binding potential zzso in a rare patient with zzso disease and selective bilateral zzso zzso damage relative to 10 healthy control zzso zzso with our a zzso hypothesis, we observed a zzso global decrease in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso patient relative to zzso Thus, brain abnormalities in this patient are not restricted to the amygdala, but extend to overall zzso zzso via zzso zzso Our findings provide important insights into the molecular architecture of human anxiety behaviors and suggest the zzso zzso as a promising pharmacological target to control pathological zzso
