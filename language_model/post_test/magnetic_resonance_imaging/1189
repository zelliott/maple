Using zzso we investigated the zzso structures controlling zzso coordination applying a zzso coordination zzso Recent studies suggest the existence of a widespread network for the zzso control of zzso coordination including primary zzso zzso zzso lateral and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motor area zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, subjects performed zzso and zzso tasks requiring the coordination of two fingers at a time to navigate a zzso on a computer zzso Thus, in contrast to previous studies, we are using appropriate zzso control zzso zzso By using this new motor task, we identified a similar zzso network for zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited bilateral zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cortex, as well as in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We did not find any additional zzso when comparing zzso with zzso zzso The lack of significant zzso in the comparison zzso zzso zzso gives reason to suggest that this network is not limited to the control of zzso motor actions, but responsible for zzso coordinated movements as zzso Interestingly, we found stronger zzso for zzso as compared to zzso zzso We zzso that task difficulty zzso of freedom to control, zzso number of zzso is more important in determining which network components are activated and to what extent, compared to the factor of zzso It even seemed to be less demanding for the motor system to control the zzso zzso compared to the zzso performance with two adjacent zzso
