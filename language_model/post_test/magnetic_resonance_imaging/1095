To determine the in zzso feasibility of zzso early degenerative changes in zzso joint of symptomatic human knee using zzso relaxation time in the rotating frame zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

All the zzso experiments were performed on a zzso T zzso GE zzso clinical scanner using a custom built zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso with a three-dimensional zzso pulse sequence zzso with a zzso cluster consisting of two hard 90 degrees zzso and a low power zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation maps of zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso and six symptomatic human volunteers (four men, two zzso were zzso using a appropriate signal zzso 

All six symptomatic volunteers showed zzso in zzso relaxation times when compared with zzso zzso In symptomatic population, the zzso relaxation times varied from 63 zzso 4 zzso to 95 zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso standard zzso depending on the degree of cartilage zzso The increase in zzso of symptomatic population was statistically significant zzso zzso 6, P zzso when compared with corresponding zzso zzso However, in zzso population the relaxation times varied only from approximately 45 to 55 zzso zzso zzso 8, age range zzso zzso 

zzso results demonstrated the in zzso feasibility of zzso early zzso changes in symptomatic zzso subjects employing zzso zzso on a zzso T clinical zzso This study on limited number of symptomatic population shows that zzso zzso provides a zzso marker for zzso of early degenerative changes of cartilage in zzso However, further studies are needed to correlate early zzso determined from zzso with zzso in a large symptomatic zzso
