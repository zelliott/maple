To zzso speed and accuracy of motor zzso we can prepare not only the type of movement to be made but also the time at which it will be zzso Previous cued zzso zzso have shown that anticipating the moment in time at which this response will be made zzso zzso or selectively preparing the motor zzso with which an imminent response will be made zzso intention or zzso zzso recruits similar regions of left zzso zzso zzso raising the possibility that these two zzso processes are inextricably zzso We used a zzso design to independently cue motor and zzso components of response preparation within the same experimental zzso By zzso zzso either zzso or manual response systems, rather than zzso zzso responses within just one of these systems, potential spatial confounds were zzso We demonstrated that zzso and motor zzso were zzso zzso each capable of improving performance zzso zzso zzso data revealed that zzso zzso activated the left zzso even if the motor zzso that would be used to execute the response was zzso Moreover, zzso zzso activated left zzso whether the target required a zzso or manual response, and whether this response was zzso or zzso thus confirming the ubiquity of left zzso zzso for zzso zzso Finally, a small region of left zzso was also activated by motor zzso for manual, though not zzso zzso Despite their functional independence therefore, zzso zzso and manual motor zzso nevertheless engage partially overlapping regions of left zzso possibly reflecting their shared zzso zzso
