In this paper, we propose a method to zzso magnitude magnetic resonance zzso images, which are zzso zzso zzso maximum likelihood methods incorporate the Rice distribution to estimate the true, underlying signal from a local neighborhood within which the signal is assumed to be zzso However, if this assumption is not met, such filtering will lead to blurred edges and loss of fine zzso As a solution to this problem, we put forward the concept of restricted local neighborhoods where the true intensity for each noisy zzso is estimated from a set of zzso neighboring zzso To this end, a reference image is created from the noisy image using a recently proposed zzso means zzso This reference image is used as a prior for further noise zzso A scheme is developed to locally select an appropriate subset of zzso from which the underlying signal is zzso Experimental results based on the peak signal to noise ratio, structural similarity index zzso zzso zzso and mean absolute difference from synthetic and real MR images demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art zzso
