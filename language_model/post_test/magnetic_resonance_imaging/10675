zzso connectivity maps the distributed network of brain regions fluctuating zzso during a continuous brain zzso This study sought to investigate whether patients with left zzso lobe zzso zzso differ from controls in their zzso functional connectivity between typical language zzso 

We studied 17 patients with left zzso together with eight healthy controls, using seeded functional zzso zzso regions were defined using the regions of zzso zzso and zzso during a language functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso task in a separate cohort of 30 zzso 

Language zzso produced the expected zzso pattern, which was not different between patients and zzso However, functional connectivity between language areas during rest was markedly zzso whereas controls showed connectivity between each of the seed areas and the majority of the language areas, patients showed connectivity only with a few areas, particularly the seed area zzso This difference was significant in the direct comparison of patients and control connectivity zzso 

We suggest that this reduced connectivity in left zzso lobe zzso may reflect a zzso of the language network during resting state in patients and may be related to subtle language difficulties in this patient zzso
