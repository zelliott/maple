zzso has been clinically only used for investigation of zzso disc zzso In this study, MR images were used and a new zzso zzso of the zzso discs was zzso zzso examination had been performed on zzso girls presenting an idiopathic zzso and wearing a first zzso zzso Using an in-house image processing software and the zzso processing software zzso geometrical models were obtained with and without brace for each zzso These models included the outline of the zzso high intensity zone, composed of the nucleus and a part of the zzso The shift forward between disc high intensity zone zzso and body zzso was found to be varying from 0 to zzso The zzso and zzso shifts forward appeared in the zzso zzso and were maximum at the zzso zzso The zzso disc zzso was found to be varying from zzso degrees to zzso zzso On these zzso zzso patients, the zzso brace decreased the zzso shift forward between disc high intensity zone zzso and body zzso and increased the zzso zzso zzso The zzso disc zzso obtained represented new data in the zzso deformation zzso But this method was not adapted for a clinical zzso The qualitative and quantitative data obtained will help the zzso in the brace design and also the zzso in the zzso zzso
