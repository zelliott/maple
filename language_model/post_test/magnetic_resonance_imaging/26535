It is controversial whether the zzso prefrontal zzso is involved in the maintenance of items in working memory or in the selection of zzso We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the performance of a spatial working memory task by zzso We distinguished the maintenance of spatial items from the selection of an item from memory to guide a zzso zzso but not zzso was associated with zzso of prefrontal area 46 of the zzso lateral prefrontal zzso In contrast, maintenance was associated with zzso of prefrontal area 8 and the zzso zzso The results support a role for the zzso prefrontal zzso in the selection of zzso This accounts for the fact that this area is activated both when subjects select between items on working memory tasks and when they freely select between movements on tasks of zzso zzso
