zzso brain imaging has been considered a new and better technique for the detection of zzso The reasoning is that there is a neural locus or circuit for lying that is sensitive, specific, zzso across individuals and measurement zzso and robust to zzso To determine the extent to which the group results predicted lying at the level of the individual, we zzso data on 14 participants from a study that had previously identified regions involved in lying zzso satisfying the criterion for zzso We assessed the efficacy of functionally determined brain regions based on the zzso contrast for zzso participants to detect deception in the zzso zzso zzso showed that no region could be used to correctly detect deception across all zzso The best results were obtained for zzso prefrontal zzso zzso correctly identifying zzso of participants as lying with no false zzso zzso the threshold for a response increased hits and false zzso The results suggest that although brain imaging is a more direct index of zzso than the traditional zzso it is subject to many of the same zzso and thus zzso does not appear to reveal processes that are necessarily unique to zzso
