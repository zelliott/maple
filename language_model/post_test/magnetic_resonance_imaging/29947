A common post-traumatic location of zzso is the zzso zzso lobe despite evidence of associated diffuse or remote cerebral zzso We undertook a review of post-traumatic zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso patients as part of an overall post-traumatic zzso population to assess the extent of cerebral injury sustained by this zzso and to establish whether surgical outcome differed from that of a zzso zzso zzso A retrospective review of 57 patients operated for post-traumatic zzso zzso over a 10-year period zzso was undertaken with particular attention to those undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was assessed for the type and location of zzso zzso outcomes were compared with those of patients with zzso of zzso origin operated by the same zzso Of the 57 patients zzso 30 cases underwent zzso zzso lobe zzso The most common mechanism of injury was blunt trauma attributable to motor vehicle accidents with imaging abnormalities characterized by zzso zzso sclerosis zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diffuse cerebral zzso (five zzso and focal zzso (three zzso Six patients had normal zzso zzso No significant differences in zzso outcomes were found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso change in the zzso zzso lobe varied greatly and provided no indication of a zzso zzso zzso Patients with post-traumatic zzso zzso lobe zzso respond zzso to surgical zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso there is substantial variation of zzso findings which correlate poorly with current imaging zzso The zzso outcomes obtained following surgery in this group attest to a zzso with other risk factors in the genesis of zzso in this zzso
