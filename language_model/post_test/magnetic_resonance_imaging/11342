The block uniform zzso zzso zzso is a newly proposed zzso technique for zzso zzso zzso Even though it is a relatively zzso intensive algorithm, since it uses singular value decomposition zzso its procedure is simple because it requires neither a zzso nor a zzso zzso Furthermore, the reconstructed image is generally of high quality since it provides accurate zzso values when the local zzso data zzso is zzso However, the zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso Specifically, inaccurate zzso data values are often generated in the zzso zzso if the original zzso data are corrupted by noise, which is virtually guaranteed to occur to some extent in zzso As a result, the reconstructed image quality is zzso despite excellent performance under ideal zzso In this article, a method is presented which avoids inaccurate zzso zzso data values from noisy sampled data with the zzso zzso The newly proposed technique simply zzso a series of singular values after the zzso is zzso This reduces the zzso demand when compared with the zzso algorithm, avoids amplification of noise resulting from small singular values, and leads to image zzso improvements over the original zzso zzso
