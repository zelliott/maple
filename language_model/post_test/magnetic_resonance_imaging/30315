To examine the outcome of cochlear zzso in children with auditory zzso zzso and cochlear nerve zzso zzso zzso zzso are compared with a cohort of children with AN and normal cochlear nerves zzso zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

The Sydney zzso zzso Centre and the Children's Hospital at zzso 

Children younger than 15 years with bilateral profound zzso hearing loss and the diagnosis of AN confirmed on zzso zzso All children underwent cochlear zzso with zzso 24 cochlear implants from 1997 to zzso 

zzso resonance imaging was examined for zzso of the zzso zzso Brain and inner ear abnormalities were zzso zzso implant outcomes and demographic variables were zzso 

Melbourne speech perception score zzso at 1 year and implant evoked electric auditory zzso response zzso 

Group A performed significantly worse on both parameters than Group zzso In Group A, median zzso was 1, compared with a median score of 4 in Group B zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso was abnormal in 13 of 15 zzso children in Group A, compared with 9 of 39 zzso in Group zzso Children in both groups with abnormal zzso had significantly worse zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Fourteen of 15 children with cochlear nerve zzso had associated inner ear zzso 

Children with AN can have associated cochlear nerve zzso These patients have worse speech perception scores at 1 year post cochlear zzso higher rates of abnormal zzso and more associated inner ear abnormalities than children with AN and normal cochlear zzso
