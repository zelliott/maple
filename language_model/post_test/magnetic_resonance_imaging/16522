The aim of the present study was to identify the neural zzso underlying memory impairment due to a single dose of zzso zzso by means of zzso Based on previous behavioral results it was hypothesized that this deficit could be attributed to a specific influence of zzso on zzso Fourteen Ecstasy users participated in this zzso zzso zzso study with two treatment conditions: zzso (75 zzso and zzso Memory performance was tested by means of a word learning task including two words lists, one addressing reading processes zzso task, zzso and a second zzso task, zzso addressing zzso and reading zzso zzso data showed that under the influence of zzso zzso performance was worse than zzso Imaging data showed that zzso was situated mainly in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso interaction was situated in three zzso the left middle frontal zzso zzso the right zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso zzso zzso and functional data only correlated in zzso It appeared that zzso performance caused zzso signal change in zzso during zzso treatment but not during zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso influences middle frontal zzso processes resulting in impoverished memory zzso
