zzso zzso is a rare brain tumor which zzso resembles a diffuse cerebral zzso It can simultaneously zzso multiple sites in the zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso This remarkable zzso has led to the idea that zzso zzso does not derive from a solitary focus but must arise from a broad field of zzso zzso We studied the zzso from zzso zzso in a 12-year-old boy by conventional zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Aside from normal cells, we found a majority of cells with the zzso zzso zzso A smaller proportion of cells had 88 zzso with a doubling of this abnormal zzso These findings are consistent with a zzso zzso stemming from a single zzso The zzso changes we observed, with the possible exception of the zzso 6 zzso did not resemble those frequently found in zzso zzso zzso may therefore belong to a separate category of brain zzso
