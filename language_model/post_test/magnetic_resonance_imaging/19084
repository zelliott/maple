The study of subjects with acquired brain damage has been an invaluable tool for exploring human brain function, and the description of zzso locations within and across subjects is an important component of this zzso Such descriptions usually involve the separation of zzso from zzso tissue zzso zzso and the description of the zzso location in terms of a standard anatomical reference space zzso zzso The objectives of this study were to determine the sources and magnitude of zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso Each of two observers segmented the zzso volume in ten zzso subjects twice, so as to permit zzso comparisons of both zzso and zzso zzso The segmented volumes were then warped to a reference brain using both a manual zzso and an automated zzso zzso Observer agreement between segmented and warped volumes was analyzed using four zzso volume size, distance between the volume surfaces, percentage of zzso zzso and percentage of highly zzso zzso The techniques for zzso and zzso produced high agreement within and between zzso For example, in most instances, the warped volume surfaces created by different observers were separated by less than 3 zzso The performance of the automated zzso technique compared favorably to the manual technique in most subjects, although important exceptions were zzso Overall, these results establish benchmark parameters for expert and automated zzso transfer, and indicate that a high degree of confidence can be placed in the detailed anatomical interpretation of focal brain damage based upon the zzso zzso
