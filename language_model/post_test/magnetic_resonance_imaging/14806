zzso the cognitive and neural processes that zzso human decision making requires the successful prediction of how, but also of when, people zzso zzso sampling models zzso have greatly advanced the decision sciences by assuming decisions to emerge from a bounded evidence zzso process so that response times zzso become zzso Here, we demonstrate a difficulty of zzso that occurs when people are not forced to respond at once but are allowed to sample information zzso The decision maker might decide to delay the choice and terminate the zzso process temporarily, a scenario not accounted for by the standard zzso zzso We developed several zzso for predicting zzso from two independent samples of an zzso zzso and a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso In these studies, participants bought or rejected fictitious stocks based on zzso presented cues and were free to respond at any zzso Standard zzso zzso did not describe zzso zzso zzso However, by adding a mechanism for zzso decisions to the model we obtained an accurate fit to the zzso zzso analysis of zzso data revealed alternating states of zzso and increasing zzso power in zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that responses were repeatedly prepared and inhibited and thus lending further support for the existence of a decision not to zzso Finally, the extended model accounted for the results of an adapted version of our paradigm in which participants had to press a button for sampling more zzso Our results show how zzso modeling of decisions and zzso support a deeper understanding of the hidden dynamics in zzso
