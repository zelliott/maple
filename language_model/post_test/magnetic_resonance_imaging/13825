There is substantial evidence that zzso defects and zzso may play a role in the zzso of zzso disease zzso Potential therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases in which there is reduced energy metabolism and zzso zzso are the administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We found that oral administration of either zzso zzso or zzso significantly extended survival and delayed the development of motor deficits, weight loss, cerebral zzso and zzso zzso inclusions in the zzso transgenic mouse model of zzso The combined treatment, using zzso zzso and zzso together, was more zzso than either compound alone, resulting in an approximately 32 and zzso increase in survival in the zzso and zzso mice, zzso zzso resonance imaging showed that combined treatment significantly attenuated zzso enlargement in zzso These studies further zzso defective energy metabolism and zzso in the zzso and zzso transgenic mouse models of HD and are of interest in comparison with the outcome of a recent clinical trial examining zzso zzso and zzso in HD zzso
