It is suggested that resting state networks reflecting correlated neural regional activities participate significantly in brain zzso A fundamental issue is to understand how these networks interact and how their activities change during behavioral zzso Our aim was to understand better with functional zzso connectivity how the brain switched from a zzso to a zzso state by exploring the zzso readiness state for an intended movement of the right zzso Our study does not address movement preparation occurring in a time scale of milliseconds before movement which has been widely studied but zzso which can last zzso At rest, in the absence of overt zzso behavior, a zzso network, whose main areas are the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows high activity interpreted as day zzso free association, stream of consciousness, and inner zzso We found that, during rest, the zzso network and the zzso network were not functionally zzso During zzso the two networks were functionally correlated through an interaction between the zzso and the zzso superior zzso zzso in the upper zzso The complex zzso has been shown to be involved in retrieval and/or setting up spatial attributes for motor imagery, and thus, would be a key region in the zzso zzso It might functionally connect to the zzso superior zzso zzso to initiate the movement programming through retrieval of suited movement zzso The anterior zzso functionally correlated to the primary zzso zzso during zzso would have a motivational role or could generate predictions about the zzso
