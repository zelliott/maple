zzso in conventional zzso for zzso soft tissue zzso zzso potentially exceed normal tissue zzso This study compares zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso target volume coverage and zzso integral dose to zzso zzso 

Ten patients undergoing zzso zzso for zzso zzso were zzso zzso was defined as zzso bed plus zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was defined as zzso zzso zzso were defined as whole zzso zzso zzso tissue corridor and normal tissue outside zzso For each patient zzso zzso was compared to 2/3 field zzso and zzso field zzso zzso with simultaneous integrated boost zzso The primary planning objective was to zzso zzso and skin corridor zzso zzso analysis and conformity and zzso zzso were used for plan zzso 

A planning protocol containing zzso constraints for target and zzso was zzso zzso zzso showed greatest conformity and zzso zzso resulted in significantly lower zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso resulted in significantly lower normal tissue zzso zzso and maximum dose zzso than zzso 

A zzso set of planning guidelines and zzso constraints for zzso and zzso planning for zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in better target coverage and significantly decreased zzso zzso Further evaluation of this technique within a clinical trial is recommended to demonstrate that the technical benefit of the more complex technique translates into zzso benefit by reducing late zzso
