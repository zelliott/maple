The prospect of new therapies in zzso stresses the need to refine the indications for zzso The aim of this study was, therefore, to perform a detailed analysis of zzso brain zzso at diagnosis and zzso to better understand the natural history of zzso 

This retrospective zzso study zzso looked at 13 patients with zzso zzso years of zzso with 28 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso compared with 39 zzso and zzso zzso All zzso were evaluated zzso and zzso The Student zzso test, zzso signed rank test, and zzso correlation were used for statistical analysis zzso zzso zzso 

In addition to diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso pattern zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and internal capsules zzso we found significant zzso abnormalities such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso without zzso involvement zzso The pattern of zzso involvement progression was zzso with initially diffuse high signal intensity, which later became zzso before finally progressing to zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso This should not be mistaken for a disease zzso zzso confirmed a decrease in the zzso ratio, an increase in the zzso ratio and in zzso and a zzso zzso 

zzso changes may be a common finding in zzso raising the prospect of primary zzso zzso This may prove important when evaluating the efficacy of new zzso
