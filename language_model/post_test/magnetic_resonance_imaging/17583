zzso coils zzso are used for acquiring high spatial resolution magnetic resonance zzso images of the human zzso The goal of this study is to determine the impact of an zzso versus a rigid zzso on changes in the location and deformation of the prostate zzso and subsequently on registering prostate images acquired with and without an zzso zzso and zzso zzso weighted MR images were acquired from 25 patients receiving a combined MR zzso zzso imaging staging exam for prostate zzso Within the same exam, images were acquired using an external pelvic phased array zzso both alone and in combination with either an zzso zzso zzso Pittsburgh, zzso or a rigid zzso zzso zzso Aurora, zzso zzso translations and zzso caused by the zzso were measured and zzso The ability to register images acquired with and without the zzso using a manual zzso registration was assessed using a similarity index zzso Both zzso caused the prostate to tilt zzso with an average tilt of zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso degrees, mean zzso standard zzso for zzso and rigid zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso caused a significantly larger distortion of the prostate as compared to the rigid zzso zzso the prostate in the zzso direction by zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and widening the prostate in the zzso direction by zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the ability to manually align prostate images acquired with and without zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso better for the rigid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso for the rigid and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the manual zzso alignment of prostate MR images acquired with and without the zzso can be improved through the use of a rigid zzso
