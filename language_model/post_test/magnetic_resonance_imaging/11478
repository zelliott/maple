To report late onset cerebral white matter disease as a distinctive zzso in zzso zzso disorder zzso 

There is zzso and genetic overlap among the zzso known as Zellweger syndrome zzso infantile zzso disease zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso external features are variable among these three disorders, and zzso deficit has its onset at birth or in zzso In a structured follow-up cohort of 25 patients with zzso not including zzso three patients had an unusual pattern of cerebral white matter disease with onset past the age of 1, not zzso to any of the classic zzso zzso 

Clinical zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in body zzso and zzso identification of affected zzso gene by genetic zzso in zzso and zzso zzso 

Two unrelated patients with zzso without distinctive external features had normal zzso milestones during their first year, followed by rapid deterioration including severe zzso zzso seizures, zzso and zzso A third patient initially diagnosed with zzso developed cerebral white matter zzso in the third year of life, complicating the original zzso zzso in all three patients showed cerebral zzso with sparing of zzso fibers and pronounced central zzso zzso 

zzso cerebral white matter disease may occur in zzso either following zzso or following normal early development and in the absence of distinctive external zzso zzso zzso disorder should be included in the differential diagnosis of zzso onset of cerebral white matter disease
