We studied brain water self diffusion in zzso zzso by zzso using single spin echo pulse sequences with zzso magnetic field zzso of different zzso The methods is based on the fact that the movement of water molecules is restricted in brain tissue and that zzso of water in the brain tissue will enhance the self diffusion of zzso In order to evaluate the brain water content in zzso zzso we compared the water self diffusion zzso in various regions of the brain in zzso patients with that of healthy zzso Ten patients with zzso zzso were zzso All had increased zzso and increased resistance to zzso zzso All patients had normal conventional MR spin echo images without focal zzso and a normal sized zzso zzso All patients had abnormal diffusion images showing increased water zzso Some patients had in particular increased diffusion in the zzso regions, others in the whole zzso The diffusion zzso in all brain regions of interest were significantly higher in patients than in zzso The findings suggest that patients with zzso zzso have a zzso zzso flow of water causing an zzso brain zzso and in addition an zzso brain water zzso
