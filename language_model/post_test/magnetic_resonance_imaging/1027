To investigate the effect of electrical stimulation of the nerve zzso of the hand on cortical activity zzso by zzso zzso stimulation for sensation in healthy human zzso 

Ten healthy volunteers were studied using zzso with 1) a test zzso with zzso tapping of the left hand, 2) a zzso zzso electrical stimulation of the left hand below the sensory level for sensation for 30 minutes, 3) a second zzso run with the same paradigm as in the test zzso immediately after electrical zzso and 4) a final identical zzso run 2 hours zzso to test the cortical changes induced by electrical zzso zzso were carried out on a zzso T MR scanner and for zzso zzso sequences were zzso Data analysis was performed with zzso 

An increase of zzso responses was seen within the primary motor and primary zzso areas of both zzso when comparing the test zzso with the zzso after electrical stimulation relative to the baseline or sham zzso Two hours zzso the zzso effects of zzso stimulation diminished to baseline level except within the zzso primary motor zzso 

The increased zzso response zzso localized within the zzso zzso reflects an increase in zzso activity that may provide zzso zzso zzso
