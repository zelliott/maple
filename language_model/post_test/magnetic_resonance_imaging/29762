zzso learning can be induced by passive tactile zzso without attention or zzso We used functional zzso zzso and zzso to investigate in detail the specificity of this type of learning for different tactile discrimination tasks and the underlying cortical zzso We found that a few hours of zzso zzso evoked a significant increase of primary zzso and secondary zzso zzso cortical areas representing the zzso body zzso The amount of plastic changes was strongly correlated with improvement in spatial discrimination zzso However, in the same subjects, frequency discrimination was impaired after zzso indicating that even zzso processes can be induced by intense passive sensory zzso
