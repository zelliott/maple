zzso zzso mapping zzso based on zzso echo zzso magnetic resonance phase data is a novel technique for zzso assessment of magnetic tissue zzso zzso The method is expected to be an important means to determine iron zzso in zzso and may, thus, be instrumental for zzso the zzso role of iron and zzso iron concentration changes associated with various neurological and psychiatric zzso This study introduces a framework for zzso and demonstrates calculation of zzso and zzso zzso maps from zzso data acquired at zzso The potential of these zzso maps to perform anatomical imaging is investigated, as well as the ability to measure the zzso blood oxygen zzso level in large vessels, and to assess the local tissue iron zzso In order to take into account zzso zzso contributions induced by zzso a correction scheme for zzso based iron zzso is zzso The findings suggest that zzso contrast, and zzso also phase contrast, are not only linked to the storage iron concentration but are also significantly influenced by other sources such as zzso After zzso correction the linear dependence between magnetic zzso and previously published iron zzso from post zzso studies was significantly zzso Finally, a comparison between zzso maps and processed phase images indicated that caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions about iron zzso when directly assessing processed phase zzso
