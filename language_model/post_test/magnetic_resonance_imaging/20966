zzso zzso represent an aggressive class of central nervous system zzso zzso of zzso outcomes with tumor zzso data zzso zzso zzso of tumors (typically based on magnetic resonance zzso Expert zzso is the long-held gold standard for tumor zzso but is exceptionally resource intensive and subject to zzso and zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso have been demonstrated for a variety of imaging zzso and tumor zzso but translation of these methods across clinical study designs is problematic given variation in image zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso and validation zzso zzso the authors demonstrate an alternative approach for zzso tumor zzso using zzso collaborative zzso 

In a study of 85 human zzso and 98 tumor patients, zzso were recruited from a general university campus population zzso no specific medical zzso given minimal training, and provided zzso tools to label zzso images based on zzso cross zzso The labeling goal was characterized as to extract the enhanced tumor zzso on zzso zzso and the bright zzso on zzso zzso An experienced zzso manually constructed the ground truth volumes of a randomly sampled zzso of 48 tumor subjects (for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso individual zzso as well as the volume wise truth estimates via statistical fusion method, were evaluated over the subjects having the ground zzso 

Individual zzso were able to reliably characterize (with zzso dice similarity zzso zzso the zzso zzso and extent of the zzso areas only slightly more than half of the zzso Yet, human zzso were efficient in terms of providing these highly variable zzso (less than 20 s per zzso When statistical fusion was used to combine the results of seven zzso per slice for all slices in the zzso the zzso agreement of the fused results with expertly delineated zzso was on par with the zzso reliability observed between experienced zzso using traditional zzso tools zzso zzso zzso The cumulative time spent per tumor patient with the collaborative approach was equivalent to that with an experienced zzso but the collaborative approach could be achieved with less training time, fewer resources, and efficient zzso 

zzso collaborative labeling is a promising technique with potentially wide zzso to cost-effective manual labeling of medical zzso
