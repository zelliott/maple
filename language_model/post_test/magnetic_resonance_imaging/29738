This paper examines an alternative approach to separating magnetic resonance imaging zzso intensity zzso from underlying zzso structure using a direct zzso zzso This permits the explicit spatial modeling of subtle intensity variations present in normal anatomy which may confound common retrospective correction techniques using criteria derived from a global intensity zzso A zzso zzso driven spatial zzso procedure is employed to map intensity distorted MR images to a tissue reference zzso This allows a direct zzso of the relative bias field between template and subject MR images, from the ratio of their zzso filtered intensity zzso A tissue template for an aging individual is constructed and used to correct distortion in a set of data acquired as part of a study on zzso A careful validation based on manual zzso and correction of nine zzso with a range of zzso and distortion levels is carried zzso This reveals a consistent improvement in the removal of global intensity variation in terms of the agreement with a global manual bias estimate, and in the reduction in the zzso of intensity variation in manually delineated regions of white zzso
