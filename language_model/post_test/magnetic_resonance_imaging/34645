zzso zzso patients who undergo intensive chemotherapy develop anemia caused by zzso suppression that zzso zzso that, in turn, cause iron deposition in the zzso zzso We describe MR imaging of iron overload in pediatric patients who underwent such chemotherapy and who have solid and zzso zzso 

The MR appearance of the liver, zzso and bone zzso was evaluated in 13 children with both solid zzso zzso 10) and zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso using known criteria for the presence of iron zzso zzso were correlated with zzso history, zzso regimens, and zzso zzso 

MR imaging obtained after chemotherapy and zzso therapy revealed signs of iron deposition in the liver and zzso particularly on zzso zzso Bone zzso signal intensity varied among zzso zzso signal intensity was zzso zzso levels were elevated in all zzso 

zzso system iron deposition present in follow-up MR imaging of pediatric solid and zzso zzso zzso reflected the intensity of the zzso regimen, the degree of zzso suppression, and the zzso zzso zzso Such iron deposition appeared to have no effect on zzso liver, or pancreatic zzso
