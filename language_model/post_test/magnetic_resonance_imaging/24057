The purpose of this study was to investigate the natural history of the high signal zzso shown on long zzso zzso type 1 bright objects zzso children with zzso type 1 zzso We have paid particular attention to the development of tumors in these areas of zzso 

During a 12-month period in 1992 to 1993, 46 children with clinically proven zzso had a magnetic resonance zzso examination at our zzso These were reviewed along with any previous or subsequent MR examinations that had been zzso We recorded the number, volume, and distribution of the abnormal high signal zzso and their change with time when serial examinations were zzso 

zzso were found in zzso of 46 children with zzso on the original zzso zzso The most common zzso sites were the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The number and volume of zzso varied significantly with zzso zzso were uncommon in children younger than 4 years but were very common and extensive between 4 to 10 zzso A significant reduction in the number and volume of zzso was demonstrated in children older than 10 years as shown on both the zzso and zzso portions of the zzso Eight brain tumors zzso zzso were demonstrated in the 46 children zzso with 1 child having two zzso Only 1 child had symptoms zzso to the tumor at the time of zzso Five tumors developed in zzso that were documented on serial MR zzso All those cases developed in children aged 7 to 12 years, and all these children had higher than average numbers and volumes of zzso 

zzso occur commonly in children with zzso and are most prevalent between the ages of 4 and zzso We have shown a high frequency of brain tumors in our children with zzso but the majority of these were zzso We have demonstrated zzso change zzso in zzso of 46 zzso Most zzso zzso with age and seem to be benign, however, young children with a large number and volume of zzso should be followed closely with regular MR examinations because of an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso type 1, magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso
