Working memory capacity has traditionally been thought to be zzso Recent studies, however, suggest that working memory can be improved by zzso In this study, we have investigated the changes in brain activity that are induced by working memory zzso Two experiments were carried out in which healthy, adult human subjects practiced working memory tasks for 5 zzso Brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso before, during and after zzso After training, brain activity that was related to working memory increased in the middle frontal zzso and superior and inferior zzso zzso The changes in cortical activity could be evidence of zzso plasticity in the neural systems that zzso working zzso
