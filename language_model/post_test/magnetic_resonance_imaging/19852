zzso gaze zzso and progressive zzso zzso is caused by zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso associated with zzso guidance during zzso Although there is evidence for zzso zzso and zzso tracts in zzso it is unclear whether other central nervous system pathways are zzso 

To study two patients with zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso using a variety of zzso and zzso zzso 

A battery of zzso tests was applied to assess various cognitive and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and auditory pathways were evaluated using appropriate zzso zzso To access motor pathways to the neck muscles, zzso recordings were obtained from the zzso and zzso zzso muscle during active head zzso 

Both patients performed normally on manual zzso complex sensory and zzso functions, reading and general intelligence zzso Motor evoked zzso in both patients showed zzso zzso tracts for the zzso although in one patient, zzso indicated zzso tract crossing for the neck zzso Although zzso evoked zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and light touch, right median nerve zzso evoked potential in one patient indicated a partial zzso zzso zzso skin response and zzso zzso showed a zzso crossing of the zzso and zzso zzso Brain stem auditory evoked zzso indicated a lack of crossing in the level of the trapezoid zzso 

Our patients with the zzso zzso zzso show normal zzso and cognitive functions and have both crossed and zzso zzso sensory and auditory zzso
