To present and evaluate the clinical and imaging features of patients with zzso zzso in zzso 

Clinical and zzso findings were studied in 63 patients with zzso zzso collected at zzso Hospital Medical School, zzso Imaging features including CT scan in 15 patients, magnetic resonance imaging in 14 patients and magnetic resonance zzso in ten patients were evaluated and compared to zzso 

Among 63 patients there were 43 females and 20 males with the ratio female to male zzso The most common age groups were in the third and fourth decades of zzso The most common clinical findings were hypertension and absence or weakness of zzso zzso zzso zzso rate was found in zzso For zzso the most common vessel affected was the abdominal zzso zzso The second and third most common sites were zzso arteries zzso and the zzso arteries zzso zzso artery involvement was found in two out of eight zzso No pulmonary involvement was found in eight cases studied by pulmonary zzso For zzso of zzso the most common type of involvement zzso was extensive involvement of the zzso and branches zzso V of new zzso established from International zzso on zzso zzso in Tokyo zzso No patient was found to have only involvement of zzso branches or ascending zzso and zzso zzso CT scan showed zzso in the vessel walls zzso zzso which helped in diagnosis of the zzso Wall zzso surrounding zzso appearance of the vessel and zzso zzso could be well zzso zzso resonance imaging added more detail in multiple planes and could demonstrate vascular zzso High detection rate of the zzso zzso was found for the zzso The study was less sensitive for smaller zzso zzso resonance zzso showed better correlation of the findings of zzso arteries compared to zzso zzso steal syndrome could be zzso For zzso zzso MR zzso could correctly demonstrate zzso of zzso artery in six out of eight zzso In the other two cases only zzso of the vessels were found on zzso One zzso zzso zzso on MR zzso was confirmed by zzso 

zzso zzso could be found in zzso Clinical features were almost the same as in reports from other zzso Various forms of zzso involvement were demonstrated by imaging zzso zzso remained the best method for detection and diagnosis of zzso zzso in correlation with clinical and laboratory zzso Although CT zzso magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso were limited and less sensitive for detection of the zzso they were useful as zzso zzso showing more details of zzso zzso vascular wall and surrounding tissue which could be correlated with pathological findings and zzso of the zzso Our study suggests that MR imaging and MR zzso can be screening and diagnostic techniques for patients with suspected zzso zzso
