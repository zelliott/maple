The paper discusses the first evaluation of a zzso zzso technique that operates on zzso zzso mosaic zzso zzso zzso data by zzso spreading followed by zzso with region zzso This leads to a robust and intuitive zzso selection for various zzso and image zzso without requiring problem specific zzso During interactive zzso from a set of zzso seed points a triangle mesh using Delaunay zzso is zzso For each triangle, defined by three seed points, a closed surface patch is generated by the zzso zzso zzso For evaluation purpose white cerebral matter from zzso images is to be zzso A mean zzso from the correct object boundary extracted from available model data of about zzso zzso zzso zzso is observed while the required time was about zzso seconds zzso zzso
