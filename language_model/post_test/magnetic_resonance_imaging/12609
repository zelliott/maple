In this paper, we propose a new skull stripping method for zzso magnetic resonance zzso brain zzso Skull stripping has played an important role in zzso research because it is a basic preliminary step in many clinical zzso The process of skull stripping can be challenging due to the complexity of the human brain, variable parameters of MR zzso individual zzso zzso In this paper, we aim to develop a zzso efficient and robust zzso In the proposed algorithm, after eliminating the background zzso with zzso analysis, two seed regions of the brain and zzso regions were automatically identified using a mask produced by zzso zzso Then we expanded these seed regions with a zzso region growing zzso based on general brain anatomy zzso The proposed zzso was validated using 56 volumes of human brain data and simulated phantom data with manually segmented zzso It was compared with two popular automated skull stripping zzso the brain surface zzso zzso and the brain extraction tool zzso The experimental results showed that the proposed zzso produced accurate and stable results against data sets acquired from various MR scanners and effectively addressed difficult problems such as low contrast and large anatomical connections between the brain and surrounding zzso The proposed method was also robust against noise, zzso and intensity zzso
