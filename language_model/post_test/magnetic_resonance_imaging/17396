We zzso examined serial zzso studies of 7 patients, performed on a zzso T zzso Four patients had the first evaluation within the first 4 months of life and three zzso The imaging protocol included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Five patients underwent zzso using chemical shift imaging zzso in three patients and single zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

Three of the patients studied early showed zzso zzso and diffuse swelling of zzso white matter with involvement of the zzso zzso Two showed zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso White matter changes became evident at a later zzso In three cases zzso showed an abnormal peak of zzso in the zzso zzso or in the zzso white zzso
