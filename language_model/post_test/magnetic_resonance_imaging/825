zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies are limited by the presence of noise produced by echo zzso imaging zzso The current study zzso the effect of MR scanner noise on zzso measures of the perception of zzso and on measures of zzso the representation of auditory zzso within the auditory zzso Seven normal hearing adults were examined using tones of 5 different auditory zzso zzso 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 zzso of equal zzso Using an imaging protocol with peak MR scanner noise at zzso zzso the perception of zzso and zzso zzso activity in response to a zzso tone was less compared to other zzso When the imaging protocol was changed such that peak MR scanner noise occurred at zzso zzso the perception of zzso and zzso zzso activity in response to a zzso tone was less compared to other zzso The reduction in the measured zzso activity for tones near scanner zzso may be due to an inflated zzso baseline at those zzso In addition, zzso activity decreased with increasing frequency, possibly due to the upward spread of masking of zzso high-intensity tonal stimuli or the proximity of zzso core and belt areas of the auditory zzso These results demonstrate the direct effect of scanner noise and high-intensity tonal stimuli on zzso of auditory zzso zzso
