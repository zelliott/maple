The aim of this prospective zzso study was to assess the diagnostic role of zzso in the diagnosis of newly discovered focal liver zzso in clinical zzso One important aspect is the comparison of zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

From 05 zzso 2004 to 12 zzso 2006, standardized zzso was performed zzso on zzso patients with focal liver zzso that had been newly detected by fundamental ultrasound in order to determine tumor differentiation and tumor zzso zzso patients had a standardized zzso after zzso In typical liver zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso the definitive diagnosis was based on the zzso as the zzso gold zzso and on clinical evidence and additional follow-up zzso zzso or on zzso zzso zzso 262 patients met the diagnostic standard that had been zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the tumor differentiation zzso or zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso in 225 cases zzso and the assessment of tumor entity in 204 cases zzso In zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso results for tumor differentiation were obtained in 169 zzso and for tumor entity in 160 zzso zzso Liver zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were most zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso comprised mainly zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso with only a few of zzso zzso zzso 8) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation was zzso in 56 zzso and tumor entity in 44 cases zzso There were no statistically proven differences between zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso are of equal value for the differentiation and zzso of newly discovered liver tumors in clinical zzso zzso and zzso are extremely reliable for the differentiation of benign and zzso zzso the diagnosis of liver zzso and zzso The characterization of zzso and zzso is also very zzso
