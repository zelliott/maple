The human capacity to implicitly acquire knowledge of structured sequences has recently been investigated in artificial grammar learning using functional magnetic resonance zzso It was found that the left inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso area zzso zzso was related to zzso zzso The objective of this study was to investigate whether the IFC zzso zzso is zzso related to zzso of artificial zzso structures by means of an zzso repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso zzso We manipulated the stimulus material in a 2 zzso 2 zzso design with zzso status and local zzso familiarity as zzso The participants showed a reliable effect of zzso on zzso of novel items after 5 days of exposure to grammatical zzso without performance feedback in an implicit acquisition zzso The results show that zzso of BA zzso improves zzso zzso performance by increasing the rejection rate of zzso items and by zzso reaction times of correct rejections specifically after zzso zzso A similar pattern of results is observed in zzso experiments on artificial zzso zzso These results suggest that activity in the inferior frontal region is zzso related to artificial syntax zzso
