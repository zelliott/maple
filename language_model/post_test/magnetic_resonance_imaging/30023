The aim of this study was to assess the value of direct magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the wrist for detecting zzso tears of the triangular zzso complex zzso zzso consecutive patients who had zzso wrist pain and clinical suspicion of zzso tear were included in the zzso All patients underwent direct MR zzso and then wrist zzso and the results of MR zzso were compared with the zzso zzso The positive zzso value of MR zzso in detecting zzso zzso tear was zzso and the negative zzso value was zzso The sensitivity of MR zzso in detecting a zzso zzso tear was zzso zzso and specificity was zzso zzso The overall accuracy of MR zzso in detecting a zzso tear of the zzso in our study was zzso zzso We believe that diagnosis of tears in the zzso by direct MR zzso is not entirely zzso although MR zzso has a high positive zzso value for detecting zzso zzso zzso results of MR zzso in patients with clinical suspicion of zzso tear should be interpreted with zzso
