zzso stimuli are characterized by their capability to zzso and seize available cognitive zzso Although the zzso and its zzso zzso respond to a variety of stimuli zzso defined as zzso including zzso the relationship between zzso activity and zzso is not well zzso Specifically, it is unclear if the zzso responds in an zzso fashion to salient events or instead responds in a graded fashion to the degree of zzso associated with an zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured activity in the brains of 20 participants performing a visual zzso task in which they identified single digits as odd or even zzso An auditory tone preceded each number, which was occasionally, and unexpectedly, zzso by a novel zzso The novel sounds varied in their ability to interrupt and zzso cognitive resources zzso their zzso as measured by a delay in reaction time to immediately subsequent zzso zzso The present findings demonstrate that zzso activity increases zzso to the degree to which an unexpected novel sound interferes with the current cognitive focus, even in the absence of zzso These results suggest that activity in the human zzso reflects the level of zzso associated with a zzso perhaps providing a signal to zzso limited resources to important zzso
