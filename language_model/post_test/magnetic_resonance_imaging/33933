Complete zzso of zzso zzso is necessary at initial surgery due to its poor sensitivity to zzso and zzso However, due to the zzso characteristics of this zzso zzso zzso tends to be zzso resulting in local zzso in many zzso 

The clinical features and results of surgical treatment of 13 patients with zzso zzso who were treated at the zzso Cancer Center and zzso University beginning in 1972 were zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in eight patients, marginal zzso in two patients, and wide zzso in three zzso Local recurrence was observed in six patients, with a high proportion occurring in the zzso muscles attached to the zzso (the zzso zzso muscle and zzso zzso Seven patients died of their disease and six patients were alive with no evidence of zzso The zzso survival rate was zzso and the 10-year survival rate was zzso 

It is highly possible that residual zzso zzso the zzso muscles accounts mainly for the local zzso zzso a precise zzso assessment of the tumor zzso into the zzso muscles by magnetic resonance imaging is important for the prevention of local zzso For complete tumor zzso a radical wide zzso surgical margin of the zzso muscles should be zzso A less radical anterior surgical margin is sufficient because there is a firm zzso zzso anterior to the zzso The appropriate surgical margin for the complete removal of the zzso differs according to the location of the tumor and zzso zzso
