zzso and functional imaging studies in humans have suggested that the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso A functional magnetic resonance imaging study supplemented by a behavioral experiment examined the effects of 5 zzso repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso conditioning to the right and left zzso on reaction times and synaptic activity as zzso by changes in the blood zzso zzso zzso signal during a cued choice reaction time zzso zzso zzso were either correct zzso or incorrect zzso with respect to the subsequent move zzso The effects of real and sham zzso were compared for each site of zzso zzso trials showed a significant increase in response times and increases in the zzso signal in right frontal and zzso regions when compared with valid zzso zzso left zzso with zzso led to decreased zzso signal during performance of this zzso task in areas including left zzso and left zzso Comparing invalid to valid trials after right zzso conditioning revealed decreased zzso signal in right zzso Data from the behavioral study showed that right zzso zzso selectively increases response times in invalid zzso This effect was only present in the first 10 zzso after zzso zzso No effect was found in either zzso or zzso cued trials with left zzso zzso These results suggest that 5 zzso zzso over right zzso exerts remote effects on the activity of areas that functionally interact with the zzso during zzso zzso particularly when the zzso of attention is more demanding as in invalid zzso
