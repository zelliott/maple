This paper examines the functional contribution of zzso zzso cortex, the supplementary motor area zzso to zzso zzso Previous studies have found evidence of zzso in zzso using zzso zzso tasks in which subjects make zzso zzso about simultaneously presented depth rotated novel zzso This manipulation zzso potential confounds in the cognitive demands of the task in addition to spatial zzso zzso We clarify the role of zzso in zzso zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging with a sequential zzso zzso task involving zzso zzso rotated zzso The results show preferential zzso of zzso as well as the zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso during the zzso transformation of zzso zzso
