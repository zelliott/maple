The relationship between neural activity and accompanying changes in cerebral blood flow zzso and zzso must be fully understood before data from brain imaging techniques can be correctly zzso Whether signals in zzso reflect the neural input or output of an activated region is still zzso Similarly, quantitative relationships between neural activity and changes in zzso are not well zzso The present study addresses these issues by using simultaneous laser zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso and zzso zzso to record neural activity in the form of field zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso is a zzso inverse zzso zzso Comparing the data with previous work suggests that within a cortical model, zzso shows greatest spatial correlation with a current sink 500 zzso below the surface corresponding to sensory zzso These results show that care must be exercised when interpreting imaging data zzso by particularly strong or weak stimuli and that zzso changes may better reflect the input to a region rather than its zzso zzso
