Awareness of cognitive dysfunction shown by individuals with zzso zzso zzso zzso a condition zzso risk for Alzheimer's disease zzso is zzso zzso or zzso of loss of function, is beginning to be recognized as an important clinical symptom of zzso However, little is known about the brain zzso underlying this zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso of cortical zzso structures zzso during zzso would zzso with level of insight into cognitive difficulties zzso by a zzso score between patient and informant ratings of cognitive decline in each zzso zzso To address this hypothesis, we first compared 16 zzso participants and 16 zzso controls, examining brain regions showing zzso or differential zzso response during zzso Second, we used zzso to investigate the relationship between awareness of deficit in zzso and zzso activity during zzso controlling for extent of memory zzso zzso comparisons indicated that zzso participants show subtly attenuated zzso activity during zzso zzso analysis revealed a highly significant relationship between zzso response during zzso and self-awareness of deficit in zzso This finding highlights the level of zzso in zzso as an important predictor of response to zzso in cortical zzso structures, brain regions vulnerable to changes in early zzso
