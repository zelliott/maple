Although talents and disabilities appear to run in families, direct links between genes and cognitive ability are difficult to zzso Investigators are currently searching for intermediate zzso with plausible links to both zzso and zzso (the cognitive zzso zzso anatomy could provide one such intermediate zzso Variation in cortical size, asymmetry and zzso pattern is influenced by genetic variation in zzso factors and can predict variation in verbal and mathematical zzso zzso evidence suggests that individuals with a rare zzso zzso of zzso zzso sometimes have superior zzso ability combined with verbal zzso Documentation of such zzso cortical zzso might prove as genetically zzso as the identification of zzso syndromes associated with mental zzso A necessary prerequisite for the establishment of such syndromes is a reliable technique for the identification of cortical zzso Recent technical advances in software for automatically labeling and measuring cortical zzso now provide the possibility of establishing standard measures for their shape, size and zzso Such measures are a prerequisite for genetic studies of cortical patterns that could illuminate the zzso pathways by which genes affect cognitive zzso
