To determine whether adult zzso zzso zzso are able to repair zzso joint damage in order to generate a model system for the study of zzso joint zzso 

Joint instability and zzso cartilage zzso of the knee joint of adult zzso (N zzso were induced by zzso injection of zzso The changes over time were zzso zzso by zzso zzso and by reverse zzso zzso to detect selected relevant zzso 

After rapid onset of disease with joint zzso loss of zzso and cartilage volume, the signs ameliorated continuously by zzso of the affected joint zzso The majority of zzso were zzso intact and functionally operative after 10 zzso zzso of zzso key zzso zzso expression levels of factors implicated in cartilage zzso and limb zzso as well as the distribution of the zzso marker zzso in both treated and zzso knees suggest that joint zzso in adult zzso only partially zzso pathways of zzso zzso 

zzso are able to zzso zzso cartilage injuries and to restore tissue integrity and function after induction of damage using a procedure known to induce experimental zzso in zzso zzso Further analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms may contribute to the development of novel treatment approaches in joint zzso
