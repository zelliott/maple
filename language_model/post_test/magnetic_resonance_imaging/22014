The zzso and cardiovascular anatomy is zzso We have developed a three-dimensional zzso reconstruction system for the major zzso structures using magnetic resonance imaging data on a zzso zzso The program uses a combination of automatic and manual procedures to determine the contours of the cardiac zzso The geometric centers of the contours are connected by a zzso space curve, and the central axis of each cardiac structures is zzso The contours are projected on the perpendicular plane to the central axis and zzso processed until the contours of one zzso are zzso Then the surface rendering with transparency is zzso zzso combines two images so that both appear in the zzso superimposed on each zzso zzso of the various zzso lines and cardiovascular diseases by the zzso of the partly transparent zzso images has promoted a better understanding of the complex zzso and cardiovascular anatomy and zzso
