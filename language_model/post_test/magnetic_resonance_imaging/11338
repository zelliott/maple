The transport of sodium and zzso between the zzso and zzso pools and the maintenance of the zzso concentration zzso are important to cell function and zzso The early disruption of the sodium pump in zzso zzso in response to the exhaustion of energy reserves following zzso and zzso results in increased zzso (and thus total) sodium zzso In this study a method for zzso zzso zzso sodium levels directly from sodium zzso zzso is zzso It was used to measure total zzso sodium on a clinical zzso system in six normal dogs and five dogs with zzso zzso zzso zzso The technique was validated by comparing total sodium content measured by zzso zzso with that measured by atomic zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Total sodium measured by zzso zzso was significantly elevated in regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wet zzso mean zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso tissue from both zzso dogs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and from normal controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso tissue sodium content as measured by zzso zzso did not vary regionally in the zzso zzso or inferior regions in normal hearts zzso P zzso zzso zzso content measured by zzso zzso agreed with the mean zzso estimates of zzso zzso zzso zzso wet zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal hearts, and did not differ significantly from zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, local tissue sodium levels can be accurately zzso zzso using zzso zzso in normal and acutely zzso zzso The detection of regional zzso sodium zzso may help differentiate viable from zzso zzso zzso
