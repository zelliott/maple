zzso status zzso is associated with subsequent zzso damage and development of zzso zzso sclerosis in a subset of zzso The zzso zzso model of status zzso zzso in the rat provides a model in which to investigate the molecular and zzso process leading to zzso zzso In this study, a zzso approach was used to detect zzso changes in the zzso at an early stage (2 zzso after SE, when increased zzso values were zzso by magnetic resonance zzso zzso image analysis was followed by zzso identification of protein species that differed in abundance between zzso and control zzso The most significantly zzso species in the experimental animals was identified as heat shock zzso zzso in line with findings in humans and in other experimental models of zzso Additional zzso species included zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the zzso of rats subject to zzso zzso exhibits specific changes in protein zzso which likely relate to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
