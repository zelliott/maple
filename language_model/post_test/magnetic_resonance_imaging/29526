To determine whether zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso could be used to differentiate zzso from zzso on the basis of differences in zzso levels in the different involved zzso 

Twenty-two patients (age range from 32 to 62 years, with a median age of zzso zzso with a solitary brain zzso zzso zzso eight zzso underwent zzso zzso enhanced zzso images, and zzso before surgical zzso zzso from the enhancing zzso the zzso region, and normal brain were obtained from zzso A point resolved zzso sequence was required for zzso The zzso in the zzso include: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Relative zzso of zzso were related to the peak area, and expressed with reference to zzso zzso zzso was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in relative zzso ratios between high-grade zzso and zzso Meanwhile, 16 of all 22 patients were zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso within 6 months of surgical zzso zzso was present in three patients zzso zzso one zzso 

Of the 14 patients with zzso the zzso of zzso were reduced in three zzso the zzso of zzso which were zzso appeared as typical zzso in the zzso region in nine zzso the zzso of zzso which were also zzso had a zzso appearance in seven zzso The zzso of zzso were increased in the zzso region in eight cases, and zzso levels were elevated in all 14 zzso Of the eight patients with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region in three cases and zzso zzso in the zzso region in four cases were zzso respectively, while the zzso of zzso were reduced in three cases, and the zzso of zzso were markedly reduced in four cases within the enhancing zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso ratio was zzso zzso in both the zzso and zzso regions of zzso but not in the zzso zzso ratio was zzso zzso and elevated zzso levels were present zzso ratio was zzso within the enhancing zzso of zzso but not in the zzso zzso ratio was zzso The difference was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were present in all three patients with zzso 

zzso is a useful method in the distinction of these two kinds of zzso It may also may provide useful zzso zzso
