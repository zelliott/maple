Our goal was to determine whether PET with zzso and/or zzso could predict zzso grade in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso or transformed zzso NHL were zzso zzso zzso values zzso transport rate and mass influx values were calculated both for the whole tumor zzso regions of interest, zzso and for the tumor area with the highest levels of activity, zzso four zzso zzso within each tumor and designated as a hot zzso 

Both zzso and zzso detected all zzso In addition, zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso did zzso With zzso three transformed zzso zzso behaved in an intermediate zzso All quantitative zzso values correlated well with each other for both zzso except for the mean zzso zzso and transport rate of zzso zzso of mean zzso zzso and hot spots were strongly zzso 

The results of this study together with previous findings from other studies indicate that zzso but not zzso can predict zzso grade in zzso Further studies with a larger series of patients are zzso
