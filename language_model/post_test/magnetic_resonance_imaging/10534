To assess the potential role of cerebral zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso as indicators of cerebral zzso disease, and their possible implications for zzso zzso 

The author reviewed literature published through July 2005 from electronic zzso zzso and hand zzso zzso prevalence analyses were performed for subjects without cerebrovascular disease, with zzso and with zzso cerebrovascular zzso 

zzso data from more than zzso subjects were zzso In elderly subjects without cerebrovascular disease, zzso prevalence is between zzso and zzso associated with advanced age, while data are inconsistent with regard to zzso and chronic zzso zzso are prevalent in zzso of patients with spontaneous zzso and zzso of those with zzso cerebrovascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with the highest prevalence zzso of zzso among patients with zzso zzso In patients with suspected cerebral zzso zzso zzso or zzso disease, zzso are predominantly located in the zzso zzso Current data provide no evidence that zzso increase the risk of zzso among patients on zzso treatment or those treated with zzso for acute zzso 

zzso zzso might indicate a higher risk of future zzso zzso and may be a marker of cerebral zzso disease and cerebral zzso zzso However, more prospective data are required in order to confirm these zzso zzso to guide zzso treatment based on the detection of cerebral zzso are presently not zzso
