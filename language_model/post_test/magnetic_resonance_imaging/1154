To assess the frequency, imaging findings, and significance of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the liver following partial zzso 

We zzso reviewed MR images after partial zzso in 30 zzso zzso zzso was performed in zzso months zzso zzso zzso after partial zzso We defined the zzso zzso as a zzso that was ill zzso zzso wedge zzso or zzso located along the liver zzso not visible on zzso MR zzso did not appear zzso on portal zzso or zzso zzso or a combination of those imaging zzso 

A total of 39 zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso mean, zzso zzso in 19 patients and 17 zzso tumors zzso range, zzso zzso mean, zzso zzso in 10 patients newly appeared after partial zzso The zzso zzso were diagnosed as zzso by the second zzso follow-up zzso in 17 patients or zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso A total of 13 zzso zzso zzso were located along the liver edge and 20 zzso were adjacent to the zzso zzso The shape was circular in 11 zzso oval in three zzso irregular in 11 zzso wedge shaped in five zzso and zzso in nine zzso No zzso zzso showed zzso on zzso portal zzso or zzso zzso A total of 14 zzso zzso zzso showed slight zzso on zzso zzso The confidence levels for zzso probability assigned by blinded zzso were lower with zzso zzso than with zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso are frequently seen in zzso following partial zzso and occasionally are slightly zzso on zzso images, mimicking zzso zzso However, most zzso zzso can be correctly diagnosed with zzso zzso
