zzso zzso changes have not been extensively studied for language, whereas important zzso mechanisms have been seen in other cognitive zzso This study examined age-related changes in zzso zzso during language tasks and, in particular, their dynamic zzso 

zzso was performed on 22 young and 21 old healthy right-handed subjects during a silent category zzso zzso zzso and dynamics of zzso signals were studied separately during the first and second portions of each zzso zzso 

zzso of the left frontal lobe was initially similar in young and old zzso however, it decreased after 30 s in the old zzso On the other hand, additional areas were initially involved only in old subjects and especially in the default mode zzso 

This study showed age-related differences in the dynamics of zzso zzso during a silent zzso task, suggesting a different pattern of language function with zzso
