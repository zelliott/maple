The purpose of this study was to zzso compare the efficacy of zzso MR imaging zzso zzso and CT for pulmonary functional loss assessment and clinical stage zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso CT and zzso measurement were used 34 consecutive zzso classified into four stages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Relative enhancement ratio maps for every subject were generated, and determine mean relative enhancement ratios zzso Mean lung density zzso and the airway wall area zzso corrected by body surface area zzso were also measured on zzso To compare the efficacy of the two methods for pulmonary functional loss assessment, all indexes were correlated with zzso To determine the efficacy of the two methods for clinical stage zzso all parameters for the four clinical stages were statistically zzso 

zzso showed fair or moderate correlation with all parameters zzso zzso WA, zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso group were significantly larger than those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso group significantly lower than that of the zzso zzso group zzso 

zzso zzso is as effective as CT for pulmonary functional loss assessment and clinical stage zzso of zzso
