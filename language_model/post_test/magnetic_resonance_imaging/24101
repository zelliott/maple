To evaluate the clinical efficacy of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging for zzso zzso zzso we reviewed the results of clinical phase II and III trials in zzso zzso was administered at a dose of zzso zzso to 139 patients who were suspected to have zzso Dynamic phase images zzso zzso zzso echo zzso zzso zzso images obtained within 10 minutes of injection, and delayed zzso zzso images obtained zzso minutes after injection were zzso All zzso images were compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The contrast efficacy for the dynamic study was classified as ( ) or zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso within 10 minutes of injection, and in zzso zzso with zzso zzso at delayed zzso The increase in zzso zzso ratio was best at the zzso phase of dynamic zzso zzso Liver zzso ratio showed a mean zzso increase in delayed zzso Additional information at delayed phase compared with images acquired within 10 minutes of injection (including the dynamic zzso was classified as ( ) or zzso in zzso zzso With regard to safety, the overall zzso of adverse reactions was zzso zzso of the patients who were suspected to have zzso all of whom recovered within 12 hours without any zzso No clinically important changes were observed in the blood and urine laboratory zzso It was concluded that zzso was well tolerated and effective in both dynamic study and delayed zzso imaging for the diagnosis of zzso
