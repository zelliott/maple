zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso and to zzso zzso channels zzso induce distinct courses of zzso encephalitis, related to zzso findings, seizure outcome and zzso 

A detailed analysis of the cognitive course of the two forms is zzso spanning a median time zzso of 28 months, including parameters of attention, learning and memory in 15 zzso and 16 zzso zzso 

In both groups, the initially significantly impaired attention performance recovered to a zzso zzso zzso In zzso patients the partially severely impaired learning and memory performance improved under treatment but remained zzso at last zzso By contrast, zzso patients had initially less impaired learning and memory scores but did not show an improvement under zzso 

The results provide evidence of distinct relations between zzso processes and cognitive outcome in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso encephalitis, which possibly depend on differences in zzso molecular mechanisms and affected cerebral zzso
