Several small patient studies and case reports raise concerns that the reliability of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso may be impaired in the vicinity of cerebral zzso This could affect the clinical zzso of zzso for zzso language zzso The current study sets out to identify if a systematic effect of zzso type and zzso on zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso typically occurring in zzso patients according to zzso their potential to disturb blood zzso level dependent zzso generation or detection or to disturb spatial brain zzso and zzso the proximity of zzso to zzso volumes of interest zzso The effect of zzso is evaluated through the examination of zzso zzso patients and a zzso of 37 patients with suspected unilateral zzso dominance according to the Wada zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and mass defects close to zzso or with severe zzso show lower zzso zzso zzso and more often zzso language zzso with the Wada test than do patients without such zzso 

This study points seriously toward zzso zzso being sensitive to cerebral zzso Some zzso types and locations are more critical than zzso Our results question the zzso application of zzso in patients with cerebral zzso
