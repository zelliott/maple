To examine inflammatory zzso an initial and common symptom of various types of zzso we designed zzso zzso contrast agents prepared by zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was coupled with zzso and was then zzso with zzso The specific binding of the zzso zzso complex to the zzso cells was examined in the cultured zzso cells where zzso expression was zzso zzso zzso imaging was then assessed using a mouse zzso model with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed increased zzso which was two times higher than that of zzso and showed zzso binding to cultured zzso cells, which expressed a high level of zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso enhancement was zzso with the zzso zzso in the mouse acute inflammation zzso The zzso zzso showed significantly increased vascular circulation time, which thereby offered a greater chance for its binding to the target zzso The zzso zzso displays a potential targeted zzso contrast agent specific to the inflammatory tissue that expresses zzso
