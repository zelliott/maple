zzso is the main cause of zzso zzso in the developing zzso Whether therapy with zzso agents results in improved seizure control has been questioned because of the lack of adequate, controlled zzso 

We conducted a zzso zzso trial in which 120 patients who had living zzso in the brain and zzso treated with zzso drugs were randomly assigned to receive either 800 zzso of zzso per day and 6 zzso of zzso per day for 10 days zzso zzso or two zzso zzso zzso The patients were followed for 30 months or until they had been zzso for 6 months after the doses of the zzso drugs had been zzso The efficacy of treatment was measured as the decrease in the number of zzso after zzso 

In the zzso group, there was a 46 percent reduction in the number of zzso (95 percent confidence zzso zzso to 83 percent) during months 2 to 30 after zzso This reduction, which was not statistically zzso was composed of a zzso reduction of 41 percent in the number of partial zzso (95 percent confidence zzso zzso to 84 percent) and a significant 67 percent reduction in the number of zzso with zzso (95 percent confidence zzso 20 to 86 zzso Most of the difference in the number of partial zzso was attributable to a few patients who had many zzso during zzso The proportions of patients who had partial zzso during follow-up were similar in the two groups (19 of 57 in the zzso group and 16 of 59 in the zzso group), but the patients in the zzso group had a greater tendency to have zzso with zzso zzso of 59, zzso 13 of 57 in the zzso zzso risk ratio, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso More of the zzso zzso zzso resolved in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso With the sole exception of abdominal pain, side effects did not differ significantly between the two zzso 

In patients with zzso due to viable zzso zzso zzso therapy decreases the burden of zzso and is safe and effective, at least in reducing the number of zzso with zzso
