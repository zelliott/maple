We compare the evidence from human zzso studies for and against two of the major hypotheses of how zzso in the zzso reward system zzso zzso One of these, the zzso hypothesis, proposes that addiction is characterized by excessive sensitivity to reward combined with a failure of zzso The other, the zzso hypothesis, proposes that addicted individuals have a reduced response to zzso rewards that leads them to seek drugs in preference to more socially acceptable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso density and zzso release strongly support the zzso hypothesis, while the more recent and numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of zzso behavior provide both support and contradiction for each of the zzso zzso in the time scale on which PET and zzso make zzso probably account for differences in results, at least in zzso It is likely that aspects of brain function described by both the zzso and zzso hypotheses contribute to the zzso of zzso
