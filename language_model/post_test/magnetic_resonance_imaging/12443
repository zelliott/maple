We undertook to provide data regarding zzso zzso of swallow function obtained by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging in a zzso plane and to compare these values to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso healthy female volunteers with no swallowing complaints underwent zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging with a zzso scanner while swallowing liquid and pudding zzso delivered via zzso zzso sequential images were acquired with a zzso resolution of 113 zzso per frame for each zzso The imaging was performed in the zzso zzso The analyses focused on oral and zzso transit zzso 

All subjects tolerated the protocol without complaints or adverse zzso The mean zzso zzso oral transit times for liquids and pudding were measured as zzso zzso zzso second and zzso zzso zzso second, zzso This difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso transit times for liquids and pudding were measured as zzso zzso zzso second and zzso zzso zzso seconds, zzso This difference achieved statistical significance zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso were zzso 

This sequence provided a high degree of zzso resolution of zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso acquired with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging were reliable and were relatively consistent with those of previous studies done with zzso
