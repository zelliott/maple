To date, functional imaging studies of zzso recovery from chronic zzso only assessed short-term treatment effects after intensive language zzso In the present study, we show with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso that different brain regions may be involved in immediate versus long-term success of intensive language training in chronic zzso zzso zzso 

Eight patients were trained daily for three hours over a period of two weeks in naming of concrete zzso Prior to, immediately after, and eight months after training, patients overtly named trained and untrained objects during zzso zzso On average the patients improved from zero (at zzso to zzso correct naming responses immediately after training, and treatment success remained highly stable at zzso zzso analyses showed that the degree of short-term treatment success was predicted by increased activity zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso formation, the right zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso A different picture emerged for long-term training success, which was best predicted by activity increases in the zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser degree in zzso zzso zzso 

The results show for the first time that zzso language recovery in the chronic stage after stroke is a dynamic zzso Initially, brain regions involved in memory zzso attention, and zzso integration zzso treatment zzso In contrast, long-term treatment success was predicted mainly by activity increases in the so-called zzso language zzso The results suggest that besides zzso and zzso zzso regions, functional integrity of zzso memory structures may be a prerequisite for successful zzso language zzso
