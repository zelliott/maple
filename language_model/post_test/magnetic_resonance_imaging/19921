In zzso zzso of zzso cancer, dose escalation without increased adverse effects could be achieved with a zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we zzso zzso the fraction of patients suitable for this approach, and zzso the potential of zzso zzso zzso to achieve this boost while also sparing normal zzso 

The fraction of patients suitable for this boost approach was zzso using both a series of 30 radical therapy candidates, and a series of 15 consecutive zzso zzso zzso plans with 3, 5, 7 and 9 zzso beams were set up for the patients in the zzso series found suitable for a zzso Two sets of targets were zzso with zzso wide and zzso narrow margins around both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The inverse planning zzso zzso the dose zzso across the targets whilst fulfilling zzso zzso zzso zzso on what could be achieved with zzso zzso zzso both the normal zzso and the zzso 

Fourteen of the 30 radical therapy candidates zzso and 10 of the 15 zzso patients zzso were suitable for a zzso The zzso boost could be obtained while maintaining target coverage with at least one zzso plan in 9 of 10 cases with wide margins and for all 10 cases with narrow zzso Using wide margins, all zzso plans were unacceptable, the zzso plans were acceptable for 5 of 10, and the 7- and zzso plans for 9 of the 10 zzso The normal tissue volumes receiving doses zzso were on average reduced by a factor of zzso compared with zzso The normal tissue volumes receiving intermediate doses zzso decreased slightly, whereas volumes receiving the lowest doses zzso increased with the number of zzso The use of narrow margins resulted in markedly lower normal tissue zzso 

This study has shown zzso zzso boosting to be both clinically relevant and technically feasible using zzso This approach is ready for clinical zzso although further improvement could be expected if integrated with target zzso zzso
