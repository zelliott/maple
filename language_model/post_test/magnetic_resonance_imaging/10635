With increasing numbers of in zzso experiments in the field of zzso the interest in methods for in zzso imaging of animal brains as small as those of mice has zzso Because highly specialized small bore scanners with high field strengths are not commonly available, clinical magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanners have been used in the past to image rat and more recently also mouse brains in combination with specifically developed zzso zzso These studies have demonstrated that imaging of small animal brains is zzso and that tumor volumes measured by zzso correlate well with zzso tumor volume zzso This protocol describes the zzso settings at zzso T for imaging of mouse brain with resolutions up to 120 zzso 120 zzso using an zzso commercially available small loop surface zzso This allows easy establishment of a small animal zzso facility without the need for cost intensive dedicated small animal scanners or special custom made zzso In this study, we demonstrate high-resolution imaging of zzso zzso in a mouse zzso model and monitor the treatment effect of external field zzso by zzso
