zzso lines of evidence have implicated the zzso in the zzso of zzso stress disorder zzso We previously developed a method for measuring automatic zzso responses to general zzso zzso in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we used a passive viewing task involving masked presentations of human facial zzso 

We applied this method to study veterans with zzso and a comparison cohort of zzso veterans without zzso 

The findings indicate that patients with zzso exhibit exaggerated zzso responses to zzso versus zzso zzso 

Although some previous zzso studies of zzso have demonstrated zzso recruitment in response to reminders of traumatic events, this represents the first evidence for exaggerated zzso responses to general negative stimuli in zzso Furthermore, by using a probe that emphasizes zzso we provide initial evidence of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso influences of zzso frontal zzso
