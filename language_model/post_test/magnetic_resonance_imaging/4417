Studies addressing the issue of regional function in zzso zzso patients zzso are zzso The relationship between regional wall thickness and function in these patients was studied by three zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso utilizing the zzso zzso Regional function was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and related to the local thickness and wall stress zzso An inverse relationship was found between wall zzso and thickness as well as between zzso zzso and wall zzso Lower stresses were obtained for thicker zzso zzso zzso of the zzso regions was enhanced in the zzso patients relative to the normal zzso zzso segments in patients with zzso are thus characterized by reduced zzso function, which occurs at segments with relatively low stress zzso This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that the thick zzso segments have reduced zzso activity, probably due to recently identified zzso in the gene responsible for production of beta heavy chain zzso as well as other zzso zzso
