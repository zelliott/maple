zzso of the leg muscles is a serious consequence of disuse and occurs with prolonged exposure to zzso We investigated whether intense zzso training on a cycle zzso would prevent muscle changes during unilateral lower limb suspension zzso 

This study involved 11 healthy men who were divided into 2 groups, one with training on a cycle zzso zzso zzso and the other a control group zzso zzso zzso performed intense zzso training (up to zzso of maximum heart zzso on alternate days during 20 d of zzso zzso voluntary contraction zzso of the zzso zzso and volume of the thigh muscle were measured before and after zzso Muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso which reflects the zzso activity of the zzso muscle, were acquired during zzso dynamic knee extension zzso 

The zzso was significantly decreased in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The total volume of the thigh muscles was maintained in zzso zzso however, a significant decrease was found in zzso zzso The zzso signal increase for zzso exercise did not change for zzso however, it significantly increased for zzso 

Although the power of this study was zzso these results suggest that training on a cycle zzso zzso some of the effects of unloading and merits further study as a potential zzso for muscle changes in zzso
