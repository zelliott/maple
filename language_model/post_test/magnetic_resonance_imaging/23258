Most studies involving spontaneous fluctuations in the zzso signal extract connectivity patterns that show relationships between brain areas that are maintained over the length of the scanning zzso In this study, however, we examine the zzso dynamics of the zzso fluctuations to identify common patterns of propagation within a zzso A novel pattern finding zzso was developed for detecting repeated zzso patterns in zzso zzso zzso The zzso was applied to high zzso resolution zzso zzso images obtained from rats and humans in the absence of any task or zzso In rats, the primary pattern consisted of waves of high signal intensity, zzso in a lateral to zzso direction across the cortex, replicating our previous findings zzso et zzso zzso These waves were observed primarily in zzso cortex, but also extended to visual and zzso association zzso A secondary pattern, confined to zzso regions consisted of an initial increase and subsequent decrease in signal intensity in the zzso In humans, the most common zzso pattern consisted of an zzso between zzso of areas zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso prefrontal zzso and the zzso zzso superior zzso and zzso zzso zzso Signal propagation from focal starting points was also zzso The pattern finding zzso was shown to be reasonably insensitive to the variation in zzso zzso and the results were consistent within and between zzso This novel approach for probing the spontaneous network activity of the brain has implications for the interpretation of conventional functional connectivity studies, and may increase the amount of information that can be obtained from zzso zzso
