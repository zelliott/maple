zzso is zzso by both zzso abnormalities and consistent changes in the structure of cortical zzso zzso But the relationship between these two observations is largely zzso zzso changes reported in schizophrenia include reduced zzso matter volume, thickness and surface area in several cortical regions, but most frequently in the zzso and anterior zzso zzso These two regions together constitute an intrinsic brain circuit known as the zzso zzso which has a key role in stimulus zzso During stimulus processing tasks, evoked activity is noted using zzso zzso Phase zzso of ongoing zzso contributes to this evoked zzso zzso zzso play a crucial role in cerebral recruitment during cognitive tasks, and influencing the zzso phase can zzso cortical zzso and the transition between various cognitive zzso At a network level, such a transition or switch is thought to be enabled by the zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the relationship between the cortical thickness in the zzso Network zzso using zzso and the degree of phase zzso observed during an oddball task zzso using zzso in 18 zzso male patients in a clinically stable phase of schizophrenia and 20 age and gender matched healthy zzso We obtained a measure of partial phase zzso after a stimulus is zzso and a second measure representing mean evoked activity, using the methods proposed by zzso Using zzso analysis, we have zzso shown that there is a significant loss of cortical thickness of regions that constitute the zzso Network in patients with zzso zzso analysis revealed that in healthy controls, the expected relationship between phase zzso and evoked electrical activity is observed, but in patients with schizophrenia the zzso phase zzso is a weak predictor of the activity evoked by attending to a target zzso though the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance in the present zzso Furthermore, in patients with schizophrenia the reduced thickness in the zzso Network is associated with the inefficient phase zzso of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso matter reduction seen in the zzso Network in patients with schizophrenia has substantial functional zzso In particular, the structural zzso of the zzso that is seen in schizophrenia is likely to be associated with less efficient recruitment of brain circuits for processing zzso This implies a possible mechanism by which disruptions in the intrinsic zzso Network can result in a general zzso in zzso detection seen in zzso
