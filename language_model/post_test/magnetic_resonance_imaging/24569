This study investigates neural zzso of zzso fear and joy with zzso Studies on neural zzso of zzso fear are zzso and there are only a few studies on neural zzso of joy in zzso zzso individuals listened to excerpts of zzso zzso as well as neutral music and rated their own emotional state in terms of zzso zzso fear, and zzso zzso show that zzso signal intensity increased during zzso and decreased during fear zzso to the neutral zzso in bilateral auditory zzso zzso and bilateral superficial zzso zzso In the right primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals increased during exposure to zzso zzso While zzso activity in zzso increased with increasing duration of each trial, zzso responded zzso in the beginning of the zzso and then zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed extensive zzso functional connectivity of zzso with zzso zzso cortex, as well as with zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings show that the auditory zzso functions as a central hub of an zzso network that is more extensive than previously zzso zzso analyses also showed functional connectivity of zzso with zzso during the joy condition, taken to reflect that zzso is sensitive to social signals with positive zzso During fear music, zzso showed functional connectivity with visual zzso and area 7 of the superior zzso zzso taken to reflect increased visual alertness and an zzso shift of attention during the perception of auditory signals of zzso
