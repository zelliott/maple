Muscle volume investigation by different imaging techniques has proven useful in the diagnosis and follow up of treatment in zzso zzso However, no study on muscle volume measurement by magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been done in this zzso 

Six patients with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and eight controls were examined with zzso zzso using a surface zzso In the muscle volume study, 2 zzso zzso slices were used for measuring the six zzso muscles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso zzso superior zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso muscles, as well as the zzso fatty tissue zzso In the muscle thickness study, 3 zzso zzso and zzso images were used for measuring the four zzso muscles during fixation in different gaze positions in horizontal and vertical zzso 

In zzso zzso the muscle volume of the six external eye muscles was significantly larger than in controls, except for the zzso The zzso and MR showed the largest increase in muscle zzso The correlation between muscle thickness and different degrees of eye zzso was linear for all four zzso muscles both in patients and controls, and no significant differences in the slopes of the zzso lines were zzso The volume of zzso was significantly larger in patients than in controls, and the change in volume was larger than that of muscle zzso 

zzso technique makes it possible to observe and evaluate zzso the volume of all six zzso muscles and the zzso fatty tissue in zzso zzso It also makes it possible to evaluate changes in zzso during eye muscle zzso
