The tongue is a zzso object, and moves by zzso or expanding local functional zzso For any single zzso these functional tongue segments may move in similar or opposite directions, and may reach target maximum zzso or zzso This paper will discuss the independence of five proposed segments in the production of zzso Three studies used ultrasound and zzso zzso to explore the independence of the tongue zzso High correlations between tongue segments would suggest passive zzso constraints and low correlations would suggest active independent zzso Both zzso and higher level linguistic constraints were seen in the correlation zzso zzso constraints were supported by high correlations between adjacent segments zzso and distant segments zzso zzso constraints were supported by zzso correlations that changed with the zzso content of the zzso
