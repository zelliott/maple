zzso zzso zzso impairment and cerebral white matter zzso zzso are associated in elderly or patients with overt cerebral zzso Such association has not been confirmed for zzso middle-aged individuals with risk factors for zzso We assessed the relationship between the zzso and the presence of zzso in a middle-aged zzso cohort of zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso examination were performed in 54 zzso men, all at 60 years of age, without a history of stroke, zzso deficits, or carotid zzso The zzso of the middle cerebral artery zzso was expressed as the zzso zzso reserve zzso 

zzso were detected in 22 men zzso all zzso were classified as mild zzso grade of the zzso modified zzso The zzso was lower in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to those without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The lower zzso in patients with zzso was consistent after controlling for zzso A higher zzso index zzso in subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to those without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was not consistent after controlling for zzso 

The zzso was lower in middle-aged zzso men with zzso compared to those without zzso indicating that even a low load of zzso may reflect some functional impairment of the cerebral zzso
