The zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and its connected zzso have been heavily implicated in emotional functioning in zzso major depressive disorder zzso While several recent studies have examined zzso functional connectivity zzso in depressed youth at rest, no studies to date have investigated zzso zzso in adolescent depression during negative emotional zzso 

zzso zzso adolescents with zzso and 19 matched healthy controls zzso performed an implicit fear facial affect recognition task during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We defined seeds in bilateral zzso and assessed zzso using the zzso interaction zzso We also applied cognitive behavioral modeling to estimate group differences in zzso sensitivity in this zzso Finally, we correlated connectivity strength with clinical data and zzso zzso 

zzso adolescents showed increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso frontal zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with depression severity zzso zzso Lastly, zzso adolescents exhibited poorer zzso sensitivity in the task than zzso and individual differences in zzso sensitivity significantly correlated with zzso zzso and depression scores zzso zzso 

zzso were clinically zzso possibly limiting zzso of the zzso 

Adolescent depression is associated with biased processing of negative stimuli that may be driven by zzso zzso and may possibly lead to an imbalance among intrinsic functional brain zzso This work also establishes the use of combining zzso and cognitive behavioral modeling methods to investigate cognitive and neural differences between psychiatric and healthy zzso
