In functional zzso studies of episodic retrieval zzso zzso in zzso zzso anterior cingulate, and zzso regions are typically attributed to episodic retrieval zzso However, these zzso are also frequent during visual attention zzso tasks, suggesting that their role in zzso may reflect zzso rather than zzso zzso To investigate this possibility, we directly compared brain activity during zzso and VA tasks using zzso zzso The zzso task was a word recognition test with a retrieval mode zzso and the VA task was a target detection task with a sustained attention zzso The study yielded three main zzso First, a common zzso network was found for zzso and VA, suggesting that the involvement of these regions during zzso reflects general zzso zzso This idea is compatible with some of the interpretations proposed in the zzso literature zzso zzso zzso which may be zzso in terms of zzso zzso Second, several zzso were zzso involved in zzso versus zzso For example, the zzso zzso and the zzso were more activated for zzso than for VA, possibly reflecting retrieval mode and processing of internally generated zzso zzso Finally, the study yielded an unexpected zzso some zzso zzso lobe regions were similarly activated for zzso and zzso This finding suggests that the zzso zzso zzso may be involved in indexing representations within the focus of consciousness, regardless of whether they are zzso or zzso Overall, the present results suggest that many of the zzso attributed to specific cognitive zzso such as episodic memory, may actually reflect more general cognitive zzso
