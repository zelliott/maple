The purpose of our study was to determine the zzso value of normal stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging zzso by a systematic literature review and zzso 

A comprehensive literature search of published studies through November 2011 in zzso database and Cochrane Library, regarding zzso value of stress zzso in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, was zzso 

Ultimately, we identified 11 zzso The summary relative risk ratio for major adverse cardiac events was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for normal zzso zzso The summary relative risk ratio for hard cardiac events was zzso zzso zzso zzso for normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for normal zzso zzso 

zzso stress zzso for patients known or suspected of having coronary artery disease has good zzso value in predicting cardiac zzso
