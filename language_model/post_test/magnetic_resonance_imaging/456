zzso zzso rhythms are zzso zzso between zzso zzso distinguished from alpha by having more anterior distribution and being zzso by motor rather than visual zzso Evidence accumulating during the last decade suggests that the zzso of zzso rhythms zzso zzso might be also a manifestation of a human zzso zzso System zzso To further explore this hypothesis we used a paradigm that, in a previous zzso study, successfully activated this putative zzso in zzso Our direct goal was to provide further support for a link between zzso of zzso rhythms and the zzso by finding parallels between the reported patterns of zzso zzso and patterns of zzso zzso The zzso power in the zzso range has been recorded while participants passively observed either a left or a right hand, reaching to and grasping objects, and compared it with that recorded while participants observed the movement of a ball, and while observing zzso grasping scenes or still zzso zzso zzso results zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso during object and action zzso zzso 47, zzso zzso suppression was larger in the zzso zzso to the moving hand and larger when the hands zzso different objects in different ways than when the movement was zzso No suppression was found while participants observed still objects but zzso suppression was also found while seeing zzso grasping zzso These data are discussed in light of similar parallels between zzso of alpha waves and zzso while recording zzso in the zzso The present data support a link between zzso suppression and a human zzso
