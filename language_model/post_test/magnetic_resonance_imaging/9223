The aim of this study is to conduct in zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging of labeled rat bone zzso stem cells zzso as they home into the site of injured common carotid artery following zzso zzso Our study was approved by the Institutional Committee on Animal zzso zzso rat zzso were dual labeled with zzso iron oxide zzso particle and fluorescent zzso zzso and subsequently transplanted into recipient rats injured in the left common carotid zzso Immediately before and 3 zzso 3, 7 and 12 days after zzso the labeled cells were monitored in zzso using a zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratios zzso at the injured sites were zzso with zzso examination using zzso blue zzso and fluorescent zzso zzso zzso were labeled with zzso and zzso at zzso zzso When compared with the baseline level before zzso the zzso decreased significantly on Days 3 and 7 after injection in the experimental group zzso zzso test, P zzso zzso whereas insignificant differences were observed after 3 zzso and 12 days zzso zzso test, P zzso zzso In the control group, no significant differences in zzso were found among different time points zzso P zzso zzso zzso analyses illustrated that red zzso and zzso zzso cells were mainly distributed around the zzso areas of injured common carotid zzso zzso zzso can be efficiently labeled with zzso and zzso and the directional zzso of labeled cells to the site of injured common carotid arteries after zzso transplantation could be tracked in zzso with zzso zzso
