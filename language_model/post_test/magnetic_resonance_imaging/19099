We present a case of right lung zzso cell zzso that had zzso the main pulmonary artery and superior pulmonary zzso causing multiple pulmonary zzso in the right upper and middle zzso Multiple peripheral pulmonary zzso showed clinical features that are characteristic of pulmonary zzso rapid appearance and gradual reduction in size, zzso zzso density with a truncated zzso and a round zzso shadow with a blurred margin and a centrally directed linear zzso The zzso were more intense than the primary tumor in both zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso We conclude that pulmonary zzso can look like a zzso when lung cancer invades both the pulmonary artery and vein and that such cases can be distinguished from pulmonary zzso by zzso zzso zzso and a series of zzso zzso
