zzso coated, zzso and zzso acid hybrid zzso zzso zzso clusters zzso were zzso using either a zzso method or a zzso zzso After careful characterization of the size, structure, zzso and magnetic properties, the zzso zzso were used for cell labeling while the MR detection sensitivity of cells labeled with zzso zzso was performed with a 3 T whole body MR zzso zzso investigations revealed that the sizes of the zzso were about 200 zzso and the zzso mainly consisted of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso acid or polystyrene zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso were highly zzso charged and zzso zzso were positively zzso zzso zzso revealed that these zzso possessed a very high MR sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso 299 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 124 zzso zzso especially for the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso 360 zzso zzso Furthermore, when used for cell zzso zzso zzso the zzso had no adverse effect on cell zzso and the cell zzso of the zzso show a zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging of cells labeled with zzso zzso indicated that cells with a concentration as low as 10 zzso zzso cells zzso could be detected with a 3 T zzso zzso Our study demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso clusters are a sensitive tool for cell zzso
