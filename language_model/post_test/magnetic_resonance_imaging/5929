In tasks of zzso learning, animals establish new links between unrelated items by using information about trial outcome to strengthen zzso associations and modify zzso zzso To study how zzso zzso convey information about reward and trial outcome during new zzso learning, we recorded zzso zzso as monkeys learned novel zzso zzso A large population of zzso zzso zzso signaled trial outcome by zzso between correct and error trials during the period after the behavioral zzso About half these cells increased their activity following correct trials zzso up zzso while the remaining half fired more following error trials zzso up zzso Moreover, correct up cells, but not error up cells, conveyed information about learning by increasing their zzso response properties with behavioral zzso These findings suggest that information about successful trial outcome conveyed by correct up cells may influence new zzso learning through changes in the cell's zzso response zzso
