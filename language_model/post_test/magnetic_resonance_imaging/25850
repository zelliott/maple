To perform a prospective study to compare the ability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and computer assisted zzso zzso to predict the position of a zzso within the zzso zzso and to assess the clarity of the image generated by the two zzso in patients with suspected zzso zzso 

zzso patients were investigated with CT and zzso scans and underwent zzso exploration of the zzso zzso Both scans were assessed blind and independently by three zzso A, B, and zzso A and B examined the CT scans and B and C the zzso zzso The predicted site was then compared to the size and position of the zzso at zzso 

Twenty-five patients were recruited and had both CT and zzso scans, 19 subsequently underwent zzso exploration of the zzso zzso and formed the study zzso 

The joint opinions of A and B of the CT scans were correct in zzso and those of B and C of the zzso scans were correct in zzso cases, P zzso zzso Observer agreement was used to assess the clarity of the zzso A and B agreed about the site of the zzso on the CT scan in 14 of 19 cases zzso statistic zzso B and C agreed on the zzso scans in zzso cases zzso statistic 1), P zzso zzso After the exclusion of five cases found to be zzso at surgery, the joint opinions of A and B of the CT scans were correct in zzso and those of B and C of the zzso scans were correct in zzso cases, P zzso zzso A and B agreed about the site of the zzso on the CT scan in zzso cases zzso statistic zzso B and C agreed on the zzso scans in zzso cases zzso statistic 1, no significant zzso 

In the assessment of suspected zzso zzso zzso is the imaging technique of choice in view both of its greater diagnostic accuracy and the avoidance of radiation zzso
