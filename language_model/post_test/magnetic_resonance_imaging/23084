Besides the fact that zzso in cognitive tasks are affected by the specific demands of a trial, the context in which this trial occurs zzso the speed of the zzso For instance, invalid spatial cues generally prolong zzso to targets in the zzso zzso whereas the magnitude of these zzso costs additionally varies as a function of the preceding trial types so that zzso for invalid trials may be increased when preceded by valid rather than invalid zzso In the present zzso study, we investigated trial sequence effects in a combined oddball and zzso zzso In particular, we tested whether zzso and neural activity to zzso invalid or zzso targets varied as a function of the number of preceding valid standard zzso As expected, zzso in invalid and zzso trials were significantly slower when more valid standard trials had been presented zzso This behavioral effect was reflected in the neural activity of the right zzso frontal zzso where the zzso of the zzso response in invalid and zzso trials was positively related to the number of preceding valid standard zzso In contrast, decreased activity zzso a negative zzso zzso zzso was observed when more valid standard trials were successively zzso Further positive zzso effects for the number of preceding valid standard trials were observed in the left zzso nucleus and zzso zzso The data suggest that inferior frontal zzso extracts both event zzso and irregularities in event zzso
