This study evaluates magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the detection of surgically created zzso defects in bovine zzso A total of 26 zzso defects was created in 2 fresh zzso zzso zzso The defects created include zzso grade 2 zzso zzso and zzso defects from 3 to 15 zzso in zzso The knee zzso were repaired in a normal saline bath to exclude air in the joint prior to MR zzso zzso weighted spin echo zzso images and zzso zzso echo zzso 40 degrees zzso images were zzso The zzso weighted zzso imaging technique detected 15 defects zzso compared with zzso zzso imaging technique detection of 17 defects zzso The two techniques combined enable 21 of 26 defects zzso to be zzso The imaging techniques used in this study were not able to detect zzso defects less than 10 zzso in diameter, nor zzso defects less than 5 zzso in zzso However, small zzso defects of 3 zzso in diameter are zzso provided the depth of the zzso is not less than 10 zzso The zzso zzso imaging technique alone is more sensitive in detecting zzso zzso Both imaging techniques have similarly high sensitivities in detecting zzso zzso The imaging time for combined zzso weighted zzso and zzso zzso sequence is short zzso zzso and this combined technique may be useful for MR scanning of knee zzso suspected to have zzso zzso
