Despite advances in zzso and zzso treatment, spinal zzso zzso remains a challenging problem; early diagnosis is often difficult and treatment is zzso zzso management is zzso and morbidity and mortality are zzso To define contemporary trends in zzso and management, and establish diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines, we reviewed our 10-year experience with spinal zzso zzso 

We examined medical records, laboratory data, zzso zzso and zzso studies, and operative reports from 75 cases of spinal zzso zzso between 1983 and zzso zzso zzso frequency, clinical features, zzso risk factors, surgical and medical treatment, and outcome were zzso 

We found a significant increase in the frequency of spinal zzso zzso over the 10-year period zzso zzso zzso zzso drug abuse was present in 28 patients zzso diabetes zzso in 22 patients zzso and prior spinal surgery in 11 patients zzso Back pain, progressive zzso deficit, and low grade fever remained the distinguishing diagnostic zzso zzso zzso rate was elevated in 48 of 50 patients zzso peripheral zzso count was elevated in 45 patients zzso zzso was the most effective technique for diagnosing spinal zzso zzso revealing or suggesting the diagnosis in all 59 patients zzso zzso Sites of spinal zzso zzso were equally distributed along the spinal zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso zzso of patients, with zzso having a zzso zzso zzso of patients had zzso zzso Most patients had open surgical drainage followed by prolonged zzso zzso 22 patients were managed with antibiotics alone; 50 patients zzso had a good clinical outcome after zzso Multiple medical problems, prior spinal surgery, and zzso zzso were correlated with a significantly worse zzso 

The frequency of diagnosis of spinal zzso zzso is zzso To prevent serious morbidity and zzso early diagnosis is zzso Patients with localized back pain who are at risk for developing such zzso or who have an increased zzso zzso rate and/or zzso deficit should have an immediate zzso scan with contrast zzso zzso drainage and prolonged zzso use are the zzso of treatment, although selected patients may be treated zzso
