The image analysis and kinetic modeling methods used in dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the kidney are zzso Image analysis includes various techniques of zzso and zzso Few methods have been completely zzso Nevertheless, the use of zzso may become a standard to decrease the effect of motion on abdominal images and improve the quality of the zzso zzso zzso models are classified into three zzso zzso external and internal zzso zzso representations are limited to a basic analysis of the zzso concentration zzso in the zzso Their relationship to the underlying physiology is complex and zzso However, they can be used to evaluate the split zzso zzso External representations assess the kidney input and zzso An external representation based on the zzso of the zzso enhancement to calculate the zzso zzso is commonly used because of its zzso In contrast, external representation based on zzso or identification methods remain zzso For zzso zzso an internal representation based on a zzso model is mostly zzso Internal representations based on zzso models describe the zzso function in a more realistic zzso Because of their zzso complexity, these models remain rarely zzso
