To test the hypothesis that zzso alters functional zzso during a semantic decision language zzso 

With institutional review board approval and written informed zzso 18 zzso cognitively healthy elderly participants with an zzso zzso zzso volume of more than 25 zzso and 18 zzso control participants with less than 5 zzso of zzso underwent functional MR imaging to allow comparison of zzso during semantic decisions with that during visual zzso zzso Brain statistical maps were derived from the general linear zzso zzso zzso group zzso maps were created from individual contrast zzso A cluster extent threshold of 215 zzso was used to correct for multiple zzso zzso random effects analysis was zzso Language zzso indexes were calculated for each zzso 

In control participants, semantic decisions activated the bilateral visual cortex, left zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso left frontal lobe expressive language regions, and left zzso zzso Visual zzso decisions activated the right zzso and zzso zzso zzso Participants with zzso showed reduced zzso in all regions associated with semantic zzso however, zzso associated with visual zzso decisions increased in zzso zzso analysis showed significant zzso decreases in the left anterior zzso lobe zzso right zzso zzso lobe zzso and right zzso zzso zzso in zzso with zzso Individual participant zzso indexes showed a strong trend zzso toward greater left zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with zzso functional zzso during semantic decision zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso variable in functional MR imaging studies of elderly zzso
