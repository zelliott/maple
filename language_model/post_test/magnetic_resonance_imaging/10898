zzso zzso is known to cause zzso of zzso nerve terminals after acute doses in zzso Similarly, behavioral studies in human zzso users regularly find abnormalities in memory, mood, and impulse zzso However, studies of brain function using brain imaging in zzso users have been less zzso 

The purpose of this study was to zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso whether individuals with a zzso history of zzso use would differ from zzso using controls on zzso while performing a working memory zzso 

Fifteen zzso using subjects and 19 zzso using controls underwent zzso scanning while performing the immediate and delayed memory task zzso The study was based on a block design in which the delayed memory task zzso zzso with the immediate memory task zzso which served as a control zzso zzso scans were acquired on a zzso T zzso using a zzso echo zzso pulse zzso 

Random effects zzso analysis showed significantly greater zzso zzso volume corrected cluster zzso during the zzso relative to the zzso in the zzso subjects compared with the control subjects in the zzso superior frontal zzso in the zzso extending into zzso and in the zzso 

Although these effects could be due to other drugs used by zzso users, these results are consistent with behavioral problems that are associated with zzso use, and with animal studies on the effects of zzso on brain zzso
