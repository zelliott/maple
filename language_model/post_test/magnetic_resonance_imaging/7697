A previous study showed promising results for zzso as a zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agent in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to zzso confirm the diagnostic performance of zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso cancer in a second patient zzso 

Seventy-one zzso cancer patients were zzso included, of whom 13 zzso I) underwent a primary staging zzso zzso zzso followed by surgery zzso zzso 5 zzso 5 zzso and 58 zzso zzso underwent both primary staging and restaging zzso zzso after a long course of zzso followed by zzso zzso status was scored as zzso or zzso by two independent readers zzso zzso with different experience zzso zzso were correlated with zzso on a zzso zzso 

zzso specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve zzso were zzso zzso and zzso for the more experienced zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso performance improved considerably after a learning curve, to an zzso of zzso zzso mainly occurred in zzso located in the superior zzso zzso located in between vessels and zzso containing zzso 

This prospective study confirms the good diagnostic performance of zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso shows high performance for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may facilitate better selection of patients for zzso zzso zzso zzso can be reproduced by zzso zzso zzso Experience of zzso cases is required to achieve required expertise zzso zzso Main pitfalls are zzso located between vessels and zzso containing zzso
