Blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso are new techniques of brain functional imaging which can provide the information of zzso of zzso by measure the changes of zzso and zzso data of local brain zzso The purpose of this study was to study functional brain areas evoked by pure tones in healthy and zzso hearing loss subjects with these techniques and to compare the differences between the two zzso 

Thirty healthy and 30 zzso hearing loss subjects were included in this zzso In zzso zzso paradigm was zzso During the active zzso the participants listened to 1000 zzso sound pressure level 140 zzso pure tones at duration 500 zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso which presented continuously via a magnetic zzso audio zzso None stimulus was executed in control zzso In zzso study, every subject received stimuli of 1000 zzso tone bursts delivered to the bilateral ear at duration 8 zzso zzso intervals 1000 zzso Sound pressure level in healthy subjects was 30 zzso in zzso hearing loss subjects was 20 zzso above everyone's hearing threshold zzso All subjects were examined with zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso all subjects showed significant zzso in bilateral zzso zzso anterior pole of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso The healthy subjects had more intensive zzso in bilateral zzso zzso anterior pole of zzso zzso inferior frontal zzso left superior zzso zzso and right zzso zzso than the hearing loss zzso But in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso is more intensive in the hearing loss zzso In zzso study, both in the hearing loss and the healthy subjects, the most evident audio evoked fields activated by pure tone were zzso which located precisely on the zzso zzso Compared with the hearing loss subjects, zzso of the healthy subjects was stronger and had longer zzso in right zzso 

Under proper pure tone stimulus the zzso of auditory zzso can be zzso both in the healthy and the zzso hearing loss zzso Either at objective equivalent stimuli or at zzso perceived equivalent zzso the auditory responses were more intensive in healthy subjects than hearing loss zzso The tone stimuli were processed in a network in human brain and there was an intrinsic relation between the auditory and visual zzso Blood oxygen level dependent zzso and zzso could reinforce each zzso
