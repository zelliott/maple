We present a novel approach to the nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso analysis of complex samples with zzso distribution of zzso relaxation rate zzso zzso enabled relaxation filters with double and multiple inversion zzso aim to separate signals arising from components with different zzso values prior to actual data zzso Given any standard zzso pulse zzso which, by itself, is insensitive to differences in zzso values, it can be combined with a zzso zzso which functions as a preliminary zzso filter and zzso on the original technique sensitivity to the dimension zzso This article states the principles of the approach, including the way to account for instrumental zzso and shows how zzso with specific filter profile functions can be zzso Using terms borrowed from electronics, these filters are classified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also included are an experimental zzso example and a discussion of potential applications of zzso in various zzso zzso
