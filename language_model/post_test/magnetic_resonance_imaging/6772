To determine and compare the imaging features of zzso zzso zzso using color zzso zzso CT, and zzso 

zzso CT and zzso with and without contrast agents and color zzso US were performed on seven patients with zzso zzso zzso The zzso were evaluated for location, features of zzso intensity and density, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The diagnosis was confirmed zzso in all zzso 

Six patients had solitary zzso and one displayed multiple zzso The zzso were generally seen as zzso and zzso or zzso when zzso with color zzso zzso zzso with CT, and zzso with zzso in comparison with the liver zzso zzso central zzso and small peripheral zzso were observed in six, seven, and four patients, zzso zzso flow or contrast enhancement was not observed in any of the zzso A look at the respective advantages of each method reveals that zzso was best rendered visible via CT, small peripheral zzso with zzso zzso central necrosis with CT and zzso and zzso invasion with zzso zzso zzso involvement was revealed by all zzso 

Color zzso zzso CT, and MR imaging function extremely well as complementary methods in the diagnosis of zzso Color zzso US should be performed in these patients zzso to its ability to efficiently detect the zzso zzso of imaging characteristics makes it possible to zzso ascertain an early zzso
