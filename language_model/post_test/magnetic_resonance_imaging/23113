We investigate the effective connectivity in the lateral zzso nucleus and visual zzso of humans with zzso Six zzso participated in this zzso Standard zzso mapping stimuli were used to define the boundaries of early visual cortical zzso We obtained zzso time series from zzso zzso and zzso cortical regions for the connectivity zzso zzso and zzso networks were constructed based on known anatomical connections and the effective zzso of these networks were assessed by means of a zzso system identification zzso The effective connectivity of all networks studied was reduced when driven by the zzso eye, suggesting contrary to the current zzso model of localized signal reduction, that a significant part of the zzso deficit is due to anomalous interactions between cells in disparate brain zzso The effective connectivity loss was unrelated to the zzso loss but correlated with the degree of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso suggesting that it may be a more relevant zzso zzso and feedback zzso were similarly zzso A zzso dependence was found for the zzso zzso input that was not present for the feedback connection, suggesting that the reduced function of the zzso recently found in zzso humans may not be solely determined by the feedback influence from the zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso
