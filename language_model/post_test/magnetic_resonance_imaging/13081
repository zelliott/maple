We present an zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso design specifically tailored for MR imaging applications in zzso biology and zzso zzso zzso designs sacrifice zzso uniformity for high zzso efficiency and slew rate, and are attractive for surface imaging applications where open access from one side of the sample is zzso However, decreasing the size of the zzso zzso set presents several unique engineering challenges, particularly for heat dissipation and zzso insulation of the sample from zzso zzso We demonstrate a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso design that combines efficient cooling and insulation to significantly reduce sample heating at zzso distances of less than zzso The instrument is designed for zzso in horizontal bore zzso zzso zzso current efficiencies in the zzso coils lie between zzso and zzso with current and zzso maximum zzso strengths between zzso and zzso at a zzso duty zzso The zzso zzso zzso is demonstrated with zzso corrections for both high-resolution structural imaging of tissue slices and for long zzso imaging of live, developing zzso zzso in a horizontal bore zzso zzso
