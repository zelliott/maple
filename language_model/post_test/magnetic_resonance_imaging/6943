The aim of the study was to investigate if the stretch zzso of the zzso muscle was useful in zzso upper motor zzso zzso The zzso stretch zzso was recorded in 10 healthy subjects and 20 patients with active zzso multiple sclerosis and correlated to the number of zzso zzso in zzso and clinical scores zzso disability status scale and regional functional scoring zzso The short zzso stretch zzso was zzso by rotating the left ankle joint 4 degrees with a rise time in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of the stretch was larger in multiple sclerosis patients being zzso zzso in patients and zzso zzso in controls, P zzso zzso The sensitivity of the stretch zzso expressed as the slope of the best linear fit was increased in zzso patients to zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso in controls, P zzso zzso There was no correlation between zzso of the stretch zzso and number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso stretch zzso might be useful to zzso zzso but is not useful in detecting dysfunction of upper motor zzso in zzso
