In brain cancer, a biopsy as an invasive procedure is needed in order to differentiate between zzso and benign brain zzso However, in some cases, it is difficult or harmful to perform such a zzso to the zzso The aim of this study is to investigate a new method in maximizing the probability of brain cancer type detection without actual biopsy zzso The proposed method combines both image and statistical analysis for tumor type zzso It employed image zzso and zzso of the target region of interest with zzso to assure an accurate statistical interpretation of the zzso zzso analysis was based on utilizing the mean, range, box plot, and testing of hypothesis techniques to reach acceptable and accurate results in zzso between those two zzso This method was performed, examined and compared on actual patients with brain zzso The results showed that the proposed method was quite successful in distinguishing between zzso and benign brain tumor with zzso confident that the results are correct based on statistical testing of zzso
