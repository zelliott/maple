To determine the frequency, dose zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in children after zzso zzso 

The authors identified 90 children who had undergone zzso zzso between 1981 and 2001 and undergone magnetic resonance zzso imaging with follow-up for at least 6 zzso Patients were assigned to zzso zzso and high-dose zzso zzso All 24 children in the zzso group received a radiation dose of zzso or zzso zzso The 66 patients in the HD group received a dose of zzso zzso or zzso zzso were defined as small zzso zzso on zzso or zzso MR zzso For the patients who underwent serial MR imaging, the first depicted appearance of each zzso zzso was zzso zzso analyses were zzso 

zzso in at least one area were observed in 18 zzso zzso The frequency of zzso was zzso (three of 24 zzso in the zzso group as compared with zzso (15 of 66 zzso in the HD zzso this difference was not significant zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso In 12 patients (one from zzso and 11 from HD zzso who underwent serial MR imaging follow-up for up to 10 years zzso zzso zzso a total of 31 zzso were zzso Twelve zzso of these zzso were detected by the 3rd year, and 21 zzso were evident by the 5th zzso Six zzso of the 12 patients who underwent serial MR imaging had zzso zzso after 5 zzso 

zzso zzso appears to occur in at least zzso of children who undergo zzso zzso In this small series, higher radiation dose was not significantly associated with higher frequency of zzso although there was a trend in this zzso
