To describe the MR findings of brain and spinal zzso in zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso adult patients ranging from 19 to 74 years of age zzso men and 45 zzso with clinically and zzso proved zzso underwent MR of the zzso In 30 patients the spinal zzso also was evaluated with zzso 

The brain MR findings were abnormal in 54 of 119 males and in 9 of 45 female zzso and consisted of varying degrees of zzso of the cerebral white matter in 40 patients, corpus zzso in 25 patients, zzso tracts in 46 patients, visual tracts in 31 patients, and auditory tracts in 18 zzso The zzso spinal zzso showed diffuse zzso in 18 of 20 men and in 8 of 10 zzso 

It is important to recognize the MR findings of zzso zzso because not uncommonly the clinical and MR findings of zzso are zzso as multiple zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso or zzso Analysis of the MR findings and correlation of the clinical findings has permitted a tentative subdivision of zzso zzso population into four zzso that appear to differ in respect to prognosis and possibly zzso MR evaluation of the brain in zzso also is helpful in patient selection for experimental therapy, which is most effective if offered in the early stage of the zzso
