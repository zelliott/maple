Computer simulations based on a zzso realistic zzso kinetic model with multiple pathways was used to provide insights on the zzso and interpretation of tissue enhancement metrics such as the maximum zzso peak enhancement and area under curve, commonly used in dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso conditions of the tissue that could affect the accuracy of the zzso slope method include a high blood flow, increased zzso of flow within the zzso or a low vascular zzso Interestingly, changes in zzso and zzso volume might not affect the accuracy of the zzso slope zzso zzso and peak value of the tissue enhancement curve are not strictly properties of the tissue alone, and they cannot be zzso related to intrinsic tissue parameters such as blood flow, blood volume, zzso zzso zzso volume and mean transit zzso Similar to the zzso initial area under tissue concentration curve, an alternative estimate of the total zzso distribution volume can be simply given by the ratio of zzso concentration in the tissue and artery sampled at the final zzso zzso
