zzso of magnetic zzso zzso with assessment of the zzso signal zzso function of echo time, zzso size, and object geometry in the case of zzso zzso embedded in zzso 

zzso were performed with a zzso T magnet on a network of small interacting zzso zzso along with zzso resonance imaging zzso simulations zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso over echo time was assessed at different zzso sizes on real and simulated zzso The effects of zzso distance between zzso and main magnetic field were studied using zzso 

Signal loss was greater as echo time or zzso size zzso zzso signal zzso was not exponential but was weighted by zzso zzso functions zzso echo time, zzso size and field zzso which depended on main magnetic field strength and geometric zzso of the zzso zzso was able to model signal zzso even for a complex object constituted of several zzso The specific experimental signal zzso we observed was thus reproduced and explained by zzso 

The quantitative signal zzso approach at zzso T can be used in characterization studies in the case of locally regular zzso zzso as the signal depends on object size relative to zzso size and is relevant to the geometric zzso Moreover, the good zzso between simulation and experiments should lead to further studies of magnetic zzso effects with other objects such as networks of zzso zzso simulation is thus a potential tool for molecular and porous media zzso
