To evaluate whether knee zzso mechanism features are associated with zzso zzso fat pad zzso at magnetic resonance zzso 

Institutional review board approval and written consent from all patients were zzso Patients with zzso zzso fat pad zzso zzso zzso 30) and a control group without zzso of the fat pad zzso zzso zzso were evaluated zzso with magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso data and zzso mechanism features were zzso including zzso depth, lateral zzso zzso zzso tilt angle, zzso height ratio, distance between zzso ligament and lateral zzso zzso distance from the zzso zzso to the zzso groove, zzso facet zzso and zzso ligament zzso 

The following variables were associated with zzso zzso fat pad zzso in the multivariable models: zzso height ratio zzso zzso zzso shortest distance between zzso ligament and lateral zzso facet zzso zzso zzso and distance from the zzso zzso to the zzso groove zzso zzso zzso Of all demographic and degenerative zzso only age was significantly zzso with younger patients more likely to have zzso zzso fat pad zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso a short distance between the zzso ligament and the lateral zzso zzso and an increased distance from the zzso zzso to the zzso groove are associated with zzso zzso fat pad zzso at MR zzso These results are suggestive of zzso between the lateral zzso zzso and the zzso aspect of the zzso ligament in these zzso
