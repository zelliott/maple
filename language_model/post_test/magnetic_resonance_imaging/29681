The purpose of this study was to determine whether the proportion of skeletal muscle in the zzso soft tissue mass zzso is the same in men with spinal zzso injury zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscle mass and zzso of the zzso were determined by using magnetic resonance imaging and zzso X-ray zzso respectively, in men with long-term zzso zzso complete zzso zzso zzso 8) and zzso controls of similar age, zzso and weight zzso zzso zzso Muscle mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were lower in the zzso group than in the controls zzso zzso zzso but the lower ratio of muscle to zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso suggested that they had a lower proportion of muscle in the zzso than in zzso This notion was supported by analysis of zzso in that the mean muscle adjusted to the mean zzso of the groups combined was lower in the zzso zzso Despite the lower proportion of muscle in the zzso of the zzso group, the relation between muscle and zzso was strong in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso The findings suggest a disproportionate loss of muscle in the paralyzed zzso after zzso relative to other nonfat constituents, which may be accurately estimated in men with long-term zzso by zzso X-ray zzso if the lower proportion of muscle in the zzso zzso zzso is taken into zzso
