It has been previously demonstrated that total heart volume zzso of zzso throughout the cardiac cycle varies by zzso zzso and location of center of mass by zzso 3 zzso The hypothesis has thus developed that for zzso efficiency, the heart should zzso minimal energy in zzso zzso structures by maintaining a constant zzso total heart volume and center of zzso This is achieved in the normal heart mainly by a zzso movement of the zzso valve plane toward the zzso zzso As this has never been studied in the single zzso heart or at various stages of zzso zzso it is conceivable that these patients may not exhibit the constancy of total heart volume and location of center of mass, which may lead to a poor outcome in zzso The total heart volume and center of mass relationship was therefore evaluated in 25 children zzso to 237 zzso with functional single zzso at all stages of zzso reconstruction using zzso zzso zzso or zzso resonance zzso No significant difference was seen in variation between total heart volume and zzso volume between patients before bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso and after zzso zzso zzso zzso however, in 4 of 10, 1 of 8 and 5 of 7 patients, respectively, the total heart volume varied by zzso zzso Across surgical subgroups, significant differences were found in the center of mass displacement zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
