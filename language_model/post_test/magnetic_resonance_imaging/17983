Alzheimer's disease zzso is a global public health threat that continues to rise as the proportion of the population over the age of 60 rapidly zzso Aging and zzso are both associated with cognitive decline and share some features in terms of structural and functional zzso in neural zzso In this review, we attempt to highlight the network zzso that occur in zzso aging and emphasize how they may differ from those that manifest in zzso We focus in particular on zzso studies of the zzso zzso lobe zzso network, which is involved in episodic memory and is known to change both with age and with zzso zzso We propose a zzso model of structural and functional zzso in the zzso along the zzso zzso The earliest changes are synaptic in nature and are zzso in particularly vulnerable white matter pathways such as the zzso zzso These are followed by structural degradation in the zzso region and subsequently zzso of the zzso as a result of accumulating pathology as well as zzso from zzso zzso We believe that testing this model explicitly is an important direction for future research, particularly in the context of zzso discovery and clinical trial zzso
