The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of zzso zzso of zzso bone loss and to compare the diagnostic accuracy of zzso to CT in the measurement of zzso bone zzso 

zzso CT, and zzso CT examinations of 18 zzso zzso were obtained after the creation of defects along the anterior and zzso zzso The defects were measured by three readers separately and blindly using the circle zzso These zzso were compared with zzso made on digital photographic images of the zzso zzso zzso sample Student zzso tests were used to compare the imaging zzso zzso correlation zzso were also calculated to measure zzso zzso 

Our data show that zzso could be used to accurately measure zzso bone loss with a small margin of error zzso zzso range, zzso in estimated percentage zzso zzso accuracy was similar to that of both CT and zzso CT for zzso loss zzso in our study for the readers familiar with the circle method, with zzso as the maximum expected difference in accuracy of the percentage bone loss between the different zzso zzso zzso 

zzso bone loss can be accurately measured on zzso using the circle zzso The zzso zzso of zzso bone loss compares favorably to zzso obtained using zzso CT and zzso The accuracy of the zzso zzso with the level of training, and a learning curve is expected before mastering this zzso
