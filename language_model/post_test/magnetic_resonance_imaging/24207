Recent in zzso diffusion brain imaging studies of schizophrenic patients have revealed zzso zzso with low diffusion zzso present throughout much of cortical white zzso Brain zzso is produced when zzso movement reflects physically restricted water movement, for example, by zzso zzso zzso that increase zzso such as zzso may also alter the zzso and zzso relaxation time of zzso and it is possible that such changes could explain the observed zzso diminution seen in zzso To test this possibility, we calculated zzso zzso relaxation time zzso and zzso density zzso maps for gray matter and white matter across eight zzso zzso slices of fast spin echo zzso in 10 control men (age zzso zzso and 10 men with schizophrenia (age zzso zzso zzso had significantly longer mean white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gray matter zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso their mean white and gray matter zzso values were not significantly different from those of zzso zzso were not significant between zzso and zzso in either zzso or white matter but were significant between zzso and zzso in white zzso zzso relaxation times are longer in zzso than in controls in both gray and white matter whereas zzso reduction is restricted to white zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the process producing prolonged zzso does not fully account for the zzso low zzso observed selectively in white matter in this group of schizophrenic zzso
