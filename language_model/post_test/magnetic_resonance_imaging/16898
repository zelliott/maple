zzso enjoy a singular capacity to imagine events that differ from the zzso Recent cognitive zzso research has linked such simulation processes to the zzso zzso zzso However, extant cognitive theories suggest that zzso reliably simulate only relatively zzso zzso that seem nearby, soon, likely to happen, or relevant to a close zzso Here, we test these claims by examining spontaneous engagement of the default network while zzso consider experiencing events from zzso and zzso zzso Across zzso of perspective in four dimensions, two regions of the default zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso more active for zzso than zzso events, supporting cognitive accounts that zzso only richly simulate experiences that seem immediate and that zzso represent different dimensions of distance zzso Moreover, stable individual differences in default activity when thinking about zzso events correlated with individual zzso in an implicit measure of psychological distance, suggesting that zzso naturally vary in their tendency to simulate far-off or unlikely zzso
