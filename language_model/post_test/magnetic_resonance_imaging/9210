We compare the zzso and zzso relaxation times and zzso transfer ratios zzso of normal subjects and patients with zzso zzso to evaluate the ability of these techniques to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of zzso 

The knee zzso in 11 normal volunteers and 40 patients with zzso were zzso evaluated using zzso relaxation times as measured using delayed zzso zzso of cartilage zzso zzso relaxation times (multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso patients were further zzso into mild, moderate, and severe zzso 

The mean zzso relaxation times of the four groups zzso mild zzso moderate zzso and severe zzso were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso The mean zzso relaxation times of the four groups were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation time decreased and zzso relaxation time increased with worsening zzso of zzso zzso The result of the zzso analysis showed that the zzso age had a significant influence on zzso relaxation time zzso zzso zzso No significant differences between the normal and zzso groups using zzso were zzso 

zzso and zzso relaxation times are relatively sensitive to early degenerative changes in the zzso cartilage, whereas the zzso may have some limitations with regard to early detection of zzso In addition, The zzso and zzso relaxation times zzso correlate with each other, which is a novel zzso
