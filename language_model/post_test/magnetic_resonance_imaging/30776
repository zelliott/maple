Healthy individuals performing response suppression tasks activate anterior zzso zzso with occurrence of false alarm error responses to zzso Fundamental questions include whether this zzso zzso provides a signal contributing to behavioral control and, given generally poorer performance on such tasks by zzso whether this signal is disrupted in zzso 

We used zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to study 13 individuals with zzso dependence and 26 healthy control individuals performing a zzso zzso 

Compared with controls, zzso addicts exhibited an attenuated anterior zzso zzso error signal and significantly poorer task zzso In controls, the individual level of zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso accompanying false alarm error positively predicted task performance, particularly sensitivity in discriminating targets from zzso 

The zzso of this error signal in anterior zzso zzso may play a role in loss of control in addiction and other forms of impulsive zzso
