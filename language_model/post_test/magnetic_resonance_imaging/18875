The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of treating zzso spinal zzso via unilateral approach bilateral zzso in which zzso zzso is zzso 

Eight consecutive patients with spinal zzso underwent bilateral zzso via a unilateral approach in which zzso zzso was zzso The procedures were performed on an zzso basis after induction of general zzso The patients underwent zzso and zzso zzso plain zzso in which zzso zzso films were zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging was also zzso All zzso and zzso were read by a single zzso blinded to the clinical zzso Eight zzso levels in the eight patients were surgically zzso (in one patient an additional level of zzso zzso was zzso The mean operative time was 92 minutes and the mean blood loss was 33 zzso zzso zzso was severe in five patients, zzso in two, and moderate in one; zzso zzso was absent in five, mild in two, and zzso in zzso Motion was detected on zzso zzso in three patients, but on early zzso zzso zzso there was no evidence of zzso 

By following the zzso zzso minimally invasive bilateral zzso of acquired spinal zzso associated with zzso can be successfully performed on an zzso basis, with reasonable operative times, minimal blood loss, and acceptable zzso
