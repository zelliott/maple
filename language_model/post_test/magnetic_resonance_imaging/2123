We measured the effect of 3 d of zzso zzso supplementation on repeated sprint performance and thigh muscle volume in elite power zzso 

Ten male zzso zzso standard zzso of body mass and percentage of fat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and ten female zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso athletes were matched for sex and zzso cycle sprint scores, paired by zzso and randomly assigned to the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso completed six zzso zzso cycle zzso zzso with 60 s of recovery before and after 3 d of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or P zzso zzso Before and after zzso 10 zzso zzso images of both zzso were obtained with magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso supplementation resulted in statistically significant increases in body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso total work during the first sprint zzso zzso zzso and peak power during zzso 2 to 6 zzso zzso zzso As expected, total work and peak power values for males were greater than those for their female counterparts during the initial sprint zzso zzso zzso however, the reverse was true during the last three zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging data showed a zzso increase in thigh volume in five of six zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso 

These data indicate that 3 d of zzso supplementation can increase thigh muscle volume and may enhance cycle sprint performance in elite power zzso moreover, this effect is greater in females as zzso are zzso
