zzso zzso studies have implicated dysfunction of zzso zzso in the symptoms of depression, and a recent zzso study of depressed patients found reduced density of zzso and zzso in this zzso The purpose of this study was to measure volume of zzso zzso and other frontal cortical zzso in patients with major zzso 

zzso resonance imaging was used to measure volume of the zzso zzso and other frontal cortical regions in patients with major depression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and comparison subjects zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with depression had a statistically significant zzso smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso cortical volume, without smaller volumes of other frontal regions including anterior zzso zzso area 24 zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso area 32, zzso zzso zzso area zzso or whole brain zzso The findings were significant after statistically controlling for brain zzso 

These findings are consistent with smaller zzso cortical volume in zzso
