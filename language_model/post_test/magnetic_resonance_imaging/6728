To assess the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional dynamic liver imaging with sensitivity zzso zzso including double zzso phase images and increased resolution, by comparing it to zzso iron oxide zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients with 50 zzso underwent zzso dynamic imaging using zzso and zzso MR imaging with at least a 24-hour zzso between zzso Using a three-dimensional zzso technique applying zzso dynamic imaging consisting of double zzso zzso portal zzso and delayed zzso was zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso fast imaging with zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was zzso For qualitative analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of both MR examinations for detecting the 50 zzso was evaluated using the alternative zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso and positive zzso value were also zzso 

The mean sensitivity and positive zzso value of three-dimensional dynamic imaging with zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, and those of zzso imaging were zzso and zzso zzso zzso There was a significant difference in sensitivity between the two images zzso zzso The mean zzso value of three-dimensional dynamic imaging with zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso dynamic liver MR imaging using zzso for acquiring double zzso phase images is more efficient than zzso MR imaging for detecting zzso
