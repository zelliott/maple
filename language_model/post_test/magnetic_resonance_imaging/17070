Reliable zzso methods are needed to monitor cell zzso and graft survival after zzso zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso have been shown to accumulate in various types of cells, and are currently the labeling agent of choice for cellular magnetic resonance imaging zzso However, for successful clinical translation to zzso zzso it is important that zzso maintain their viability and synthetic function after zzso In this study, primary human zzso were incubated with increasing zzso of clinical grade zzso for different time zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by light and zzso zzso and zzso iron content zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Studies were performed to determine if labeling affected cell viability and zzso zzso iron zzso increased in a zzso and zzso manner after incubation with zzso zzso had minimal short-term effects on cell attachment and zzso zzso However, exposure of zzso to zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso reduction in protein zzso Cell labeling for 16 h had no significant effect on zzso function, but longer periods of incubation resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso incorporated zzso at sufficient levels for in zzso detection on a zzso zzso imaging system, with a minimum of 2,000 zzso zzso detected by a decreased zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso transplantation of human zzso labeled with 50 zzso zzso of zzso was performed in zzso zzso combined immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a clear decrease in signal intensity on zzso MR images when compared to controls, allowing detection of zzso With further experiments to zzso the conditions for labeling human zzso it should be possible to apply this technique to track zzso transplantation in patients with liver zzso
