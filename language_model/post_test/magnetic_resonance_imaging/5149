A key question in zzso zzso involves understanding how and when the cerebral zzso is zzso into distinct functional zzso The present study used functional connectivity zzso mapping and graph theory to identify putative cortical areas and generate a zzso scheme of left lateral zzso zzso zzso in 7 to 10-year-old children and zzso zzso indicated that a majority of putative zzso areas could be matched across groups zzso distance between matched areas across age: zzso zzso Furthermore, the boundaries of children's putative zzso areas respected the boundaries generated from the adults' zzso scheme for a majority of children's areas zzso zzso with prior research, matched zzso areas showed age-related differences in functional connectivity strength with other brain zzso These results suggest that zzso cortical zzso and functional connectivity mature along different zzso zzso with zzso boundaries between zzso areas established in school-age children prior to zzso functional zzso
