In the current study, we investigated how complete infant deprivation to zzso race impacts behavioral and neural sensitivity to zzso Although monkey models have successfully achieved complete face deprivation in early life, this is typically impossible in human zzso We overcame this barrier by examining youths with exclusively zzso racial experience in early zzso zzso These were youths raised in zzso care in either East Asia or Eastern Europe as infants and later adopted by American zzso The use of international adoption bolsters confidence of infant exposure to race zzso to solely Asian faces or European zzso Participants completed an emotional matching task during functional zzso Our findings show that deprivation to zzso faces in infancy zzso recognition of emotion and results in heightened zzso response to zzso zzso Greater early deprivation zzso later age of zzso is associated with greater biases to zzso These data demonstrate how early social deprivation to race shapes zzso function later in life and provides support that early zzso development may represent a sensitive period for race zzso
