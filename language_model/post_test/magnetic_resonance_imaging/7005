The neural system underlying face perception must represent the unchanging features of a face that specify identity, as well as the zzso aspects of a face that facilitate social zzso However, the way information about faces is represented in the brain remains zzso In this study, we used zzso adaptation (the reduction in zzso activity that follows the repeated presentation of identical zzso to ask how different zzso and zzso regions of visual zzso contribute to specific aspects of face zzso We report that activity in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso was reduced following repeated presentations of the same zzso zzso in this area was not sensitive to changes in image size, but was sensitive to changes in zzso In contrast, zzso regions in the superior zzso lobe failed to adapt to identical presentations of the same face, but showed an increased response when the same face was shown from different viewpoints and with different zzso These results reveal a largely zzso neural representation in the inferior zzso lobe that could be involved in the recognition of facial identity, and a separate zzso region in the superior zzso lobe that could be used to detect zzso aspects of zzso The absence of zzso in zzso regions of visual zzso challenges the idea that a more distributed network of areas is used to represent information about zzso
