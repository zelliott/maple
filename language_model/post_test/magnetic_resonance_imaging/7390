How attention interacts with low-level visual representations to give rise to perception remains a central yet controversial question in zzso While several previous studies suggest that the units of zzso selection are individual objects, other evidence points instead toward zzso features, such as an attended color or direction of zzso We used both human zzso and zzso to investigate the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso Specifically, we focused on whether zzso attention is modulated by object appearance, comparing three conditions: zzso features appearing as one object; zzso features appearing as two separate but identical objects; zzso features appearing as two different zzso zzso were two zzso fields presented zzso to central zzso and object appearance was induced by the presence of one or two boxes around the zzso In the zzso experiment, participants performed a zzso discrimination task on one side, and ignored the other side, where we zzso for enhanced activity when either it was perceived as belonging to a same object, or shared features with the task zzso In the zzso experiments, participants performed zzso discrimination on both sides with overlapping red and green dots, now attending to either the same features zzso or zzso or different features zzso or zzso on both zzso zzso show that zzso zzso enhancement exists in all three conditions, zzso regardless whether features appear as one object, two identical objects, or two different zzso Our findings indicate that zzso attention differs from zzso attention in that it is not dependent upon object zzso Thus zzso attention may be zzso by earlier cortical processes independent of zzso visual features into zzso zzso
