To characterize energy metabolism in zzso after zzso anterior zzso zzso patients zzso A, zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of left anterior descending artery zzso and anterior wall zzso by zzso were examined by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso were compared to those of healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso The volume of interest was placed into the anterior zzso wall by magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso were recorded under optimal zzso zzso To separate the influence of coronary zzso from that of the zzso zzso additional patients zzso B, zzso zzso 4) with zzso but without left zzso dysfunction were zzso The effect of zzso medication on the zzso zzso was evaluated in patient group C zzso zzso zzso who had the same clinical features as group zzso In these patients, MRS was first performed without zzso medication zzso period zzso one day) and then repeated during intravenous application of zzso zzso Mean zzso was significantly lower in group A patients zzso zzso zzso than in healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with normal left zzso function zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to those of normal controls zzso zzso zzso After zzso infusion zzso of group C rose from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso paired zzso Thus, zzso zzso after zzso zzso is characterized by a larger decrease of the cellular energy buffer zzso compared to the zzso zzso These findings may reflect degenerative changes of zzso due to disturbed zzso in viable areas of the zzso or zzso processes of viable zzso in the zzso zzso Both mechanisms may lead to zzso changes of cellular zzso zzso resulting in a reduced zzso content of the zzso
