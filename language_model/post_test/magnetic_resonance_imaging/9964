Administration of zzso a potent zzso for zzso zzso receptors with selectivity for the zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso a diverse array of behaviors including those associated with zzso anxiety and motor zzso In this study, we sought to gain insight into the neural actions of zzso in zzso by conducting functional magnetic resonance imaging in awake and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso echo imaging and an zzso zzso iron oxide contrast agent, functional imaging was conducted on a zzso T magnet to measure changes in relative cerebral blood zzso In awake, restrained, male zzso rats that were zzso to the imaging environment, injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked changes to relative cerebral blood volume in several neural regions including the cingulate, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These effects were typically zzso with significant decreases in relative cerebral blood volume at the zzso zzso dose and increases at the higher doses zzso and zzso zzso The decreases and increases in relative cerebral blood volume were often observed within the same region, but triggered by different zzso Both increases and decreases in relative cerebral blood volume were blocked by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso in awake zzso Administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso rats did not significantly alter relative cerebral blood volume in any brain region suggesting an zzso interference with the effects of zzso The neural regions affected by administration of zzso corresponded well to the known zzso behavioral profile for this compound, and demonstrate the utility of using functional magnetic resonance imaging in awake animals to study pharmacological zzso
