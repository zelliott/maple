zzso stages of cortical processing zzso increasingly more complex types of zzso In the visual motion system this increasing complexity, zzso by an increase in spatial zzso has proven effective in characterizing the mechanisms zzso visual zzso Here we report zzso results from a zzso stroke patient, zzso whose pattern of deficits over time reveals a systematic shift in spatial scale for processing zzso We show that following loss in sensitivity to low-level motion direction zzso representation of speed shifts to larger spatial zzso consistent with recruitment of intact high-level zzso With the recovery of low-level motion processing zzso representation of speed shifts back to small spatial zzso These results support the recruitment of high-level visual mechanisms in cases where zzso function is impaired and suggest that, as an experimental zzso spatial zzso may provide an important avenue for investigating functional recovery in patients following damage to visually responsive zzso
