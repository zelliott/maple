To evaluate the magnetic resonance zzso imaging features of zzso zzso emphasizing the presence and shape of the zzso on the same side of the zzso 

MR images from 23 patients with 24 zzso proven zzso zzso were reviewed by two zzso Eleven were zzso and 12 were zzso The presence and shape of the zzso tissue on the same side of the zzso were evaluated on zzso MR zzso 

In 11 zzso of the 24 zzso zzso the zzso zzso was detected on zzso zzso The zzso was zzso along the periphery of the zzso in six zzso of 11 zzso and had a normal, oval shape in five zzso Of these five zzso the zzso was connected to the zzso by a zzso structure in three and was closely attached to the periphery of the zzso in zzso The zzso zzso was detected in 10 zzso of 12 zzso in zzso patients, and in one zzso of 12 zzso in zzso zzso There was a statistically significant difference zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of the remaining zzso on the same side as the zzso is not unusual on zzso especially in zzso women, and the shape of the zzso may be normal in cases of zzso with zzso growth from the periphery of the zzso
