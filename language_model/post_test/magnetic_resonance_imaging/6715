The zzso III remains the gold standard for the surgical treatment of zzso zzso However, the zzso technique is time consuming and technically zzso The pulmonary veins are the source of zzso in the majority of patients with zzso zzso The safety and efficacy of bipolar zzso to zzso isolate the pulmonary veins was evaluated in a prospective zzso zzso 

Beginning in January 2002, 30 patients at three medical centers underwent pulmonary vein isolation using bipolar zzso and were followed for 6 zzso zzso of the patients also underwent a modified zzso zzso zzso isolation of the pulmonary veins was confirmed with zzso zzso Pulmonary vein zzso was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging or three-dimensional zzso zzso in 15 patients at 1 zzso 

Mean age was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had zzso zzso zzso All pulmonary veins were isolated in every zzso The left pulmonary veins underwent zzso zzso zzso applications for a total of zzso zzso zzso zzso The right pulmonary veins underwent zzso zzso zzso applications for a total of zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no operative zzso At 1 month, imaging revealed no evidence of pulmonary vein zzso At 6 months, zzso of patients were in normal zzso zzso 

The use of bipolar zzso for electrical isolation of pulmonary veins and to replace other zzso III incisions is safe and effective at controlling zzso zzso This emerging technology may shorten and simplify the surgical management of zzso zzso
