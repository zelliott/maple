To propose a zzso zzso zzso that may be applied to guide zzso or zzso investigations for patients with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of 158 patients with zzso zzso and no zzso zzso were examined according to a new categorization system based on zzso zzso zzso The clinical and zzso findings were confronted to zzso and/or genetic results using the MR zzso zzso Seven groups of zzso zzso pattern were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unilateral zzso zzso zzso global zzso zzso zzso signal abnormalities zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso groups were classified as zzso zzso Global zzso and signal zzso groups were classified as zzso zzso 

In the zzso zzso group, a specific genetic diagnosis was obtained in eight children zzso and all of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are involved in primary zzso zzso In the group of zzso zzso specific genetic diagnosis was obtained in one patient zzso zzso Thus, nine of 42 children classified as zzso disorder had a molecular zzso Global zzso and signal zzso groups were classified as zzso disorders, specific zzso was obtained in zzso zzso In global zzso group, respiratory chain zzso was diagnosed in 18 children zzso In 21 children a zzso disorders of zzso type zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed zzso and infantile zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed in one zzso In signal abnormalities group, specific zzso diagnosis was obtained in six out of 11 children, five children with respiratory chain zzso and one child with zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso groups, no biological diagnosis was found for any of the zzso In the group of unilateral zzso zzso we hypothesized a zzso prenatal zzso 

The proposed MR zzso zzso was useful to guide zzso or zzso zzso allowing an zzso diagnosis in 55 zzso
