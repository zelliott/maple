The design and evaluation of therapeutic gene zzso protocols and zzso are under extensive zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso techniques can aid considerably in the development of experimental treatment approaches, as well as in determining treatment response by observing gross tissue zzso However, through a unique set of contrast zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso more information about tissue status can be obtained while zzso and zzso tumor characteristics in more zzso We show here that zzso relaxation in the rotating frame, zzso provides unique in zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso which effectively zzso these tumors, resulted in significantly prolonged zzso relaxation times in zzso already after 3 days of treatment, whereas conventional contrast parameters were elevated after zzso days of zzso Interestingly, the prolonged zzso values were observed while an increase in tumor volume was still taking zzso The regions of elevated zzso relaxation coincided with high zzso activity as determined by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso contrast could be used as a novel early indicator of zzso cell damage in zzso
