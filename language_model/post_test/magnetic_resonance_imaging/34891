We have investigated zzso magnetic resonance zzso of the zzso zzso in 41 zzso zzso with major depression, prior to starting an zzso standardized trial of zzso zzso and 22 matched comparison zzso Upon completing the trial, depressed subjects were classified as treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 23), based on changes in the Hamilton Depression zzso zzso zzso subjects had a lower area ratio of the zzso resonance to the zzso resonance zzso than comparison zzso This statistically significant difference between the depressed subjects and comparison subjects was more pronounced in the treatment zzso than in the zzso There were no differences in the relative volumes of gray matter or white matter in the zzso used for zzso zzso in depressed subjects relative to comparison zzso These results are consistent with an zzso in the metabolism of zzso zzso compounds in the zzso zzso of depressed subjects and, in particular, those who are responsive to zzso
