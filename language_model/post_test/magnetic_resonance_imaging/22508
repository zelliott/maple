zzso resonance imaging zzso of the lung is challenging because of substantial zzso However, lung zzso that are associated with increased zzso values in CT enhance zzso in zzso zzso density is increased and zzso zzso resulting in zzso artifacts, are reduced in pneumonia, zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, many lung diseases result in zzso of breath, so that patients cannot hold their breath for long zzso zzso fast imaging techniques are required which should also allow for high spatial resolution so that small zzso can be zzso zzso and air pockets within zzso are not readily recognized with zzso Thin section CT is standard for the diagnosis of zzso With parallel imaging techniques, zzso examination of the lungs can be performed with short periods of breath zzso which allow for zzso resolution in the zzso Especially for follow-up examinations in zzso patients and, in some instances, for the staging of zzso diseases zzso zzso zzso lung cancer, respectively), zzso is very promising and may contribute to a decrease in the radiation exposure of the zzso
