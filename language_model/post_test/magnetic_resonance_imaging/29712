zzso zzso has been used as a tool to determine the indication for surgery for zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso contributes to optimal zzso 

Between 1993 and 2001, US and zzso studies were simultaneously performed on 13 consecutive infants younger than 2 months of age with zzso zzso The US zzso were classified as complex or zzso Signal intensity zzso of the zzso on zzso was compared with that of the liver on zzso images zzso and with urine on zzso images zzso We assumed that high zzso on zzso and iso or low zzso on zzso indicated zzso 

There were 10 complex and three simple zzso on zzso Of the 10 complex zzso two had no complications at surgery or resolved zzso These two zzso showed low zzso on zzso Eight complex zzso showed high zzso on zzso and all were zzso The US diagnosis corresponded to the zzso findings in three simple zzso The sensitivity of US for zzso was zzso and that of zzso was zzso 

We found that zzso was a more reliable diagnostic zzso than US for diagnosing zzso zzso zzso
