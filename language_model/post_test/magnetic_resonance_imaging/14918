Patients with an enlarged prostate and suspicion of prostate cancer pose a diagnostic zzso The prostate cancer detection rate of systematic zzso zzso ultrasound guided biopsy is between zzso and zzso For zzso greater than 40 zzso this decreases to zzso or zzso zzso zzso fusion biopsy has shown superior prostate cancer detection zzso We defined the detection rate of magnetic zzso fusion biopsy in men with an enlarged prostate zzso 

We zzso analyzed the records of patients who underwent zzso prostate magnetic resonance imaging followed by magnetic zzso fusion biopsy at our zzso Whole prostate volumes were calculated using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso rates were analyzed with respect to age, prostate specific zzso and whole prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess these parameters as independent zzso of prostate cancer zzso 

We analyzed zzso patients with a zzso age of zzso years and a median prostate specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean whole prostate volume was zzso zzso The overall detection rate of the magnetic zzso fusion platform was zzso For zzso less than 40 zzso the detection rate was zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso 40 to zzso 55 to zzso 70 to zzso 85 to zzso 100 to zzso and 115 zzso or greater, respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significant inverse association of magnetic resonance imaging volume with prostate cancer zzso controlling for age and prostate specific zzso 

zzso ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate zzso However, magnetic zzso fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of zzso ultrasound guided biopsy in the zzso zzso zzso fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged zzso
