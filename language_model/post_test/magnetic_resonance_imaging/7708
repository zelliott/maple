The human zzso zzso lobe zzso is an important part of the zzso system, and its zzso play key roles in learning, memory, and zzso The zzso includes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso that are complex in shape and have low zzso intensity contrast, making them difficult to segment manually in magnetic resonance zzso This article presents a new zzso method that combines active appearance modeling and zzso local refinement to automatically segment specific zzso of the zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso relying on zzso to analyze statistical variations in image intensity and shape information in study population, is used to capture global shape characteristics of each structure of interest with a zzso zzso zzso local zzso using zzso means to compare the image local intensity properties, is applied to locally refine the zzso results along the structure borders to improve structure zzso In this manner, zzso zzso and global shape constraints could allow more accurate zzso of zzso zzso experiments against manually defined labels demonstrate that this new zzso method is zzso efficient, zzso and zzso In a zzso validation on 54 normal young adults, the method yielded a mean zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso for the anterior parts of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso
