To assess the use of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in monitoring treatment response in patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso 

Bulk zzso and zzso were determined with at least four MR imaging examinations zzso zzso during the first 6 weeks of treatment in 29 patients with zzso (age range, zzso years; 15 female, and 14 zzso Bulk zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 7) patients were zzso 

Relative to zzso bulk zzso values, bulk zzso had increased a mean of zzso at week 1 and had decreased a mean of zzso and zzso at weeks 2 and 6, zzso zzso in zzso patients were not statistically significantly different zzso zzso zzso 

MR imaging of zzso bone zzso in patients with zzso demonstrated statistically significant changes in bulk zzso during treatment that correlated with changes in zzso However, neither the early increase in bulk zzso nor the rate or magnitude of the subsequent decrease in bulk zzso were indicative of a positive response to zzso
