zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to detect the cerebral cortical zzso during maximum voluntary zzso with and without soft zzso in patients with zzso spasms zzso and the central mechanisms of zzso and the rule of the zzso zzso 

Four zzso patients were selected and the spasms sides were right in two cases and left in the other two zzso zzso images were obtained on zzso zzso zzso MR zzso Block design was used and the movement pattern was the onset of spasms after maximum voluntary zzso with and without soft zzso The zzso data were analyzed by zzso zzso 

With the onset of spasms after maximum voluntary zzso the zzso of motor zzso in 3 zzso patients was found lateral dominance on the left side, and the other one showed bilateral zzso All the 4 patients were found zzso in zzso zzso With the onset of spasms after maximum zzso wearing soft zzso the zzso of motor zzso showed no lateral dominance on the left side, and 3 patients were not found zzso in zzso zzso 

The changes of the zzso in motor zzso and zzso area during the onset of spasms after zzso with and without soft zzso might be the central mechanisms of the rule of zzso therapy, through which the soft zzso might function in alleviating muscle zzso
