Despite many desirable zzso zzso zzso stimulus designs for zzso and IRON suffer from low detection power relative to block designs because the zzso impulse response function zzso acts as a zzso filter on neural zzso to zzso the size of differential responses to alternate zzso While the use of zzso contrast agent zzso zzso provides an alternative zzso method in animal models to improve sensitivity and spatial zzso the inherently slower zzso zzso causes IRON detection efficiency to decrease faster than zzso efficiency as the zzso zzso zzso is zzso Using simulations based upon assumptions of zzso zzso and experimental data obtained in awake, zzso zzso this study compared detection efficiencies for zzso random and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and IRON zzso A larger relative gain in detection efficiency at short zzso was obtained by zzso designs using IRON contrast relative to zzso contrast due to the slower zzso of the IRON zzso To zzso tradeoffs between detection efficiency and the predictability of stimulus zzso the Shannon zzso was introduced as an objective measure of zzso Small amounts of zzso can be traded for large gains in efficiency, particularly for the IRON zzso
