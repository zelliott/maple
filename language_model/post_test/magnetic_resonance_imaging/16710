Several lines of evidence suggest that bipolar disorder is associated with progressive changes in gray matter volume zzso particularly in brain structures involved in emotional regulation and zzso The majority of these studies however, have been zzso in zzso In this study we compared baseline and follow-up scans in groups of bipolar disorder and healthy zzso We hypothesized bipolar disorder subjects would demonstrate significant zzso changes over zzso 

A total of 58 bipolar disorder and 48 healthy subjects participated in structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso were zzso zzso months after their baseline zzso zzso images were zzso zzso to standard zzso space, and compared zzso using statistical zzso mapping software zzso A model was developed to investigate differences in zzso at zzso and associated with time and episodes, as well as in comparison to healthy zzso 

We observed increases in zzso in bipolar disorder subjects across several brain regions at baseline and over time, including portions of the prefrontal zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes differed to some degree between adolescent and adult bipolar disorder zzso The zzso between scans positively correlated with zzso increases in bipolar disorder subjects in portions of the prefrontal cortex, and both illness duration and number of depressive episodes were associated with increased zzso in zzso and zzso zzso 

Our findings support suggestions that widely observed progressive zzso changes in bipolar disorder patients may be related to structural brain abnormalities in anterior zzso zzso zzso largely involve regions previously noted to be integral to emotional expression and regulation, and appear to vary by zzso
