Our results suggest that the zzso of most children with cochlear implants can easily be damaged, as shown by the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to click zzso Also, in most of the children, the zzso nerve was seemingly not zzso by the cochlear zzso These results suggest that electrical stimulation at the C level can stimulate the cochlear zzso however, this stimulation did not spread to the zzso nerve in our zzso In some children with zzso zzso or zzso nerve zzso the zzso nerve was zzso when the cochlear implant device was on, because of a zzso response to electrical zzso 

To clarify the diagnostic value of zzso in cochlear implant zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso of 12 children who underwent cochlear zzso surgery were zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso responses were zzso 

Before surgery, 6 of the 12 children showed normal zzso 1 showed a decrease in the zzso of zzso and five showed no zzso zzso After surgery, with the cochlear implant device off, 1 child showed a decreased zzso and 11 showed no zzso With the cochlear implant device on, four children showed zzso and eight did zzso
