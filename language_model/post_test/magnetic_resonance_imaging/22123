Pulmonary zzso is a debilitating effect of acute respiratory distress zzso The ability to measure it zzso with high sensitivity and in three dimensions could be useful in not only detection but also in assessment and guidance of zzso To this end, a three-dimensional zzso pulse sequence to measure the formation of zzso was developed and zzso Another sequence was tested to measure blood flow in zzso pulmonary zzso Pulmonary zzso was induced in nine dogs via zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso was verified by zzso weight ratio zzso zzso zzso and zzso lung water at baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso dry lung zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio within the lungs increased from zzso zzso zzso at baseline to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the time course of zzso formation was zzso zzso from MR zzso blood flow zzso were zzso The authors conclude that the three-dimensional scan provides a sensitive relative zzso of pulmonary zzso formation without the use of contrast agents or zzso zzso
