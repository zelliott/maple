To examine zzso changes in the shape of the upper airway during zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, to understand the mechanism of zzso therapy to improve the zzso 

Fourteen zzso participated in the zzso A custom-made oral device was used to keep the zzso in zzso advancement at zzso zzso 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the maximum zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to investigate the difference in the shape of zzso in these 4 zzso Changes in the zzso direction zzso lateral direction zzso and its ratio zzso were zzso which were transformed into the percentage of the original zzso 

The zzso decrease of zzso was found when the zzso was advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso change rate in percentage increased by degrees zzso zzso zzso while the increase of zzso change rate in percentage showed no statistical zzso 

The shape of upper airway tended to be less zzso The enlargement of upper airway during zzso zzso advancement was mainly the result of enlargement in lateral zzso
