This study used an infusion of a zzso contrast agent to zzso zzso blood zzso and investigate its effect on the zzso zzso zzso A three compartment zzso signal model combined with a modified balloon model was developed to interpret the MR zzso This model incorporated zzso blood volume in order to simulate signal changes resulting from the contrast zzso The zzso signal model was fitted to the experimental data to test the hypothesis that zzso blood volume changes during zzso It was found that allowing zzso blood volume to change, rather than assuming this change is negligible as often assumed in the literature, provides a better fit to the experimental data, particularly during the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was fitted well, regardless of whether the zzso blood volume was allowed to change, by assuming that this feature is due to delayed zzso zzso However the zzso zzso in zzso blood volume zzso with an extremely long time constant, taking more than 55 s to recover to baseline following a zzso s zzso The zzso signal changes measured here could alternatively be described by a zzso zzso in zzso An alternative model of oxygen zzso in place of the zzso zzso model, would be required to test this zzso
