zzso zzso zzso are rare tumors and their zzso appearance resembles that of zzso especially zzso zzso To increase the knowledge on the zzso composition of this type of tumor for better diagnosis and zzso we performed a molecular study using zzso high resolution magic angle spinning zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, to help in the discrimination between zzso and zzso zzso we compared the zzso zzso zzso of samples from one patient with zzso and 5 patients affected by zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso localized single zzso zzso was also performed on the same patients prior to surgery and the zzso and zzso MRS zzso were zzso We observed the presence of zzso together with zzso in zzso and a low amount of zzso in the zzso that may reflect zzso zzso responsible for associated zzso Many differences between zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The relative ratios of zzso zzso and zzso with respect to zzso are higher in zzso compared to zzso whereas the relative ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso compounds with respect to zzso are lower in zzso compared to zzso These data will be useful to improve the interpretation of zzso MRS zzso resulting in a more accurate diagnosis of these rare zzso
