To evaluate zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and MR zzso imaging for the depiction of locally zzso prostate cancer after external beam radiation zzso 

zzso MR imaging and MR zzso imaging were performed in 21 patients with zzso failure after external beam radiation therapy for prostate zzso Two readers independently and zzso reviewed MR images and rated the likelihood of zzso tumor on a zzso zzso zzso zzso were considered suspicious for zzso if the zzso level was elevated and zzso was zzso zzso operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess cancer detection in each side of the prostate with zzso MR imaging and zzso imaging at different thresholds based on the scores assigned by the two readers and on the number of suspicious zzso in each zzso zzso The presence or absence of cancer at subsequent zzso biopsy was used as the standard of zzso 

zzso demonstrated locally zzso prostate cancer in nine zzso in six zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection of locally zzso cancer with MR imaging was zzso and zzso for readers 1 and 2, zzso By using the number of suspicious zzso to define different diagnostic zzso the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for MR zzso imaging was significantly zzso zzso zzso higher, at zzso In particular, the presence of three or more suspicious zzso in a zzso showed a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso respectively, for the diagnosis of local zzso Seven zzso demonstrated complete zzso zzso at zzso imaging and only zzso zzso at zzso 

zzso data suggest that MR zzso imaging, but not zzso MR imaging, may be of value for the depiction of locally zzso prostate cancer after radiation zzso
