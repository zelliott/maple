zzso imaging of zzso remains challenging in clinical zzso Here, we applied zzso molecular imaging to detect vascular cell zzso zzso in early and advanced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso iron oxide particles zzso with zzso or without zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso were zzso by ultra zzso zzso zzso magnetic zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a marked signal loss in the zzso root of zzso zzso mice fed a Western diet for 8 and 26 weeks in zzso and ex zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso mice, and zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed iron zzso in the zzso in zzso with vascular cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scattering zzso demonstrated iron signals in the zzso and media of the zzso root in the zzso but not zzso zzso zzso mice, localized to zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso regions containing smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso confirmed iron particles enclosed in zzso cells and in the vicinity of smooth muscle zzso 

Using a combination of innovative imaging zzso in this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying zzso as a contrast agent for imaging of zzso
