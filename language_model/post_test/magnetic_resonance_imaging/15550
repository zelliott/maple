It is unclear how effort translates into brain zzso In this study we zzso to identify the activity in a working memory task that is related to the allocation of mental zzso Such activity, if present, would be a likely candidate to explain how effort works in terms of brain zzso Eleven healthy participants performed a zzso task with a zzso of one, three, or five consonants in an zzso zzso zzso stimuli were either one consonant or one zzso We expected digits to be processed automatically and consonants to require working zzso Because the probe type was unpredictable and subjects had to respond as fast as possible, we expected subjects to allocate mental resources on the basis of the zzso size, not the probe zzso zzso we anticipated that activity in regions involved in effort would be a function of the size of the zzso but independent of the type of zzso We found that the zzso for digits increased in line with our expectation of automatic processing and the reaction time for letters increased in line with our expectation of controlled zzso zzso revealed that activity in the right zzso zzso changed as a function of zzso The zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso showed reduced activity as a function of zzso zzso in regions regarded as pivotal for working memory (among others, the left zzso prefrontal cortex, anterior zzso zzso appeared to be predominantly related to information processing and not involved in zzso
