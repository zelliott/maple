zzso transition from zzso to zzso circulation might permanently alter zzso growth and zzso To test this hypothesis, we measured zzso dimensions in adolescents born very zzso 

Eighty-six healthy 15-year-old subjects were zzso 45 born very zzso at an average zzso age of 28 weeks zzso weight zzso 1500 zzso and 41 controls born at zzso Using a zzso Fiesta sequence on a zzso zzso 25 images were collected within the heart cycle at several levels of the descending zzso zzso zzso areas were zzso calculated using an active zzso zzso 

zzso born zzso had zzso zzso zzso The difference was zzso in the zzso and zzso in the abdominal zzso after adjustment for body surface area and gender zzso zzso zzso zzso smoking in pregnancy was also found to be an independent risk factor for zzso narrowing in the offspring zzso zzso throughout the zzso zzso offspring to zzso zzso zzso born zzso had higher zzso and zzso blood zzso however, blood pressures did not correlate with zzso size or maternal smoking during zzso 

Very zzso birth and exposure to maternal smoking in zzso life are independent and strong risk factors for general zzso narrowing 15 years after zzso
