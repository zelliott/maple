To compare the sensitivity, positive zzso value, and diagnostic accuracy of zzso iron oxide zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging with those of zzso row zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this study, and informed consent was obtained from all zzso A total of 44 patients zzso men, eight zzso age range, zzso zzso with 59 zzso and mild liver zzso zzso score A or zzso underwent zzso CT and zzso MR zzso The diagnosis of zzso was established at surgical zzso zzso zzso 31) and zzso biopsy zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso CT consisted of four zzso zzso early zzso late zzso portal zzso and zzso Three observers independently analyzed each image in random zzso zzso positive zzso value, and diagnostic accuracy were calculated by using the alternative zzso receiver operating characteristic analysis for zzso row CT and zzso MR zzso 

Although not significant zzso zzso zzso the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for zzso MR imaging zzso zzso was higher than that for zzso row CT zzso zzso for all zzso Also, although no significant difference was demonstrated by any of the three observers zzso zzso zzso there was a trend toward increased sensitivity on both a zzso and a zzso basis for zzso MR imaging zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso row CT zzso zzso and zzso zzso No significant difference in positive zzso value was observed between zzso 

zzso MR imaging and zzso CT show similar diagnostic zzso sensitivity, and positive zzso value for the detection of zzso in patients with relatively mild zzso zzso zzso
