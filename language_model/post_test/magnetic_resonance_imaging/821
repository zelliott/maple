We studied time course and cerebral zzso of word, object, and face recognition using zzso zzso zzso and source zzso zzso To compare zzso rates of these three categories, we used zzso images that easily pop out without any change in the physical features of the zzso once the meaning is zzso Comparisons before and after identification show additional periods of zzso beginning at 100 zzso for faces and at around 200 zzso for objects and zzso For faces, this zzso occurs predominantly in right zzso areas, whereas for objects, the specific time period gives rise to bilateral zzso but right dominant zzso Finally, words show a maximum area of zzso in the left zzso area at their specific time zzso These results provide unequivocal evidence that when effects of low-level visual features are zzso faces, objects, and words are not only distinct in terms of their zzso routes, but also in terms of their times of zzso
