To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic navigation in ultrasound zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients who were scheduled for zzso zzso procedures (20 liver cancer zzso procedures and 17 other zzso were zzso zzso navigation with three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic navigation were used for zzso The influence on clinical outcome was also zzso 

zzso navigation facilitated zzso placement in 15 of 20 zzso procedures for liver cancer in which multiple zzso were zzso enhanced guidance in two small liver zzso invisible on conventional US but visible at CT or zzso and depicted the residual viable zzso after zzso zzso zzso for liver cancer in one zzso In four of 17 other zzso procedures, zzso magnetic navigation increased the zzso of the needle zzso zzso navigation was beneficial in 11 zzso of 20 zzso zzso increased confidence but did not change management in five zzso added some information but did not change management in two zzso and made no change in two zzso In the other 17 zzso procedures, the corresponding numbers were 1 zzso 2 zzso 7 zzso and 7 zzso respectively zzso 

zzso navigation in zzso zzso procedure provides solutions in some difficult cases in which conventional US guidance is not zzso It is especially useful in complicated zzso procedures such as zzso for liver zzso
