We acquired simultaneous zzso (3 zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso using a sparse sampling technique to measure auditory cortical activity generated by right ear stimulus zzso Using zzso source zzso we showed that the anatomical location of the grand mean equivalent zzso of auditory evoked zzso zzso and the center of gravity of zzso activity were in good agreement in the horizontal zzso However, the grand mean equivalent zzso was located significantly superior in the zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso asymmetry was exhibited by zzso whereas neither the zzso zzso moments nor the mean global field power zzso of the zzso showed significant zzso zzso the number of recording zzso from 64 to 128 improved the accuracy of the equivalent zzso source zzso but decreased the zzso ratio zzso of MR zzso This suggests that 64 zzso may be optimal for use in simultaneous recording of zzso and zzso
