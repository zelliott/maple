zzso in semantic processing occurs early in Alzheimer's disease zzso and differential impact on zzso of semantic relations have been reported, yet there is little data on the zzso basis of these zzso Patients with mild zzso and healthy controls underwent 3 functional zzso auditory stimulation tasks requiring semantic or zzso decisions zzso about word pairs zzso zzso zzso Patients showed a significant performance deficit only on the zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso zzso controls showed a clear zzso focus in the left superior zzso zzso for the zzso zzso patients showed additional zzso in the left zzso prefrontal and bilateral zzso zzso On the semantic tasks, zzso zzso zzso were seen in the inferior and middle frontal zzso zzso greater than right) in both groups but patients showed additional zzso suggesting zzso recruitment of locally expanded zzso and remote regions, for example, right frontal zzso during the zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso task performance was strongly related to signal increase in bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso The authors conclude that zzso can reveal similarities and differences in functional zzso processing of semantic and zzso information in mild zzso compared to healthy elderly, and can help to bridge cognitive and neural investigations of the integrity of semantic networks in zzso
