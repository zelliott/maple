zzso in zzso a zzso zzso involved in zzso fusion, zzso organization and control of zzso have been linked to zzso zzso zzso transmitted as an zzso trait zzso We here report on eight patients from six independent families showing that zzso in the zzso gene can also be responsible for a zzso form of zzso associated with zzso deafness, zzso zzso zzso zzso chronic progressive external zzso and zzso zzso with zzso c zzso negative and zzso Red zzso Most zzso we demonstrate that these patients all zzso multiple deletions of zzso DNA zzso in their skeletal muscle, thus revealing an zzso role of the zzso protein in zzso zzso The five zzso zzso associated with these zzso zzso zzso were all zzso point zzso affecting highly zzso zzso acid positions and the nuclear genes previously known to induce zzso multiple deletions such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were ruled zzso Our results show that certain zzso zzso exert a dominant negative effect responsible for zzso disease, closely related to classical zzso zzso by a mechanism involving zzso zzso
