zzso disease zzso is a late zzso neurodegenerative disorder in humans caused by an expansion of a zzso zzso repeat of more than 39 units in a gene of unknown zzso Several mouse models have been reported which show rapid progression of a zzso leading to death within 3-5 months zzso zzso resembling the rare juvenile course of HD zzso zzso or which do not present with any symptoms zzso zzso zzso to the small size of the brain, mice are not suitable for repetitive in zzso imaging zzso Also, rapid progression of the disease in the transgenic models limits their usefulness for zzso We therefore generated a rat model transgenic of zzso which carries a truncated zzso zzso zzso with 51 zzso repeats under control of the native rat zzso zzso This is the first transgenic rat model of a neurodegenerative disorder of the zzso These rats exhibit zzso neurological zzso with reduced anxiety, cognitive zzso and slowly progressive motor dysfunction as well as typical zzso zzso in the form of zzso nuclear inclusions in the zzso As in HD patients, in zzso imaging demonstrates zzso shrinkage in magnetic resonance images and a reduced brain zzso metabolism in high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This model allows zzso in zzso imaging studies and is therefore zzso suited for the evaluation of novel therapeutic approaches such as zzso
