zzso resonance imaging zzso has been used for the determination in zzso of rat zzso zzso In zzso zzso sections the zzso having a lower zzso value than the surrounding zzso was visible with pronounced zzso The size has been estimated by zzso zzso A close correlation zzso zzso zzso with the zzso weights determined zzso has been zzso demonstrating the reliability of the in zzso zzso Using zzso the effects of zzso a zzso zzso on the zzso size have been monitored in a rat model of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Treatment with zzso over 4 weeks resulted in a zzso reduction of the zzso zzso These results have been confirmed by determination of zzso weights zzso However, due to a large zzso variation in size of zzso zzso more animals are required to reach statistical significance when only zzso of treatment can be zzso In contrast, zzso allows one to monitor individually the drug effects over a long period of time, eliminating zzso zzso
