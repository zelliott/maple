We propose a new zzso approach to resolution zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It combines the zzso of zzso schemes with new zzso oriented zzso to provide resolution zzso with better zzso performances than the usual zzso zzso predictor or the zzso zzso Because the proposed zzso oriented prediction zzso is not really efficient on smooth images, we also introduce new zzso which are zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso results, which are obtained on a large-scale medical image database, are more than zzso better on zzso and zzso better on zzso than resolution zzso zzso zzso and close to zzso zzso The zzso zzso is also well suited for zzso zzso providing an interesting zzso zzso compared with zzso and equivalent or a better zzso than zzso for a high bit rate on noisy zzso medical zzso
