To define the evolution of zzso zzso with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in an animal model of acute zzso zzso 

Adult zzso rats were divided into two zzso Group I underwent inferior zzso artery zzso zzso followed by zzso observations and zzso zzso In group II, zzso was performed before and after zzso zzso and followed by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso started to develop 1 h after zzso zzso when pale areas became evident in the zzso zzso zzso and progressively worsened up to 8 h thereafter, when the zzso was less pale, and the zzso zzso loop appeared very zzso The zzso results reflected these zzso showing a zzso signal in both the zzso space and the zzso loop wall 1 h after zzso zzso the latter progressively increased to demonstrate a reduction in the zzso loop zzso at 6 zzso Eight hours after zzso zzso zzso showed a persistent zzso mural zzso associated with a reduction in zzso free zzso The zzso findings were correlated with zzso zzso varying from an attenuated zzso with zzso zzso zzso at 1 h to zzso necrosis and loss of the surface zzso detected 8 h after zzso zzso 

zzso may be used as a substitute for invasive procedures in diagnosing and grading acute zzso zzso allowing for the early identification of pathological zzso
