A major intrinsic limitation of zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to map the human brain lies in the unclear relationship between the position of the stimulating zzso on the scalp and the underlying zzso zzso The relationship between structure and function as the major feature zzso a brain mapping zzso can therefore not be zzso Recent advances in image processing allowed us to refine zzso by combining magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso with zzso using a zzso system to measure the position of the stimulating zzso and map this position onto a zzso data zzso This technique has several advantages over recent zzso mapping zzso The position of the zzso on the scalp can be held constant as verified by real time visual zzso When evaluating higher cortical functions, the relationship between underlying cortical anatomy and the scalp stimulation site can be accurately zzso zzso motor output maps can be easily obtained for zzso planning and decision making for mass zzso near zzso zzso in zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso is a reliable alternative for zzso cortical functions and therefore may be a useful adjunct or in selected patients even a helpful alternative to other functional zzso zzso
