To zzso dynamic enhancement of breast zzso with zzso and conventional magnetic resonance zzso imaging, to correlate these data with zzso findings and vessel density, and to evaluate 

Twenty female patients with 22 breast zzso underwent conventional and MR zzso imaging zzso values, change in zzso zzso zzso and zzso products were calculated with zzso imaging data and were correlated with zzso findings and zzso zzso 

zzso values of zzso were not statistically significantly zzso zzso had more rapid zzso and higher zzso products zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and specificity was zzso for diagnosis of zzso zzso density was higher for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an overall positive (not statistically zzso correlation between zzso product and zzso zzso 

zzso imaging appears promising for zzso of breast zzso zzso zzso data indicate that tumor zzso affects zzso
