This study was designed to evaluate the characteristics of zzso imaging of zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been used successfully to evaluate tissue necrosis after zzso zzso In zzso zzso energy is used to create a targeted zzso necrosis for the treatment of various zzso 

Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso system, zzso zzso (10 to 40 W for 30 zzso were created on the zzso of the right zzso in eight zzso zzso After injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso echo images were obtained during a follow-up of 10 h using an zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso were analyzed on the MR images and compared with gross anatomy and zzso 

Four distinct zzso of signal enhancement were zzso After zzso injection, zzso zzso were delineated clearly as zzso areas of low signal intensity zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Signal enhancement in the zzso periphery started zzso zzso zzso zzso after injection and progressively extended toward the zzso center at a rate of zzso zzso Full delayed enhancement was observed after 98 zzso 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During the follow-up period, zzso started to decrease, but the zzso were zzso for as long as 10 h of zzso During the first three zzso of enhancement, zzso correlated well with the pathological findings zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be evaluated accurately by using zzso zzso which may allow the zzso assessment of procedural zzso The dissimilar zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso suggest a different zzso process with complete loss of zzso
