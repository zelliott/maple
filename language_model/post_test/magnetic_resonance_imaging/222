To investigate the underlying zzso diversity of molecular profiles in zzso a zzso approach was introduced to compare samples from regions of different zzso zzso Using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso we compared zzso collected tissue samples of different zzso grade areas of three zzso zzso zzso results showing relatively high expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso areas zzso 2 zzso zzso 3 and 4) and high expression of zzso in zzso areas zzso 2 zzso zzso 3 and 4) were zzso These results were confirmed by western zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso This study provided the evidence of zzso zzso signatures according to regional and zzso zzso in zzso
