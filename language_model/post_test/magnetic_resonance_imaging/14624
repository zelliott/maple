To determine if regional gray matter volume zzso differences in middle-aged adults with and without zzso diabetes zzso are localized in areas most vulnerable to aging, zzso zzso zzso and if these differences are explained by cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes zzso 

Regional zzso was zzso using zzso zzso of 104 adults with a childhood onset of zzso zzso age: zzso and zzso zzso and 151 adults without diabetes zzso age: zzso A zzso threshold zzso zzso was applied to account for multiple zzso comparisons and analyses were repeated in an zzso and zzso subset of participants with zzso and controls zzso in each group, mean age zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Compared to controls, zzso patients had smaller zzso in the frontal lobe zzso to zzso zzso and adjacent zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso differences were independent of age, waist zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso total cholesterol and smoking status and were similar in sensitivity analyses restricted to zzso and zzso zzso zzso between zzso and diabetes complications were not zzso 

These findings extend the notion of accelerated brain aging in zzso to middle-aged zzso The zzso of frontal gray matter zzso and its impact on future development of disability and zzso need further study, especially as middle-aged zzso patients progress to older zzso
