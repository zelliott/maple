zzso and zzso in vulnerable zzso plaques are key features for severe clinical zzso Dynamic zzso zzso zzso and zzso PET are two zzso imaging techniques capable of zzso plaque zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso However, their mutual role in defining plaque vulnerability and their possible overlap has not been thoroughly zzso We studied the relationship between zzso and zzso PET data from the carotid arteries of 40 subjects with coronary heart disease zzso or zzso risk zzso as a zzso of the zzso trial zzso 

The zzso trial was a zzso study that evaluated zzso a zzso zzso transfer protein zzso zzso underwent anatomical zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only baseline imaging and zzso data zzso zzso from zzso were used as part of this zzso Our primary goal was to evaluate the relationship between zzso and zzso PET zzso As secondary zzso we evaluated the relationship between zzso PET data and zzso anatomical zzso data, and zzso zzso and matching anatomical zzso zzso All correlations were estimated using a mixed linear zzso 

We found a significant inverse relationship between several zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by zzso Regarding our secondary zzso there was a significant relationship between plaque burden measured by anatomical zzso with several zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by zzso No relationship was found between plaque composition by anatomical zzso and zzso or zzso PET zzso 

In this study we observed a zzso weak inverse relationship between inflammation measured as zzso zzso by PET and plaque zzso by zzso Our findings suggest that there may be a complex relationship between plaque inflammation and zzso during the different stages of plaque zzso zzso PET and zzso may have complementary roles in future clinical practice in identifying subjects at high risk of cardiovascular zzso
