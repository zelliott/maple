zzso the oxygen consumption of the left zzso zzso provides important insight into the relationship between zzso oxygen supply and zzso In other territories, cardiac magnetic resonance has been zzso to measure zzso oxygen consumption with a blood level oxygen dependent zzso zzso The zzso technology requires repetitive sampling of stationary zzso and is frequently implemented in areas such as the zzso A limitation to utilizing zzso cardiac magnetic resonance techniques in the heart has been cardiac zzso In this study, we document a methodology for acquiring zzso images in the heart and demonstrate the utility of the technique for identifying associations between zzso oxygen consumption and blood zzso
