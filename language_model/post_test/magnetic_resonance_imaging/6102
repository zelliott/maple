We sought to determine the zzso value of magnetic resonance imaging measures of vascular disease zzso matter zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso on the progression of mild cognitive impairment to zzso 

We included 152 consecutive patients with mild cognitive zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine the presence of zzso zzso lobe zzso and vascular disease zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was determined, and zzso were rated on a zzso zzso Patients were followed up for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso patients progressed to zzso during zzso Of these, 56 zzso patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and 16 zzso patients were diagnosed with a zzso zzso (including vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso and Parkinson zzso zzso were older and had a lower zzso State zzso score at zzso On baseline magnetic resonance imaging, patients who progressed to a zzso zzso showed more severe zzso and had a higher prevalence of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso Cox zzso models showed that, adjusted for age and sex, baseline zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but not vascular disease, was associated with progression to Alzheimer's zzso By contrast, deep zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso predicted progression to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso yielded a zzso increased, though zzso risk of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso lobe zzso and markers of cerebrovascular disease predict the development of different types of zzso in mild cognitive impairment zzso
