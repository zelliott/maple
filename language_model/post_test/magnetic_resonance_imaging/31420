To zzso assess the reliability of magnetic resonance zzso image volume measurement in fetuses with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the reliability and zzso of zzso in in zzso lung zzso 

This study was approved by the ethics committee, and informed consent was zzso MR fetal lung volume zzso was measured in 40 consecutive fetuses with zzso by using zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso MR imaging and true fast imaging with zzso zzso at zzso weeks gestation zzso zzso age, zzso weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso Lung volumes were independently assessed in three zzso section planes by two experienced zzso Additionally, 28 in zzso lung models of defined volumes of zzso zzso were evaluated the same zzso To assess measurement zzso and zzso the zzso correlation zzso zzso and the zzso plot were zzso 

The zzso reliability was high for both the lung models and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also good, with a mean difference between the calculated volume and the true volume of zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso reliability and zzso did not zzso to any considerable degree, on imaging plane or sequence zzso range, zzso or on total zzso 

The reliability and zzso of MR volume zzso are zzso The method is independent of the sequence and the imaging plane and can be performed with a very good zzso agreement, even in small zzso
