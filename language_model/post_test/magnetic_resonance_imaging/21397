zzso selective for faces, places, and bodies feature prominently in the literature on the human zzso visual zzso Are zzso for these categories in fact the most robust response profiles in this pathway, or is their prominence an artifact of biased sampling of the hypothesis space in prior work? Here we use a zzso structure discovery method that avoids the assumptions built into most prior work by 1) giving equal consideration to all possible response profiles over the conditions tested, 2) relaxing implicit anatomical constraints zzso important functional profiles should manifest themselves in zzso zzso zzso arising in similar locations across zzso and 3) testing for dominant response profiles over images, rather than categories, thus enabling us to discover, rather than zzso the categories respected by the zzso Even with these assumptions relaxed, face, place, and body selectivity emerge as dominant in the zzso zzso
