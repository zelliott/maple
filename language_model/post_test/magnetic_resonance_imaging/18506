The present study shows that for assessment of zzso zzso and the standard methods seem to provide information of similar zzso For absolute volume zzso zzso and zzso are superior to single plane zzso and 2 DE using the modified zzso The time consuming zzso zzso method does not seem to be superior to the zzso zzso method, when zzso zzso can be ruled zzso zzso thus seems to be an accurate method for determination of zzso stroke volume as well as for determination of zzso and hence for zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, depends of a good image quality, which is crucial especially in zzso zzso containing stagnant or slowly moving zzso
