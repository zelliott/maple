This study examined the effect of visual feedback and force level on the neural mechanisms responsible for the performance of a motor zzso We used a zzso zzso approach to determine the effect of visual feedback (with and zzso during a grip force task at zzso and zzso of maximum voluntary zzso Two areas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed an interaction between force and feedback zzso When the main effect of feedback condition was zzso higher zzso when visual feedback was available was found in 22 of the 24 active brain areas, while the two other regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed greater levels of activity when no visual feedback was zzso The results suggest that there is a potentially zzso influence of visual feedback on brain zzso during a motor task, and for some regions, this is dependent on the level of force zzso
