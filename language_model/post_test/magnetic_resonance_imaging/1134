We assessed the accuracy of brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in discriminating between patients with probable Alzheimer's disease zzso at the very early stage and zzso controls before and after partial volume correction zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso We randomly divided the subjects into two zzso The first group, zzso 30 patients and 30 healthy volunteers, was used to identify the brain area with the most significant decrease in regional cerebral blood flow zzso in patients compared with normal controls based on the zzso analysis of a group zzso The second group, zzso 31 patients and 31 healthy volunteers, was used to study the improvement in diagnostic accuracy provided by zzso A Z score map for a zzso image of a subject was obtained by comparison with mean and standard zzso zzso images of the healthy volunteers for each zzso after anatomical zzso and zzso zzso to global mean or zzso values using the following zzso Z score zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of receiver operating characteristics zzso for a Z score discriminating zzso and controls in the zzso zzso zzso where a significant decrease in zzso was identified in the first group, showed that the zzso significantly enhanced the accuracy of the zzso diagnosis of very early zzso from zzso to zzso with global mean zzso The zzso mildly enhanced the accuracy from zzso to zzso with zzso zzso This result suggests that early diagnosis of zzso requires zzso in a zzso zzso
