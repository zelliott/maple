The zzso of zzso disrupted zzso barrier zzso to zzso zzso zzso was studied in zzso zzso opening was induced by zzso injection of zzso One hundred zzso rats were used for the zzso zzso were examined at two time points, 30 minutes and 12 hours after zzso zzso zzso Different preparations zzso injected 30 minutes before rat sacrifice were used for characterization of zzso zzso zzso integrity was determined with zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso Iron zzso particles zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso of three different sizes zzso 100, and 200 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used for investigations of the dependence of zzso zzso on particle system size or zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated as zzso contrast agent to monitor with magnetic resonance imaging zzso the zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso relaxation times of the brain tissue were measured at 40 zzso and 37 degrees C, and zzso MR images were acquired at zzso zzso After zzso zzso infusion, as expected, the zzso breakdown was immediate and temporary as judged by soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso crossed the zzso 12 hours after intravenous zzso injection, at a time when brain zzso for molecules or small particles returns to zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso of zzso zzso On zzso signal intensity decreased after injection of zzso even 12 hours after zzso zzso This zzso could be useful in the study of focal pathological zzso accompanied by zzso zzso zzso In such conditions, zzso particle contrast agents could be caught by the zzso allowing the observation of impaired zzso areas without zzso cellular zzso
