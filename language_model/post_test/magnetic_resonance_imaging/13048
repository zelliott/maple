A stable and sensitive toxin zzso zzso based on the relaxation of magnetic zzso was zzso The method was performed in one reaction and offered sensitive, fast detection of target toxin zzso in zzso The target zzso zzso zzso in Tai lake water, zzso with the zzso on the surface of the magnetic zzso and then influenced the formation of zzso of the magnetic zzso zzso the magnetic relaxation time of the magnetic zzso was changed under the effect of the target zzso The zzso curve was deduced at different zzso of the target zzso The limit of detection zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the detection range was zzso zzso zzso Another important feature of the developed method was the easy zzso only two steps were needed zzso to mix the magnetic zzso solution with the sample solution and zzso read the results through the zzso zzso the developed method may be a useful tool for toxin zzso sensing and may find widespread zzso
