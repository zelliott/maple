The modeling of zzso complexes by zzso zzso using the known structures of their constituents is developing rapidly to become a powerful tool in structural zzso It is especially useful in combination with even limited experimental information describing the zzso Here we demonstrate for the first time the use of diffusion zzso in combination with chemical shift zzso data to drive zzso zzso For validation purposes we make use of simulated diffusion zzso zzso zzso of this information, which can be derived from zzso relaxation rates and reports on the orientation of the components of a complex with respect to the zzso diffusion zzso substantially improves the zzso zzso
