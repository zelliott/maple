We report on the surgical outcome obtained in patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso with zzso zzso sclerosis zzso who were evaluated preoperatively without zzso recording and were submitted to zzso 

Two hundred twelve patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso were evaluated by means of clinical history, neurological examination, zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso disclosed unilateral zzso in all zzso All patients were submitted to zzso at the side determined by zzso 

zzso zzso showed unilateral zzso lobe zzso in 176 zzso in 36 patients, bilateral zzso were zzso Mean follow-up time was zzso zzso One hundred zzso patients zzso were classified as zzso class zzso zzso patients zzso were rated as zzso class zzso zzso out of 36 patients, in whom bilateral zzso were found, were in zzso class zzso Sixty percent of the patients had an improvement in memory function related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of the patients had a zzso increase in general zzso zzso zzso memory decline was noted in three zzso zzso examination showed zzso in all zzso 

It is possible to adequately select good surgical candidates for zzso lobe zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso we should expect a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decline was very rarely seen in this patient zzso The finding of zzso on zzso is the single most important zzso factor for good outcome after zzso lobe zzso
