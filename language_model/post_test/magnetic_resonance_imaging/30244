Restoration of function after stroke may be associated with structural zzso of zzso connections outside the zzso zzso However, the zzso profile of zzso zzso in zzso connectivity in relation to functional recovery is still largely zzso We performed in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso tract tracing with zzso in combination with zzso detection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess changes in zzso and zzso zzso network connections from 2 to 10 weeks after unilateral stroke in zzso In addition, functional recovery was measured by repetitive behavioral zzso Four days after zzso injection in zzso zzso cortex, zzso enhancement and zzso zzso were decreased in zzso areas of the zzso zzso network at 2 weeks after stroke, which was restored at later time zzso At 4 to 10 weeks after stroke, we detected significantly increased zzso enhancement in the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions were initially disturbed but subsequently recovered and zzso 17 days after zzso This study shows that zzso zzso can provide unique in zzso information on the zzso pattern of zzso plasticity after zzso Our data suggest that the plateau stage of functional recovery is associated with restoration of zzso zzso pathways and enhanced zzso zzso
