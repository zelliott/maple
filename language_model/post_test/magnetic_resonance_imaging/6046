To evaluate the changes in the location of the zzso muscles zzso following zzso surgery to treat a large degree of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso 

Six consecutive patients who underwent zzso zzso surgery with 360 degrees of zzso and subsequent zzso surgery were zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was performed before and after the zzso The angle made by the line connecting the center of the orbit and the center of each zzso muscle and the horizontal was zzso The changes in these angles before and after zzso surgery were zzso 

The average rotation of the globe after zzso surgery was 28 degrees zzso zzso zzso range, 17 degrees zzso degrees zzso The average measured zzso shift was zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso range, zzso degrees to zzso degrees zzso 

Despite large zzso rotation of the globe, there was no corresponding zzso repositioning of the deep paths of the zzso zzso The paths of the operated muscles were essentially zzso
