zzso zzso studies demonstrate age-related differences in recruitment of a large-scale zzso network during interference resolution, especially within zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso These zzso in functional responses have been frequently observed despite equivalent task performance, suggesting age-related zzso of neural resources, although direct evidence for a zzso effect in aging is zzso We used the zzso interference task and zzso zzso to investigate age-related differences in the zzso signature of conflict resolution, and their behavioral implications in younger and older zzso There were zzso increases in activity, involving zzso and zzso zzso networks that generalized across zzso In addition an zzso interaction was observed within a distributed network, including zzso and zzso with greater activity during interference in the zzso Next, we combined zzso and functional connectivity analyses to investigate whether zzso brain changes were present in older adults, using zzso and zzso as regions of interest zzso seed zzso This analysis revealed two networks zzso related to performance across age zzso A structural analysis revealed age-related zzso losses in regions zzso performance in the young, suggesting that functional reorganization may partly reflect structural zzso in zzso zzso these findings suggest that age-related structural changes contribute to reductions in the efficient recruitment of a zzso interference network, which zzso into zzso of a different network zzso conflict resolution in elderly zzso
