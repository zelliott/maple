To capitalize on data from different clinical series to compare sensitivity and specificity of individual zzso for predicting mild cognitive impairment zzso progression to Alzheimer's disease zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso and zzso fluid zzso were assessed in 18 patients with mild cognitive impairment zzso with zzso zzso zzso conversion time, 26 zzso 12 zzso and 18 stable zzso zzso patients from the zzso zzso Memory Clinic zzso as well as in 24 zzso patients zzso time, 36 zzso 12 zzso and 33 zzso patients from the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by manual, zzso and automated zzso zzso cortical zzso was measured using several zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso fluid markers were zzso zzso zzso and total zzso protein zzso For each zzso sensitivity for zzso specificity for zzso and diagnostic accuracy were zzso 

zzso to predict zzso conversion to zzso in the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative and zzso zzso Memory Clinic zzso was zzso and zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso volumes, zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso based on different zzso zzso and zzso and zzso based on total zzso levels, zzso zzso to exclude zzso was zzso and 50% based on zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso volumes, zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso based on different zzso zzso and zzso and zzso based on total zzso levels, zzso 

Current findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso volumes may be used in combination to best identify zzso
