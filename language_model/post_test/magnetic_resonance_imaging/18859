zzso zzso and simplicity are key aspects for user acceptance of surgical planning systems in the long zzso Automatic zzso and identification of geometric reference systems of the anatomical structures are essential to fulfill these zzso A statistical motivated shape zzso of the knee joint, based on 235 normal and abnormal MR and CT volume sets, is constructed for automatic zzso of CT image zzso In the first step of the zzso construction, the zzso structures of the knee were segmented zzso and processed into a dense and a sparse zzso surface mesh to obtain training data zzso To establish an zzso correspondence, a zzso registration method is zzso The registered sparse surface zzso are zzso to estimate a zzso zzso zzso The shape zzso is build upon these zzso and integrated into a zzso zzso An zzso zzso scheme is proposed, which consists of a combination of the zzso zzso for spatial registration and of a zzso zzso procedure for deformation of the statistical motivated shape zzso to the image zzso We expect the statistical shape model to be a robust and image zzso independent method for the zzso of pathological knee zzso in CT image zzso
