We explored age-related differences in executive function during selection of a target from among active zzso zzso zzso briefly of a zzso zzso is an executive process that zzso a target relative to other active zzso In a behavioral study, participants saw one or three words, then saw a cue to refresh one of the words, saw one word again and read it, or read a new zzso zzso the number of active representations increased response times zzso only in the refresh condition for young adults but increased zzso equally in all conditions for older adults, suggesting that they experienced interference from activated irrelevant information during perception and zzso zzso with this zzso in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, young adults showed two areas of the left zzso frontal zzso and a zzso area of frontal cortex, including anterior cingulate, that were relatively more sensitive to number of active representations during refresh than read zzso for older adults these areas were equally sensitive to number of active items for refresh and read zzso Young and older adults showed activity associated with refreshing on trials requiring selection in left zzso frontal zzso (an area associated with selection from active zzso older adults also showed activity in left anterior zzso frontal zzso (an area associated with controlled semantic zzso Our results support the hypothesis of an age-related decrease in ability to gate out activated but currently irrelevant information, and are consistent with a zzso of function between left zzso and left anterior zzso frontal zzso
