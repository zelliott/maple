The aim of this zzso zzso zzso study was to compare hand motor zzso patterns between cerebrovascular zzso patients with a zzso zzso and healthy elderly subjects and to evaluate the changes between the zzso phase and the chronic phase of zzso We studied eight right-handed patients with pure motor zzso due to a single zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Each patient underwent a first zzso zzso 20 zzso 9 days after stroke, a second zzso after 4 months and a third zzso 12 months after zzso During each zzso session, the patients performed an active motor task consisting of zzso (1 zzso finger zzso of the zzso hand and underwent a passive motor task consisting of zzso of the zzso hand performed by an zzso Data were analyzed with zzso zzso effect zzso Patients had recovered at zzso were stable between zzso and zzso but still experienced a hand zzso zzso of zzso zzso coordinates in patients compared to healthy subjects suggested an early reorganization within the zzso and a secondary reorganization within the zzso zzso at zzso The main differences between patients and healthy subjects were zzso recruitment of the zzso part of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso a general zzso (except in the zzso primary motor zzso and zzso an evolution in the zzso zzso from an early (20 days after zzso zzso zzso to a later (4 months after zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Changes in zzso were confirmed by the passive task that involved no effort and little zzso Despite clinical stability, changes in brain processing seemed to occur between zzso and zzso corresponding to a zzso of zzso zzso zzso a decrease of bilateral zzso zzso and a progressive increase in zzso 40 activity suggesting evolving zzso networks to sustain zzso
