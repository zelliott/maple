Recently, zzso approaches to total knee zzso zzso have been introduced that zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging data to manufacture custom cutting zzso specific to a patient's zzso zzso These approaches intend to provide the benefits of accurate implant alignment while overcoming some of the proposed disadvantages of current computer navigation zzso In this study, a cost and benefit assessment of implementing the zzso approach compared to conventional and zzso zzso was conducted at a large academic medical zzso zzso and zzso operating room zzso costs were determined and zzso as well as the cost for processing operative equipment and additional zzso zzso Overall, zzso zzso was not cost saving in this model on a zzso basis compared to conventional methods, although it was less costly overall to the institution compared to implementing zzso zzso However, the zzso approach provides the institution with an additional 28 minutes of available OR time per intervention based on reduction in preparation and operative times compared to conventional methods and an additional 67 minutes compared to computer navigation based on this zzso This time savings is likely to provide a greater economic impact to the health care system than zzso cost zzso
