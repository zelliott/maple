To determine whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso observed in the zzso Disease zzso Initiative zzso convenience sample differ from those observed in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of 2 zzso 

zzso recruiting sites for the zzso in the United States and Canada and the zzso a zzso cohort in Olmsted County, zzso 

zzso normal subjects and zzso subjects with mild cognitive impairment were selected from the zzso convenience cohort and zzso zzso zzso A simple random sample of subjects from both zzso in the same age range was selected, and a second sample applied matching for age, sex, educational level, zzso E zzso and zzso State zzso zzso 

zzso zzso volumes and annual percentage of decline in zzso zzso 

In the zzso sample, zzso subjects were older, had less education, performed worse on the zzso State zzso and had a family history of zzso disease less often than did zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were larger in zzso compared with zzso cognitively normal subjects in the random sample, although no differences were observed after zzso Rates of decline in zzso volume were greater in the zzso compared with the zzso for cognitively normal subjects and those with zzso mild cognitive zzso even after zzso 

Rates of decline in zzso volume suggest that zzso subjects have a more aggressive brain zzso process than zzso subjects and hence may not be representative of the general zzso These findings have implications for treatment trials that use zzso recruitment mechanisms and for studies zzso new diagnostic criteria for zzso disease in its various zzso
