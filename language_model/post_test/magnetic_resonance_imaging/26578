The zzso zzso Network zzso is a higher order functional neural network that displays zzso during passive rest and zzso during many types of cognitive zzso zzso the zzso is viewed to represent the neural correlate of zzso self-referential zzso This hypothesis implies that the zzso requires the involvement of cognitive zzso like zzso zzso The present study thus examines the spatial and functional convergence of the zzso and the semantic memory zzso Using an active zzso functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso paradigm and Independent zzso Analysis zzso we trace the zzso and zzso signal changes evoked by semantic, zzso and zzso decision tasks upon zzso zzso Our findings show less zzso during semantic compared to the two zzso tasks for the entire zzso unit and within zzso zzso regions, zzso the zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, the anterior zzso cortex, the zzso cortex, the angular zzso the middle zzso zzso and the anterior zzso region, as well as the right zzso These results demonstrate that well-known semantic regions are zzso and functionally involved in the zzso The present study further supports the hypothesis of the zzso as an internal zzso system that involves zzso memory zzso
