zzso dominant zzso kidney disease slowly zzso to zzso zzso disease and has no effective zzso A pilot study suggested that the zzso analogue zzso zzso release zzso could be zzso in this zzso We aimed to assess the effect of 3 years of zzso treatment on kidney and zzso growth and zzso function decline in participants with this zzso 

We did an academic, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trial in five hospitals in zzso Adult zzso zzso patients with estimated zzso zzso rate zzso of 40 zzso per zzso zzso or higher were randomly assigned zzso allocation by phone with a zzso list, zzso ratio, zzso by zzso block size four and zzso to 3 year treatment with two 20 zzso intramuscular injections of zzso zzso or zzso sodium zzso solution zzso every 28 zzso Study physicians and nurses were aware of the allocated zzso participants and outcome zzso were masked to zzso The primary zzso was change in total kidney volume zzso measured by zzso at 1 year and 3 year zzso zzso were by modified intention to zzso This study is registered with zzso zzso 

zzso was between April 27, 2006, and May 12, zzso 38 patients in the zzso group and 37 patients in the zzso group had zzso zzso scans at 1 year zzso at this zzso mean zzso increased significantly less in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso 35 patients in each group had zzso zzso scans at 3 year zzso at this zzso mean zzso increase in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso was zzso smaller than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso but the difference was not significant zzso 37 zzso participants in the zzso group and 32 zzso in the zzso group had at least one adverse event zzso Participants with serious adverse events were similarly distributed in the two treatment zzso However, four cases of zzso or acute zzso occurred in the zzso group and were probably zzso 

These findings provide the background for large zzso controlled trials to test the protective effect of zzso zzso against zzso function loss and progression to zzso kidney zzso
