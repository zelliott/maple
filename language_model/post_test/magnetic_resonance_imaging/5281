zzso zzso zzso of response to zzso in patients with schizophrenia is a critical goal of zzso zzso Few studies, however, have investigated the relationship between zzso of brain structure and treatment response in the context of a controlled clinical zzso In this study, we sought to identify magnetic resonance zzso imaging measures of the brain that predict treatment response in patients experiencing a zzso of zzso zzso MR imaging scans were acquired in 39 patients experiencing a zzso of schizophrenia with minimal or no prior exposure to zzso participating in a zzso zzso clinical trial comparing the efficacy of zzso vs zzso Twenty-five patients were classified as zzso by meeting zzso defined treatment response criteria on 2 consecutive study zzso Fourteen patients never responded to antipsychotic medication at any point during the clinical zzso MR imaging scans were also acquired in 45 zzso and zzso healthy zzso zzso pattern matching methods were used to compare cortical thickness and asymmetry measures among zzso zzso mapping results, confirmed by zzso testing, indicated that zzso had greater cortical thickness in zzso regions and greater frontal cortical asymmetry compared with zzso Moreover, among responders, greater thickness in zzso regions was associated with less time to zzso Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that plasticity and cortical thickness may be more preserved in zzso and that MR imaging may assist in the prediction of antipsychotic drug response in patients experiencing a zzso of zzso
