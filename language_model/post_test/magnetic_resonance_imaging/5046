We performed a prospective zzso study of the zzso and zzso changes in infants with zzso of the great arteries zzso or zzso zzso physiology to identify variables in zzso development of the brain associated with functional zzso 

zzso infants with zzso heart zzso 23 with zzso and 10 with zzso were studied at around 1 year old zzso 1) and 3 years old zzso 2) by magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso zzso assessment was performed at the same zzso 

The whole and frontal lobe volumes were significantly reduced in both groups at time 1 compared with normal control subjects zzso zzso zzso However, by time 2 whole and frontal brain volumes were normal in the zzso group but remained significantly smaller zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In agreement with these findings, the mental development index zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso at time 1 in both groups but improved to normal levels at time 2 in the zzso zzso In the zzso group, both zzso and the zzso development index zzso were significantly decreased at both time 1 and time 2 zzso zzso zzso These patients continued to experience zzso and zzso analysis revealed that functional oxygen zzso was significantly associated with zzso Further, the zzso score correlated with whole and regional brain volumes zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso outcomes improve progressively in infants with zzso unlike those with zzso zzso zzso cerebral circulation and zzso may have significant effects on brain growth and development in infants with critical zzso heart zzso
