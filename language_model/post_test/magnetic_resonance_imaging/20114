To combine the specific advantages of the generalized zzso partially parallel acquisitions zzso technique and sensitivity zzso zzso with two-dimensional zzso zzso 

By splitting the zzso reconstruction process into multiple one-dimensional zzso zzso the normal zzso zzso method can be used for image zzso Due to this zzso process, a zzso reconstruction is performed along the zzso zzso direction and effectively a zzso reconstruction is performed along the zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso experiments demonstrate the successful zzso of the zzso zzso Experimental results with up to zzso acceleration using a zzso zzso receiver head zzso array are zzso 

The proposed zzso combination for zzso imaging allows the zzso method to be applied in combination with zzso zzso Because the zzso combination is not based on knowledge of spatial zzso sensitivities, it should be the method of choice whenever it is difficult to extract the sensitivity zzso
