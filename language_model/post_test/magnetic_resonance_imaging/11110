To assess the influence of tumor diameter on tumor mobility and motion of the tumor bearing zzso during the whole breathing cycle in patients with stage I zzso lung cancer zzso using dynamic zzso 

zzso cycles of zzso patients with solitary zzso were examined using a zzso sequence (three images per zzso Patients were divided into three groups according to the zzso tumor diameter in the zzso plane zzso 3-5 and zzso zzso Continuous zzso zzso and deep zzso and zzso positions of the chest wall, the zzso and the tumor were measured in three zzso Motion of zzso and corresponding zzso zzso bearing regions was zzso 

Patients with a tumor zzso zzso showed a significantly lower zzso motion of the tumor bearing compared with the zzso bearing zzso in the zzso zzso directions zzso 3-5 zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the lower lung region showed a significantly lower mobility compared with tumors zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso is a simple zzso method to differentiate mobility of tumors with different diameters and its influence on the surrounding zzso zzso diameter has a significant influence on tumor mobility and this might be taken into account in future zzso zzso
