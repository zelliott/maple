Although solutions for zzso correction in simultaneous zzso are improving, residual artifacts after correction still considerably affect the zzso spectrum in the zzso frequency band above 100 zzso Yet this band contains subtle but valuable zzso signatures such as fast gamma zzso or evoked zzso zzso zzso bursts related to zzso of zzso and cortical zzso Here we introduce a simultaneous zzso approach that zzso hard and software modifications for continuous acquisition of zzso zzso zzso during zzso Our approach is based upon and extends the established method of averaged artifact zzso zzso Particularly for recovery of zzso zzso signatures, zzso requires zzso sampled and constant zzso zzso to achieve optimal zzso zzso zzso we adjusted our acquisition setup such that both zzso zzso zzso and zzso sampled imaging artifacts were zzso In addition, we extended the zzso zzso to cope with other, zzso related sources of zzso variations such as subject zzso A zzso principal component analysis finally removed remaining zzso zzso We provide a detailed evaluation of averaged zzso signals and zzso broadband zzso zzso up to 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso bursts were successfully recovered during periods of MR data acquisition afflicted by imaging artifacts in the zzso zzso Compared to periods without imaging artifacts they exhibited the same mean zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso ratio of zzso zzso we identified consistent zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso can be continuously monitored during zzso using the proposed zzso
