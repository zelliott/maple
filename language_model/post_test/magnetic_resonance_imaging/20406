Those who have brain zzso smaller than 30 zzso in diameter and less than 5 in number can be treated less zzso with zzso This retrospective study evaluated the optimal brain magnetic resonance image zzso follow-up zzso for zzso cell lung cancer zzso patients to detect zzso manageable zzso brain zzso zzso 

The records of zzso patients with primary zzso treated in our institute between 2002 and 2007, were zzso The initial brain zzso was performed within one month after diagnosis of zzso and the follow-up brain zzso zzso was at the discretion of zzso The zzso between the last zzso in which brain zzso were not found and the first zzso in which brain zzso were found was defined as the critical zzso zzso zzso The relationship between zzso and the maximum size or number of zzso was zzso 

Among reviewed patients, the initial zzso of 38 patients showed brain zzso and 29 patients were diagnosed as zzso In these zzso patients, the median zzso from diagnosis of zzso to diagnosis of brain zzso was zzso zzso The median zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso All brain zzso smaller than 30 zzso in maximum diameter were found when zzso was shorter than zzso months, although 5 or more brain zzso in number were detected even by shorter zzso than 3 zzso 

Early detection of zzso by zzso zzso follow-up may provide zzso patients with more opportunities to have less invasive zzso
