zzso acute inflammatory zzso zzso which is zzso by CT and zzso as a zzso mass zzso with prominent zzso zzso is very similar to zzso zzso zzso making differential diagnosis of the two zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the different zzso activities between zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Six patients with zzso underwent zzso zzso and zzso and 4 of the patients also underwent magnetic resonance zzso zzso The images obtained from these patients were compared with the corresponding images of 19 zzso zzso zzso and 21 zzso zzso The mean zzso ratio of zzso was significantly lower than that of zzso There were no significant differences in the mean zzso and zzso ratios among these zzso The zzso zzso ratio of zzso was significantly lower than those of AA and zzso The zzso zzso ratio of zzso was significantly lower than that of zzso There were no significant differences in the zzso zzso ratios among these zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso activity of zzso significantly differs in part from that of zzso zzso Combined PET and MRS zzso examinations may be useful for differential diagnosis of these zzso
