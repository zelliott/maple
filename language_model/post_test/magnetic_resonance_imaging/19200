Brain zzso studies of zzso stimuli typically start with the premise that different types of zzso strings zzso words, zzso differ from each other in discrete ways, which should be reflected in separate and distinct areas of brain zzso The present study starts from a different zzso zzso zzso zzso and false zzso vary systematically across a continuous dimension of familiarity to English zzso Using a zzso matching task to force zzso of the zzso the four types of stimuli were visually presented to healthy adult subjects while zzso zzso were zzso Data analysis focused on zzso comparisons of zzso zzso zzso We did not find any region that was exclusively activated for real zzso Rather, differences among these string types were mainly expressed as graded changes in the balance of zzso among the zzso Our results suggest that there is a widespread network of brain regions that form a common network for the processing of all zzso string zzso
