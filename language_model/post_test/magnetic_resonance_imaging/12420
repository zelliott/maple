Due to the difficulties in establishing accurate zzso of brain network zzso across individual subjects, systematic zzso of possible functional connectivity zzso zzso in mild cognitive impairment zzso compared with normal controls zzso is a challenging zzso To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop and apply novel zzso models of resting state networks zzso learned from zzso resting state zzso zzso and zzso data to assess large-scale zzso zzso in zzso Our rationale is that some zzso in zzso are substantially altered and can hardly be directly compared with those in zzso Instead, structural landmarks derived from zzso data are much more consistent and correspondent across zzso zzso and therefore can be employed to zzso zzso in NC and serve as the zzso models of zzso for zzso To derive these zzso models, zzso in NC are constructed by zzso zzso zzso and employed to functionally zzso corresponding structural zzso zzso these zzso structural landmarks are predicted in zzso based on zzso data and used to assess zzso zzso in zzso Experimental results demonstrated that the zzso models of zzso are effective and can zzso reveal widespread zzso zzso in zzso
