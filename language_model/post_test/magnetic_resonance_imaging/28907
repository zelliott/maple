We studied in zzso dynamic changes in the triangular zzso complex zzso in ten healthy volunteers using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso A custom made surface zzso which was specially designed to allow movements of the wrist in all directions, was used in this zzso MR images in the zzso and zzso planes were acquired at maximum zzso in the neutral position and at maximum zzso During zzso and zzso little zzso of the disc proper was seen on zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso side of the zzso around the zzso zzso process showed obvious dynamic zzso The zzso head translated zzso to the radius in zzso and zzso in zzso while there was little change in the position of the zzso of the zzso in relation to the zzso Considering the three-dimensional structure of the zzso these findings suggest that the disc proper is strong enough to support the zzso zzso with little zzso during rotation and that the triangular ligament twists at its zzso During rotation there is friction between the zzso side of the disc proper and the zzso zzso On zzso zzso the disc proper became thinner in zzso due to increased zzso zzso
