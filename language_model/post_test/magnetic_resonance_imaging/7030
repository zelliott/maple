zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to study the cortical activity of the bilateral secondary zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso and painful electrical stimulation of median and zzso zzso zzso recordings were performed in eight normal young zzso The aim was at evaluating the working hypothesis of a spatial segregation of zzso and painful populations not only in the zzso representation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Del zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso topography of the secondary zzso zzso for zzso and painful zzso an zzso zzso zzso 20, zzso but also in its zzso zzso zzso showed that, in both zzso and zzso representations of bilateral zzso the activity zzso by the painful stimulation was localized more zzso with respect to that zzso by the zzso zzso A fine spatial analysis of the zzso responses revealed a clear zzso organization in the bilateral zzso zzso especially zzso to the zzso stimuli zzso segregation of the hand and foot zzso In contrast, it was not possible to zzso the zzso and zzso representations of zzso for painful zzso These results extended to the zzso zzso representation previous evidence of a spatial segregation in the zzso zzso representation of zzso for the painful and zzso zzso Furthermore, they suggest that noxious information is not zzso represented in human bilateral zzso at least as zzso from zzso data at zzso zzso
