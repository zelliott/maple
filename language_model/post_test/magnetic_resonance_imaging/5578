The objectives of our study were to compare image quality of the spine and zzso of spine abnormalities at 3 T and zzso T as well as to evaluate differences in quantitative assessment of normal and zzso zzso bone zzso 

One hundred nine MR examinations of the spine were performed at zzso T and 3 T in the same patients within a time zzso of less than 3 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso structures was analyzed by two zzso zzso and zzso bone zzso was assessed on zzso fast zzso zzso zzso The signal intensity contrast of zzso bone zzso versus normal zzso bone zzso was measured at zzso T versus 3 zzso zzso zzso and accuracy with zzso zzso were zzso to assess the performance of muscle and disk as standards to differentiate between zzso and normal bone zzso on zzso sequences at zzso T and 3 zzso 

For all zzso structures zzso image quality was rated significantly higher at 3 T than at zzso zzso with zzso of the studies overall being superior at 3 zzso The contrast between normal and zzso bone zzso was significantly larger at 3 T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than at zzso T zzso zzso zzso The highest accuracy was found using muscle signal at 3 T to differentiate between normal and zzso bone zzso 

The use of zzso zzso improves zzso of zzso structures in the spine over zzso zzso As an internal standard on zzso zzso images, skeletal muscle can be used to differentiate between zzso and normal bone zzso with higher accuracy at 3 T than at zzso zzso
