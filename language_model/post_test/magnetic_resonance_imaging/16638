The zzso zzso underlying Major zzso Disorder zzso is incompletely zzso Recent reports have implicated the insular zzso 

Two zzso of participants with zzso were zzso In the first zzso zzso we used zzso facial expression recognition zzso In the second zzso we focused on facial disgust recognition, a function associated with the insular zzso zzso weighted MR imaging was used in the second cohort to test the hypothesis of abnormal insular volume being associated with impaired disgust zzso 

zzso recognition was particularly impaired in both zzso In the second zzso the magnitude of the disgust recognition deficit correlated with reduced zzso zzso matter zzso zzso the idea of zzso involvement in zzso further, we identified the insular zzso and the anterior zzso zzso as key neural zzso of core symptoms, in that scores of 3 clinical scales (the zzso Depression zzso the Hamilton Depression zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso matter volume in these zzso 

zzso participants were clinically representative of specialist and academic psychiatric practice in the UK and presented with robust primary zzso we did not exclude common zzso such as anxiety and personality zzso 

We propose that cognitive and emotional functions assumed to be associated with the zzso are adversely affected in patients with zzso and that this may, therefore, represent the zzso for some core clinical features of zzso Further exploration of the involvement of the insular zzso in zzso is zzso
