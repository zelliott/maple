The time taken to choose a response appropriate for a cue increases with the number of potential response options zzso zzso We used this zzso constraint of choice behavior in zzso zzso experiments to identify brain areas carrying out the translation from a cue stimulus to response: Since the process takes longer with more alternatives, the activity of the areas would increase in correlation with the number of alternatives zzso available at the time of choice zzso During a choice zzso task in which one target is selected among many alternatives based on the color of a cue in the center, the frontal eye fields zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Within these regions, signals were correlated with zzso at the zzso part of the zzso and the zzso part of the zzso but not at the lateral zzso and anterior zzso This suggests a functional differentiation within each cortical zzso Furthermore, given the separate zzso projections linking zzso that are alike in zzso cognitive steps for choice decision may occur in different networks of the zzso zzso the zzso translation step in a network of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and response execution in the anterior zzso zzso zzso
