To determine zzso of and risk factors for zzso pneumonia in dogs zzso for diagnosis or treatment of zzso disk disease zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

zzso dogs that underwent general zzso for the diagnosis or treatment of zzso between 1992 and 1996 or between 2002 and zzso 

zzso pneumonia was diagnosed if compatible clinical signs zzso or zzso and zzso abnormalities zzso zzso developed within 48 hours after zzso To identify risk factors for zzso pneumonia, findings for dogs that developed zzso pneumonia between 2002 and 2006 were compared with findings for a randomly selected control group of unaffected dogs from the same zzso 

There were no significant differences in age, zzso body weight, sex, location of zzso or survival rate between the 2 time zzso but there were significant differences in the use of magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso and zzso and in the percentage of dogs that developed zzso pneumonia in the later zzso versus the earlier zzso zzso zzso risk factors for zzso pneumonia included zzso zzso cervical zzso undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, undergoing zzso 1 zzso zzso longer duration of zzso and zzso vomiting or zzso 

zzso suggested that at this institution, the zzso of zzso pneumonia in dogs zzso for diagnosis or treatment of zzso had increased in recent zzso
