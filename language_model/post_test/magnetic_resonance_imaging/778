zzso or zzso zzso blood flow patterns have been widely observed in both animals and zzso The absence of spiral flow has been associated with carotid zzso zzso The aim of this study was to detect the presence of zzso spiral flow using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to evaluate the relationship of the presence of spiral zzso flow with zzso zzso disease and zzso function in the follow-up of patients with suspected zzso zzso zzso 

Prospective study of 100 patients with suspected zzso zzso disease and 44 patient zzso Using a zzso T zzso unit zzso zzso phase contrast flow zzso and three-dimensional contrast enhanced MR zzso of the abdominal zzso were zzso Renal zzso zzso zzso were classified zzso moderate or zzso Renal function was followed at 3 months before and 6 months after zzso 

zzso flow was more prevalent in patients with more severe zzso Renal impairment progressed significantly in severe zzso without spiral flow zzso zzso zzso but did not progress significantly in severe zzso with spiral flow zzso zzso zzso In minimal or moderate zzso with or without spiral flow there was no significant progression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso spiral blood flow can be assessed with zzso Lack of zzso spiral blood flow in patients with severe zzso is associated with significant short-term zzso function zzso zzso of blood flow patterns may be a useful indicator of zzso impairment progression in patients with suspected zzso artery zzso
