There is increasing evidence to suggest that primary sensory zzso can become active in the absence of external stimulation in their respective zzso This occurs, for example, when stimuli processed via one sensory zzso imply features characteristic of a different zzso for instance, visual stimuli that imply touch have been observed to activate the primary zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we addressed the question of whether such zzso zzso are content zzso To this end, we investigated neural activity in the primary zzso zzso of subjects who observed human hands engaged in the zzso exploration of different everyday zzso Using zzso pattern analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we were able to zzso based exclusively on the activity pattern in zzso which of several objects a subject saw being zzso Along with previous studies that found similar evidence for other zzso our results suggest that primary sensory zzso represent information relevant for their zzso even when this information enters the brain via a different sensory zzso
