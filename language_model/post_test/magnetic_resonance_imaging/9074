zzso syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of crossed connections between neural structures in the brain stem that control eye zzso The goal of the study was to zzso the eye movement abnormalities that occur in zzso zzso 

Eye movements were recorded in response to stationary stimuli and stimuli designed to elicit smooth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso or zzso search coils in 8 patients with zzso zzso All patients underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

All patients had the highly characteristic zzso tooth sign on brain zzso Six patients had zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gaze holding was stable in four zzso zzso gains were zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso at peak stimulus zzso of 10, 20, and 30 zzso in six zzso smooth pursuit could not be zzso in four zzso zzso gains in five patients ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be zzso in five zzso zzso zzso gain was zzso reduced across zzso drifted at zzso of 15, 30, and 45 zzso zzso gain was zzso or higher and phase appropriate in three of seven zzso zzso gain was zzso or less and phase was indeterminate in four zzso 

The abnormalities in zzso and eye movements are consistent with the distributed abnormalities of zzso zzso and brain stem regions associated with zzso zzso
