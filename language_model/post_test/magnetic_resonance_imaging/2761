A series of designs is presented for restricted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By using the real space zzso technique, simulated zzso zzso it is possible to produce viable zzso sets with a zzso ratio zzso of just zzso zzso remote return paths for the zzso coils aid in producing such short zzso While the linear regions of such coils cannot be as large as longer zzso they produce homogeneous linear regions suitable for use in zzso zzso The zzso sets are well zzso even at such small zzso
