The effect of warm zzso and zzso injury in the zzso rat liver after portal vein branch zzso zzso was examined by monitoring zzso high energy zzso metabolism using in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On 14 days after zzso zzso of the portal zzso energy metabolism of zzso lobe of the liver was evaluated by measuring the ratio of zzso to zzso obtained using zzso During zzso zzso dropped down similarly below the limit of observation in both of control and zzso zzso However, after zzso in the zzso liver, the earlier and better recovery of zzso was observed compared with the zzso In the any examination of zzso zzso increase in zzso level was apparently restrained in the zzso zzso On the pathological examination, zzso necrosis and zzso zzso were remarkable in the normal liver, while in the zzso liver, these changes were zzso In conclusion, these results suggest that zzso injury observed in the zzso liver seems to be reduced compared with that in the normal zzso zzso and structural changes in the zzso liver could be claimed as a course of this zzso However, to understand the zzso further study will be needed both in zzso and zzso zzso
