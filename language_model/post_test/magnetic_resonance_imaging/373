Age is associated with substantial zzso brain zzso While some recent magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported larger age effects in men than women, others find no sex zzso As brain zzso is a potentially important tool in diagnosis and monitoring of age-related neurological diseases, zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso it is important to know whether sex influences brain zzso We analyzed zzso magnetic resonance scans from zzso healthy participants from seven zzso provided by four independent research zzso In addition, 96 patients with mild zzso were zzso Estimates of cortical thickness continuously across the brain surface, as well as volume of 17 zzso structures, were obtained by use of automated zzso tools zzso In the healthy participants, no differences in aging slopes between women and men were found in any part of the zzso zzso corrected for zzso volume showed slightly higher age correlations for zzso The analyses were repeated in each of the seven zzso and the lack of age zzso sex interactions was largely zzso zzso of the zzso sample showed no interactions between sex and age for any brain zzso We conclude that sex has negligible effects on the age slope of brain volumes both in healthy participants and in zzso
