Although enlargement of the cerebral zzso plays a central role in the diagnosis of normal pressure zzso zzso there are no reports on the use of zzso assessment to distinguish between patients who respond to zzso shunt surgery and those who do zzso The purpose of this study is to explore the association between zzso zzso compartment volumes and zzso zzso 

Twenty-six patients (17 zzso mean age, 75 years zzso zzso zzso with a clinical or zzso suspicion of zzso were included in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso function were evaluated by clinical zzso MR imaging of the brain was acquired at zzso T and zzso zzso Total zzso volume, zzso volume, brain volume, and zzso zzso volume were determined by zzso zzso Four imaging variables were zzso zzso volume ratio, brain volume ratio, zzso zzso volume ratio, and the ratio of zzso volume to zzso zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso shunt zzso 

Clinical follow-up was assessed 1 year after shunt zzso No difference in the mean zzso volume ratio, the mean brain volume ratio, the mean zzso zzso volume ratio, and the mean ratio between zzso and zzso zzso volume was found between subjects who improved on gait or zzso or zzso function and those who did zzso 

zzso assessment has no zzso value in zzso between zzso patients who respond to zzso shunt surgery and those who do zzso
