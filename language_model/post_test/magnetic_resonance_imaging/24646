zzso behavior involves interactions between systems regulating zzso and instrumental control of zzso Here, we present the first investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying aversive zzso transfer using zzso in zzso Recent evidence indicates that these zzso influences on instrumental actions are zzso zzso approach is zzso by zzso zzso cues but inhibited by aversive zzso zzso zzso instrumental withdrawal is inhibited by zzso zzso cues but zzso by aversive zzso zzso We show that zzso responses in the zzso and the nucleus zzso were associated with behavioral zzso by aversive zzso cues, irrespective of action zzso Furthermore, zzso responses in the zzso prefrontal zzso differed between approach and withdrawal zzso Aversive zzso zzso stimuli modulated connectivity between the zzso prefrontal zzso and the zzso zzso These results show that zzso aversive control of instrumental behavior involves the zzso of zzso interactions by zzso zzso zzso
