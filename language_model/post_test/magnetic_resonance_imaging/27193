This study aims to assess the diagnostic value of zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso combined with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the differential diagnosis and grading of brain tumors by comparing zzso data with zzso findings obtained after zzso or zzso 

A total of 159 patients with a previous brain tumor diagnosis underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso and zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed with an echo time of 30, zzso zzso zzso 160 zzso acquisition time 7 zzso 34 zzso zzso maps were evaluated during zzso zzso analysis was performed on the examination of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso test, and zzso zzso We used the zzso test to compare zzso 

In the differential diagnosis between zzso and zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso zzso reached high sensibility and specificity zzso In brain tumor zzso the same method reached high sensibility and specificity zzso in distinguishing grade zzso zzso but encountered difficulty in determining grades within the two main groups of primary brain tumors, especially where mixed zzso were zzso 

The systematic use of zzso zzso and zzso imaging has shown a high potential in the differential diagnosis and grading of brain zzso Further exploration into diagnostic procedures that can significantly distinguish between grade zzso and grade II tumors is zzso
