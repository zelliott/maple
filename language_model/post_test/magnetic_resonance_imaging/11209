zzso primates produce a diverse repertoire of zzso calls and have rich conceptual zzso Some of their calls are designed to convey information about concepts such as zzso food, and social zzso as well as the affective state of the zzso Little is known about the neural architecture of these calls, and much of what we do know is based on zzso physiology from zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso in awake zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso visual areas, including regions in the zzso lobe associated with the visual perception of object form zzso and motion zzso zzso zzso and storing visual object information into long-term memory zzso as well as in zzso (the zzso and zzso and zzso regions zzso prefrontal zzso associated with the interpretation and zzso of highly salient and affective zzso This neural zzso strongly zzso to the network shown to support representation of zzso and affective information in zzso These findings shed light on the evolutionary precursors of conceptual representation in humans, suggesting that monkeys and humans have a common neural zzso for representing object zzso
