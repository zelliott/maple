zzso delivery zzso has been developed as an effective zzso strategy for brain zzso zzso direct zzso of the tissue distribution of drugs infused by zzso would assure successful delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain tumor while minimizing exposure of the normal brain zzso We previously showed the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso delivered via zzso against a zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso Here, we developed a method to monitor the drug distribution using a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of a mixture of zzso with zzso was performed using three zzso primates under real-time magnetic resonance imaging zzso Animals were clinically observed for any toxicity after zzso Two months later, their brains were subjected to zzso examination for the evaluation of local zzso Another one animal was zzso immediately after zzso of a mixture of zzso zzso and Evans blue dye to evaluate the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The harvested brain was cut into blocks and the zzso content was zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging monitoring of zzso zzso confirmed the success of the infusion zzso In the monkey that also received Evans blue, the distribution of Evans blue was similar to that of zzso and paralleled the measured zzso content, suggesting zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso examination revealed minimum tissue damage with the infusion of zzso at 1 zzso determined as a safe dose in our previous zzso zzso zzso of zzso can be zzso with zzso to ensure successful infusion and monitor the distribution zzso
