To determine if zzso incoherent motion zzso imaging zzso zzso including free zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso correlate with the degree of tumor necrosis and viable tumor in zzso cancer zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients referred for zzso of liver zzso from zzso were zzso included in this Institutional Review Board approved zzso An zzso sequence was performed on a zzso zzso MR imaging system, with 10 b factors zzso 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 100, zzso 400 and 800 zzso zzso Mean D, zzso f and apparent diffusion zzso zzso values were determined in zzso with a longest diameter above 10 zzso zzso between the diffusion parameters and the degree of liver tumor necrosis and viable tissue were determined zzso 

zzso between diffusion parameters and zzso findings was performed in 35 zzso zzso with a diameter of more than 10 zzso zzso size of zzso zzso range, zzso zzso Both D zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlated with the degree of tumor necrosis but not with viable zzso 

zzso variation observed in zzso zzso following systemic chemotherapy reflects a specific increase in zzso diffusion zzso in itself correlated to the degree of zzso zzso
