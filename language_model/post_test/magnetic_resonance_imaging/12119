Eight patients with acoustic tumor were studied with a zzso MR zzso zzso images with zzso most accurately showed the margin of the seventh and eighth nerves in the internal auditory canal and were most sensitive in detecting small zzso zzso images were inferior to zzso images, that could fail to detect small zzso High resolution, thin zzso MR imaging using surface zzso is particularly useful for small acoustic tumor because of its higher specificity compared with zzso zzso
