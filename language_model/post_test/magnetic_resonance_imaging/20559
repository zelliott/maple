Combining information across zzso can affect sensory zzso We studied how zzso sounds zzso behavioral visual detection sensitivity zzso and neural responses, for visual stimuli of higher or lower zzso zzso of a sound enhanced human detection sensitivity for zzso but not zzso visual zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso linked this to boosts in zzso for zzso visual and auditory cortex, plus zzso superior zzso zzso zzso specifically for a zzso visual event when paired with a zzso zzso structures in visual and auditory zzso the lateral and zzso zzso bodies, respectively zzso zzso showed a similar zzso zzso zzso benefits correlated with corresponding zzso signals in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also analyzed differential zzso patterns of zzso and zzso with other regions in the different experimental zzso zzso analyses showed enhanced zzso of zzso zzso bodies with the affected cortical sites during enhanced detection of zzso visual events paired with zzso zzso strength between visual and auditory zzso with cortical regions, including zzso zzso zzso with the zzso benefit for this specific zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso enhancement of detection sensitivity for zzso visual stimuli by zzso sounds reflects a brain network involving not only established zzso zzso and zzso zzso but also visual and auditory zzso
