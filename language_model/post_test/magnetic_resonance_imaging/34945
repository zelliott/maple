The clinical utility of zzso zzso is well zzso but the materials and techniques required to perform the procedure are not widely available outside major research zzso We describe a personal computer-based method of zzso data zzso 

Using a zzso zzso we obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans of 20 healthy volunteers aged zzso zzso We used an inexpensive utility program to extract image information and an zzso Image for image zzso The zzso zzso were traced with a graphics tablet and landmarks described by Watson et zzso zzso zzso zzso of individual zzso zzso were used to fine tune the selection of landmarks and zzso zzso silhouette pairs generated from these zzso zzso were compared to determine how well observers could visually zzso area zzso 

Visual detection of asymmetry of silhouette pairs was sensitive, but the magnitude of asymmetry was zzso We achieved zzso zzso of variation of zzso volume ratios between zzso and zzso and an zzso range of volume ratios of zzso In 20 healthy controls aged zzso years, the mean right and left zzso volumes were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The lower limits of normal were zzso zzso for the right and zzso zzso for the zzso The mean zzso zzso ratio was zzso and the limits of normal (3 zzso for this were zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso can be performed reliably and zzso Our methodology makes it possible for different observers to generate consistent and comparable zzso
