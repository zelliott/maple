To correlate magnetic resonance zzso images of a bone zzso zzso pattern with zzso findings in zzso zzso 

Sixteen consecutive patients (age range, zzso years; mean, 67 zzso referred for total knee replacement were examined with zzso short inversion time zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR imaging zzso days before zzso zzso plateau abnormalities on MR images were compared zzso with those on zzso zzso 

The bone zzso zzso pattern zone zzso and zzso on STIR images and zzso on zzso MR zzso mainly consisted of normal tissue zzso of the area was fatty zzso zzso was intact zzso and zzso was blood zzso and a smaller proportion of several abnormalities zzso zzso necrosis zzso of zzso abnormal zzso or zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso bleeding zzso The bone zzso zzso pattern zone and the zone with a normal MR imaging appearance differed significantly in the presence of bone zzso necrosis zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and abnormal zzso zzso zzso but not in the prevalence of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso zzso also was found in zones with an unremarkable MR appearance zzso zone, zzso zzso control zone, zzso zzso 

A bone zzso zzso pattern in zzso knees represents a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso is not a major constituent of MR imaging signal intensity abnormalities in such zzso
