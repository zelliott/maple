This presentation explores clinical zzso limitations, and the scientific rationale for use of zzso contrast agents in MR imaging of the brain and zzso Enhancement of abnormal zzso zzso is related to structure and function of the zzso barrier under zzso conditions, the zzso of which is tumor zzso zzso administration can improve the diagnostic sensitivity of zzso MR imaging, zzso detection of zzso or zzso disease spread and zzso Moreover, use of contrast often provides greater diagnostic specificity by virtue of the presence and, in many cases, the absence of zzso This is particularly helpful in distinguishing zzso from other potential causes of high signal intensity on zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to improving diagnosis of zzso zzso use is often necessary to demonstrate most zzso zzso and to differentiate zzso disc from zzso zzso in the zzso surgery zzso Advanced techniques that exploit zzso properties zzso MR zzso zzso MR zzso or increase its diagnostic effectiveness zzso fat suppression in the zzso zzso are zzso
