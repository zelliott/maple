We studied zzso times for diagnostic and zzso zzso using zzso billing data and paper zzso zzso For computerized zzso and magnetic resonance imaging procedures, we tried to predict future zzso times by using historical zzso times classified by Current zzso zzso zzso zzso By this method, zzso times were estimated even less accurately than operating room zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging had many different zzso codes, most rare, and zzso codes reflected zzso zzso not scanning zzso However, when, zzso times were estimated by expert judgment, face zzso and accuracy were zzso Lower and upper prediction bounds were also estimated from the expert zzso For zzso zzso predicting zzso times was challenging because few zzso codes accounted for most zzso Because zzso zzso scheduled their zzso cases into allocated time, the necessary goal was not to estimate the time to complete each case but rather the time to complete each day's entire series of zzso cases including turnover zzso We determined the time of day zzso 4 zzso up to when zzso zzso could schedule so that on zzso of days the zzso team finishes no later than a specified time zzso 6 zzso Both diagnostic and zzso zzso results were similarly less accurate when zzso 9 of the International zzso of zzso procedure codes was used instead of zzso
