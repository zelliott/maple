Some involvement of the human zzso in the processing of facial expressions has been investigated in zzso studies, although the neural mechanisms underlying motivated or emotional behavior in response to facial stimuli are not yet fully zzso We investigated, using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and healthy volunteers, how the zzso interacts with other cortical regions while subjects are judging the sex of faces with negative, positive, or neutral zzso The data were analyzed by a zzso method, then, to clarify possible interaction among regions within the brain, several kinds of analysis zzso a correlation analysis, a zzso interaction analysis and a structural equation zzso were zzso Overall, significant zzso was observed in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, and the right zzso lobe during the zzso The results of zzso between the conditions showed that the left amygdala, right zzso cortex, and zzso zzso were predominantly involved in the processing of the negative zzso The right angular zzso was involved in the processing of the positive expressions when the negative condition was zzso from the positive zzso The correlation analysis showed that activity in the left zzso positively correlated with activity in the left prefrontal zzso under the negative minus neutral zzso zzso The zzso interaction revealed that the neural responses in the left zzso and the right prefrontal zzso underwent the zzso changes between the negative and positive face zzso The right zzso activity also had an interactive effect with activity in the right zzso and middle zzso zzso These results may suggest that the left and right zzso play a differential role in effective processing of facial expressions in collaboration with other cortical or zzso regions, with the left being related with the bilateral prefrontal cortex, and the right with the right zzso zzso
