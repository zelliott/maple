zzso zzso zzso were measured in infant rats using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso were made prior to, during and after exposure of rats zzso and zzso to unilateral cerebral zzso zzso carotid artery zzso zzso zzso zzso Data clustered according to age and zzso animals with no zzso and zzso animals with zzso In zzso animals, cerebral zzso concentration increased during zzso particularly zzso to the zzso and returned to normal soon after the end of zzso There were no major changes in zzso levels zzso in this group and no regions of zzso on zzso or zzso weighted images at 24 zzso In the zzso animals, zzso increased during zzso and remained elevated in the first hour after zzso Furthermore, zzso remained at zzso and zzso of zzso levels, 24 and 48 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso decreased to zzso during zzso recovered early zzso and again decreased to zzso and zzso at 24 and 48 h zzso zzso The zzso volumes measured by diffusion weighted and zzso weighted zzso at 48 h zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, irreversible damage correlated well with measured in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Those animals in which zzso was zzso and zzso recovered soon after zzso did not show long-term damage zzso zzso whereas those animals in which zzso decreased and zzso remained elevated went on to zzso zzso zzso
