zzso fat zzso is frequently visible on magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the spine in patients with zzso zzso zzso and likely reflects zzso tissue zzso To support the concept of zzso between inflammation and new bone formation, we tested the hypothesis that focal fat zzso at a zzso corner is more likely to evolve into a de zzso zzso 

zzso scans were obtained at baseline and zzso were obtained at baseline and 2 years in 100 AS patients from 2 zzso a clinical trial cohort zzso zzso zzso and an zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso In the clinical trial zzso patients were zzso to receive zzso necrosis factor zzso therapy or zzso for zzso weeks and then zzso treatment for 2 zzso In the zzso zzso patients received either standard therapy zzso zzso zzso or zzso therapy zzso zzso 26) for 2 zzso zzso corner inflammation and fat zzso were assessed independently by pairs of readers who were blinded with regard to the zzso zzso 

New zzso developed significantly more frequently in zzso corners with fat in both the clinical trial zzso and the zzso zzso cohort as compared to those without either feature on baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso variations in baseline zzso zzso corners that were zzso significantly predicted new zzso with an odds ratio zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while a model that included baseline variations in both fat and inflammation showed an OR of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for inflammation and an OR of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

Our data lend support to the hypothesis that inflammatory zzso evolve into new bone through a process of tissue zzso that includes fat zzso
