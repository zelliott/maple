We investigated the influence of stimulus complexity on the zzso network of visual areas involved in zzso zzso form zzso zzso zzso imaging on 14 healthy, adult volunteers was performed during a two alternative forced choice zzso form discrimination zzso The functional load imposed onto the visual system was varied by using simple and complex zzso The figures were defined using a zzso a chromatic or a motion contrast zzso The three cues activated the same visual areas in the zzso pathway, including area zzso zzso of visual area zzso but not area zzso in the zzso zzso was observed to the motion contrast zzso The simple shapes induced a larger zzso response in zzso than the complex shapes, reflecting the selectivity of this region for the features in the stimuli such as edges and zzso The brain regions yielding a larger zzso signal to the complex shapes were areas know to be selective to the zzso content of our complex zzso The processing requirement was assessed by comparing the subjects' reaction zzso We found no significant difference in the reaction times to the simple and complex zzso The reaction times to the zzso contrast cue and the chromatic contrast cue were identical but that to the motion contrast cue were 200 zzso zzso This finding concurs with zzso studies, reporting a longer onset zzso for motion contrast zzso It further lends support to the idea that the motion contrast cue requires auxiliary processing by the visual areas of the zzso zzso before entry into the zzso zzso
