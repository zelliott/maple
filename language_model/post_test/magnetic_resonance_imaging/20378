With appropriate selection, zzso lobe zzso is potentially zzso with surgical intervention achieving seizure freedom in zzso of zzso MR zzso identification of zzso remains central to the selection process but currently relies on qualitative visual zzso We sought to determine if new zzso zzso details seen on zzso MR imaging had zzso zzso and whether these could serve as a useful tool in zzso zzso 

Patients undergoing selective anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) were scanned using zzso MR imaging zzso zzso bloc zzso were zzso and subsequently prepared for zzso analysis of all zzso layers in the zzso zzso Using a newly identified landmark from zzso zzso zzso images in 20 patients with zzso confirmed zzso blinded studies compared zzso and zzso sides to generate threshold zzso for application in a fast quantitative analysis zzso 

zzso analysis and correlation with zzso imaging of en bloc zzso identified the zzso signal as the stratum zzso zzso was associated with extensive zzso throughout the zzso regions, with loss of tissue thickness in the stratum zzso most pronounced in zzso Fast quantitative analysis by using the stratum zzso as a landmark provided a test that identifies zzso with a zzso of zzso and SP of zzso 

Here we delineated zzso zzso details seen on zzso MR imaging in both the in zzso and ex zzso setting, zzso these with zzso features consistent with zzso and provided preliminary data suggesting their utility in the development of a quantitative analysis assessment tool for application in zzso zzso
