zzso a recently developed method to analyze zzso with excellent spatial resolution across thousands of points across the lateral and zzso cortical surface, we mapped differences in cortical surface anatomy between subjects with Williams syndrome zzso zzso and an zzso sample of healthy subjects zzso zzso subjects showed increased zzso zzso in zzso regions and over the zzso zzso were more pronounced in the left zzso than in the right, with additional regions of increased zzso in zzso in the left zzso zzso and anterior cingulate, zzso and zzso frontal zzso No cortical area was significantly more convoluted in healthy subjects relative to the zzso zzso On the lateral surfaces, the direction and pattern of zzso zzso were similar in zzso subjects and zzso zzso brain regions had greater zzso in the left hemisphere, while anterior brain regions showed greater zzso in the right zzso On the zzso surfaces, control subjects and zzso individuals differed considerably with respect to the degree but also direction of zzso zzso Our findings confirm and extend previous studies measuring cortical complexity at the global zzso or zzso zzso The observed zzso abnormalities in individuals with zzso might be related to zzso in zzso circuits and consequently contribute to the distinct cognitive and behavioral profile accompanying the zzso
