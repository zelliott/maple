Recent findings on zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso of localized zzso networks is altered in zzso leading to generalized seizure activity via zzso hubs in the zzso zzso Regional zzso zzso analysis of blood oxygen zzso zzso signals has demonstrated localized signal zzso and zzso zzso in a number of zzso We wanted to find out whether the zzso of zzso activity can be used to detect regional signal zzso zzso in children with zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were compared with age and zzso healthy zzso zzso increased zzso was discovered in the zzso zzso zzso and the right zzso zzso lobe of the patients, and they also had significantly decreased zzso in the zzso compared with the healthy zzso However, the zzso in zzso differed between the patients with normal and abnormal zzso zzso the latter showing significantly increased zzso in the right zzso zzso and significantly decreased zzso in the right zzso frontal zzso relative to the controls, while those with normal zzso had significantly increased zzso in the right inferior zzso zzso and the left zzso zzso zzso We conclude that altered zzso signal zzso can be detected in the cerebral and zzso zzso of children with zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso zzso
