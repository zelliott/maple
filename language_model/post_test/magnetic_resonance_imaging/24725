This study was undertaken to assess the reliability of the zzso approach under zzso guidance zzso with the arm zzso before performing direct magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the zzso 

A total of 111 (82 men, 29 zzso mean age, 24 zzso underwent direct MR zzso of the zzso Patients were enrolled because of zzso instability zzso chronic shoulder pain zzso suspicion of rotator cuff tear zzso and adhesive zzso zzso Patients were placed in the lateral position, on the zzso side to that being zzso the arm of the shoulder undergoing the examination was placed in slight internal rotation with the hand under the zzso zzso A zzso solution was injected into the zzso capsule under zzso and zzso zzso A zzso approach was systematically zzso For each patient, the number of injection attempts, room time, complications and pain, as recorded on a zzso visual analogue scale zzso were zzso For quantitative parameters zzso time and pain zzso the mean and standard zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso MR zzso were performed successfully in all zzso no immediate or late major complications were zzso Fourteen patients zzso reported temporary and zzso compromise of arm movements, and 13 patients zzso reported a zzso reaction not requiring zzso In 102 cases zzso the injection was successful at the first attempt, whereas in the remaining nine cases zzso needle repositioning without any additional puncture was required to obtain clear zzso depiction of the position of the needle zzso Mean room time was zzso zzso Mean pain intensity was zzso on the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a reliable and rapid technique that is well tolerated by patients and easy for the zzso to zzso
