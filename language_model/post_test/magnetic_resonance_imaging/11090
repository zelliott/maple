The zzso zzso is a unique route into the zzso To better characterize this system in zzso rat zzso functional connections were mapped using magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso combined with newly developed statistical brain image zzso Six rats underwent imaging on a zzso MR scanner at zzso and 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h and zzso zzso zzso and zzso days zzso of zzso zzso zzso into the right zzso zzso Images were zzso zzso zzso and zzso transformed to the zzso and Watson rat brain atlas, then averaged across subjects using automated image analysis software zzso Images at each time point were compared to zzso using a zzso zzso statistic on a zzso basis in 3-D and converted to Z statistic zzso zzso mapping and group averaging improved signal to noise ratios and signal detection zzso zzso transport of zzso was observed in zzso structures zzso to site of zzso administration including the bulb, lateral zzso tract zzso by 12 h and in the zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso amygdala, and in smaller structures such as the anterior zzso after 24 h zzso MR imaging with zzso statistical analysis clearly demonstrated bilateral zzso zzso transport to secondary and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The method permits in zzso investigations of functional zzso connections within the zzso
