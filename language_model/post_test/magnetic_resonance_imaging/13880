Brain structure changes in size with normal aging, but the rate at which different structures change is zzso We used magnetic resonance imaging zzso performed twice, 4 years apart, to compare rates of age-related size change of the corpus zzso which has been zzso observed to thin with age, with change in the lateral zzso which are well established to zzso zzso were 215 community zzso elderly men zzso years old at initial zzso who were participants in a zzso study of cardiovascular risk zzso zzso change in size was significant for both the zzso and zzso measures, but annual rate of zzso expansion zzso was significantly greater than annual rate of zzso thinning zzso zzso regions showed statistically equivalent rates of zzso zzso zzso was zzso Neither zzso and zzso rates of change correlated with each other zzso zzso zzso nor did zzso and zzso rates of change correlate with each other zzso zzso zzso Tests of zzso processing were administered zzso with both zzso to examine functional ramifications of observed brain zzso zzso in the zzso State zzso was related to thinning of the zzso and decline in zzso test word reading was selectively related to thinning of the zzso zzso These zzso data support the zzso that differential rates of change occur in different brain regions in normal aging, age-related zzso thinning contributes to functional declines, and rate of change in one region can be independent of rate of change in another region, even within a brain zzso
