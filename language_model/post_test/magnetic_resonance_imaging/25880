We have developed a rapidly acquired zzso zzso pulse sequence that uses zzso zzso parameters of zzso 70 zzso TE 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso with large pulse angles, and zzso This sequence yields two images of the abdomen during a comfortable zzso of 9 zzso zzso phantom studies with this sequence demonstrated that peak zzso ratios occurred at pulse angles of 120 degrees and 135 zzso Compared to this rapidly acquired zzso a conventional zzso zzso sequence of zzso 140 zzso TE 10 zzso zzso demonstrated zzso times the zzso ratio, zzso times the zzso zzso ratio but only zzso times the zzso zzso When zzso for the imaging time, however, there was little difference in the zzso and zzso ratios, although the zzso zzso demonstrated zzso times the zzso zzso We conclude that for abdominal imaging the zzso zzso is an excellent alternative to zzso and other fast imaging techniques, and, although there are inherently low zzso ratios, it may be particularly useful when coupled with a zzso contrast zzso
