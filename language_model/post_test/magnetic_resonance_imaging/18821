zzso in current use for expansive zzso operations zzso on the cervical spine damage the zzso mechanisms, resulting in restriction of neck motion, loss of zzso and persistent zzso zzso 

This article introduces a new surgical technique called skip zzso which reduces morbidity after zzso of the cervical spinal zzso 

A prospective study is presented of all patients with zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso treated by this new procedure between December 1998 and March zzso 

Since December 1998, 61 patients with zzso have undergone the zzso of whom 24 (13 men and 11 zzso were selected for this zzso zzso periods ranged from 12 to 25 months, with an average of 18 zzso Average age at operation was 69 years zzso 50 to 82 zzso zzso patients with zzso on whom zzso zzso zzso had been performed by the author before 1998 were selected as controls for study of zzso zzso of the deep zzso cervical zzso There were 11 men and 7 women, average age 67 years zzso 45 to zzso 

zzso symptoms and Japanese zzso Association zzso scores were zzso zzso and zzso ranges of neck motion were measured on lateral zzso and extension zzso zzso and zzso cervical zzso indexes were calculated according to zzso zzso For quantitative analysis of damage to the zzso cervical muscles, zzso rates were calculated from zzso areas of the deep zzso muscles on the zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

In skip zzso standard zzso are performed at selected levels, combined with partial zzso of the zzso halves of zzso at other selected levels, where the muscular attachments to the zzso processes are left zzso Instead of a standard zzso an zzso zzso can be performed at levels where the anterior spinal zzso zzso is zzso It is accomplished by simply removing the zzso half of the inferior zzso and zzso zzso without zzso the zzso zzso and zzso muscles from the adjacent zzso zzso 

Using zzso scores, the average recovery rate was zzso None of the patients complained of persistent zzso zzso The zzso range of zzso motion averaged zzso of the zzso zzso The cervical zzso index was reduced in 1 of the 24 zzso The zzso rate of the deep zzso muscles after skip zzso was zzso of that seen after zzso zzso 

Skip zzso for cervical spinal canal zzso is less invasive than conventional zzso and zzso It is effective in preventing zzso problems, such as persistent zzso symptoms, restriction of neck motion and loss of cervical zzso
