To reach the upper zzso zzso a number of extensive approaches have been zzso The purpose of this study is to provide a clear perspective for the selection of surgical approaches in patients who undergo zzso body zzso zzso and stabilization for upper zzso and zzso junction zzso 

zzso patients with upper zzso or zzso junction zzso instability underwent surgery between January 1999 and May zzso All patients presented with pain and/or neurological zzso The causes of zzso were 10 zzso and 7 pathological zzso The approach chosen was primarily dictated by 3 factors including zzso type of injury, zzso level of zzso and zzso time of zzso zzso surgical approach was performed to all pathological and traumatic fractures causing anterior spinal zzso zzso Level of zzso determined the selection of the type of zzso surgical approach, zzso zzso zzso or lateral zzso On the other hand, combined zzso and zzso approach was performed to all late admitted trauma zzso 

Twelve zzso 2 combined zzso and zzso and 3 zzso approaches were performed in this zzso zzso approaches included 3 zzso 5 upper lateral zzso and 4 zzso cervical dissection procedures for zzso fusion, and zzso fixation depending on the levels of the zzso The mean follow-up period was 18 months, ranging from 10 to 58 zzso zzso or zzso complications were not zzso The zzso neurological conditions were statistically significantly better than the zzso ones zzso zzso zzso 

Consideration of the type of injury, level of zzso and time of admission can provide a perspective for the selection of side of surgical approach for this transitional part of the spinal zzso This study also suggests that zzso cervical approach achieves sufficient exposure up to zzso zzso approach for zzso and lateral zzso approach below zzso
