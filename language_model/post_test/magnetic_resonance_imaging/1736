zzso area measurement in multiple sclerosis zzso is one of the key points in evaluating the natural history and in monitoring the efficacy of zzso This study was performed to check the zzso and zzso agreement zzso of a locally developed Growing Region zzso Software zzso comparing them to those obtained using manual zzso zzso From routine zzso zzso study of clinically zzso multiple sclerosis patients, 36 zzso seen on zzso images zzso and 36 enhancing zzso on zzso zzso images zzso were randomly chosen and were evaluated by three zzso The mean range of zzso size was zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso on zzso The median zzso and zzso agreement were, respectively, zzso and zzso using zzso on zzso zzso and zzso using zzso on zzso zzso and zzso using zzso on zzso and zzso and zzso using zzso on zzso The zzso and zzso agreements were significantly greater for zzso compared with zzso ( zzso and zzso zzso for zzso while no difference was found between zzso an zzso for zzso The zzso zzso for zzso was significantly lower on both zzso ( zzso and zzso ( zzso whereas for zzso the same result was found only for zzso ( zzso These data indicate that zzso reduces both the zzso and the zzso zzso in assessing the area of zzso zzso on zzso and may prove useful in zzso zzso
