This study aimed to investigate whether a commercially available zzso zzso mapping sequence will demonstrate findings of zzso cartilage zzso based on zzso relaxation values zzso and color zzso using zzso bone zzso zzso zzso as a marker for zzso zzso 

The patient group consisted of 88 subjects who underwent knee magnetic resonance imaging at zzso T who had zzso zzso evident on zzso zzso zzso The control group was comprised of 60 subjects with no evidence of zzso zzso A commercially available eight echo zzso relaxation sequence zzso time zzso zzso was used to construct a zzso color map and to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined on cartilage zzso zzso zzso in patients and in eight zzso anatomical regions in zzso zzso color maps in the patient and control groups were analyzed for degree of color zzso zzso zzso two or more zzso at the same zzso site as that used for zzso RV zzso 

zzso zzso were significantly increased in patients compared to controls for the zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso facet zzso p zzso zzso lateral zzso facet zzso p zzso zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and lateral zzso plateau zzso p zzso zzso Loss of color zzso was noted in patients compared to controls in the zzso zzso plateau zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the patient group, increase in zzso zzso was associated with corresponding decrease in color zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groove zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso groove zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was associated with an increase in adjacent zzso cartilage zzso zzso at some zzso Also, elevated zzso zzso were associated with loss of color zzso
