The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of zzso treatment for pigmented zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 

All patients undergoing hip zzso are zzso assessed with a modified Harris zzso zzso preoperatively and zzso at 3, 12, 24, 60, and 120 zzso Thirteen patients were identified with zzso confirmed zzso and minimum zzso zzso These procedures were performed between 2001 and 2008, during which time a total of zzso zzso procedures were zzso There was zzso follow-up at a mean of 63 months zzso 24 to 120 zzso There were 9 female and 4 male patients with a mean age of 27 years zzso 14 to 46 zzso The pattern of involvement was diffuse in 3 patients, zzso in 3, and combined in zzso zzso pathology included 7 zzso cartilage zzso (3 grade III and 4 grade zzso 6 zzso tears, and 4 cases with zzso zzso 

The mean improvement in the Harris zzso zzso was 27 points (62 points preoperatively and 89 points zzso zzso 17 points), with a range of 3 to 56 zzso The mean improvement based on pattern of disease was as zzso zzso 30 points zzso 23 zzso zzso 25 points zzso 18 zzso and combined, 26 points zzso zzso zzso There were no zzso but one patient was converted to a total hip zzso at 6 years zzso 

In this cohort the results of zzso management of zzso have been favorable with minimal zzso zzso may be necessary to substantiate the diagnosis, as well as to assess and address other accompanying zzso The procedure must include both the central and peripheral zzso The secondary damage and prelude to zzso cannot be reversed and, when zzso make the less invasive nature of the zzso approach especially zzso
