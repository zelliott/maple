Late development of specialization in the visual word processing system was examined using zzso zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of word and symbol string processing in groups of adolescents zzso zzso and adults zzso zzso We focused our zzso analyses on fast visual activity: the zzso zzso zzso zzso modulated by physical stimulus characteristics and the zzso zzso zzso zzso reflecting visual tuning for zzso Our zzso analyses concentrated on zzso zzso zzso in the visual word form area zzso For words, the correlation of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso confirmed the close relationship of the zzso zzso with zzso activity in the zzso Further support for this relationship came from low resolution electromagnetic zzso zzso the zzso zzso near the zzso Both imaging techniques revealed zzso differences between words and symbol zzso Late development, however, was zzso detected with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with age were not limited to words and suggested further maturation of the underlying brain zzso and zzso Following adolescence, decreasing zzso zzso specific to words point to continued specialization of the visual word processing zzso Both zzso and zzso measures correlated with reading zzso In zzso the similarity of global zzso zzso patterns between groups suggests a fully established distribution of the reading network in adolescence, while the decreasing zzso zzso for words indicate protracted fine tuning after zzso
