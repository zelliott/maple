zzso in adult animals recruits brain sites extending from zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso suggesting a range of motor and zzso reactions to maintain zzso We hypothesized that comparable neural actions during development rely more extensively on localized zzso zzso We used functional zzso to assess neural responses during sodium zzso challenges in 14 zzso kittens, aged zzso days, and seven adult zzso zzso zzso pressure increased with age in kittens, and zzso heart rates were zzso The magnitude of zzso responses increased with age, while zzso zzso sensitivity initially increased over those of zzso In contrast to a decline in adult zzso functional zzso signal intensity increased significantly in zzso and zzso zzso regions and the zzso zzso in the kittens during the zzso zzso In addition, significant signal intensity differences emerged in zzso zzso and deep zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thalamus, and insular zzso The altered neural responses in zzso zzso zzso sites may have resulted from zzso or zzso influences from zzso and more zzso structures as a result of zzso developed zzso or other neural zzso A comparable zzso of blood pressure control mechanisms in humans would have significant clinical zzso
