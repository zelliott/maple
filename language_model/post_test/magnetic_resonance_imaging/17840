To investigate the implications of duration of deafness in the rehabilitation of unilateral deafness utilizing cochlear zzso From the ongoing prospective cochlear zzso in unilateral deafness study, we looked at five adults who received a cochlear implant for long-term unilateral zzso Speech perception in noise and zzso evaluation of the benefits of cochlear zzso were measured at 3, 6, and 12 months after zzso The results were analyzed and compared with published data from normal hearing individuals and adults using cochlear implants zzso Analysis of speech perception in noise showed significant improvement for three spatial zzso speech and noise from the front zzso zzso speech from the front and noise from the normal hearing ear zzso zzso speech from the implanted ear, and noise from the normal hearing ear zzso zzso The scores obtained at 12 months after surgery improved to values similar to those obtained by individuals with normal zzso The results of zzso measures showed significant improvement in hearing over time to the scores obtained by individuals with a bilateral cochlear implants and those with normal zzso In this study, older adults with more than 25 years of unilateral deafness obtained scores in speech perception testing and in zzso evaluation that are similar to those attained by individuals with normal hearing and/or those with bilateral cochlear zzso zzso patients with zzso unilateral deafness should not be excluded as cochlear implant candidates on the basis of a long duration of zzso
