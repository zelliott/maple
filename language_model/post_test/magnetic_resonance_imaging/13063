The zzso and triangular sections of the inferior frontal zzso also known as zzso area, have been shown to be involved in various language zzso In the current study we investigated both the functional role, as well as the precise zzso involvement of zzso area during picture zzso We applied online zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to zzso area at five different time points after picture zzso aiming to cover the complete language production zzso zzso real zzso at 300 zzso after picture presentation led to an increase in picture naming zzso whereas sham stimulation and real stimulation at earlier and later time windows did not result in any changes in reaction time zzso Our zzso approach enabled us to get insight into the zzso characteristics of the involvement of this brain area during picture zzso Making use of this information and directly relating it to zzso models, we conclude that zzso area may be involved in the process of zzso during overt speech zzso
