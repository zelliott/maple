The decomposition of zzso zzso in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso is an efficient way to produce zzso iron oxide zzso zzso with small zzso We present an extension of this method by introducing zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso as a zzso agent and adding zzso zzso as a stabilizing zzso The synthesis was studied with respect to effects of the chain length of the zzso used as zzso the chain length of the zzso agent, the presence of zzso the heating rate, and the nature of the zzso By varying these zzso we were able to show, that probably an interplay of the zzso agent and the zzso plays an important role for the stabilization and growth of the different zzso of the zzso zzso The chain length of the zzso used as zzso alters the influence of zzso or zzso as stabilizer of zzso zzso leading to zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso and mean diameters ranging from 4 zzso up to 25 zzso zzso in the reaction medium zzso down particle size and shape zzso and promotes the formation of very stable, zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the particles was determined by a zzso quantum interference device zzso and their ability to act as a zzso agent was tested by magnetic resonance imaging zzso
