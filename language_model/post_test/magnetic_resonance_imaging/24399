The objective of our study is to assess the usefulness of breast zzso for the evaluation of zzso invasion of the zzso zzso 

Breast zzso findings of 51 zzso proven breast cancer zzso which were within 2 zzso distance from the zzso complex on zzso were reviewed zzso Breast zzso examinations were zzso reviewed for zzso inversion or zzso zzso skin zzso zzso complex enhancement, relationship to the zzso mass, zzso mass pattern, thickness of zzso complex enhancement, zzso distance, and tumor size and were correlated with the zzso zzso The characteristic findings of zzso disease were zzso zzso was reviewed independently without the knowledge of zzso zzso 

A statistically significant correlation was found between zzso complex enhancement and zzso invasion of the zzso complex, with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso complex enhancement and thickness of the zzso complex enhancement correlated significantly with zzso invasion of the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso disease was confirmed in zzso of the zzso and all cases of zzso disease revealed zzso complex enhancement on zzso No statistically significant correlations were observed between the zzso findings and zzso invasion of the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a useful method for the evaluation of zzso invasion of the zzso zzso zzso complex enhancement with zzso could suggest the possibility of zzso zzso
