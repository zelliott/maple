To assess zzso zzso zzso in patients with different Crohn's disease zzso identified on MR zzso 

Thirty-four patients, zzso into three different Crohn's disease subgroups, underwent MR zzso A high resolution zzso true zzso sequence with fat zzso was applied to assess zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution, size and zzso Their enhancement ratio zzso was calculated by dividing signal intensity of each zzso to signal intensity of nearby vessel on zzso weighted zzso images, acquired 75 s after intravenous administration of zzso A one-way analysis of zzso statistical test was applied to investigate any significant differences regarding mean zzso among different disease zzso 

Two hundred and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 231 in patients with active inflammatory zzso disease, 36 in patients with zzso zzso and 16 in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and minimum diameters were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso presented with an oval zzso The majority were identified as being zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso presented with the highest mean zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The differences in mean values of zzso of zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were statistically significant zzso while mean zzso between zzso of zzso and the other two zzso did not present statistically significant zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso identified on MR zzso may vary across different zzso of Crohn's zzso Such differences may be valuable in clinical zzso
