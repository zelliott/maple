To compare magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso in the local staging of locally advanced zzso zzso 

Sixteen consecutive patients who, after zzso zzso zzso had surgery for zzso zzso clinically judged as extending into zzso zzso in the zzso were examined using MR and CT before and after zzso The examinations were reviewed by four zzso The relation of the zzso to 14 different zzso structures in the pelvis in a total of 50 examinations was zzso The results were compared to surgical and zzso zzso 

Seven patients had zzso zzso of adjacent zzso in the pelvis at surgery, the most common being the urinary zzso zzso zzso and small zzso MR predicted involvement of the urinary zzso and the zzso better than zzso However, there were more false positive findings on MR than on CT compared to surgical and zzso zzso 

For staging of advanced zzso zzso the overall results were not significantly better for MR than zzso If involvement of the urinary zzso and the zzso cannot be ruled out using CT, MR is advocated due to its higher soft tissue contrast resolution and zzso zzso
