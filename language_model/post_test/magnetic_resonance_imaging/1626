The main aim of this study was to investigate the differential processing of correct and incorrect equations to gain further insight into the neural processes involved in zzso zzso zzso studies in humans have demonstrated that processing incorrect zzso equations zzso 2 + 2 zzso 5) elicits a prominent zzso potential zzso compared to processing correct equations zzso 2 + 2 zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the neural zzso of this process using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso were presented with zzso equations and asked to indicate whether the solution displayed was correct or zzso We found greater zzso to zzso compared to correct zzso in the left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso BA zzso and the left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso BA zzso Our results provide the first brain imaging evidence for differential processing of incorrect zzso correct zzso The prefrontal zzso zzso observed in processing incorrect equations zzso with brain areas known to be involved in working memory and interference zzso The zzso region zzso activated by incorrect equations was also involved in overall zzso processing, whereas the zzso was activated only during the differential processing of incorrect zzso zzso response to correct and incorrect zzso equations was not observed in zzso zzso regions such as the angular zzso and zzso zzso which are known to play a specific role in performing zzso zzso The pattern of brain response observed is consistent with the hypothesis that processing incorrect equations involves detection of an incorrect answer and resolution of the interference between the internally zzso and zzso presented incorrect zzso More specifically, greater zzso during processing of incorrect equations appears to reflect additional operations involved in maintaining the results in working memory, while subjects attempt to resolve the conflict and select a zzso These findings allow us to further delineate and zzso the contributions of prefrontal and zzso zzso to zzso zzso
