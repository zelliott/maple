We sought to develop a method to evaluate the rapidly changing cardiac dimensions during sustained zzso zzso zzso We also present details of our zzso research imaging program to facilitate this avenue of clinically important zzso 

The changes in cardiac dimensions occurring during the initial critical electrical phase of sustained zzso are not entirely zzso Conventional cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso functional imaging lacks the zzso resolution necessary to capture the dynamic changes within this early time period of sustained zzso We hypothesized that changes in the middle short axis slice of the zzso will reflect changes in zzso volumes zzso 

zzso dimensions were determined from zzso for 30 zzso of zzso zzso in a closed chest, closed zzso model in seven zzso zzso zzso free zzso images zzso from the cardiac base to the zzso were acquired, taking care to align the anatomical short axis zzso imaging planes zzso The middle slice of the zzso was determined as the mathematical center of the stack of zzso zzso We then compared the relative changes of right zzso zzso and left zzso zzso volumes to relative changes in zzso single slice zzso 

During 30 zzso of sustained zzso there was an excellent correlation between the changes in exact zzso area and the quantitative changes in zzso volumes zzso 

zzso area data can be used as a surrogate marker of prompt zzso volume changes during zzso By imaging the heart 10 times faster, the rapid anatomical changes occurring during the initial few minutes of sustained zzso can be understood zzso
