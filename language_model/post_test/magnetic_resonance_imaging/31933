Several zzso are currently working on the development of a zzso treatment system with online MR imaging zzso zzso The main difference between their designs is the magnetic field strength of the zzso zzso While we have chosen a zzso zzso zzso magnetic field strength, the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton will be using a zzso T zzso scanner and the company zzso aims to use zzso zzso The magnetic field strength will affect the severity of magnetic field dose effects, such as the electron return effect zzso considerable dose increase at tissue air boundaries due to returning zzso This paper has investigated how the zzso dose increase depends on the magnetic field zzso zzso four situations where the zzso occurs have been zzso zzso at the zzso side of the zzso the lateral zzso zzso in zzso air cavities and zzso in the zzso The magnetic field comparison values were zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso show that, in general, magnetic field dose effects are reduced at lower magnetic field zzso At the zzso side, the zzso dose increase is largest for B zzso zzso T and depends on the zzso field size for B zzso zzso zzso The lateral zzso is strongest for B zzso 3 T but shows no effect for B zzso zzso zzso Around zzso air zzso dose zzso disappear if the radius of the cavity becomes small relative to the zzso radius of the secondary electron zzso At larger cavities zzso zzso 1 zzso dose zzso exist for all magnetic field zzso In zzso zzso the zzso dose increase takes place at the zzso transition and the dose decreases at the zzso transition, but these effects are minimal for B zzso zzso zzso These results will contribute to evaluating the zzso between magnetic field dose effects and image quality of zzso zzso zzso
