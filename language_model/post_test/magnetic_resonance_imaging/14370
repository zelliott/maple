In order to study zzso effects in zzso under different conditions we developed two different kinds of zzso The first phantom exhibits linear zzso flow with several zzso within one zzso The second consists of an zzso exchange zzso with beads forcing the spins to change directions such that they undergo zzso and zzso Both zzso were zzso with standard zzso sequences and signal zzso were zzso at various echo zzso zzso and quantitative agreements of the data with the results obtained by zzso of signal loss due to zzso phenomena are excellent, thus suggesting that zzso effects can be fully understood using these zzso It is argued that the zzso used in conjunction with conventional zzso sequences represent a realistic model for studying true zzso networks in conjunction with specialized zzso zzso
