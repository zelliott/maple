Previous zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments have suggested that correlated neural signals may be detected in the brains of individuals who are physically and zzso isolated from each zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods were used in the present study in an attempt to replicate these zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso because of the characteristic surroundings of the scanner zzso During the experiment, the zzso subject was placed in the scanner with sensory zzso goggles covering the zzso zzso The zzso subject was placed 30 feet away and sat in front of a video monitor that presented an alternating schedule of six zzso zzso The zzso on condition consisted of a zzso zzso pattern whereas the zzso condition consisted of a zzso zzso zzso conditions were presented in the sequence zzso The duration of these intervals was randomly assigned but consistently provided a total of 150 seconds of flicker and 150 seconds of zzso Sessions were repeated twice to assess possible replication of the zzso 

Changes in zzso brain zzso zzso to blood zzso and zzso signals were measured in the zzso zzso Changes occurring during zzso conditions were statistically compared to changes occurring during the zzso zzso 

zzso significant changes in zzso brain zzso and zzso signals were observed when comparing the zzso condition to the zzso condition in zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple zzso For zzso these changes were observed in visual brain areas 18 and 19 zzso zzso One of the subjects zzso the zzso 

These data replicate previous findings suggesting that correlated neural signals may be detected by zzso and zzso in the brains of subjects who are physically and zzso isolated from each zzso
