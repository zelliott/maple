This study was an initial phase II trial in humans of molecular magnetic resonance zzso imaging for improved zzso of zzso in vessel territories potentially responsible for stroke using a new zzso contrast agent zzso Eleven patients with zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso left or right atrium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) or carotid artery zzso zzso 1) as verified by an index examination zzso zzso zzso or conventional zzso were zzso All MR imaging was performed on zzso T zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso The same sequence was performed before and 2-6 h after zzso intravenous administration of 4 zzso zzso Two investigators assessed image quality and signal zzso Furthermore, zzso ratios zzso between the zzso and the blood zzso soft tissue before and after administration of the contrast agent were compared using zzso zzso MR imaging and data analysis were successfully completed in 10 zzso No major adverse effects zzso On enhanced images, zzso demonstrated high signal amplification, typically at the zzso surface, with a significantly increased contrast in comparison to the surrounding blood pool and soft tissue zzso for zzso zzso blood pool, zzso and zzso 6 zzso 8 and 29 zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso soft zzso zzso and zzso 0 zzso 4 and 21 zzso 13; P zzso zzso for both zzso zzso allows for molecular MR imaging of zzso potentially responsible for zzso High contrast between zzso and surrounding blood and soft zzso can be achieved with enhanced zzso
