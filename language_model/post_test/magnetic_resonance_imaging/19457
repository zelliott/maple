zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso provides a unique tool to detect and zzso brain zzso In multiple sclerosis it can be used to investigate zzso loss or dysfunction through measurement of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso Previous studies in adults have reported variable effects of aging on zzso zzso but have predominantly focused on changes in the zzso This study has examined a younger adult age group to provide a reference database more zzso to the multiple sclerosis zzso Single zzso zzso MRS was carried out in 44 subjects between 22 and 62 years of zzso Sixteen subjects underwent repeat examination after one zzso Absolute zzso of zzso (the sum of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing compounds zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not correlate with age but there were significant correlations between age and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant differences in zzso zzso were seen over one zzso This study provides evidence that age-related changes of zzso zzso occur even in a young to middle aged adult zzso This emphasizes the need to perform absolute zzso of zzso zzso rather than ratios and the importance of zzso in zzso MRS studies of multiple zzso
