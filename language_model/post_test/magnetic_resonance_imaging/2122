The present study zzso zzso effects on the exploratory zzso of neglect patients during their spontaneous search of the zzso We were asking whether different tasks would be associated with different structuring of the visual display and, therefore, would result in different forms of neglect in one and the same zzso zzso zzso patients' eye and head movements were recorded when they searched for a target within a homogeneous stimulus array surrounding the zzso zzso they explored the same array which was now segmented into different zzso When the patients' attention was allocated to the whole surrounding space, all patients completely neglected the left zzso and spontaneously attended to the right zzso No significant zzso asymmetry was detected in a selected segment located in the periphery of the attended, right zzso However, all patients completely ignored the left part of this segment when they had to concentrate visual search on this segment zzso The results suggest an important influence of zzso effects on the exploratory zzso of neglect zzso They show that one and the same physical stimulus at one and the same location in a scene might be attended or, in another situation, zzso just depending on the zzso goal of the zzso The findings support the idea that the brain zzso and zzso continuously the representation of the same physical input according to the changing task zzso
