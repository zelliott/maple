To define the zzso of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for assessment of regional left zzso zzso strain and timing of contraction in a zzso zzso zzso 

The study population consisted of 16 healthy zzso zzso zzso were performed in three zzso zzso slices zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso views zzso zzso and zzso for assessment of zzso zzso zzso strain and time to peak zzso To assess the zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso was performed by two independent observers who were blinded to each other's results and four studies were repeated on a different zzso 

zzso zzso strain was highest at the zzso as was zzso zzso zzso Peak zzso strain occurred earliest at the base, as did peak zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso between observers and repeated studies ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

The present study demonstrates the ability of zzso zzso to define regional left zzso strain and the time sequence of regional zzso zzso zzso may represent a highly objective method for zzso regional left zzso zzso
