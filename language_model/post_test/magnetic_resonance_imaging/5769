A layered zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from an zzso solution of zzso The X-ray zzso zzso and the selected area electron zzso zzso studies showed that this compound zzso in the zzso structure (a zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso A, and c zzso zzso zzso which is zzso with zzso Interestingly, this layered material was readily dispersed and led to a stable zzso zzso in zzso zzso The obtained zzso solutions were characterized by the evaluation of their stability in zzso solution, their in zzso zzso and their magnetic resonance imaging zzso relaxation zzso It is reported that the zzso analysis of zzso suspensions exhibits a sufficient contrast effect for zzso weighted magnetic resonance zzso
