One of the most important issues in zzso zzso brain functional magnetic resonance imaging is the understanding of the vascular structures that are responsible for the signal changes zzso The zzso signal changes observed during variations in zzso magnetic field zzso are a function both of zzso mechanisms, such as zzso and of zzso effects such as field zzso zzso zzso signal changes are only a function of zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso images could be less sensitive to blood zzso changes in a zzso environment than zzso images and could thus be more accurate in identifying the zzso of the zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso In this study we use zzso and zzso challenges in cats to provide a change in blood zzso concentration (as a model for classic zzso changes and not as a model for zzso zzso A combined zzso echo and spin echo zzso zzso pulse sequence was used to map zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes during the zzso Our experiments demonstrate that: zzso the acquisition of zzso zzso data does not in itself differentiate signal changes in the zzso from those occurring in regions around larger vessels, but that zzso the simultaneous acquisition of zzso and zzso images could be useful in identifying zzso regions in gray matter by analyzing the ratio zzso This value seems independent of the degree of zzso concentration change, but is related to properties of the vascular zzso We suggest a possible application of the results to the study of brain function in zzso
