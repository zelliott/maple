The zzso zzso of alien limb and zzso are a defining feature of the zzso syndrome, but a limited understanding of their zzso zzso has hampered progress towards effective zzso Here we combined several key methods to investigate the mechanism of zzso in voluntary action in zzso zzso We used a quantitative measure of awareness of action that is based on zzso processes of motor zzso structural and functional anatomical zzso and evaluation against the clinical zzso disorders of zzso zzso In patients and healthy adults we measured zzso zzso the perceived zzso attraction between voluntary actions and their sensory zzso Patients showed increased binding of the perceived time of actions towards their zzso This increase correlated with the severity of alien limb and zzso which we suggest share a core deficit in motor control zzso through reduced precision in voluntary action zzso zzso zzso analyses showed the zzso zzso in patients was related to changes in zzso matter volume in zzso motor area, and changes in its underlying white matter tracts to prefrontal zzso Moreover, changes in functional connectivity at rest between the zzso motor area and prefrontal zzso were zzso to changes in zzso These zzso structural and functional results zzso to reveal the frontal network for altered awareness and control of voluntary action in zzso syndrome, and provide candidate markers to evaluate new zzso
