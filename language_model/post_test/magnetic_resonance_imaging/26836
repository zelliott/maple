zzso is a condition characterized by deficits in cognitive processing and the regulation of zzso Several theories have been proposed for the underlying zzso but the zzso of zzso remains zzso 

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated brain zzso measured on the scale of zzso in 38 individuals who were presented with neutral, sad, or angry affective facial zzso 

We found significant inverse correlations between the degree of zzso represented by the Korean version of the Toronto zzso zzso zzso and the intensity of the neural response to angry facial stimuli over neutral facial stimuli in the right zzso This result was mainly due to the zzso in factor 2 zzso describing zzso in zzso zzso 

The results suggest that functional zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso may play important roles in the zzso of zzso
