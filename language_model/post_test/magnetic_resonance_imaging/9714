zzso and behavioral studies in many species have demonstrated zzso confusion for objects, perhaps because many objects are vertically zzso zzso a cup is the same cup when seen in left or right zzso In contrast, the zzso of a scene changes when it is mirror zzso and behavioral studies reveal high sensitivity to this zzso Thus, we predicted that representations in zzso zzso will be unaffected by mirror zzso whereas representations in zzso zzso will be sensitive to such zzso To test this hypothesis, we ran an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation experiment in human zzso zzso with our zzso we found tolerance to mirror zzso in one zzso region, the zzso zzso zzso and a strong sensitivity to these zzso in two zzso regions, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso However, a more zzso zzso region, the lateral zzso zzso showed sensitivity to mirror zzso suggesting that the sense information that zzso mirror images is represented at earlier stages in the zzso zzso Moreover, one zzso region (the zzso place area or zzso was tolerant to mirror zzso This last finding challenges the hypothesis that the zzso is involved in navigation and zzso and suggests instead that scenes, like objects, are processed by distinct pathways guiding recognition and zzso
