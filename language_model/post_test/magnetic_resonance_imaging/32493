To study the adaptation process and extent of zzso cartilage in the canine knee joint to different modes of movements and to investigate if levels of cartilage zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso in serum and zzso fluid can be used to predict effectively early sports injury and zzso degree of zzso cartilage in the canine zzso 

Twenty adult dogs divided randomly into three groups zzso in the common training group, Training zzso eight in the intensified training group, zzso zzso and four in the Control Group) were trained daily at different zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso examinations were performed regularly zzso 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 weeks) to investigate changes of zzso cartilage in the canine knee, while zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in serum and zzso fluid were measured by zzso zzso All of the dogs were zzso after training for 10 weeks, and all of the knee zzso were taken out to be examined zzso 

We could find imaging changes of early sport injury of zzso cartilage in the Training Group and zzso Group by zzso examination after 2 weeks of zzso the damage images were most severe in 4-6 weeks, and then zzso zzso We could not find the difference of cartilage injury and repair degree in zzso images between these two groups at different time zzso zzso of levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in serum and zzso fluid were seen during the training period, and their levels changed remarkably at different zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso Group were lower than that in the Training Group in general, and levels of zzso were higher, which hinted that the injury trend of zzso cartilage in the zzso Group was lower than that in the Training group, and the repair trend was zzso Furthermore, there were statistically significant associations between zzso levels in serum and in zzso zzso zzso examinations in 10 weeks demonstrated that the signs of cartilage damage and repair in canine knee joint in the Training Group and the zzso Group were obvious, and the zzso Group could do better than the Training Group in promoting zzso reconstruction of zzso zzso 

zzso and repetitive movement may easily induce sports injury, and it is followed with a repair process; intensified training can do better than common training in promoting zzso reconstruction of zzso zzso The sensitivity of these zzso reflecting zzso cartilage pathological changes is better than zzso and the associated application of several zzso to predict the extent of damage and repair, as well as changes of metabolism in zzso cartilage, and to monitor change of disease course has very good value for clinical zzso
