zzso zzso zzso invades beyond enhancing zzso and tumor cells are believed to exist in zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso treatment of both enhancing and zzso abnormalities on zzso by zzso zzso zzso would reduce local and regional zzso The purpose of this study was to demonstrate patterns of failure after zzso with simultaneous differential doses to two different target volumes of contrast enhancing zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso were treated with zzso between 2008 and zzso zzso was offered for the patients who had progressive tumors after the initial surgical zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A was 32 zzso (8 zzso zzso 4 zzso to the contrast enhancing zzso zzso zzso B was 32 zzso (8 zzso zzso 4) to the contrast enhancing zzso and 24 zzso (6 zzso zzso 4) to the zzso zzso delivered zzso The study zzso was zzso failure on zzso at 2 months after zzso Median survival after zzso was zzso months, and median zzso survival after zzso was 4 zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso recurred during zzso The local and regional failure rate was significantly lower in zzso B zzso zzso than in zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No sign of tumor progression in 10 % of zzso A versus zzso % of zzso B was shown during followup zzso zzso zzso Instead, distant failure rate was higher in zzso zzso In conclusions, zzso was found to be a safe and effective salvage therapy for zzso zzso zzso to both contrast enhancing and zzso abnormalities appeared to improve local tumor control, and reduce regional tumor zzso
