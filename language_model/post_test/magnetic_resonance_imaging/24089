While the diagnostic benefits of zzso zzso contrast agents are firmly established in magnetic resonance imaging zzso of tumors, the zzso basis of the enhancement observed and its zzso correlate remained zzso zzso zzso is fundamental for growth and zzso and also of interest in new therapeutic zzso By zzso analysis of a) zzso b) vascular density zzso and c) vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso we found a) significantly zzso zzso zzso faster exchange rates in zzso compared with benign breast zzso b) distinct differences in enhancement characteristics between the zzso types zzso zzso zzso invasive zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and c) dependence of enhancement zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso basis for the differences in contrast enhancement patterns of tumors zzso by zzso is mainly due to vascular zzso which leads to more characteristic differences than vascular zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso breast tumors due to their different zzso zzso
