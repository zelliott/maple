The purpose of this study was to assess the utility and efficacy of zzso breast zzso in the evaluation of abnormalities identified on zzso breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

A retrospective review was performed of 152 zzso breast zzso examinations having 196 zzso abnormalities to identify findings that underwent subsequent breast zzso zzso examinations had a suspicious zzso identified on zzso zzso and documentation of the location and size of the finding on zzso and subsequent zzso zzso Fourteen examinations not meeting the criteria were zzso with 182 abnormalities zzso Patient medical records were zzso 

zzso percent zzso of zzso of breast zzso zzso were visible at zzso zzso zzso (54 of zzso were zzso zzso zzso percent zzso of zzso of zzso visible abnormalities underwent breast zzso zzso examinations of sampled zzso visible zzso revealed 39 zzso 9 high-risk zzso 72 benign zzso and 1 zzso not specified at zzso zzso (9 of zzso of zzso were in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso biopsy was performed for zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso revealing 8 zzso 1 high-risk zzso and 41 benign zzso 3 of the benign zzso did not have sufficient zzso specimens but were benign at zzso zzso resonance imaging guidance was used in zzso zzso of 50) of these zzso One zzso cancer was identified in the zzso zzso zzso Of the 182 zzso that underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso had a change in zzso 

zzso zzso has value in the evaluation of abnormalities found on breast zzso We found enhancements in zzso zzso of zzso yielding 39 zzso
