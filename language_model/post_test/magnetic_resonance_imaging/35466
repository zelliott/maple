A cohort of young, healthy New Zealand White rabbits was followed zzso with serial magnetic resonance imaging zzso analysis and terminal analysis of zzso changes and gene zzso 

To examine the changes observed during normal aging in the zzso zzso 

Although there is a correlation between aging and the onset of zzso disc zzso zzso evidence suggests that distinct pathways are involved in these zzso Our group has characterized a zzso rabbit model of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, no similar analysis has been performed zzso for zzso disc aging to allow comparison of these 2 important zzso 

Four zzso mature female zzso rabbits were housed for 122 weeks, and zzso spine zzso were characterized zzso zzso and quantitative gene expression analysis of the nucleus zzso of these aging animals was performed, and compared with adult and young zzso 

Mean zzso index decreased by zzso through 120 zzso The zzso analysis showed changes in cell zzso with abundant zzso cells in the young, zzso cells and zzso cells in the adult, and clusters of zzso zzso in the aging zzso The zzso analysis of the nucleus zzso showed that gene expression of collagen zzso whereas that for zzso increased with zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was significantly lower in the young compared with adult discs and zzso demonstrated lower gene expression in young and aging zzso 

Although dramatic cellular changes were observed, age-related zzso changes occurred in this rabbit model of normal aging at a much slower rate than in a previous injury model of zzso In addition, the gene expression analysis of the nucleus zzso demonstrated remarkable differences between aging and injury induced zzso These results suggest that aging and injury contribute uniquely to the process of zzso
