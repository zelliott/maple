The renewal effect describes the zzso of a previously extinguished response in situations where the context of extinction differs from that of zzso thus illustrating the zzso of extinction zzso A number of studies on contextual fear extinction have implicated zzso and zzso in processing and retrieval of context both during extinction learning and recall of zzso In this functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study we explored the neural zzso of the renewal effect in zzso learning, using a zzso learning task that required participants to learn relations between cues and outcomes presented in particular zzso During extinction in a novel context, compared to extinction in a context identical to the acquisition context, participants who exhibited the renewal effect zzso showed increased zzso in brain regions including bilateral zzso zzso and left zzso zzso This zzso pattern was absent in participants that did not show the renewal effect zzso In direct comparisons between the groups, the zzso group exhibited higher zzso in bilateral zzso while the zzso group showed higher zzso in left zzso zzso zzso and right anterior zzso zzso zzso During extinction recall, stimuli that had been extinguished in a different context were again presented in the context of zzso Here both groups exhibited predominantly prefrontal zzso with the zzso group's focus upon bilateral zzso zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso 10), while the zzso group showed generally more widespread zzso predominantly in large clusters of zzso zzso zzso In a direct comparison, the zzso group showed higher zzso than the zzso group in left zzso zzso 10), while zzso participants exhibited more zzso in zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso in left zzso during extinction recall correlated with the number of renewal effect responses, while the zzso zzso showed a negative correlation with renewal effect zzso These results highlight the differential zzso patterns of processes that will eventually produce or not produce a renewal effect, indicating that during extinction learning zzso encodes the relation between context and zzso while in extinction recall zzso is active to retrieve this zzso
