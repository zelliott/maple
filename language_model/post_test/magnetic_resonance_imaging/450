This study aims to compare the sensitivity of zzso zzso with bone zzso in the detection of bone zzso in patients with zzso zzso A prospective study was carried out in 47 patients with zzso cancer zzso age 62 years, range zzso zzso All patients had assessment of the skeleton with zzso bone zzso (with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso weighted and short zzso inversion recovery zzso The number and sites of zzso zzso were assessed on each imaging investigation zzso Sites of zzso zzso on zzso were also zzso The imaging findings were correlated with other imaging zzso and zzso 15 patients zzso had bone zzso at 34 different zzso Both zzso and zzso were highly specific zzso and zzso respectively), but the sensitivity of zzso zzso was superior zzso zzso zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso identified more zzso in the spine and zzso zzso whereas zzso showed more zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso identified zzso zzso in 33 patients zzso these were mainly lung and zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a more sensitive method for detection of bone zzso in zzso cancer than bone zzso and also allows the assessment of zzso zzso
