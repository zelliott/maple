zzso listening to a repeated word without a pause produces a series of zzso transitions of the physically unchanging word, which is called verbal zzso zzso transformations provide a rare opportunity to examine how auditory zzso are formed in the zzso We found that verbal forms are affected by phonetic reorganization of a word, rather than by auditory adaptation and zzso distortion of zzso We identified brain activity leading to individual differences between zzso transitions and tone zzso An zzso zzso analysis revealed that the left inferior frontal zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and the left prefrontal zzso were activated when zzso transitions from one verbal form to another occurred, but not when tone zzso were zzso The number of zzso transitions showed positive and negative correlations with signal intensity in the left IFC and the left zzso zzso The results suggest that active generation of verbal forms is linked with zzso gestures for speech production and that the frequency of zzso transitions is determined by a balance of the zzso between the two brain zzso zzso equation modeling demonstrated that individual differences in the number of zzso transitions rely on negative feedback from the zzso to the IFC via the zzso zzso These findings suggest that distributed frontal areas are involved in auditory awareness underlying verbal zzso
