The control of spatial zzso attention between visual field locations or sustaining attention to one zzso the prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso Within the zzso cortex, shifting attention has been linked to the superior zzso zzso however, the neural zzso associated with sustained attention are still zzso In the present zzso study, we aimed to identify generalized control regions associated with sustained attention using two different zzso The motion protocol zzso between periods of moving or stationary dots, and the flicker protocol zzso between periods of zzso or stationary zzso (each period lasted 14 zzso During moving and zzso zzso the behavioral task zzso between sustained attention and zzso A zzso analysis confirmed that the motion but not flicker protocol produced attention zzso activity associated with sustained attention than zzso motion processing region zzso A whole brain conjunction analysis identified regions commonly associated with sustained attention for both zzso which included the right zzso zzso zzso zzso the right middle frontal zzso zzso zzso the right superior zzso zzso zzso zzso the right zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso zzso with previous results, the present findings suggest a zzso organization of zzso zzso where shifts in attention are zzso by superior regions and sustained attention is zzso by more lateral zzso
