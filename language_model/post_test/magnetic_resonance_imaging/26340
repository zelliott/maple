The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of whole body MR imaging zzso in the detection of bone zzso from breast cancer and to compare the results with those from bone zzso In 21 patients with suspected bone zzso from breast cancer, both bone zzso and zzso were zzso With zzso zzso images were obtained using a body zzso in an zzso of 48 zzso and sequences of fast short zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso zzso were used in three zzso from the head to the zzso the abdomen to the zzso and the lower zzso Of the total 105 zzso bone zzso 65 zzso were detected by bone zzso 98 zzso by fast zzso and 74 zzso by fast zzso Thus, the detection of bone zzso by zzso was zzso However, zzso in the ribs was lower for zzso than for bone zzso zzso zzso was useful in the differentiation of zzso zzso in which high signal intensity is rare, zzso zzso which has high signal intensity on zzso and bone zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso showed high reliability in the detection of bone zzso zzso from breast zzso
