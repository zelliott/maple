Conventional methods to zzso zzso size after zzso zzso in mice are not ideal, requiring either tissue destruction for zzso or relying on zzso zzso such as wall zzso We therefore implemented a fast, high-resolution method to directly measure zzso size in zzso using three-dimensional zzso late zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation was zzso at zzso zzso in five mice, and zzso was tested by repeat imaging after 5 zzso In a separate set of healthy and zzso mice zzso zzso 8 of each), continuous zzso zzso were made following intravenous or zzso injection of a contrast agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The time course of zzso contrast development between viable and zzso zzso was thereby determined, with optimal zzso imaging windows and inversion times zzso zzso sizes were zzso using zzso and compared with zzso zzso zzso on day 1 after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso the mean value was zzso zzso 41 zzso zzso contrast peaked earlier after intravenous injection than with zzso zzso however, contrast between viable and zzso zzso was comparable for both routes zzso zzso zzso with adequate contrast remaining for at least 60 zzso zzso Excellent correlation was obtained between zzso sizes derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicated good agreement free from systematic zzso We have validated an improved zzso zzso method to zzso zzso zzso size in mice with zzso spatial resolution and tissue zzso This method is particularly suited to studies requiring early zzso of initial zzso size, for example, to measure damage before intervention with stem zzso
