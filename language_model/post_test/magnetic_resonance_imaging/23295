The aim was to investigate the feasibility of making relative cerebral blood flow zzso maps from MR images acquired with short zzso by measuring the initial arrival amount of zzso evaluated within a time window before any contrast agent has a chance to leave the zzso We named this zzso measurement technique utilizing the early data points of the zzso zzso the zzso time zzso method zzso based on the hypothesis that early time point signals were zzso to zzso zzso data were used successfully to examine the ideal behavior of zzso while monkey's zzso results offered encouraging support to the utility of zzso for zzso zzso A better brain coverage for zzso could be obtained by applying the zzso Echo zzso zzso zzso zzso A recipe to run zzso was zzso with attention paid to the noise problem around the time of arrival zzso of the contrast zzso
