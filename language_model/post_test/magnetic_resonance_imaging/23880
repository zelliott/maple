To study the functional accuracy of zzso targeting for the zzso zzso zzso comparing targets chosen on magnetic resonance images zzso and fused zzso to zzso zzso zzso images, with zzso refined anatomical zzso zzso AND zzso For each of the 10 zzso three sets of targets were collected, beginning with the zzso zzso The second target set was measured on images generated by zzso zzso fusion of zzso images with CT using Image Fusion zzso zzso The anatomical target site was then determined zzso with zzso zzso recording and zzso stimulation zzso 

zzso resonance imaging or zzso fused images alone would not have been sufficiently accurate to zzso visual or motor complications in the zzso zzso based on our target located within 1 zzso of the zzso tract and within 2 zzso of the internal zzso In 2 of the 10 cases of either zzso or fused images, the targets were dangerously close to the zzso zzso Two of 10 of the fused targets were within the internal zzso The fusion of zzso with CT did not functionally improve the targeting accuracy of zzso since the means of the zzso targets and the fused targets were statistically the zzso zzso however, the zzso target was different from the fused target in each case by an average zzso distance of zzso zzso zzso zzso but such corrections were not statistically or surgically zzso 

zzso targeting including zzso or fused zzso data may not be sufficiently accurate to prevent zzso or visual deficits in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, the functional accuracy of zzso was not improved by fusion with zzso
