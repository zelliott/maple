zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso are often implicated in zzso studies of memory zzso with this activity ascribed to controlled monitoring processes indicative of difficult or demanding zzso zzso however, is multiply determined, with success rates governed both by the available evidence and by the nature of decision rules applied to that zzso Using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated these factors by 1) contrasting different decision rules across matched evidence and 2) manipulating the level of evidence within a fixed decision zzso For zzso constructed retrieval zzso (1 old and 1 new zzso zzso zzso these zzso compared with zzso (which one is zzso decision rules yielded bilateral zzso and right zzso zzso zzso However, these regions were unaffected when the available evidence was greatly lowered within zzso zzso Thus, the regions were simultaneously sensitive to the type of decision rule and yet insensitive to the level of evidence supporting those zzso zzso zzso tasks yielded similar patterns, demonstrating that the zzso responses were not episodic memory zzso We discuss the zzso differences between zzso versus zzso decisions and the implications of these data for current theories of zzso activity during episodic remembering and executive zzso
