zzso parallel imaging strategies such as zzso zzso and zzso rely on the sensitivity distribution of phased array zzso coils to reduce zzso imaging zzso Using an zzso phased zzso these techniques allow maximum zzso zzso such that L zzso or zzso zzso with acceleration defined as the factor by which scan time is reduced in comparison to zzso fully zzso zzso zzso As N increases in modern zzso facilities or using special hardware zzso its role as the primary limitation in partially parallel imaging will be reduced and other limiting factors will become zzso Two such factors include available zzso and the variation of sensitivity zzso with imaging zzso zzso have been conducted to evaluate the impact of slice depth and noise on partially parallel reconstructions for the case of a square linear array of overlapped elements that are parallel to the imaging zzso zzso indicate that even when sensitivity zzso are exactly known, the linear surface array can only provide high zzso over a limited imaging depth due to changing suitability of the sensitivity zzso for partially parallel zzso This work emphasizes the importance of simulations for zzso partially parallel array zzso
