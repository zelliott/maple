This study examines the effect of the zzso slope on the anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso on the lateral and zzso zzso zzso The study consisted of 33 matched pairs of patients divided into two groups: an examined group with a diagnosed zzso zzso and a control group with diagnosed zzso zzso The patients were matched on the basis of four zzso age, sex, type of zzso zzso it was zzso and whether the zzso was zzso or zzso zzso were carried out by zzso and zzso In the examined group, the lateral zzso plateau was significantly greater than in the control group zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso plateau had lower zzso slope values than the control zzso however, the difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso In both groups, the difference between the slopes on the lateral and zzso zzso was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso In relation to zzso intact patients, population with zzso zzso have greater zzso slope of the lateral zzso The greater zzso slope of the lateral zzso plateau may be the factor that leads to the injury of the anterior cruciate zzso Compared to the zzso zzso the population with zzso zzso have a greater zzso slope on the lateral zzso while the population of the intact zzso have greater zzso slope on the zzso zzso The zzso slope of the zzso and lateral zzso should be compared separately because the values obtained from the two sets of data were different, revealing apparently opposing effects on the zzso zzso
