The conditions under which we identify entities as animate agents and the neural mechanisms supporting this ability are central questions in social zzso Prior studies have focused upon 2 zzso cues for signaling zzso 1) surface features representing body forms such as faces, zzso and limbs and 2) motion cues associated with biological zzso Here, we consider a third zzso zzso of an zzso zzso in the social brain network, such as the right zzso superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso face area zzso are activated by zzso motion and body form zzso cues signaling zzso Here, we investigate whether these same brain regions are activated by zzso motion even when performed by entities that lack zzso zzso zzso We observed an interaction effect zzso the presence of either zzso zzso cues or zzso actions was sufficient to activate the right zzso and zzso Only stimuli that lacked zzso zzso cues and zzso actions failed to activate the zzso and zzso at the same zzso
