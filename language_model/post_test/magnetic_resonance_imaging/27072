zzso attention to a body location results in enhanced processing of tactile stimuli presented at that location compared to another unattended zzso In this paper, we review studies investigating the neural zzso of sustained spatial attention in zzso These studies consistently show that activity within zzso zzso areas zzso and zzso is modulated by sustained zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that these zzso areas may be recruited as part of a larger cortical zzso including zzso zzso regions involved in spatial selection across zzso We discuss, in turn, the following zzso effects in sustained zzso attention zzso First, zzso zzso links between touch and vision, reflected in enhanced processing of zzso visual stimuli at zzso attended locations, are zzso by common zzso representations of external zzso Second, vision of the body zzso activity underlying sustained zzso attention, zzso zzso zzso of tactile processing in zzso (when hands are sufficiently far apart) and zzso zzso zzso in zzso selection zzso Finally, body posture influences mechanisms of sustained zzso attention, zzso at least partly, on zzso of tactile stimuli in zzso visually zzso spatial zzso Taken together, the findings reviewed in this paper indicate that sustained spatial attention in touch is zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso The interplay between these mechanisms allows flexible and efficient spatial selection within and across sensory zzso
