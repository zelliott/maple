We sought to determine the value of zzso right zzso zzso zzso in pulmonary hypertension zzso patients with right zzso zzso dysfunction defined by cardiac magnetic resonance zzso 

A total of 31 consecutive patients with zzso with a mean pulmonary zzso pressure of zzso zzso underwent both zzso and zzso zzso Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of zzso defined as a RV ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso modeling was performed to define the association between zzso and zzso 

About half of the patients had zzso zzso ; zzso The R to S wave ratio zzso or zzso of zzso pattern zzso in lead zzso was significantly greater in patients with zzso complicated by zzso than in those without zzso These 2 patterns were significant zzso of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and when each of these zzso findings was assigned with a point zzso to OR zzso of 2 for zzso in lead zzso and score of 1 for zzso in lead zzso the zzso of zzso increased by the total zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso findings, especially in lead zzso predicts the presence of zzso defined by zzso zzso might be a useful tool for zzso the presence of zzso in patients with zzso
