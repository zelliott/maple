The present contribution discusses the clinical use of functional zzso zzso and its role in the most common neurological zzso zzso was found a reliable and zzso examination tool resulting in a wide distribution of zzso methods in zzso evaluation of zzso in determining the relationship of eloquent areas and the zzso zzso zzso data suggest that zzso using memory zzso can predict the zzso memory decline in zzso surgery by determining whether a reorganization of memory functions took zzso zzso zzso became the most used tool in determining zzso zzso Visual and zzso zzso can also be routinely investigated by zzso which helps in decision on zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso is a new diagnostic tool in zzso and sleep zzso zzso can identify the zzso after stroke and can provide an additional information on zzso state of the threatened brain zzso zzso has a zzso role in zzso zzso In zzso zzso an zzso reorganization can be demonstrated by zzso affecting the zzso zzso and memory systems, despite preserved functional zzso Much more extensive reorganization can be demonstrated in secondary progressive zzso These findings suggest that the different stages of zzso are related to different stages of the reorganization and zzso becomes progressive when there is no more reserve capacity in the brain for zzso zzso offers the capability of detecting early functional zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease before zzso zzso zzso can be a valuable tool to test and monitor treatment efficacy in zzso zzso can also provide information about the mechanisms of different therapeutic approaches in Parkinson disorder including drug treatment and deep brain zzso
