The use of zzso MR systems is increasing zzso We evaluated magnetic field interactions and zzso attraction for 32 aneurysm clips in association with exposure to zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging zzso 

zzso different aneurysm clips were evaluated in this zzso Each aneurysm clip was zzso evaluated for magnetic field interactions and zzso assessed for zzso attraction by using the zzso angle zzso The zzso angle tests were performed at the points of the highest spatial zzso for zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging zzso 

zzso of the 32 aneurysm clips showed positive magnetic field zzso zzso angles for the aneurysm clips were significantly zzso zzso higher on the zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with those recorded on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging zzso zzso clips made from commercially pure titanium and titanium zzso displayed no zzso attraction zzso zzso zzso whereas those made from stainless steel zzso zzso and zzso displayed positive zzso angles zzso zzso zzso 

The 32 different aneurysm clips passed zzso zzso zzso the zzso angle test by using the long- and zzso zzso MR imaging systems, indicating that they are safe for patients and other persons in these MR environments zzso immediate area of MR imaging zzso However, only clips made from the titanium and titanium zzso are entirely safe for patients undergoing MR imaging procedures because of the total lack of magnetic field zzso The remaining clips require characterization of magnetic zzso zzso Because of possible differences in the points of the highest spatial zzso for different zzso MR imaging systems, the results are specific to the imaging units and bore designs used in this zzso
