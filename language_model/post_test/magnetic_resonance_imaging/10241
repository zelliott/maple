The aim of this study was to evaluate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging in assessment of zzso zzso by using a pulsating silicon aneurysm zzso For each imaging system, we studied zzso and zzso zzso and the agreement between interpretations and reference zzso We also examined how each imaging technique affected the operator's therapeutic zzso 

Two silicon aneurysm models depicting zzso zzso were used, one with a wide neck and one with a narrow zzso Each aneurysm model was placed in series on a zzso flow circuit and was filled with zzso detachable coils to simulate a clinical zzso Each aneurysm was then gradually filled with silicon gel in increments of zzso up to zzso to simulate different levels of zzso zzso neck or dog ear, zzso zzso at each filling zzso For each level of zzso we performed conventional zzso and zzso MR zzso We submitted the images for examination by 2 senior medical staff with 2 readings per zzso A combined reading of the 2 images was submitted to each expert to determine whether the 2 examinations were zzso 

The zzso analysis showed good zzso zzso zzso zzso and k zzso zzso and agreement zzso zzso zzso in describing zzso zzso The distinction between a zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, was not zzso The zzso provided a good description of the zzso and silicon zzso into the parent zzso The zzso analysis of the residual aneurysm, however, was not zzso though it was more effective than the zzso in evaluation of partially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging vs k zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso At the same filling level, the zzso analysis indicated repeat treatment more often than zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso remains the gold standard, but MR imaging is more effective in evaluating a zzso zzso The zzso analysis indicated repeat treatment more often than the zzso for the same zzso zzso The distinction between zzso zzso and a zzso zzso was not reliable with either method of zzso
