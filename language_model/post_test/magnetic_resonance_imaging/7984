Abstract Although several functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have been conducted in human models of mild traumatic brain injury zzso to date no studies have explicitly examined how injury may zzso affect both the positive phase of the zzso response function zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso Animal models suggest that the acute and zzso stages of zzso are associated with significant disruptions in metabolism and to the zzso both of which could impact on the zzso zzso zzso data were collected on a cohort of 30 zzso patients with zzso (16 zzso zzso years old; zzso years of education) and 30 carefully matched healthy controls zzso 16 zzso zzso years old; zzso years of education) during a simple zzso zzso Patients reported increased zzso zzso and emotional symptoms relative to controls, although no group differences were detected on traditional zzso zzso There were also no differences between patients with zzso and controls on zzso data using standard zzso techniques, although zzso exhibited a greater volume of zzso during the task zzso A significant zzso interaction was observed in the right zzso zzso bilateral primary and secondary visual cortex, and the right zzso zzso The interaction was the result of an earlier zzso and positive magnitude shift throughout the estimated zzso in patients with zzso relative to zzso This difference in zzso shape combined with the greater volume of activated tissue may be indicative of a potential zzso mechanism to zzso The current study demonstrates that direct examination and modeling of zzso characteristics beyond magnitude may provide additional information about underlying zzso that is not available with more standard zzso zzso
