The simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram zzso and functional magnetic resonance image zzso is a promising tool that is capable of providing high zzso brain zzso with each zzso zzso complementary zzso One of the major barriers to obtain high-quality simultaneous zzso data is that zzso activity due to the heartbeat zzso significant artifacts in the zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a novel zzso for removing heartbeat artifact, thus overcoming problems associated with previous zzso Our method consists of a mean artifact wave form zzso the selective removal of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso filtering operates without dedicated sensor for the reference zzso and only when the mean zzso and zzso noise removal is not zzso The performance of our system has been assessed using simulated data based on experimental data of various spectral zzso and actual experimental data of zzso normal zzso and zzso zzso
