zzso zzso are frequently detected in symptomatic and zzso older persons undergoing cerebral zzso but their significance in older adults has not been zzso We determined the prevalence of zzso zzso in a zzso sample of men and women aged zzso or zzso 65 years and related these findings to zzso zzso and neurological zzso 

zzso scanning was performed in zzso zzso Health Study zzso participants after brief neurological examinations and tests of cognitive zzso zzso were read centrally for the presence of an zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso in diameter or smaller zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were detected in zzso of 3647 participants with zzso zzso information zzso and in 961 of the zzso of zzso participants zzso without known prior stroke zzso zzso zzso Smaller zzso zzso were found in 196 of zzso participants who had no zzso zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso were more common in participants who were older, had prior stroke, impaired zzso visual field deficits, slowed repetitive finger tapping (all P zzso zzso weakness on toe and heel walking, and history of memory loss, coma, or migraine zzso zzso analysis in those without prior stroke showed strong associations of silent zzso zzso with older age, history of zzso lower zzso symbol scores, and more abnormalities on neurological zzso 

zzso evidence of brain zzso is common in older men and women without a clinical history of zzso Their strong associations with impaired zzso and neurological deficits suggest that they are neither silent nor zzso
