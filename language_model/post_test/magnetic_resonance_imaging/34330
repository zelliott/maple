New three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso methods for measuring the zzso moment arm were created and were evaluated on the zzso moment arm of the zzso zzso zzso at the third zzso zzso Using an open magnet zzso system and a hand holder, a series of zzso images were acquired at four joint angles and analyzed using specially created computer zzso Three methods were zzso zzso a zzso zzso excursion method that extended the method of zzso zzso a zzso geometric method zzso the moment arm was the perpendicular distance between the joint axis of rotation and the zzso path, and zzso a two-dimensional zzso geometric method zzso single image slices were zzso Repeating the imaging and measurement zzso the zzso zzso excursion method was more zzso zzso zzso than the zzso geometric method zzso and both were much more zzso than the zzso geometric method zzso By having three operators analyze a single set of image data, we found that the precision of the zzso zzso excursion method was much less affected by zzso error than the zzso geometric zzso With the zzso imaging methods, zzso zzso and a displacement of the joint center of rotation toward the zzso side of the hand were zzso leading to as much as a zzso increase in moment arm with joint zzso Because of the dependence on zzso and variation between subjects, we recommend zzso zzso for target applications in functional zzso stimulation interventions and zzso transfer zzso
