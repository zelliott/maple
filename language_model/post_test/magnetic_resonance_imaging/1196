To outline the best available method of measurement for detecting progression of zzso zzso of the hip especially in therapeutic zzso 

A zzso search of articles related to progression of hip zzso was zzso A group of experts met over a zzso session to review available literature and new zzso zzso questions were addressed in order to reach a consensus on measuring progression of zzso of the zzso 

Of the available surrogate measures, a single yearly standing or zzso zzso plain zzso of the pelvis with feet internally rotated zzso degrees, can be evaluated with the use of an zzso for joint space zzso zzso zzso zzso There should be a minimum zzso upon baseline screening that may be 1 or 2 zzso zzso of films offers a slight reduction in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso can be calculated by measurement of the zzso on paired and blinded zzso A reduction of zzso or zzso zzso zzso is greater than the zzso zzso zzso as well as the variation of most imaging techniques, and represents a clinically relevant and significant reduction in the zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso may tend to progress more rapidly than other zzso In clinical trials, patients who zzso the study treatment need to be followed after zzso and an zzso strategy which provides unbiased estimates of both the treatment effect and its zzso is an appropriate technique for zzso zzso 

For the development of new agents intended to zzso zzso stabilize or reverse the progress of zzso of the hip, the zzso methodology presently available is adequate to detect changes in hip zzso of zzso
