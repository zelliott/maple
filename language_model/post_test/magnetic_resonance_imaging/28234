The purpose of this study was to zzso compare the effectiveness of administering zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso in either the first zzso zzso or last zzso zzso zzso period along with a zzso course of the zzso analog zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso on zzso and zzso volumes and hormone zzso zzso and zzso and serum zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso and high and low density zzso zzso Sixteen women were zzso into protocol A or B, received either zzso or zzso along with zzso respectively, and were then crossed over at 12 weeks to zzso or zzso respectively, for the final zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes were determined by magnetic resonance imaging, and serum studies were performed at the beginning of the study and at 12 and 24 zzso In both zzso zzso and zzso levels declined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso respectively, at 12 weeks and remained at this level at 24 zzso There were no significant changes in the other laboratory tests between protocols or zzso over zzso Total zzso volume decreased to zzso of the baseline at 12 weeks in protocol B zzso zzso zzso but did not change in protocol zzso After crossover at 12 weeks, the total zzso volume of women in protocol A decreased to zzso of the baseline zzso zzso zzso at 24 zzso zzso comparisons demonstrated a greater decline in total zzso volume in protocol B than A at 12 weeks, but after zzso zzso addition was associated with a significant increase in total zzso volume zzso zzso compared to a decrease in protocol A at 24 weeks zzso zzso zzso In contrast, although zzso volume declined in both zzso no significant changes in zzso volume were detected within or between groups over the treatment zzso zzso volume changes in protocols A and B roughly paralleled total zzso volume changes, with zzso zzso showing a correlation with a reversal in the zzso decrease in zzso tissue zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
