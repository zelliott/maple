zzso zzso are a rare cause of zzso zzso and back zzso zzso treatment is directed at complete zzso of the zzso We used minimally invasive surgical techniques for a series of patients, to assess the effectiveness of this approach for zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso patients (10 female and 7 male zzso with presumed zzso zzso as indicated on magnetic resonance imaging scans, underwent surgical zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso Memphis, zzso A unilateral approach was used, with either an operating microscope (13 zzso or a magnifying zzso (4 zzso depending on the preference of the zzso Outcomes were reported by using modified zzso zzso 

The average patient age was 64 years zzso zzso zzso The zzso level was most commonly affected zzso of zzso Grade 1 zzso at the level harboring the zzso zzso was observed for zzso of the zzso all cases of zzso involved the zzso zzso The mean operative time was 97 minutes, and the average blood loss was 35 zzso Excellent or good results were achieved for zzso of the zzso A zzso tear that did not violate the zzso membrane occurred during surgery for one patient but did not require further zzso 

zzso zzso can be effectively treated with a zzso zzso system in conjunction with an zzso or zzso Use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incision zzso blood loss, and disruption of zzso and zzso zzso This may be particularly significant when zzso zzso are associated with zzso minimizing the risk of progressive instability and the need for zzso
