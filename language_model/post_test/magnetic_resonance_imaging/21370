zzso with regard to participation in zzso studies can have a large impact on the zzso of zzso Our aim was to investigate the direction and magnitude of potential bias by comparing zzso factors among participants and zzso in a zzso based on zzso a large Norwegian health zzso 

Of zzso individuals aged zzso who had participated in all three large public health surveys within the Norwegian county of zzso zzso 1, 2 and zzso zzso who lived within 45 minutes of travel from the city of zzso were invited to a zzso study zzso The sample of participants in zzso zzso were compared with those who were invited but did not participate zzso and with those who were eligible but not invited zzso using zzso analyses and zzso zzso analyses adjusting for age and education zzso 

zzso health did not differ between the three groups, but participants had a higher education level and were somewhat younger than the two other zzso In the adjusted zzso zzso obesity was consistently less prevalent among zzso zzso differences in blood pressure and cholesterol were also zzso 

This is the first large zzso study comparing participants and zzso in an zzso study with regard to general zzso The groups were not widely different, but participants had a higher level of education, and were less likely to be obese and have hypertension, and were slightly younger than zzso The observed differences between participants and zzso individuals are probably partly explained by the inclusion criterion that participants had to live within 45 minutes of transport to where the zzso examination took zzso One will expect that the participants have somewhat less brain zzso changes related to cardiovascular risk factors than the general zzso Such consequences underline the crucial importance of evaluation of zzso in zzso zzso
