To explore the zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in an animal model of acute zzso zzso zzso zzso with and without zzso 

In this study, 8 adult zzso rats underwent superior zzso artery zzso zzso and were then randomly divided in two groups of zzso In group I, the zzso was maintained for 8 zzso In group II, zzso after zzso zzso the zzso was removed by cutting the thread fixed on the back of the animal, and zzso was monitored for 8 zzso zzso was performed using a zzso zzso 

We found that, in the case of zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso free abdominal fluid and zzso wall thinning are present from the second hour, and zzso wall zzso in zzso sequences are present from the fourth zzso The zzso model shows the presence of early zzso wall zzso in zzso sequences after 1 h and zzso wall zzso from the second zzso 

Our study has shown that zzso can assess pathological changes that occur in the small zzso and distinguish between the presence and absence of zzso after induced acute zzso zzso
