zzso transfer imaging zzso is a magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique that is now used in multiple sclerosis zzso studies, and is thought to have a higher pathological specificity than conventional zzso zzso This review outlines the correlations between zzso transfer zzso metrics and other zzso abnormalities in the study of individual zzso zzso and in the assessment of zzso disease zzso zzso studies of individual zzso zzso confirm the pathological zzso of zzso zzso abnormalities and the potential role of zzso zzso zzso as specific markers of localized severe white matter zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies using zzso and zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso findings may vary in zzso with different patterns of enhancement, and that zzso abnormalities are closely related to the onset and recovery of zzso barrier disruption in new zzso zzso zzso zzso load zzso is highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso but it has a limited reliability as a measure of zzso disease zzso On the contrary, measures obtained from zzso scans using zzso zzso analysis are highly correlated with the extent of zzso abnormalities on conventional zzso scans, and predict patients' clinical disability well, since they are sensitive to the amounts of both zzso and microscopic zzso disease burden in the whole brain and in specific zzso The correlations between zzso metrics and conventional zzso findings suggest that: zzso zzso is sensitive to different stages of zzso pathology and pathological evolution in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis can provide a more global assessment of zzso disease burden, since it encompasses both zzso and microscopic zzso zzso
