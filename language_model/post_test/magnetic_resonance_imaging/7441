The magnetic zzso of tissue within and around an image zzso affects the magnetic field and thus the local frequency in that zzso Recently, it has been shown that spatial maps of frequency can be used to zzso local zzso if the contributions of surrounding tissue can be zzso Currently, such quantitative zzso mapping zzso methods employ zzso recalled echo zzso imaging to measure spatial differences in the signal phase evolution as a function of echo time, from which zzso can be zzso Analysis of these phase images, however, is complicated by phase wraps, despite the availability and usage of various phase zzso zzso In addition, lengthy high-resolution zzso scanning often zzso the magnet zzso causing the magnetic field to drift over several Hertz, which is on the order of the frequency differences between zzso Here, we explore the feasibility of applying the zzso zzso Shift zzso zzso method for zzso whole brain zzso zzso zzso uses direct zzso of water zzso as a function of frequency zzso offset to generate frequency maps without phase wraps, which can be combined with any image or zzso zzso By utilizing a series of fast zzso direct zzso images with multiple zzso zzso a frequency correction for field drift can be applied based on the individual image zzso zzso of interest were delineated with an automated zzso method, and the average magnetic zzso calculated from frequency maps obtained from zzso correlated well with those from the zzso zzso zzso approach at zzso
