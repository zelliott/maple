It has been suggested that the mirror zzso system provides an important neural zzso for zzso ability to zzso zzso zzso have been found during zzso recordings in monkeys in area F5 and zzso It is believed that the human equivalent of this mirror system in humans is the zzso zzso of the inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso and the zzso part of the inferior zzso zzso This article critically reviews published zzso studies that examined the role of frontal and zzso brain regions in zzso A zzso using zzso likelihood zzso zzso revealed that the superior zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso but not the inferior frontal zzso are all commonly involved in zzso An additional zzso using a zzso review confirmed that in the frontal zzso the zzso zzso rather than the inferior frontal zzso is consistently active in studies investigating zzso In the zzso region the superior and inferior zzso zzso are equally activated during zzso Our results suggest that zzso and frontal regions which extend beyond the classical mirror zzso network are crucial for zzso
