In some zzso mass zzso zzso may be the only way to establish an accurate zzso Core needle biopsy zzso is widely performed in zzso and unlike fine needle aspiration biopsy zzso it can provide sufficient tissue sample for zzso and zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and possible complications of zzso of zzso zzso 

Fifty zzso zzso from 46 patients zzso zzso zzso were zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso 11 procedures were performed under ultrasound zzso All 50 samples received routine zzso examination and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso sufficient for zzso analysis were obtained in all zzso The zzso diagnosis was established in zzso of zzso 30 tumors were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso three were zzso ten zzso and four were zzso zzso Three zzso were zzso two zzso zzso showed zzso identification and one was a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso as zzso zzso The diagnoses were confirmed by zzso or zzso biopsy in 26 zzso The zzso rate in patients with a surgically confirmed diagnosis was zzso The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for zzso zzso from benign zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two patients suffered zzso mild zzso zzso with no decreased visual zzso There was no damage to the globe or zzso zzso zzso disorder, or zzso 

zzso of zzso mass zzso is a safe procedure that provides a sufficient amount of tissue for zzso and zzso and may be useful for improving the quality of the pathological diagnosis of zzso zzso
