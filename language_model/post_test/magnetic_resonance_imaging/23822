Stroke in the human is most frequently caused by an zzso zzso In order to investigate human stroke, appropriate and relevant animal models must be zzso Since the only approved treatment of stroke is that of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso the models selected should be amenable to zzso zzso We therefore describe a new model of zzso stroke in the rat in which a zzso rich zzso is placed via the internal carotid artery zzso at the origin of the middle cerebral artery zzso Data are summarized describing treatment of zzso stroke with zzso administered at various times after stroke, the use of combination zzso zzso and zzso therapy, and the application of zzso to monitor the zzso evolution of zzso changes within zzso tissue with and without zzso intervention and to predict therapeutic zzso
