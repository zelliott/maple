Today's definition of coronary artery disease zzso comprises two zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso chance of a life-threatening zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is well documented in numerous zzso The objective in modern strategies of diagnosis and therapy should therefore be zzso identification of patients at high risk for coronary events, who will benefit from a customized zzso Before initiating diagnostic procedures of zzso a well defined strategy should be zzso There are two possible primary zzso zzso OF THE zzso RISK FOR A zzso zzso Assessment of the individual zzso risk for a coronary event is not possible using single traditional risk zzso The individual risk can be estimated by zzso several of the traditional risk factors into a scoring zzso These so-called risk scores zzso zzso score and zzso zzso however, have been associated with zzso insufficient discrimination of high-risk from low-risk zzso The calcium score has therefore become increasingly zzso this zzso score is independent of the traditional risk factors, so there is no correlation between zzso and zzso zzso Today, the calcium score is considered the superior test for identifying individuals at high risk for a coronary event and its use is recommended by the European Society of zzso zzso guidelines for prevention of cardiovascular zzso zzso OR zzso OF A zzso zzso zzso zzso Another concept is the definitive proof or exclusion of a zzso zzso coronary zzso The probability of an zzso zzso is traditionally assessed by the type of chest pain, age, gender and zzso In patients with a low probability of an zzso zzso cardiac zzso is not zzso whereas in patients with a high probability of a zzso significant coronary zzso an invasive strategy should be zzso Since zzso coronary zzso zzso with zzso has been shown to provide a high negative zzso value, zzso (with good imaging zzso is suitable for ruling out a significant zzso zzso in the group at intermediate risk for an zzso zzso Another approach could be a functional test to initially prove a relevant, zzso zzso zzso In a large cohort it was shown that patients will only zzso benefit from zzso procedures if the zzso zzso area is greater than zzso zzso the assessment of the extent of zzso zzso is the domain of modern stress imaging zzso zzso and zzso zzso have almost the same sensitivity zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso respectively), which are considerably higher than for zzso zzso MR is most suitable for the assessment of zzso zzso because it traces the first pass dynamics of zzso at rest and during stress in zzso slices at an acceptable spatial and a high zzso resolution without zzso zzso Whether the zzso coronary zzso with zzso and the zzso imaging with zzso will completely replace diagnostic cardiac zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso remains to be evaluated in further zzso
