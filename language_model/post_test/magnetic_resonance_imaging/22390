Identification of the zzso zzso segment on magnetic resonance zzso images is important for appropriate treatment of disease in the zzso zzso zzso In the study, data obtained from plain zzso zzso of the zzso spine and zzso MR imaging scans zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso spine and zzso with the zzso bone, are zzso Twenty-six children aged 10 to 14 years were examined for back zzso On the standard zzso zzso of the zzso spine, a zzso transitional vertebra as classified according to the method of zzso et zzso was found in 17 zzso The problem arose as to whether this was zzso or zzso and how to determine which vertebra was zzso zzso zzso On the zzso MR imaging studies the same question zzso A need emerged for a simple method which would identify the zzso segment on the zzso MR imaging studies of the zzso spine in children so that in case of a zzso zzso zzso or zzso of a disc, the level in the zzso spine where the problem is localized can be accurately zzso To this objective we selected the method using detection of the zzso zzso This involved that, in addition to the zzso MR imaging scans of the zzso spine, zzso images of the zzso and zzso bone be also zzso on the zzso zzso the zzso can be clearly zzso from the zzso zzso By counting from the zzso up, the zzso vertebra can be accurately zzso zzso of the zzso vertebra enables detection of the zzso vertebra and, in turn, of all other zzso zzso In patients in whom a zzso MR studies were done zzso could be precisely determined and so could the zzso zzso In this process, whether the patient had a transitional vertebra or whether there was zzso or zzso was zzso
