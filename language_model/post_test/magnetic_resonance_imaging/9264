After zzso of the first zzso in bilateral deep brain stimulation zzso lead zzso brain shift effects in the target region and along the zzso trajectory of the second zzso are zzso with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso We investigated zzso X-ray imaging for its feasibility in indirect detection of brain zzso 

In 25 patients who underwent bilateral zzso lead zzso X-ray and zzso were performed before and after zzso of the first zzso Two parameters of brain shift were assessed with zzso zzso deformation field analysis of the zzso zzso global brain shift along the anterior and zzso zzso zzso line and specific brain shift along the zzso trajectory of the second zzso zzso and zzso X-ray images were zzso and intensity corrected for detection of significant signal changes through zzso air zzso during zzso of the first zzso 

After zzso of the first zzso brain shift greater than 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed at the zzso and brain shift greater than 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed along the planned zzso trajectory of the second zzso In 1 patient, the zzso trajectory of the second zzso went through a zzso after cortical brain zzso In 9 patients, zzso air volume between zzso and zzso zzso was observed with zzso after zzso of the first zzso zzso X-ray zzso changes were induced by an zzso air volume of greater than 8 zzso 

In bilateral zzso zzso brain shift effects can cause zzso of the second zzso with the risk of adverse or no stimulation effects as well as unnecessary cortical zzso A lack of X-ray signal changes caused by zzso air invasion during zzso lead zzso indicates a lack of clinically relevant brain zzso
