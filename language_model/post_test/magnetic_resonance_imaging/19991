The authors sought to establish whether the volume of the zzso zzso in children suffering from zzso zzso Type I zzso is smaller than normal, as has been suggested zzso They also investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso zzso volume zzso and zzso volume zzso were measured using zzso techniques on zzso magnetic resonance images obtained in 42 children who underwent surgery for zzso zzso age zzso months, range zzso zzso 25 zzso of the patients had zzso The zzso ratio was calculated to eliminate differential zzso zzso Patients who had zzso potentially interfering with skull growth or who had undergone a shunt zzso procedure prior to zzso zzso were zzso The results were compared with zzso of 51 healthy children using one-way analysis of zzso In patients with zzso only, the mean zzso and zzso ratios were not statistically different than those for healthy zzso In patients with both zzso and zzso zzso the mean zzso and zzso ratios were statistically smaller than those for healthy zzso The zzso was zzso zzso in the healthy group, zzso zzso in the zzso only group, and zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso the zzso was 186 zzso in the healthy group, 196 zzso in the zzso only group, and zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso the zzso ratio was zzso in the healthy group, zzso in the zzso only group, and zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso These differences were more prominent in the first 10 years of zzso 

Children with isolated zzso do not have a zzso smaller than normal, whereas children with both zzso and zzso have a zzso significantly smaller than zzso This result indicates that the two zzso may represent different zzso expression or even a different zzso
