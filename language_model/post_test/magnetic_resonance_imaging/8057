Parallel zzso techniques are a promising approach for reducing zzso B1 zzso due to the potential for adjusting the spatial zzso profile with independent zzso zzso These techniques may be further improved with transmit sensitivity zzso zzso methods because the sensitivity information in pulse design provides an zzso that is inherently compensated for zzso B1 zzso This paper presents a proof of this concept using transmit zzso zzso tailored zzso zzso designed for small flip zzso An zzso receiver zzso was used to mimic parallel transmission for brain imaging at zzso The transmit zzso zzso were based on the zzso design and produced zzso slices at a flip angle of 30 degrees with only a zzso pulse zzso It was found that the transmit zzso zzso produced more homogeneous images than those obtained from the complex sum of images from all receivers excited with a standard zzso zzso
