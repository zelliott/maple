zzso major depression zzso is characterized by distinct zzso and zzso factors, as well as medical zzso that are associated with specific zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to use zzso correlations of cortical and zzso volumes to examine zzso structural network properties in subjects with zzso compared with healthy comparison zzso 

This was a zzso zzso study conducted in the general zzso We recruited 73 healthy elderly comparison subjects and 53 subjects with zzso who volunteered in response to zzso Brain network connectivity measures were generated by zzso regional volumes after controlling for age, zzso and zzso volume by using the Brain zzso zzso 

zzso for overall network strength revealed that zzso networks showed a greater magnitude of associations for both positive and negative correlation weights compared with healthy elderly zzso zzso networks also demonstrated zzso in brain network structure compared with healthy comparison zzso zzso networks were also more vulnerable to targeted attacks compared with healthy elderly comparison subjects, and this vulnerability was attenuated when controlling for white matter zzso 

Overall, this study demonstrates that zzso network properties are altered in zzso and may reflect the underlying zzso vulnerabilities of the zzso
