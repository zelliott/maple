Previous work has demonstrated that deficiencies in volume selection sequences used in magnetic resonance zzso may compromise the quality of the zzso zzso In this paper, further studies on the zzso and PRESS sequences are zzso Under conditions of partial zzso zzso can exhibit serious contamination with extraneous zzso particularly when a small volume of interest zzso is zzso zzso protocols should therefore use zzso that are large relative to the target volume, and repetition times that are as long as zzso In zzso contamination is found to be zzso by using a zzso that is small relative to the target volume, and to be independent of repetition zzso PRESS performance is also independent of echo time, except when very short echo times are zzso These results are consistent with previously published work on zzso and zzso and it is now possible to establish generic features of these sequences and to understand the implications for quantitative zzso zzso of contamination in zzso can compromise both relative and absolute zzso techniques in several zzso zzso in PRESS is largely independent of relaxation times and would be easier to model and correct for in the context of quantitative zzso
