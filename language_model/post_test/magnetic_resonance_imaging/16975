A comparison of zzso patterns of white matter zzso within the prefrontal region between humans and nonhuman primates is key to understanding human brain zzso zzso mediates complex cognitive processes and has zzso connections with zzso processing regions zzso zzso Although the zzso pattern of prefrontal zzso in zzso differs markedly from that in humans zzso this has not been explored in our closest evolutionary relative, the zzso The present zzso study of magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated that the prefrontal zzso volume in chimpanzees was immature and had not reached the adult value during zzso as observed in humans but not in zzso However, the rate of prefrontal zzso volume increase during infancy was slower in chimpanzees than in zzso These results suggest that a less mature and more protracted zzso of zzso connections in the prefrontal portion of the developing brain existed in the last common zzso of chimpanzees and humans, and that this served to enhance the impact of zzso experiences on zzso zzso Furthermore, the rapid development of the human prefrontal zzso during infancy may help the development of complex social zzso as well as the acquisition of zzso knowledge and skills to shape zzso zzso
