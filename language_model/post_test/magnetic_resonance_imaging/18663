zzso zzso zzso using the zzso gamma knife promotes acute and chronic local changes in zzso zzso We have been able to find very few papers on zzso on the subject of assessment of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso The aim of this work was to specify the additional value of zzso zzso in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso zzso zzso from viable brain zzso in a clinical zzso zzso zzso in 25 patients were treated by zzso An average of 33 weeks later, all the patients underwent zzso zzso At the same time zzso weeks) all the patients underwent zzso The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of both zzso PET and zzso examinations were calculated with reference to clinical and zzso follow-up or zzso The additional value derived from use of zzso PET after zzso was assessed and zzso survival rates were zzso The difference in zzso survival rates between the negative and positive zzso was significant ( zzso for zzso and even more so ( zzso for zzso zzso zzso specificity and accuracy were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso In the zzso of patients with positive or zzso zzso the probability of presence of a viable zzso was only zzso zzso This probability increased to zzso zzso when subsequent zzso PET was positive and decreased to zzso zzso when zzso PET was zzso The frequency of a viable zzso was significantly different ( zzso in the zzso PET negative and positive zzso zzso and zzso PET both have an important zzso value for persistent viable zzso after treatment by zzso Neither sensitive but zzso zzso nor specific but insensitive zzso PET is reliable on its zzso While zzso PET significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy in the zzso of patients with positive and zzso zzso it provided no additional value in the zzso zzso
