To zzso impairment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Five patients with genetically zzso zzso zzso zzso 51 to 65 years, mean zzso zzso and 5 zzso and zzso healthy controls underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the brain in the zzso predominantly containing the zzso zzso or the zzso 

Conventional zzso studies showed apparently normal zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso MRS showed that the zzso zzso zzso ratio for the patients' zzso zzso the region zzso affected in zzso was significantly higher than that in the controls zzso The zzso zzso ratio for the zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso ratios for the thalamus, the region relatively spared in this disease, did not differ significantly between the patients and zzso 

MRS may sensitively and specifically detect zzso zzso in susceptible regions of patients with zzso zzso
