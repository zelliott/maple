zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso zzso was investigated using a verb generation task in 10 healthy right-handed zzso zzso showed an early transient zzso in the left inferior zzso region zzso zzso following auditory presentation of the stimulus zzso A sustained slow cortical zzso of later onset zzso zzso was then recorded, most pronounced over left inferior frontal zzso zzso data were in agreement with both zzso effects, showing left zzso zzso in inferior and superior zzso as well as inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso effects occurred during the verb generation task but not during passive word listening or during zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso provided zzso evidence regarding language zzso with zzso revealing the zzso sequence of zzso to anterior cortical zzso during semantic zzso
