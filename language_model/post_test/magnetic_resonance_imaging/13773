To study the effect of water zzso on zzso zzso and cortical zzso in patients with diabetes using blood zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

Nine mild diabetic subjects zzso zzso zzso years of age, six zzso and nine zzso subjects of similar age and sex, all without known vascular or zzso disease, were studied zzso by zzso before and during water zzso 

Water zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso in control subjects, producing a decrease in zzso zzso zzso relaxation zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but no significant change in the group of diabetic zzso 

These findings in middle-aged diabetic subjects, which resembled those previously described in elderly subjects zzso years of age, suggest early impairment of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso in zzso
