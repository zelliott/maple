zzso lateral sclerosis zzso is zzso by zzso of upper zzso and lower motor zzso zzso aimed to relate clinical variables to cortical thinning of the primary motor zzso zzso The zzso was defined as the region of interest in high-resolution structural zzso zzso We related zzso measures of cortical thinning to zzso involvement, zzso zzso the total ALS functional rating scale zzso and its zzso and upper limb zzso In total, 93 ALS patients were recruited zzso with classical zzso 17 with dominant zzso zzso primary lateral zzso 16 with pure zzso zzso zzso progressive muscular zzso zzso arm or leg zzso and compared to 67 age and gender matched healthy zzso The zzso signs in the zzso regions were associated with bilateral thinning within the zzso segment on the motor cortex, and zzso signs in spinal regions were associated with thinning in the limb segment of the motor zzso The site of disease onset zzso zzso exhibited the most pronounced thinning in the corresponding part of the motor zzso According to our analysis, dominant zzso patients demonstrated the most distinct thinning followed by classical ALS zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ from healthy zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso correlated with thinning of the left inferior zzso zzso zzso changes within the zzso zzso to clinically measured zzso and depend on disease zzso zzso cortical thickness may potentially offer an objective in zzso marker to zzso disease zzso
