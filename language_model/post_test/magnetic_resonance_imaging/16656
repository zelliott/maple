Brain functional connectivity zzso refers to zzso zzso of low frequency fluctuations in blood zzso level dependent functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso has been evaluated both during task performance and in the zzso state, yielding reports of zzso differences correlated with behavior and zzso Two zzso are widely used for evaluating zzso from blood zzso level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso correlation with a specified seed zzso or small region of interest; and spatial independent component zzso While results from zzso and independent component analysis zzso are generally similar, they are zzso zzso This study is intended to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the relationship between seed and independent component analysis derived measures of zzso zzso zzso measures are shown to be the sum of independent component zzso within network zzso and between network zzso We present a simple simulation and an experiment on zzso activity that highlight this relationship between the two zzso
