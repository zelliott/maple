A number of B1 mapping methods have been zzso A model to facilitate choice among these methods is valuable, as the performance of each technique is affected by a variety of factors, including acquisition zzso ratio zzso The zzso shift B1 mapping method has recently garnered significant zzso In this paper, we present a statistical model suitable for analysis of the zzso shift zzso Unlike previously presented models, the analysis is valid in both low zzso and high zzso zzso We present a detailed analysis of the performance of the zzso shift B1 mapping method across a broad range of acquisition scenarios, and compare it to two other B1 mapping techniques (the dual angle method and the phase sensitive zzso Further validation of the model is presented through both zzso Carlo simulations and experimental zzso The simulations and experimental results match the model well, lending confidence to its zzso Each technique is found to perform well with high acquisition zzso However, our results suggest that the dual angle method is not reliable in low zzso zzso Furthermore, the phase sensitive method appears to outperform the zzso shift method in these zzso cases, although variations of the zzso method may be possible that improve its performance at low zzso
