Whether motor and linguistic representations of actions share common neural structures has recently been the focus of an animated debate in cognitive zzso Group studies with zzso patients reported association patterns of zzso and linguistic deficits whereas single case studies documented double zzso between the correct execution of gestures and their comprehension in verbal zzso When the relationship between language and zzso was investigated, each ability was zzso as a unique process without distinguishing between possible zzso However, recent cognitive models can be successfully used to account for these inconsistencies in the extant zzso In the present study, in 57 patients with left brain damage, we tested whether a deficit at imitating either meaningful or meaningless gestures zzso zzso on three distinct linguistic abilities zzso naming and zzso Based on the zzso models, we predicted that zzso and linguistic performance would be associated when meaningful gestures are zzso and would zzso for meaningless zzso We used partial correlations to assess the association between patients' scores while accounting for potential zzso effects of zzso factors such age, education and zzso zzso We found that zzso of meaningful gestures significantly correlated with patients' performance on naming and repetition (but not on zzso This was not the case for the zzso of meaningless zzso Moreover, zzso zzso mapping analysis revealed that damage to the angular zzso specifically affected zzso of meaningless zzso independent of patients' performance on linguistic zzso Instead, damage to the zzso zzso affected not only zzso of meaningful zzso but also patients' performance on naming and zzso Our findings clarify the apparent conflict between associations and zzso patterns previously observed in zzso studies, and suggest that motor experience and language can interact when the two zzso zzso zzso
