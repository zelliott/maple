The goal of the study was to investigate factors associated with zzso of the internal carotid artery zzso and zzso artery zzso which reflect the anterior and zzso circulation respectively, and to examine if these arteries are affected differently by specific zzso 

The diameters of zzso and BA were measured using zzso magnetic resonance zzso images at the level of the zzso in 304 zzso with the zzso zzso of the flow void taken as the diameter for each zzso The association between the diameters and clinical data including zzso zzso zzso and estimated zzso zzso rate zzso was zzso The same analysis was performed for the zzso zzso 

Multiple zzso analysis adjusted for zzso factors including gender and age showed that a lower zzso was independently associated with zzso of both the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the BA zzso zzso zzso zzso was independently associated with a greater zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso but zzso did not show this zzso Diabetes zzso was significantly more frequent zzso in patients with a zzso ratio higher than the mean, compared to those with a lower zzso zzso 

zzso dysfunction was shown to be a zzso factor for the anterior and zzso circulation as reflected by the zzso and BA zzso zzso The association of the zzso ratio with zzso suggests that diabetes zzso may affect each circulation zzso
