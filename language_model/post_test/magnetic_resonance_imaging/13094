Conventional zzso zzso at zzso T does not provide adequate image quality of small zzso thus reducing its potential for use as an alternative to invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso T provides good images of small zzso We therefore compared the diagnostic usefulness of zzso zzso with conventional zzso for zzso examination of human zzso 

We did zzso zzso at zzso T and zzso T on 18 fetuses of less than 22 zzso zzso using three-dimensional zzso zzso echo zzso before doing invasive zzso Images obtained with zzso for each system were compared with the findings of invasive autopsy in a blinded zzso zzso contrast of 14 different regions was compared on zzso T and zzso T images that were provided by zzso zzso separately and in a random order, and image quality was scored on a zzso zzso The primary zzso was diagnostic zzso 

zzso resolution, tissue contrast, and image quality of all organ systems were much better with zzso zzso than with conventional zzso All structural abnormalities that were detected with invasive autopsy and internal examination of visceral zzso were also detected with zzso zzso whereas conventional zzso was not zzso useful in 14 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a feasible option for zzso examination of human zzso and can provide good tissue zzso even in small fetuses (5 zzso The use of zzso at zzso T might be helpful in the development of a minimally invasive zzso autopsy zzso
