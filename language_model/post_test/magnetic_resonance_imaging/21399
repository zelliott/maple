In this study, a correlation zzso based zzso zzso zzso method is introduced to extract multiple correlation patterns from zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso It was applied to spontaneous zzso signals acquired from zzso rats, and the results were then compared with those obtained using independent component analysis zzso one of the most popular zzso analysis method for analyzing spontaneous zzso zzso It was demonstrated that the zzso has a higher sensitivity than the zzso particularly on a single run data, for identifying correlation structures with relatively weak connections, for instance, the zzso zzso Compared to the zzso correlation analysis, the zzso does not require a zzso information and thus can avoid potential biases caused by seed selection, and multiple patterns can be extracted at one zzso In contrast to other zzso methods, the zzso is based on zzso correlations of zzso signals and its analysis outcomes are easy to interpret as the strength of functional zzso Moreover, its sensitivity of detecting patterns remains relatively high even for a single zzso In conclusion, the zzso method could be a useful tool for investigating zzso brain connectivity and zzso
