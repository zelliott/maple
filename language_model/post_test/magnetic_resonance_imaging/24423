zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is often associated with zzso zzso We hypothesized that there are specific magnetic resonance zzso imaging findings at the diagnosis of zzso zzso that predict subsequent zzso Various clinical characteristics were investigated including outcome and MR imaging findings in 12 patients with zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and 21 patients with zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso Patient age and presence of zzso zzso were significantly associated with poor zzso Median survival with zzso zzso was longer in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso Low zzso performance status zzso and poor zzso zzso analysis zzso class zzso class 3, 5, 6, or 7) at the diagnosis of zzso zzso were associated with the presence of zzso The zzso of zzso dissemination after zzso zzso was higher in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso Evans index and fractional zzso value showed no difference at the diagnosis of zzso zzso but some MR imaging findings indicated that zzso attached to the zzso zzso and/or zzso was closely associated with subsequent zzso We recommend careful monitoring of the zzso size and zzso zzso especially in patients with low zzso and/or poor zzso class, if MR imaging indicates that the zzso is attached to the zzso zzso and/or zzso at recurrence of zzso
