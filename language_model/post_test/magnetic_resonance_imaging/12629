The time course of changes in regional cerebral zzso during a continuous motor learning task performed with the right hand was monitored using the zzso spin labeling zzso technique at high field (3 zzso zzso allowed measuring explicit learning related effects in neural activity zzso throughout a 6 minute task zzso During this time learning took place as demonstrated by performance zzso Comparing the initial and final learning zzso zzso decreases were detected in most of the cortical regions recruited during early zzso More interestingly however zzso increases were observed in a few cortical and zzso regions of the zzso zzso the supplementary motor area, the primary zzso area, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso and zzso the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso increases in the zzso zzso and zzso were highly correlated during the learning zzso These results support the hypothesis that the zzso and zzso form interactive memory systems with parallel zzso
