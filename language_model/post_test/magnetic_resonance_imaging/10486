zzso and transient signals were compared in a group of zzso children and a group of adults performing the same cognitive task using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in conjunction with a mixed zzso zzso zzso revealed several regions, including a region in the right lateral inferior frontal zzso that exhibited opposing zzso zzso in sustained and transient zzso particular, decreased sustained signals and increased transient signals with zzso zzso of the data assuming zzso and zzso designs, as opposed to a mixed design, produced different zzso In zzso these results may help to explain contradictory findings in the literature regarding the direction of neural development in frontal zzso Moreover, these results underscore the value of separating sustained and transient signals in zzso studies of zzso
