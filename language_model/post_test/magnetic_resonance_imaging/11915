The acoustic noise generated during an zzso sequence can be effectively reduced with the help of soft zzso zzso using zzso zzso The long slope zzso however, leads to long acquisition zzso The use of zzso spiral zzso calculated with long zzso slopes, is proposed to reduce the acquisition time while maintaining low acoustic noise zzso The practicality of this approach is demonstrated on phantom and volunteer zzso
