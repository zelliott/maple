The value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the evaluation of the zzso or comatose patient with a potential neck injury is a controversial zzso Some authors have suggested that zzso of the cervical spine adds no value in the evaluation of patients with a normal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso However, others have suggested that zzso is the gold standard for clearing the cervical spine in a clinically suspicious or zzso blunt trauma zzso The purpose of this study is to evaluate our data in regard to these conflicting zzso 

Five consecutive years of data from 17,000 patients seen at our Level I trauma center yielded 512 individuals who underwent both CT and zzso of the cervical zzso Of the latter group, 150 individuals met three strict inclusion criteria for this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with 94 of this group comatose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no obvious zzso zzso and zzso a normal cervical zzso The effect of zzso on the clinical management of these patients was zzso 

Among the 150 zzso or comatose patients with a negative CT, the majority zzso had a normal zzso Among the patients with a positive zzso the most common zzso findings were zzso and soft tissue injury zzso However, no zzso findings were deemed zzso and no surgical intervention or change in the clinical management aside from zzso zzso of these individuals occurred after zzso 

The addition of a cervical zzso to the evaluation protocol of zzso or comatose patients with an otherwise normal zzso examination and a normal cervical CT did not provide any additional useful information to change the management of these zzso
