We used a mechanical method to locate the axis of rotation of the zzso zzso A single constant axis of rotation was found just zzso to the tips of the zzso The paths of light-emitting zzso mounted on a zzso pin were recorded with time zzso photography during zzso These paths were analyzed both in the zzso plane and in a plane perpendicular to the axis of zzso zzso plane studies were distorted by perspective zzso The plane used to analyze joint motion or shape must be the plane of zzso Models of the zzso joint for gait analysis, zzso surgery and prosthetic design should have a single offset axis of zzso
