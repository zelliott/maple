To compare the diagnostic performance of zzso M with that of zzso zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso with magnetic resonance zzso imaging in a rabbit model of gastric zzso 

The study protocol was approved by the institutional animal care zzso zzso zzso were zzso into the wall of the stomach in 20 zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was performed 4-6 weeks after zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging was performed approximately 24 hours zzso Both MR imaging sets were analyzed separately and independently by four zzso with respect to confidence level regarding the presence of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by using zzso zzso zzso receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and the zzso signed rank zzso 

zzso were confirmed at zzso analysis in 32 of 104 zzso zzso from 16 zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso for confidence regarding the presence of zzso in zzso zzso was significantly greater for zzso M than for zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso However, most zzso 25 of zzso zzso zzso were zzso and no significant difference was obtained in zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso the zzso M MR imaging set was assigned a significantly higher score than was the zzso zzso MR imaging set by all readers zzso zzso zzso 

zzso M showed significantly higher accuracy and better zzso than zzso zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso most of which were zzso in this animal model of gastric zzso
