The accuracy of tumor plasma volume and zzso estimates obtained with zzso MR imaging may have zzso introduced by a poor zzso of the zzso In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a novel technique by using a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso grading of patients with suspected zzso 

This prospective study included 46 patients with a new zzso confirmed diagnosis of zzso Both magnitude and phase images were acquired during zzso MR imaging for estimates of zzso and zzso zzso from a zzso zzso and bookend zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso from a zzso zzso without zzso zzso 

Median zzso values were zzso zzso (95 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for grade II, III, and IV zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso for zzso Median zzso values were zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso g zzso and zzso zzso g zzso with P zzso zzso between grade II and III zzso and P zzso zzso between grade III and IV zzso In zzso zzso from high-grade zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The differences between the zzso were not statistically zzso 

zzso and zzso are parameters that can help in zzso zzso from high-grade zzso
