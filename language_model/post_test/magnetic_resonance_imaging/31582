We addressed the question whether zzso of zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso activity in zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso patients is determined by pathology or sex, zzso between two zzso zzso implicated in zzso memory as zzso zzso - the zzso zzso and the zzso place area zzso We further assessed the relation between zzso of zzso zzso and zzso memory decline regarding performance in standardized zzso tests of verbal and zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data were acquired from unilateral zzso patients performing an object location memory task in a virtual zzso Individual zzso zzso zzso based on zzso brain zzso patterns were calculated for each subject and zzso zzso analyses were zzso between zzso to zzso changes in learning and asymmetry in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso zzso activity in patients with zzso was determined by the side of seizure focus, not zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso was neither influenced by side of pathology nor zzso zzso of zzso zzso was significantly correlated with decline in verbal learning after zzso We were able to demonstrate that asymmetry of zzso zzso in unilateral zzso patients is determined by the side of seizure focus, thus indicating the relative functional integrity of the zzso This is zzso by the finding that greater zzso of the zzso zzso leads to stronger verbal memory decline after zzso
