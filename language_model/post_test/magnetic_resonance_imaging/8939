We present a dynamic zzso model that can explain zzso changes in neural responses, in the rat barrel cortex, to an electrical zzso stimulation at different zzso zzso responses were measured in terms of local field zzso These were converted into current source density zzso data, and the time series of the zzso sink was extracted to provide a time series response zzso The model structure consists of three layers zzso the responses from the brain stem to the zzso and then the barrel zzso and the latter two layers contain zzso coupled zzso of linear zzso dynamic zzso The interaction of these zzso forms a zzso regulatory system that determines the zzso structure of the neural response zzso for the zzso and cortical zzso The model is based on the measured population dynamics of zzso rather than the dynamics of a single zzso and was evaluated against zzso data from experiments with varying stimulation frequency zzso zzso random pulse trains, and awake and zzso zzso The model parameters obtained by zzso for different zzso conditions zzso or zzso were significantly zzso Following zzso zzso Turner, and Price (2000), this work is part of a formal mathematical system currently being developed zzso et zzso zzso that links stimulation to the blood oxygen level dependent zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso signal through neural activity and zzso zzso The importance of the model described here is that it can be used to zzso the zzso zzso of changes in blood flow to estimate the underlying neural zzso
