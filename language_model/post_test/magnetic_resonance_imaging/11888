A 77-year-old left-handed man presented with pure zzso following cerebral zzso The zzso was restricted to the right zzso zzso extending to the immediately underlying zzso white matter and the frontal part of the insular zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed that half of the zzso errors in spontaneous speech were sequencing zzso zzso errors were detected at the zzso level in both consonants and zzso and at the syllable zzso Most of the sequential errors were zzso zzso errors were observed both within and across zzso In clear contrast with zzso writing and comprehension was zzso which suggested the problem was limited to oral zzso Our findings provide further support that the zzso zzso and/or the insular zzso of the language dominant zzso is responsible for the zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso
