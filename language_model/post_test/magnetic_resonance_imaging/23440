Recently, several protocols for labeling of stem cells with zzso iron zzso zzso have been developed, leading to an active and growing field aimed at visualizing stem cells using zzso zzso resonance zzso including zzso stem cell zzso This development occurred simultaneously with a significant rise in the number of cell therapy clinical trials for cardiovascular applications and their preceding zzso studies in animal zzso In this chapter, we will describe several labeling strategies that can be used to label cells with zzso zzso This is followed by a discussion of current strategies for using zzso to zzso these cells in zzso zzso
