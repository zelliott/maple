Progressive facial zzso zzso is characterized by a slowly progressive zzso of soft zzso and in some cases zzso zzso zzso features of localized zzso zzso are commonly observed, indicating the close nature of both zzso 

We sought to investigate clinical, zzso and zzso findings in zzso from zzso patients with zzso and to discuss the relationship to linear zzso en coup de zzso zzso 

A total of 12 patients with zzso were zzso evaluated on the basis of clinical, zzso and zzso zzso 

Five patients zzso presented with complete zzso and 7 patients zzso with partial zzso involving either cheek or zzso Five of the patients zzso had a zzso zzso zzso and 3 of them zzso had zzso zzso of the zzso zzso involvement was present in 6 zzso Neurological involvement was common, in particular, zzso zzso zzso investigations showed neither evidence for infection with zzso zzso nor any other indication of underlying systemic zzso zzso 

There were a relatively small number of patients in a retrospective zzso 

The reported cases suggest a close relationship between zzso and zzso zzso might appear as two different zzso one involving zzso structures and presenting with clinical features similar to zzso one being strictly restricted to subcutaneous structures, primarily affecting the cheek zzso The zzso clinical features of central nervous system involvement indicate the zzso importance of neurological involvement in the development of zzso zzso resonance imaging should be included in the tools of standard diagnostic procedures in patients with zzso The zzso relevance of zzso as well as preceding trauma should be investigated in larger collective zzso
