The aim of this study was to identify the normal anatomy of the zzso region on magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso zzso zzso images of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso planes were obtained with a body zzso in 60 normal volunteers (30 women and 30 men, aged zzso zzso at rest in the zzso zzso 

zzso images showed fat spaces and muscles zzso allowing zzso of 7 image zzso including the zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle, inner zzso space, vertical zzso outer zzso space, and external zzso zzso The zzso smooth muscle was derived from the zzso smooth muscle, and the inner space originated from the zzso zzso The outer space lay between the vertical zzso and the external zzso The zzso did not have a zzso zzso The deep, superficial, and SC zzso were 3 separate muscle zzso The zzso spaces had a complex zzso 

zzso zzso zzso studies can show zzso fat spaces and zzso zzso allowing fat spaces and zzso to serve as mutual zzso The results of imaging of the zzso region with this method are different from previous imaging descriptions and may provide a more accurate and systemic description of the zzso region structures than was previously zzso
