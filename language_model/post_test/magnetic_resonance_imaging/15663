zzso new knowledge based on knowledge established through prior learning is a central feature of higher zzso that is captured in research on stimulus zzso zzso Numerous zzso investigations show that reinforcing behavior under control of distinct sets of arbitrary conditional relations gives rise to stimulus control by new, derived zzso This investigation examined whether zzso and zzso networks known to support reinforced conditional relations also support derived conditional zzso Twelve adult subjects completed zzso zzso training with zzso feedback to establish four trained conditional relations within two zzso zzso stimulus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso functional zzso was performed when zzso trials were presented involving matching two identical circles (a zzso control zzso trained relations zzso zzso and derived zzso symmetry zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso responding to trained and derived relations was similarly correlated with bilateral zzso in the targeted zzso Comparing trained to derived relations, however, highlighted greater zzso in several prefrontal regions, the zzso thalamus, and zzso which may represent the effects of extended training or feedback present during zzso Each derived relation also evidenced a unique zzso zzso zzso the findings extend the role of zzso and zzso networks to derived conditional relations and suggest that regional involvement varies with the type of derived conditional zzso
