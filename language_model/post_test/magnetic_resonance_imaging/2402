An important controversy on the development of multiple sclerosis zzso after an isolated episode of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is the method of election in order to detect zzso zzso in zzso The current study was designed to determine the prevalence of brain abnormalities on zzso and to zzso the further development of zzso after an isolated idiopathic ON in our zzso 

From 1991 to 1995, 60 patients with decrease of visual acuity were zzso 35 zzso women, half age 31 zzso 10 zzso completed criteria of idiopathic zzso A brain zzso was performed in all patients after the diagnosis of idiopathic ON and they subsequently were followed in the zzso clinic from our center for a mean time of 29 zzso 16 zzso 24 out of the 35 patients were treated with zzso in different zzso 

It has been found zzso of the patients with idiopathic ON to have brain zzso by zzso During the follow-up zzso of the patients developed a clinically zzso zzso all of them had a pathological brain zzso at the zzso evaluation zzso zzso zzso None of the patients that were treated with high-dose of zzso zzso developed zzso 

The prevalence of silent cerebral zzso in the zzso after an idiopathic ON is elevated in our population although further development of zzso is lower possibly due to the short follow-up carried zzso The presence of zzso in the zzso zzso a high risk for developing zzso after an idiopathic zzso
