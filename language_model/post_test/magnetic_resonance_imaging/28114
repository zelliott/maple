To assess the clinical feasibility of sodium magnetic resonance imaging for the zzso and characterization of zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance images were obtained of zzso human eyes and of rabbit eyes in zzso The magnetic resonance imaging technique used in this study provided slices of zzso 2 zzso thickness and zzso resolution of zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso From each of these slices local values of zzso relaxation time zzso were calculated from zzso zzso in each of the eight zzso 

The images clearly display normal zzso details of the lens and zzso humor, and important zzso details such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso melanoma, and retinal zzso zzso tissue identifications based on relative zzso relaxation time values and zzso zzso correlate with those made by standard diagnostic zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging may be used for the zzso and characterization of zzso zzso zzso among zzso humor, zzso zzso humor, zzso fluid, or zzso and tumor may be based on image intensity and/or zzso relaxation zzso
