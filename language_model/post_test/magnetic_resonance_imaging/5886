The accuracy of zzso after zzso zzso zzso in locally advanced zzso cancer zzso has been zzso We have evaluated our experience of sequential zzso to assess zzso zzso with zzso zzso 17 patients with zzso had three zzso zzso zzso 1, before zzso zzso 2, 6 weeks zzso and zzso 3, zzso zzso T and N staging were reported, with zzso subdivided into zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso wall zzso and a prediction of vascular involvement were also correlated with zzso zzso agreement with zzso 3 was zzso T zzso N zzso and vascular zzso zzso significant zzso T zzso was shown in zzso 2 and zzso 3 zzso In the 6 weeks zzso zzso T zzso occurred in zzso of patients, with a further zzso showing zzso to zzso zzso zzso showed N stage zzso In the third zzso group zzso zzso showed an zzso T stage improvement, with a further zzso downsizing in zzso of zzso 50% of these zzso had shown no T stage improvement on their second zzso The sequential scans also showed significant reduction in wall thickness zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso showed ongoing response to zzso up to 12 weeks zzso which has important clinical implications regarding the most appropriate time to zzso zzso agreement between zzso 3 and zzso compared with previous studies including only one zzso zzso was also zzso
