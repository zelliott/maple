Advances in solid-state zzso methodology and zzso chemistry are applied to the zzso zzso of solid zzso It is demonstrated zzso and confirmed by density functional theory zzso calculations, that the spectral resolution in the zzso spinning spectrum is limited by the zzso of the bulk magnetic zzso zzso This leads to the unusual observation that the resolution improves as the sample is zzso zzso calculations provide assignments of each of the zzso in the zzso spectrum, but the predictions are close to the limits of accuracy and correlation information from zzso zzso is invaluable in confirming the zzso The effects of zzso zzso on the use of zzso zzso for mapping correlations of spectral zzso zzso due to the zzso are also zzso
