There is experimental evidence that zzso restores diminished CO2 zzso after mild traumatic brain injury in zzso This effect is believed to be zzso by zzso zzso oxide, which is a zzso zzso for CO2 zzso To clarify whether these findings can be transferred to the clinical situation and have beneficial effects in patients, we studied the effects of zzso on CO2 zzso of the cerebral vessels in patients with impaired zzso zzso zzso and compared them with patients with normal zzso 

Twenty-two patients with cardiovascular risk factors and zzso zzso with no zzso or zzso zzso were examined by bilateral zzso zzso zzso of the right and left middle cerebral arteries and compared with 20 zzso and zzso patients with normal zzso zzso zzso was tested by zzso zzso followed by a zzso inhalation of zzso zzso zzso were performed before and after infusion of 30 g zzso over 30 zzso The 22 patients with reduced zzso zzso were compared with 20 patients with normal zzso zzso 

zzso mean zzso of the 42 patients was zzso There was no difference between the zzso and the zzso zzso In the 22 patients with reduced zzso in the first examination zzso zzso increased significantly after infusion of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, values did not change after infusion of zzso in the 20 patients with normal zzso zzso before versus zzso after zzso There was a negative correlation of initial CO2 zzso and the percentage of zzso increase after infusion of zzso 

Our data support the hypothesis that in humans zzso is able to improve impaired CO2 zzso of the cerebral zzso This effect can be found in patients at cardiovascular risk with impaired zzso and might have therapeutic implications in the zzso
