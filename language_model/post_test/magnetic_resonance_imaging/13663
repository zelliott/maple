To determine the ability of dynamic zzso zzso to depict finger zzso injuries in extreme rock zzso 

zzso extreme rock zzso zzso levels 8-11 on a scale ranging from 1 to zzso Union zzso des zzso zzso with finger injuries (75 symptomatic and 181 zzso zzso were examined by using zzso with the zzso operating at 12 zzso The distance between the zzso zzso and phalanx was evaluated in extension and forced zzso at the level of the zzso and A4 zzso pulleys as an indicator of zzso zzso A distance between the zzso zzso and phalanx greater than zzso zzso was interpreted as positive for a zzso zzso US findings were compared with those of magnetic resonance zzso zzso correlation was available in seven zzso zzso analysis was performed by using analysis of zzso the Student zzso test, and the zzso zzso 

US depicted 16 zzso of 16 complete zzso zzso zzso nine zzso of nine complete A4 zzso zzso six zzso of seven surgically proved complete combined zzso and A3 zzso zzso and 15 zzso of 15 incomplete zzso zzso zzso zzso of distance between the zzso zzso and phalanx was significantly different among patient zzso without zzso zzso and those with incomplete, complete, or complete combined zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of US for depiction of finger zzso injuries was zzso and specificity was zzso 

Dynamic US allows excellent depiction of finger zzso injuries in extreme rock zzso
