zzso zzso zzso coated with three different zzso zzso acid, zzso or zzso and their zzso with sizes in range zzso zzso were zzso by zzso decomposition of zzso zzso The effects of zzso and surface chemistry of zzso zzso on the magnetic properties were systematically investigated by comparing their zzso zzso values and their capability to improve the negative contrast for magnetic resonance imaging zzso after converting the zzso zzso to zzso ones by a zzso exchange zzso An important finding is that the zzso values and zzso zzso rates of zzso zzso are strongly dependent on the size and surface state of the particles that zzso bonded with different zzso zzso before zzso zzso In particular, zzso cubic zzso zzso could be obtained when zzso and zzso were used as mixed stabilizers, and showed excellent zzso and magnetic zzso Furthermore, the low zzso and good cell zzso MR imaging of the zzso capped zzso zzso make them promising candidates for use as zzso zzso
