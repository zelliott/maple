A new technique for zzso the blood fluid zzso rate at the vessel wall is zzso The technique uses zzso zzso imaging to determine the zzso distribution within a spatial element zzso that zzso the zzso wall zzso By appropriate processing, the zzso distribution zzso can determine the location of the zzso interface within the zzso and zzso estimate the zzso profile across the spatial extent of the zzso From this information, accurate estimates of fluid zzso rate may be zzso zzso are presented to illustrate this technique and to show the effects of various error sources, including differences in zzso zzso between blood and wall zzso and zzso signal zzso Experimental evidence obtained for steady flow in straight tubes is also presented in support of the zzso The mean error in the experimental zzso rate estimates found using the proposed technique was zzso This represents a significant improvement over estimates obtained by zzso of the zzso profile over multiple zzso zzso error of zzso
