This study evaluates the relation between zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and the apparent diffusion zzso zzso in patients with zzso and zzso zzso 

For 36 patients (30 with zzso and 6 with zzso zzso the standardized zzso value zzso ratio was calculated to assess the zzso zzso zzso correlation analysis was used to assess the relation between the zzso ratio and the zzso value: those of zzso zzso and high-grade zzso were zzso as were those of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso correlation between the zzso ratio and the minimum zzso was found for all cases zzso zzso and for zzso cases zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly higher zzso ratio than zzso zzso did zzso they also showed significantly lower minimum zzso than zzso zzso did zzso zzso values used for the zzso ratio of zzso and for the minimum zzso of zzso were used to differentiate high-grade from zzso zzso with high zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly higher zzso ratio than zzso zzso No significant difference in the zzso value was found between zzso and zzso zzso (the minimum zzso zzso the mean zzso zzso zzso 

An inverse correlation was found between the zzso ratio and the minimum zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso ratio and the minimum zzso are useful to evaluate the grading of zzso The zzso ratio might be more useful for zzso zzso zzso from zzso than the zzso value zzso
