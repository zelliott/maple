To compare zzso ratios zzso and zzso ratios zzso in various MR zzso including zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso imaging, zzso fast spin echo zzso imaging, and zzso three-dimensional driven equilibrium zzso transform zzso imaging, and to determine the diagnostic accuracy of these imaging sequences for detecting cartilage zzso in zzso knees, as compared with zzso 

Two zzso zzso zzso images zzso time zzso zzso echo time zzso zzso zzso short zzso and zzso zzso long zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso images zzso 40 degrees flip zzso and zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso images zzso were acquired in 35 knees from 28 patients with zzso of the zzso The zzso efficiencies zzso of cartilage, zzso fluid, muscle, zzso bone zzso and fat zzso and the zzso efficiencies zzso of these structures were zzso Kappa values, exact agreement, sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value were determined by comparison of MR grading with zzso zzso 

The zzso fluid zzso on zzso zzso short TE images, zzso zzso long TE images, and zzso three-dimensional zzso images showed similar zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso images showed the highest zzso zzso of all zzso All images showed fair to good agreement with zzso zzso zzso in zzso short zzso zzso in zzso long zzso zzso in three-dimensional zzso and zzso in three-dimensional zzso Although the sensitivity of all sequences was high zzso in zzso short zzso zzso long zzso and zzso zzso in zzso specificity was relatively low zzso in zzso short TE and zzso long zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso The peripheral area of bone zzso zzso or whole area of bone zzso zzso on zzso zzso images was demonstrated as low or zzso intensity on zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso 

zzso three-dimensional zzso imaging and zzso zzso imaging showed high sensitivity and high negative zzso values, but relatively low zzso The Kappa value and exact agreement was the highest on zzso zzso short TE zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso images showed results similar to the conventional zzso
