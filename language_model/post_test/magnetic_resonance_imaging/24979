To compare zzso and zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images for distinguishing zzso from zzso damaged zzso in a cat model of zzso zzso zzso 

Twelve cats underwent 90 minutes of zzso and 90 minutes of zzso of the left anterior descending coronary zzso After baseline zzso and zzso MR images were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images were zzso obtained for 6 hours and 2 hours, zzso After MR imaging, all cats were sacrificed for zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso Areas of abnormal signal intensity on zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR images were compared with the areas of zzso seen at zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso analysis of zzso linear zzso analysis, and zzso zzso 

Mean areas of zzso high signal intensity on zzso and zzso zzso MR images zzso of the left zzso surface area zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly larger than the mean area of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, there was excellent correlation between the size of an enhancing area on zzso zzso zzso MR images and that of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

zzso zzso zzso MR images accurately reflect the area of zzso whereas the size of zzso is overestimated on zzso and zzso zzso MR images, which seem to depict the zzso area as well as the zzso zzso
