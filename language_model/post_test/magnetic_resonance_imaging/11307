This work demonstrates the feasibility of using zzso tuned zzso markers with a limited projection zzso imaging with zzso free zzso sequence zzso to accurately obtain tracking information necessary for interactive scan plane selection in magnetic resonance imaging zzso The position and orientation of a rigid zzso device can be uniquely determined from the zzso coordinates of three zzso markers mounted in a known zzso on the zzso Three zzso markers were tuned to the zzso resonant frequency in a zzso open MR scanner and mounted to the surface of a zzso water zzso An zzso sequence was developed to suppress the water phantom signal while preserving that of the zzso markers through a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso applied prior to data zzso A zzso zzso was developed to accurately calculate the zzso coordinates of the zzso markers using four zzso projections in two zzso scan zzso The sequence repetition time zzso zzso 21 zzso and the limited projection set resulted in fast zzso coordinate acquisition times of approximately 170 zzso with an accuracy zzso zzso of 3 zzso on a zzso MR zzso This fast, accurate tracking method provides the fundamental technology for interactive zzso scan plane definition for rigid zzso devices without the need for zzso cameras or reference zzso
