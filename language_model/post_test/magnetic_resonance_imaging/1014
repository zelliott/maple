zzso is a strain of mice with the unusual ability to recover from injuries without forming zzso zzso It was recently reported that the zzso mice can recover with little or no zzso formation following a zzso induced zzso zzso of the right zzso These findings suggest that zzso recovery from zzso injury is possible in zzso zzso If zzso to humans, these results could have significant clinical implications in the management of patients with zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in human patients usually results from zzso injury instead of zzso zzso zzso usually occurs in the left zzso 

We performed a prospective study creating left zzso zzso zzso in 32 zzso mice using coronary zzso 

Among them, 21 mice survived surgery and had zzso zzso documented by delayed zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso days after zzso All 21 mice had evidence of zzso zzso in follow-up zzso performed zzso days after zzso The zzso size was zzso of the area of zzso zzso during the first zzso study and was zzso during the second zzso study zzso Large zzso zzso with aneurysm formation was documented by zzso examinations in all 21 zzso The zzso aneurysm showed zzso zzso with replacement zzso and zzso zzso zzso surrounded by zzso zzso zzso zzso surviving zzso are present within the zzso 

zzso zzso injury in zzso mice is not followed by zzso zzso
