zzso zzso variations due to the presence of iron in neural tissue can result in a shift of local resonance frequency, decreased zzso resulting from water diffusion through local field zzso and line broadening due to field zzso within a zzso In this study, modified spin echo phase contrast pulse sequences were used to map zzso resonance line zzso in zzso and in zzso In zzso gels containing varying zzso of zzso zzso line broadening mechanisms permitted accurate spatial zzso of iron deposits from measurement of local resonance line zzso Furthermore, line zzso estimated from the data were strongly correlated with iron zzso indicating the potential quantitative applications of the zzso The technique was applied clinically to map iron in zzso brain zzso These data suggest that resonance line zzso may be a useful measure of brain iron zzso
