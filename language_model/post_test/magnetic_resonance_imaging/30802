Few studies have investigated the internal processes involved in zzso bond formation, particularly where zzso and hydrated zzso contribute jointly to bond zzso This paper reports the first study to zzso map the internal environment within a developing zzso bond, zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso to measure zzso water zzso zzso zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso zzso to estimate zzso zzso In a model zzso bond formed between an zzso zzso and zzso zzso characteristic profiles were observed in which zzso zzso showed a region of increasing zzso concentration in the zzso layer region adjacent to the zzso corresponding closely with a zone of restricted water zzso in the diffusion zzso These regions extended 144 zzso (a normal human gastric layer thickness zzso zzso 95 zzso zzso into the zzso layer after just 30 zzso increasing to 800 zzso after 30 zzso The formation of a hydrated zzso layer at the zzso surface, confirmed zzso was also reflected in corresponding zzso zzso The results suggest a progressive zzso of the zzso gel during bond formation, and the study demonstrates how together, these zzso can provide zzso zzso spatial and zzso evidence of internal zzso zzso during zzso bond zzso
