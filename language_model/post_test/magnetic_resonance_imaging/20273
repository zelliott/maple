Previous zzso studies using magnetic resonance imaging zzso have revealed structural brain abnormalities in obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the zzso in brain structure of patients with zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Sixteen patients with zzso free of zzso major depression, and 32 zzso and zzso healthy subjects underwent zzso using a zzso MR zzso zzso severity was assessed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were zzso zzso and segmented using the zzso package zzso zzso analysis was performed using statistical zzso mapping zzso 

zzso reductions in regional gray matter volume were detected in the left zzso anterior zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso zzso in the patients with zzso as compared to healthy controls zzso P zzso zzso No significant differences in white matter volumes were observed in any brain regions of the zzso No significant correlation between zzso zzso zzso score and regional gray matter or white matter volume was zzso 

Regional gray matter zzso in the zzso zzso cortex, which is suggested to play a role in zzso cognitive zzso may be related to the zzso in zzso
