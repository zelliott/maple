zzso image guided zzso systems are rapidly becoming incorporated into routine zzso zzso In our unit, the zzso Viewing zzso has been applied to a comprehensive range of zzso procedures, including zzso zzso zzso skull base, zzso and zzso zzso The system allows a minimally invasive surgical exposure and provides instant and continual navigational information during zzso zzso studies have shown this zzso information to facilitate the zzso perception of zzso relations and identification of structures, thus improving surgical zzso Furthermore, in comparison to traditional zzso zzso the zzso system has been reported to reduce operative zzso The technology involves the use of a zzso mechanical arm to which a zzso or biopsy probe is zzso This zzso arm is hand-held and is therefore only as steady as the zzso zzso This zzso the use of the Viewing zzso for functional procedures and for the safe biopsy of small, zzso zzso zzso Both types of procedures are very dependent on a steady linear approach to the target for a successful zzso We have designed a simple guidance device that eliminates the risk of unwanted drift or angular movements of the probe as it is advanced toward the zzso When used with the Viewing zzso this device guides the wand biopsy probe along a predetermined, fixed linear trajectory to the zzso zzso We report the successful use of the fixed trajectory guidance device zzso with the zzso Viewing zzso in a series of 12 zzso
