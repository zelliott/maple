This study sought to analyze whether cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso can detect and zzso zzso damage in the early stages of zzso in muscular zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a genetic disease that involves skeletal and cardiac zzso of zzso zzso is common, and death secondary to cardiac or respiratory diseases occurs early in zzso zzso magnetic resonance is a reliable method for assessing global and regional cardiac function, allowing also for the detection of zzso zzso zzso 

Ten patients with zzso or Becker zzso were studied by zzso Physical examination, zzso disease zzso tests, zzso chest zzso total zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also obtained in all zzso 

Patients with zzso had a lower ejection fraction than those zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso was observed in 7 of the 10 patients, and the lateral wall was the most commonly involved zzso There was moderate correlation between zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance can identify zzso and may be useful for detecting the early stages of zzso in zzso Future work will be needed to evaluate whether zzso can influence zzso and zzso
