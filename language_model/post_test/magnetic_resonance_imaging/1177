The anterior zzso zzso zzso has diverse functions and several functional zzso This study implemented a counting zzso task that presented zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimuli at two speeds to probe zzso zzso and zzso zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso healthy subjects completed the task twice: once outside the scanner while heart rate zzso zzso was recorded and once during zzso In both sessions, subjects completed two zzso zzso were presented every zzso s in one run and every zzso s in the zzso zzso data analysis revealed two important zzso First, by computing differential zzso between zzso and zzso zzso a cluster of zzso related to response zzso was observed in the left zzso Additionally, by calculating the interaction of speed with stimulus zzso a cluster of zzso was observed in the left zzso This zzso correlated significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and P zzso zzso for zzso and represents the zzso zzso role of the zzso This study supports the notion of functional subdivisions within the zzso and links the processes of cognitive interference and zzso zzso with zzso in specific zzso of the zzso a structure that is critical for the interface between zzso and zzso
