zzso zzso zzso zzso have been reported to offer a sensitivity to sample structure at a specific zzso length scale down to the order of 10 zzso When assessing this novel contrast mechanism in controlled phantom experiments, we have observed three different mechanisms zzso residual zzso zzso zzso arising from intense high spatial zzso zzso echoes and strong zzso zzso zzso can produce significant changes in signal contrast at particular length zzso These changes which only appear when components arising from zzso and zzso are both present in the detected zzso are similar to changes previously attributed to zzso zzso We demonstrate each mechanism by which these residual zzso arise and describe methods for their zzso
