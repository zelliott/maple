To explore the labeling efficiency and cellular viability of rabbit zzso labeled with different zzso of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso and to determine the feasibility of zzso labeled stem cells with MR zzso 

The zzso were collected from zzso zzso of 10 adult rabbits (weighing zzso zzso and zzso The zzso compound by different ratios mixed with zzso therefore, the final concentration of zzso was 150 zzso zzso 100 zzso B), 50 zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso zzso per zzso respectively, the 3rd generation zzso culture medium was added to zzso zzso cells served as a control zzso zzso MR imaging of cell suspensions was performed by using zzso and zzso sequences at a clinical zzso T zzso zzso 

zzso were efficiently labeled with zzso labeled zzso particles were stained in all zzso of groups A, B, C and zzso With the increasing of zzso zzso blue dye particles zzso The zzso result was negative in group zzso The cell viability in groups A, B, C, D and E was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There were statistically significant differences between groups A, B and groups C, D and E zzso zzso zzso and between group A and group B zzso zzso zzso zzso images had no specific difference among 5 groups, zzso images decreased significantly in groups A, B, C, decreased slightly in group D, and had little change in group zzso The zzso signal zzso of groups A, B, C, D and E were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, showing significant difference between groups A, B, C, D and group E zzso zzso zzso and between groups A, B, C and group D zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can be easily and efficiently labeled by zzso without interference on the cell viability in labeled concentration of zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso of zzso labeled zzso is zzso which may be critical for future experimental zzso
