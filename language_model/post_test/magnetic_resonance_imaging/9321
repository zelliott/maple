To zzso assess the value of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and MR zzso combined with the zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio for detecting prostate cancer in men with elevated zzso zzso 

The institutional review board approved the study, and all patients provided informed written zzso zzso MR imaging and MR zzso were performed in 54 patients with zzso levels greater than 3 zzso but less than 15 zzso and zzso zzso ratio of less than zzso followed by zzso biopsy in the peripheral zzso For each patient, MR imaging and MR zzso findings, zzso level, and zzso zzso ratio were analyzed and compared with biopsy results and/or zzso tumor maps with regard to a zzso zzso The likelihood of cancer in each zzso according to MR and MR zzso findings was graded independently on a scale of 1 zzso to 5 zzso zzso accuracy and a zzso zzso zzso analysis were used to determine the most accurate combination of imaging, and clinical tests were used to detect prostate cancer according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso 

The model incorporating MR imaging, MR zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso was significantly more accurate in predicting prostate cancer than models using MR imaging alone zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso MR zzso alone zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or MR imaging and zzso zzso ratio combined zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

MR and MR zzso combined with zzso zzso ratio improves the zzso value for prostate cancer zzso
