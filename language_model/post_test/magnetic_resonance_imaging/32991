zzso necrosis in the brain commonly occurs in three distinct clinical scenarios, zzso radiation therapy for head and neck zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso radiation therapy (including zzso for brain zzso and radiation therapy for primary brain zzso zzso of the radiation treatment plan, amount of brain tissue included in the radiation port, type of radiation, location of the primary zzso and amount of time elapsed since radiation therapy is extremely important in determining whether the imaging zzso represents radiation necrosis or zzso zzso Conventional magnetic resonance zzso imaging findings of these two entities overlap zzso and even at zzso analysis, tumor mixed with radiation necrosis is a common zzso Advanced imaging zzso such as diffusion zzso imaging and zzso MR imaging (with calculation of certain specific parameters such as apparent diffusion zzso ratios, relative peak zzso and percentage of signal zzso MR zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be useful in zzso between zzso tumor and radiation zzso In everyday practice, the visual assessment of zzso and zzso images may also be helpful by favoring one diagnosis over the other, with restricted diffusion and an elevated relative cerebral blood volume being seen much more frequently in zzso tumor than in radiation zzso
