Parallel imaging is one of the most promising developments in recent years for the acceleration of MR zzso One area of practical importance where different parallel imaging methods perform differently is the manner in which they deal with zzso in the zzso reconstructed zzso It has been reported that sensitivity zzso zzso reconstruction fails whenever the reconstructed zzso is smaller than the object being zzso On the other hand, generalized zzso partially parallel acquisition zzso has been used successfully to reconstruct images with zzso in the reconstructed zzso as in conventional zzso The disparate behavior of these methods can be easily demonstrated by a few simple illustrative zzso Additional in zzso examples using zzso and modified zzso zzso make this distinction zzso These experiments demonstrate that zzso fails to reconstruct correct images when zzso sensitivity maps are used that do not automatically account for the object size and therefore the zzso in the reconstructed zzso However, with the use of zzso high-resolution zzso sensitivity zzso accurate zzso reconstructions can be zzso On the other hand, zzso produces images with an zzso appearance that is exactly as would be expected from normal zzso zzso An understanding of these effects could potentially lead to fewer zzso zzso as well as a better understanding of the differences between the underlying reconstruction zzso
