To zzso evaluate the function and anatomy of the right zzso in Boxer dogs with zzso 

Five adult Boxer dogs with zzso and 5 healthy zzso zzso zzso

RV ejection fraction was significantly lower in zzso with zzso compared with the controls zzso zzso 11 control zzso 10, P zzso zzso There was an RV aneurysm in 1 dog with zzso but not in any of the zzso RV zzso gross fatty changes were not observed in dogs of either zzso
