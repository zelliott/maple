zzso results of zzso artery zzso zzso for zzso are largely zzso We assess long-term outcome of zzso in 40 women with zzso 

Between March 1999 and October 2006, 40 consecutive women with zzso zzso in combination with zzso were treated with zzso Changes in junction zone thickness were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging zzso at baseline and again at 3 zzso After a mean clinical follow-up of 65 months zzso 58 zzso zzso women filled out the zzso zzso symptom and quality of life zzso zzso which had additional questions on the long-term evolution of baseline symptoms and adverse zzso 

During zzso 7 of 40 women zzso underwent zzso Among these 7 women, the junction zones were significantly zzso both at baseline zzso 23 zzso 16 zzso P zzso zzso and at zzso follow-up zzso 15 zzso 9 zzso P zzso zzso Of 33 women with preserved zzso 29 were zzso Four patients had symptom severity scores of 50 to 85 and overall zzso scores of 60 to 66, indicating substantial clinical zzso There was no relation between clinical outcome and the initial presence of zzso in addition to zzso 

In women with zzso zzso zzso resulted in long-term preservation of the zzso in the zzso Most patients with preserved zzso were zzso The only predictor for zzso during follow-up was initial thickness of the junction zzso The presence or absence of zzso in addition to zzso had no relation with the need for zzso or clinical zzso
