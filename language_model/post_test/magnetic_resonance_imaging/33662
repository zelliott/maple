The authors propose a new imaging approach for studying zzso great vessels, using high-speed MR imaging combined with intravenous rapid zzso injection of a zzso contrast zzso The decrease of the zzso relaxation time of flowing blood induced by the contrast agent zzso caused an increased signal intensity within the vessel zzso for a time period allowing zzso imaging of various vascular zzso The zzso signal enhancement is mainly related to the blood concentration of the contrast agent as in conventional X-ray zzso Information on the zzso and pulmonary arteries obtained by the so-called zzso magnetic resonance zzso appears complementary to that obtained with other vascular MR imaging procedures such as zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso
