zzso resonance imaging zzso is the newest evaluation procedure to be applied to the identification and study of zzso zzso offers the sensitivity of zzso but with far greater zzso The differentiation of zzso from zzso can be made with greater accuracy than with zzso and zzso allows the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso and soft tissue zzso with the reliability of zzso zzso Areas adjacent to metallic fixation devices show some signal loss but the distortion is less than with zzso zzso There is no risk to the patient caused by imaging with the fixation devices in zzso The major problem in zzso use today is its relatively high cost, although it is less expensive than the combination of nuclear medicine studies often employed for the study of zzso
