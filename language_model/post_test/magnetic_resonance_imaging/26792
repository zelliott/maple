Previous human imaging studies used facial stimuli to explore the potential association between depression and zzso This study aimed at investigating brain zzso in a zzso model of depression when innate fear was induced in the form of the zzso odor zzso zzso zzso sensitive line zzso rats, a genetic animal model of depression, and their control counterpart zzso resistant line zzso were used in this functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso rats exhibited greater zzso zzso in the cortical zzso and zzso in the prefrontal zzso in response to zzso suggesting zzso dysfunction in the depressed zzso In addition, the zzso in the insular zzso in zzso rats may be the basis for enhanced zzso responses to fear and zzso in zzso These results are evidence for the value of zzso models of depression in expanding understanding of the neural zzso zzso common human zzso like depression and zzso
