To describe the potential and limitations of selective zzso calcium stimulation and zzso zzso sampling zzso in the evaluation of patients with zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive adult patients with documented zzso zzso undergoing an zzso test and zzso confirmed diagnosis were zzso 

By zzso 24 patients were found to have an zzso two had zzso cell zzso and one had zzso neuroendocrine zzso of the zzso zzso correctly predicted the source of excessive insulin zzso in 26 of 27 zzso zzso zzso In two patients with an zzso zzso had to be repeated for correct zzso in one patient with a zzso zzso zzso was falsely zzso In one patient, a falsely negative zzso test was caused by zzso zzso in another patient a falsely negative zzso test occurred because of extraordinarily high baseline insulin levels when the calcium stimulation was zzso CT and/or MR imaging correctly predicted the source of excessive insulin zzso in 59% of patients, the sensitivity of the zzso exploration was zzso 

In the zzso experience, the zzso test is superior to zzso imaging and even the zzso exploration in identifying the source of excessive insulin zzso in patients with zzso zzso To prevent false negative zzso tests, medications with an influence on insulin zzso have to be discontinued prior to zzso and two baseline blood samples should be obtained before the calcium stimulation is zzso
