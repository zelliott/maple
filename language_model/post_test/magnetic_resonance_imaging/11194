zzso resonance imaging was used to measure the zzso and zzso volumes of 60 chimpanzees zzso zzso An asymmetry zzso zzso was then used to calculate the asymmetry for each of the zzso A zzso zzso test indicated that there was a zzso right zzso asymmetry for the zzso There was no significant zzso asymmetry for the zzso An analysis of zzso using sex and rearing history as zzso variables showed no significant main effects or interaction effects on the zzso zzso however, males were more strongly zzso than zzso Several of these findings are consistent with results found in the human zzso
