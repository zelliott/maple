The perception of our limbs in space is built upon the integration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that these signals are combined in areas of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, it remains to be determined whether zzso populations in these areas integrate hand signals according to basic zzso and spatial zzso principles of zzso zzso Here, we developed a setup based on advanced zzso video technology that allowed us to manipulate the zzso relationships of zzso zzso stimuli delivered on a healthy human zzso real hand during zzso and investigate the ensuing neural and zzso zzso Our experiments revealed two novel zzso First, we found responses in zzso zzso and zzso regions that were dependent upon the spatial and zzso zzso of VT zzso This zzso integration effect required a simultaneous match between the seen and felt postures of the hand, which suggests that zzso zzso signals from the upper limb are essential for successful VT zzso Second, we observed that zzso conflicts significantly disrupted the default feeling of ownership of the seen real zzso as zzso by complementary zzso zzso and zzso zzso The degree to which zzso was impaired could be predicted from the zzso of neural responses in key zzso zzso These results zzso the neural bases of the integration of zzso hand signals according to basic zzso principles and demonstrate that the disintegration of these signals leads to zzso of the seen real zzso
