We compared zzso zzso parameters zzso blood zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso administration in six healthy human subjects studied with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso simultaneously to investigate whether zzso could measure in zzso zzso in the brain tissue zzso zzso with the PET zzso zzso zzso were performed at the forehead with four different zzso spacing from 2 zzso to 5 zzso Total zzso and oxygen zzso zzso measured by zzso significantly increased after administration of zzso at any zzso spacing in all zzso In PET study, zzso and zzso were estimated in the following three volumes of interest zzso determined on magnetic resonance images, zzso scalp and skull, zzso gray matter region, zzso gray and white matter zzso zzso treatment elevated zzso and zzso significantly in zzso and zzso but zzso zzso zzso was more strongly correlated with zzso counterpart in zzso and zzso when the zzso spacing was above 4 zzso although optical signal from cerebral tissue could be caught with any zzso zzso As to increase of the zzso 4 zzso of zzso spacing correlated best with zzso To support the result of zzso experiment, we also estimated the contribution ratios of zzso tissue to observed zzso change based on diffusion zzso The contribution ratios at 4 zzso were estimated as zzso zzso zzso zzso 791 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso with 4 zzso of zzso spacing could measure cerebral zzso responses zzso and zzso
