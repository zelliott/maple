zzso in zzso syndrome is accompanied by zzso and zzso pathology the distribution of which replicates pathological features of Alzheimer's zzso With advancing age, an increasing proportion of zzso syndrome subjects zzso years old develop progressive cognitive zzso resembling the cognitive profile of Alzheimer's zzso Based on these findings, zzso syndrome has been proposed as a model to study the zzso stages of Alzheimer's zzso Using an interactive anatomical zzso technique and zzso zzso of zzso we showed recently that zzso zzso syndrome adults had significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso and corpus zzso sizes with increasing zzso In this study, we applied the automated and objective technique of zzso zzso implemented in zzso to the analysis of structural zzso from 27 zzso zzso syndrome adults zzso age zzso years, 15 zzso Regional zzso matter volume was decreased with advancing age in bilateral zzso zzso zzso the zzso and inferior zzso zzso bilateral frontal zzso with left side predominance zzso middle frontal zzso left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso right zzso and left zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso The reductions were unrelated to zzso zzso volume or general cognitive zzso Grey matter volume was relatively preserved in zzso zzso zzso regions, the zzso surface of the brain zzso zzso and anterior zzso and the anterior zzso zzso Our findings suggest zzso matter reductions in zzso and association zzso in the zzso stage of zzso zzso The most likely zzso of these changes is zzso or loss of zzso and zzso zzso due to Alzheimer's zzso zzso
