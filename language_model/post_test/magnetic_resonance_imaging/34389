The zzso lobe and associated structures have been previously implicated in the zzso of zzso This study was designed to assess the potential influence of gender on the zzso of zzso lobe structures, including the superior zzso zzso and the zzso complex, in patients with schizophrenia and to examine whether schizophrenic patients differ zzso in these structures from comparison zzso 

zzso resonance imaging was used to measure the volume of zzso lobe structures, including the superior zzso zzso the zzso complex, and the zzso lobe zzso the volumes of the superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two comparison zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso 36 male and 23 female patients with schizophrenia and 19 male and 18 female comparison zzso 

There was a significant main effect of diagnosis in the superior zzso zzso and the zzso complex, with smaller volumes in patients than in comparison zzso There was a significant zzso interaction for zzso lobe zzso zzso lobe volume on the left was significantly smaller in male patients than in male comparison zzso Female patients and female comparison subjects demonstrated no significant difference in zzso lobe zzso There were no statistically significant gender interactions for the superior zzso zzso the zzso complex, or the comparison zzso 

These findings suggest that there may be a unique interaction between gender and the zzso processes that lead to altered zzso lobe volume in patients with zzso
