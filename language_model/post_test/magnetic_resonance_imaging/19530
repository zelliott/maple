zzso in patients suffering from spontaneous zzso of the knee zzso may be reduced by high zzso zzso zzso However, the fate of the zzso zzso is unknown and needs further zzso We conducted a prospective study to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging zzso changes after operative and zzso zzso Ten consecutive patients suffering from zzso of the zzso compartment were given two treatment options: either zzso zzso zzso 6) or conservative treatment with partial weight bearing for 3 months zzso zzso zzso We measured the greatest extent of zzso zzso low signal intensity zzso considered to represent zzso and the surrounding area of intermediate signal intensity, considered to represent zzso bone zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso images before and after zzso The zzso follow-up period was zzso months zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso months zzso zzso in the zzso zzso At follow-up the zzso evaluation revealed a decrease in the low signal intense areas zzso in five of the six patients in the zzso zzso Only one of the four zzso patients showed a decrease in the low signal intense zzso The intermediate intense areas zzso decreased in all patients in the zzso group and in three of four in the zzso zzso The mean decrease in the area of zzso zzso was significantly greater in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant difference was found for the area of necrosis between the two groups zzso zzso zzso A clinical improvement was observed in all patients of the zzso group but in only two of the four patients of the zzso zzso We conclude that the decrease in zzso bone zzso zzso seems to be associated with improved patient zzso The zzso appearance of the zzso zzso does not alter with either treatment zzso
