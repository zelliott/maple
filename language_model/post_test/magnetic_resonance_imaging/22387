High altitude pulmonary zzso zzso is a rapidly zzso zzso zzso that occurs in individuals who travel to high zzso The difficulties associated with making zzso zzso in humans who are ill or at high zzso along with the idiosyncratic nature of the disease and lack of appropriate animal models, has meant that our understanding of the mechanism of zzso is incomplete, despite considerable zzso zzso zzso studies at altitude in zzso subjects have shown that mechanical stress-related damage to the pulmonary blood gas barrier likely precedes the development of zzso Although zzso individuals have increased pulmonary zzso pressure in zzso how this high pressure is transmitted to the zzso has been zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging of pulmonary blood flow, we have been able to show that regional pulmonary blood flow in zzso subjects becomes more zzso when they are exposed to zzso zzso This is not observed in individuals who have not had zzso providing novel data supporting earlier suggestions by zzso that uneven hypoxic pulmonary zzso is an important feature of those who develop zzso This brief review discusses how uneven hypoxic pulmonary zzso increases regional pulmonary zzso pressure leading to stress failure of pulmonary zzso and zzso We zzso that, in addition to the well-documented increase in pulmonary vascular pressure in zzso individuals, increased zzso zzso in zzso results in lung regions that are vulnerable to increased mechanical zzso
