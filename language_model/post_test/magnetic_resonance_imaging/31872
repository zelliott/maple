The purpose of this work was to study the feasibility of incorporating functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso information for intensity modulated zzso zzso treatment planning of brain zzso Three zzso patients were zzso zzso for zzso zzso with additional zzso zzso The zzso of each patient was acquired using a bilateral zzso paradigm with a zzso echo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso data were processed using the Analysis of zzso zzso zzso software package for determining zzso volumes, and the volumes were fused with the simulation zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in left and right primary motor zzso zzso were contoured as critical structures for zzso zzso The goal of zzso was to minimize the zzso dose to the zzso volumes in the zzso regions, while maintaining a similar coverage to the planning target volume zzso and keeping critical structures within accepted dose zzso zzso zzso of the treatment plans with and without considering the zzso information were zzso zzso angles adjustment or additional beams were needed for 2 cases to meet the planning zzso Mean dose to the zzso and zzso zzso was significantly reduced by zzso and zzso respectively, for 1 zzso For the other 2 patients, mean dose to zzso zzso region was lowered by zzso and zzso In general, zzso zzso can reduce the zzso dose to the zzso regions without compromising the zzso coverage or sparing of other critical zzso In conclusion, it is feasible to incorporate the zzso information into the zzso treatment zzso zzso planning allows a significant reduction in zzso dose to the zzso regions, especially if the region does not lie within the zzso
