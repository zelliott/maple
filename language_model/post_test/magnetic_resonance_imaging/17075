The zzso effect of many zzso zzso contrast agents changes in response to a molecular zzso However, other molecular zzso or environmental factors can influence zzso so that a change in zzso is not conclusive proof for detecting the zzso To overcome this problem, a second control zzso effect may be included in the same zzso agent, which is responsive to all factors that alter the first zzso effect except for the zzso to be zzso To investigate this approach, a zzso zzso contrast agent was developed with one zzso effect that is responsive to zzso zzso activity and a second control zzso zzso The ratio of the two zzso effects was independent of concentration and zzso relaxation, so that this agent was zzso with respect to these zzso This zzso method was dependent on temperature and was influenced by MR zzso as the chemical exchange rates approached the chemical shifts of the zzso zzso as temperature was zzso The two zzso effects also showed evidence of having different pH zzso so that this agent was not zzso with respect to zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso contrast agent can more accurately detect a molecular zzso such as zzso zzso activity, as long as temperature and pH are within an acceptable zzso range and remain zzso
