To test whether zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso reveals changes in the zzso content of the zzso muscle zzso and zzso muscle zzso of a patient with unilateral isolated zzso of the right zzso 

zzso was performed on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lipids inside zzso and zzso were assessed in both calves of the patient by a zzso zzso echo acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared to a control group of four healthy zzso 

Total amount of muscular lipids in the zzso zzso of the patient was clearly increased compared to the controls zzso versus zzso zzso while zzso lipids of the adjacent zzso were lower compared to the zzso healthy zzso 

zzso lipids are zzso for metabolism and can be assessed zzso by zzso zzso is considered to be a helpful tool in clinical assessment of muscle metabolism in cases with muscular zzso or zzso
