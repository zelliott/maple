Very little is known about the neural zzso guiding anger, angry zzso and aggressive zzso In the present zzso experiment, participants were zzso and induced to zzso zzso in the zzso anterior zzso zzso was positively related to zzso feelings of anger and individual differences in general zzso zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso was related to zzso zzso and individual differences in displaced zzso Increased zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso following the provocation predicted subsequent zzso zzso These findings increase our understanding of the neural processes associated with the risk for aggressive behavior by specifying neural regions that mediate the zzso experience of anger and angry zzso as well as the neural pathways linked to different types of aggressive zzso
