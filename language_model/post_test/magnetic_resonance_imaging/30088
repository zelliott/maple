To better understand zzso zzso the authors performed a prospective study in which they used findings from serial clinical and magnetic resonance zzso imaging examinations performed before and after zzso zzso to establish the time course of zzso zzso 

zzso clinical examinations and cervical MR imaging were performed in 29 consecutive patients with zzso zzso Type I zzso and zzso before surgery, 1 week, and 3-6 months after surgery, and then zzso Time to narrowing of the zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso following surgery was calculated using the zzso zzso 

All zzso decreased in diameter and length zzso of zzso on MR images at 3-6 months, 1 year, and 2 years or zzso The zzso diameter decreased from zzso zzso zzso zzso preoperatively to zzso zzso at last evaluation zzso The median time to zzso narrowing was zzso months following zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso After surgery zzso of patients had improved symptoms, but symptoms resolved incompletely in zzso of zzso 52 and 59% of patients had residual zzso and sensory loss, zzso Clinical improvement occurred before partial or complete disappearance of the zzso on MR zzso Patient age, duration of symptoms, sex, zzso zzso diameter, and length of zzso were unrelated to time to zzso zzso 

Most patients improve after zzso for zzso but many have residual zzso zzso may continue to diminish for months to years after surgical zzso A collapsed zzso zzso of zzso of the spinal zzso indicates that the zzso has been reversed by treatment regardless of the zzso of elimination of the cavity on MR zzso
