When people listen to music, they often move their body in time with the zzso However, people differ widely in their tendency to zzso a zzso Why? Here we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with a timing task that is diagnostic of individual differences in beat perception and compared the brain activity of individuals who readily perceive an implied beat with those who do zzso zzso in auditory and motor areas was correlated with individual differences in beat perception, even when participants performed a timing task in which no behavioral differences zzso The results support two zzso First, a bias toward beat perception is zzso by the zzso of cortical circuits involved in rhythm zzso Second, some individuals more readily engage these cortical zzso circuits when making timing judgments than do zzso
