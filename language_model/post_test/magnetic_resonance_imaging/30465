This study examines whether zzso attention to biologically based social cues engages neural mechanisms distinct from those engaged by zzso to zzso based zzso zzso Participants viewed a zzso ambiguous stimulus presented centrally while performing a target detection zzso By having participants alternate between viewing this stimulus as an eye in profile or an zzso we were able to directly compare the neural mechanisms of zzso zzso to social and zzso cues while holding the physical stimulus zzso The functional magnetic resonance imaging results indicated that zzso zzso to both eye gaze and zzso cues engaged extensive zzso and zzso zzso zzso Eye gaze cues, however, more vigorously engaged two regions in the zzso frontal zzso associated with zzso zzso to salient or meaningful zzso as well as lateral zzso zzso An zzso potential study demonstrated that this enhanced zzso response was attributable to a zzso sensory gain effect for targets appearing at locations cued by eye gaze than for those cued by an zzso These results endorse the hypothesis that differences in attention to social and zzso cues are quantitative rather than zzso running counter to current models that assume enhanced processing for social stimuli reflects the involvement of a unique network of brain zzso An intriguing implication of the present study is the possibility that our ability to orient zzso and zzso to socially irrelevant zzso including zzso may have arisen as a useful zzso of a system that developed first, and foremost, to promote social zzso to stimuli that are biologically zzso
