In patients with idiopathic normal pressure zzso zzso zzso and narrowed zzso spaces at the high zzso appear in magnetic resonance zzso images before the occurrence of objective zzso In addition, quantitative regional cerebral blood flow zzso has been reported to be reduced in zzso patients with objective zzso To determine whether reduced zzso is responsible for the appearance of symptoms, we compared zzso in patients with suspected zzso with no objective zzso symptoms zzso zzso patients with apparent objective zzso symptoms zzso and normal control subjects zzso Regional zzso was zzso in 35 zzso zzso by zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso Multiple comparisons showed that, in all brain regions examined except for in the frontal white matter, zzso in the zzso group was significantly lower than that in the NC group, but in all brain regions, not significantly different from that of the zzso zzso These results suggest that factors other than zzso in the resting state are responsible for the occurrence of objective symptoms of zzso
