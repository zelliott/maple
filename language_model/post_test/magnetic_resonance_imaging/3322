It is debated whether functional divisions between structures in the zzso zzso lobe zzso in particular the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are best zzso according to memory process (Diana et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso or stimulus category zzso et zzso zzso In the former account, zzso is critical for item familiarity but not recollection of associations between items and their contexts (which is instead dependent upon the zzso zzso et zzso zzso In the latter theory, complex object representations in zzso are capable of supporting memory for objects as well as for zzso associations, particularly when there is a demand to discriminate between highly visually similar objects zzso et zzso zzso To zzso between these accounts, human participants were scanned while making two different judgments about visually presented objects (is the object common or zzso or does the object have more edges or zzso In a zzso zzso retrieval phase, participants made item zzso followed by context zzso zzso judgments about previously seen and novel zzso zzso activity at zzso was separated according to the accuracy of the retrieval zzso zzso activity predicted successful zzso judgments, a result that remained when zzso strength was zzso across objects for which the context was remembered or zzso These data imply that the function of zzso goes beyond processing zzso memory information, contributing additionally to memory for zzso associations when the stimuli are objects zzso et zzso zzso
