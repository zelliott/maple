In magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the oral and maxillofacial region, where large amounts of fat are normally present, the high signal intensity of fat on zzso images zzso and the zzso artifact have limited the utility of zzso contrast zzso zzso fat signal by zzso techniques can increase the value of zzso zzso The present study was designed to evaluate the utility and role of zzso imaging for fat suppression in the detection of oral and maxillofacial zzso in 22 patients (17 with zzso tumors, two with benign tumors, and three with zzso The depiction of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso was compared with that of conventional zzso and zzso zzso and zzso on a zzso scale zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso grade, zzso were significantly superior to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were particularly beneficial in the detection of central necrosis or zzso invasion of zzso neck zzso zzso as well as in defining the zzso extent at zzso areas such as the bone zzso or zzso These findings demonstrated that the zzso technique is extremely useful in the zzso of oral and maxillofacial zzso without increase of the scan time or image zzso zzso
