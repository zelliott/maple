There is much current debate about the existence of mirror zzso in zzso To identify mirror zzso in the inferior frontal zzso zzso of humans, we used a repetition suppression paradigm while measuring neural activity with functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso either executed or observed a series of zzso Here we show that in the zzso responses were suppressed both when an executed action was followed by the same rather than a different observed action and when an observed action was followed by the same rather than a different executed zzso This pattern of responses is consistent with that predicted by mirror zzso and is evidence of mirror zzso in the human zzso
