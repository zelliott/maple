zzso MR zzso has revealed impaired zzso integrity in the motor zzso of patients with zzso lateral sclerosis zzso We hypothesized that the zzso zzso zzso ratios in the motor zzso and adjacent brain could reflect the therapeutic effectiveness of zzso zzso treatment in zzso 

Eight patients with ALS underwent MR zzso before and zzso days zzso zzso after starting zzso In 10 patients with ALS who were not treated with zzso paired zzso were obtained zzso days zzso zzso zzso Fourteen healthy subjects underwent a single MR zzso zzso The zzso ratio was measured in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso the supplementary motor area, and the zzso zzso 

The zzso ratio was decreased in the zzso and zzso zzso of patients with ALS compared with healthy zzso In those with zzso the change in the zzso ratio was not different between treated patients and zzso patients in any of the regions zzso 

No improvement in zzso integrity was detected in motor and zzso cerebral regions after zzso zzso This result agrees with that of prior investigations showing the zzso clinical effectiveness of zzso for ALS and supports the zzso of the zzso ratio as a surrogate of therapeutic zzso
