It is well established that the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso studies have yielded predominantly bilateral zzso zzso but the existence and nature of functionally specific contributions of left and right zzso have remained zzso In recent experiments, 2 independent parameters have been identified which substantially determine zzso 1) the degree of zzso between consecutive steps zzso zzso and 2) the degree to which the zzso of the goal state renders the order of single steps either clearly evident or ambiguous zzso zzso Thus, search depth affects the actual mental generation and evaluation of action zzso whereas goal hierarchy reflects the extraction of goal information from an encountered zzso Here, both parameters were independently manipulated in an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging study using the Tower of London zzso zzso revealed a double zzso as indicated by a significant crossover interaction of zzso and task zzso in left zzso zzso were stronger for higher demands on goal hierarchy than on search depth, whereas the reversed result emerged in right zzso In conclusion, often observed bilateral patterns of zzso zzso in complex tasks may reflect the zzso operation of specific cognitive processes that show opposing zzso
