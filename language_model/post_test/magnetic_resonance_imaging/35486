Recent advances in zzso technologies have allowed ever more detailed studies of the human zzso The combination of zzso techniques with zzso may provide a more sensitive measure of the influence of genetic zzso on cognitive function than zzso measures zzso Here we present a review of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of genetic links to executive functions, focusing on sustained attention, working memory and response zzso In addition to studies in the normal population, we also address findings from three clinical zzso zzso zzso and zzso spectrum zzso While the findings in the populations studied do not always zzso they all point to the usefulness of zzso techniques such as zzso as potential zzso for parsing the genetic zzso of executive zzso
