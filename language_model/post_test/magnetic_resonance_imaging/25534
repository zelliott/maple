zzso resonance zzso zzso is a promising diagnostic method that produces images with a contrast zzso to the elasticity of the zzso This study investigated using zzso the dependence of breast tissue elasticity from the zzso cycle of healthy zzso 

Five volunteers (age zzso without breast disease and contraceptive medication were examined once weekly over 2 zzso zzso zzso were performed with a zzso T magnet zzso Philips Medical Systems, Best, The zzso zzso mechanical waves (65 zzso were transmitted into the tissue by an zzso By means of a zzso zzso zzso mechanical waves were displayed within the phase of the MR image and phase images were used to reconstruct the local distribution of zzso The elasticity of zzso tissue and zzso breast tissue was analyzed individually, and the median and mean values of elasticity over the zzso cycle were zzso 

All volunteers presented a repeating pattern concerning the elasticity over the 2 zzso After 5 days of the onset of zzso the median value of elasticity for zzso zzso tissue declined significantly by zzso zzso zzso zzso After the second week of the cycle, zzso tissue showed again an increase in elasticity zzso zzso zzso The highest median values of elasticity were obtained during days 11 to 23 with an increase of up to zzso For zzso zzso only a slight and not significant variation of elasticity during the zzso cycle was zzso 

zzso is able to measure a dependence of tissue elasticity on the zzso zzso
