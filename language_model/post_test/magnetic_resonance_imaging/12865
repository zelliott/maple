Despite the extensive frontal zzso and behavioral zzso that characterizes behavioral zzso zzso zzso zzso many studies of early zzso suggest normal executive functioning zzso The current study examined cognitive control in patients with zzso who otherwise seemed cognitively zzso 

zzso included 7 patients with zzso with normal zzso test scores, 7 patients with zzso matched for zzso State zzso score but with impaired zzso test scores, and 14 normal zzso A zzso paradigm and other measures of zzso were administered to zzso A zzso zzso program was used to analyze structural zzso zzso 

On the zzso task, zzso analysis of zzso revealed a significant condition X diagnosis zzso Both zzso groups showed a larger zzso effect than normal controls, zzso they displayed disproportionately reduced speed and accuracy on zzso trials relative to zzso zzso Imaging data illustrated significant zzso zzso in patients with early zzso as compared with zzso 

Patients with behavioral zzso zzso zzso zzso who performed within normal limits on clinical tests of executive functioning demonstrated a select impairment on an experimental test of cognitive control, suggesting a subtle impairment in zzso attention or response to the irrelevant zzso zzso of zzso functioning sensitive to the zzso prefrontal zzso may be useful in early diagnosis of patients with zzso Our understanding of this syndrome may be increased by considering the efficiency of selective zzso a fundamental component of executive cognitive zzso
