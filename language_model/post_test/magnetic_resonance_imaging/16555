Few studies have investigated in zzso changes of the zzso zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso and zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso an at risk stage of zzso Even less is known about zzso of cortical projecting fiber tracts associated with zzso zzso zzso In this study, we determined regional zzso within the zzso zzso in 21 patients with zzso and 16 subjects with zzso compared to 20 healthy elderly subjects using zzso zzso of zzso zzso We assessed effects of zzso zzso zzso on fiber tracts derived from high-resolution diffusion zzso imaging zzso using zzso spatial zzso We localized significant effects relative to a map of zzso zzso in zzso standard space as determined from a zzso zzso Patients with zzso and zzso subjects showed reduced volumes in zzso zzso areas corresponding to anterior zzso and zzso intermediate and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as in the diagonal band of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso subjects were zzso more restricted than in zzso but occurred at similar zzso The volume of the right zzso zzso nucleus was correlated with zzso projecting fiber tract integrity such as the corpus zzso cingulate, and the superior zzso inferior zzso inferior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple zzso Our findings suggest that a zzso zzso approach is supportive to determine zzso of zzso zzso and its effect on zzso projecting fiber tracts in zzso
