In 26 patients with cardiac mass zzso confirmed by surgery, diagnostic imaging was performed preoperatively by means of two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso (12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso correctly identified the cardiac masses in all zzso zzso missed two of 12 cardiac zzso CT missed one of zzso zzso identified three of three cardiac zzso Although the sensitivity of two-dimensional zzso was high zzso all methods lacked zzso None of the methods allowed differentiation between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was successfully predicted by zzso imaging methods in all six zzso However, CT and zzso provided additional information concerning cardiac mural zzso zzso involvement, and zzso tumor extension, and should be integrated within a zzso imaging zzso Thus two-dimensional zzso is the method of choice for primary assessment of patients with suspected cardiac zzso Further zzso imaging by CT or zzso can be limited to patients with zzso suspected on the grounds of zzso zzso or other clinical zzso
