zzso learning techniques have been widely used to support the diagnosis of neurological diseases such as zzso Recent approaches zzso local intensity patterns within patches to derive zzso grading measures of zzso However, the relationships among these patches are usually zzso In addition, there is some ambiguity in assigning disease labels to the extracted zzso Not all of the patches extracted from patients with zzso are characteristic of zzso associated with zzso In this paper, we propose to use a multiple instance learning method to address the problem of assigning training labels to the zzso In addition, a graph is built for each image to exploit the relationships among these patches, which aids the zzso zzso We illustrate the proposed approach in an application for the detection of Alzheimer's disease zzso Using the baseline MR images of zzso subjects from the zzso study, the proposed method can achieve a zzso accuracy of zzso between zzso patients and healthy controls, and zzso between patients with stable zzso zzso zzso zzso and progressive zzso These results compare zzso with state-of-the-art zzso zzso
