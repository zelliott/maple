To investigate the reliability of magnetic resonance zzso zzso using heavily zzso very fast zzso sequences in imaging the upper urinary tract in patients with spinal zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso dysfunction secondary to spinal zzso may have gross spinal zzso which makes assessing the urinary tract extremely difficult by zzso or intravenous zzso The study included 50 patients zzso age 33 years, range zzso with a median zzso zzso angle of 60 zzso zzso No contrast medium was given but all patients received 20 zzso of intramuscular zzso zzso zzso before zzso 

Thirty-five patients had previous zzso during which only 42 zzso and no zzso were zzso Of the 94 zzso zzso zzso zzso all zzso and 86 zzso zzso There was good agreement amongst observers on assessing the zzso and zzso systems zzso zzso or zzso zzso but only moderate agreement on evaluating the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso There was disagreement on zzso vs zzso zzso zzso in 14 zzso zzso about no zzso vs zzso of the zzso system in 14 zzso systems and about no zzso vs zzso of the zzso in 20 zzso zzso The overall quality of the zzso images was rated zzso with a mean zzso score of zzso zzso 

zzso provides a reliable zzso technique for imaging the upper tract in patients who were previously difficult to zzso
