Performance in most complex cognitive and zzso tasks improves with training, yet the extent of improvement varies among zzso Is it possible to forecast the benefit that a person might reap from zzso Several behavioral measures have been used to predict individual differences in task improvement, but their zzso power is zzso Here we show that individual differences in patterns of zzso zzso zzso images in the zzso zzso recorded at the initial stage of training predict subsequent learning success in a complex video game with high zzso These predictions explained more than half of the zzso in learning success among individuals, suggesting that individual differences in zzso or persistent physiology predict whether and to what extent people will benefit from training in a complex zzso Surprisingly, predictions from white matter were highly accurate, while zzso in the gray matter of the zzso zzso did not contain any information about future training zzso zzso accuracy was higher in the anterior than the zzso half of the zzso zzso The link between zzso and the zzso zzso signal in the zzso zzso reaffirms the role of this part of the zzso zzso in learning and executive functions, such as zzso and task coordination zzso The ability to predict who will benefit from training by using zzso data collected in the early training phase may have far-reaching implications for the assessment of candidates for specific training programs as well as the study of populations that show deficiencies in learning new zzso
