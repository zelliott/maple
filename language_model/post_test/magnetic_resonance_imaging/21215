zzso study with magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

To document the distances between the major zzso vessels and the anterior zzso disc zzso to determine the effect of patient positioning on these zzso and to discuss ways to deal with vascular zzso 

It is well known that there are major vascular structures anterior to the lower zzso zzso zzso injury during zzso approaches, however, remains a zzso These anatomical relationships have not been determined in zzso and there are no data on the effect of turning the patient zzso and onto zzso 

A random sampling of 49 women and 48 men was zzso All examinations were performed in magnetic resonance scanners operating at zzso zzso zzso were made using electronic calipers on zzso zzso zzso Post hoc studies were done on a smaller number of patients, to determine the effect of prone zzso 

At the zzso level, zzso of the common zzso arteries in women and zzso of those in men were within 5 zzso of the anterior aspect of the disc zzso At zzso these numbers dropped to zzso for women and zzso for zzso No relationship between the age of the patient and the distance from disc space to blood vessel was zzso There was little change in these zzso between the zzso and prone zzso The use of bolsters to decompress the abdominal contents in the prone position did not significantly alter the zzso zzso zzso relationships were also zzso 

The lower zzso spine is confirmed to frequently be very close to the major zzso zzso Turning the patient prone and placing the patient on bolsters does not change this zzso This is part of the reason why vascular injuries may occur during routine zzso spine zzso zzso surgeons should be able to recognize and initiate treatment of such zzso
