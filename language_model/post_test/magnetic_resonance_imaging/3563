The prevalence of traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation in the elderly population has zzso however, no consensus has been reached regarding the management of shoulder zzso in elderly zzso 

This study investigated the clinical manifestations of traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation in patients older than 60 years and evaluated the functional outcomes of different treatment zzso based on associated abnormalities and the number of zzso 

Case series; Level of evidence, zzso 

zzso patients older than 60 at the time of primary shoulder dislocation were zzso zzso resonance imaging or zzso was performed on all patients to confirm associated zzso zzso patients were treated for primary shoulder dislocation and 15 for zzso zzso 

zzso examinations revealed no associated injuries in 31 patients with primary shoulder zzso these patients recovered shoulder function after rehabilitation (American zzso and zzso Surgeons zzso zzso 93 zzso 6; zzso zzso 89 zzso zzso For the other 36 patients, 33 were found to have rotator cuff tears zzso cuff tears in zzso and 3 were found to have an isolated zzso zzso The average zzso score of the 17 patients with primary shoulder dislocation who were treated zzso was 83 zzso 10, and the average zzso score was 78 zzso 13 at final zzso The average zzso score of patients with zzso shoulder dislocation was 89 zzso 9, and the average zzso score was 84 zzso zzso No statistically significant differences in functional shoulder outcomes between patients with primary and zzso dislocation were evident zzso zzso zzso However, patients who were treated zzso showed significantly better recovery of shoulder function than patients who were treated zzso regardless of the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso shoulder dislocation was observed in any patient during an average follow-up period of 55 zzso 

The accurate diagnosis of associated injuries after traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation in patients older than 60 is critical for the recovery of shoulder function because more than half of patients had rotator cuff tears or anterior zzso zzso which may lead to zzso shoulder zzso zzso clinical outcomes without recurrence were obtained after early detection of abnormalities and different treatment zzso based on associated injuries and the number of zzso zzso
