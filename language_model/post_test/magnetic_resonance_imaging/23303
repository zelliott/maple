Reliable detection of zzso changes in the brain in zzso induced by chronic low back pain may provide improved understanding of zzso mechanisms underlying the manifestation of chronic zzso In the present study, absolute zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured in three different pain processing cortical regions zzso zzso anterior zzso cortex, and zzso of ten patients with zzso chronic low back pain by means of zzso MR zzso zzso and compared to matched healthy zzso zzso decrease of zzso was observed in the anterior zzso zzso of zzso Patients also revealed a trend of decreasing zzso zzso in all investigated brain zzso zzso of zzso were observed in the patient group in anterior zzso and in anterior zzso cortex, whereas zzso was reduced in anterior zzso zzso and in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso may indicate zzso zzso zzso due to prolonged pain perception, whereas decrease of zzso and zzso may be ascribed to zzso and zzso cell zzso No significant changes were found for zzso The zzso evaluation of zzso brain data revealed a significantly decreased zzso volume of zzso zzso as well as a non significant trend for zzso volume increase in the anterior zzso of zzso
