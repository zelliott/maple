Older individuals show decline of prefrontal zzso zzso functions which may be related to altered zzso zzso We investigated the effects of aging and zzso stimulation in 15 young and 13 older healthy subjects on the neural zzso of interference control using zzso In a zzso zzso zzso design, subjects were measured after zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In each session, subjects performed a zzso interference task based on a zzso zzso Across age groups, interference zzso relative to zzso zzso was associated with zzso in the zzso motor area, zzso and zzso zzso Increased interference was found zzso in older zzso zzso zzso in left zzso zzso in young subjects and bilateral zzso activity in older subjects was observed to be associated with interference zzso Performance deteriorated under zzso only in young zzso This was accompanied by an increase of neural activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correction for multiple zzso zzso of performance under zzso in young subjects and the associated effect on zzso may indicate that zzso of the zzso system compromises interference zzso This supports the zzso model of neurotransmitter zzso
