Two distinct strategies have been suggested to support action selection in humans and other animals on the basis of experiential zzso a zzso strategy that generates decisions based on the value and zzso zzso of action zzso and a habitual strategy that relies on the automatic zzso of actions by environmental zzso In the present study, we investigated whether a similar zzso exists for actions that are acquired zzso through observation of other individuals rather than through direct experience, and assessed whether these strategies are zzso by distinct brain zzso We scanned participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed an zzso learning task designed to encourage either zzso zzso of the consequences of observed actions, or a mapping of observed actions to conditional zzso zzso zzso in different parts of the action observation network zzso between the two conditions during zzso learning and correlated with the degree of zzso to outcome devaluation in subsequent zzso Our findings suggest that, in striking parallel to experiential learning, neural systems zzso the zzso acquisition of actions may be zzso into distinct zzso a zzso zzso component and a less flexible zzso zzso
