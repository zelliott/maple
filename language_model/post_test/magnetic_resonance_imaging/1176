Prior imaging studies have failed to show zzso of the zzso zzso in response to emotionally neutral faces in individuals with zzso spectrum disorder zzso zzso et zzso Brain 124 (2001) zzso Schultz et zzso zzso zzso zzso 57 zzso zzso However, individuals with zzso do not typically exhibit the striking behavioral deficits that might be expected to result from zzso zzso damage, such as those seen in zzso and their deficits appear to extend well beyond face identification to include a wide range of zzso in social zzso zzso In this study, our goal was to further assess the question of whether individuals with zzso have abnormal zzso zzso zzso to zzso We used zzso (3 zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to study face perception in 11 adult individuals with zzso spectrum disorder zzso and 10 normal zzso We used face zzso object zzso and sensory control stimuli zzso scrambled versions of the face and object zzso containing a fixation point in the center to ensure that participants were looking at and attending to the images as they were zzso We found that individuals with zzso activated the zzso face area and other brain areas normally involved in face processing when they viewed faces as compared to zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso deficits encountered in zzso are not due to a simple dysfunction of the zzso area, but to more complex anomalies in the distributed network of brain areas involved in social perception and zzso
