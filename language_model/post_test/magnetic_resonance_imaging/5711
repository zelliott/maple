Although it is widely agreed that the zzso is necessary for learning and consolidation of new motor tasks, it is not known whether adaptation to zzso and dynamic errors is processed by the same zzso areas or whether different parts play a decisive zzso We investigated arm movements in a zzso zzso rotation and a force field zzso zzso task in 14 participants with zzso zzso and 14 zzso and zzso zzso zzso resonance images were used to calculate the volume of zzso areas zzso zzso and lateral zones of the anterior and zzso zzso and to identify zzso structure important for the two zzso zzso previous studies, zzso participants showed deficits in adaptation to both tasks compared with controls zzso zzso zzso However, it was not possible to draw conclusions from the performance in one task on the performance in the other task because an individual participant could show severe impairment in one task and perform relatively well in the other zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso We found that zzso of distinct zzso areas correlated with impairment in different zzso Whereas zzso of the intermediate and lateral zone of the anterior lobe correlated with impairment in the zzso task zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso respectively), zzso of the intermediate zone of the zzso lobe correlated with adaptation deficits in the zzso task zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Our results suggest that adaptation to the different tasks is processed independently and relies on different zzso zzso
