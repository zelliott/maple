A sensitive zzso technique was used to measure transfer zzso zzso for blood to brain diffusion of the MR contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso and the MR shift zzso zzso zzso zzso across the normal and the zzso injured zzso barrier zzso of zzso In rats with a normal zzso mean zzso zzso for these zzso ranged from zzso to zzso across eight brain regions and were significantly lower in each region than zzso for zzso zzso a substance known to be a poor zzso of the intact zzso zzso measured 6 h after a 10 zzso period of zzso zzso zzso were increased to zzso zzso and zzso zzso in two brain regions, zzso and zzso known to be especially vulnerable to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso after zzso opening of the barrier with zzso zzso gave zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Estimates of zzso zzso in brain zzso fluid 30 zzso after dosing the animals indicated that both an extremely high dose of zzso and severe disruption of the zzso would be required to shift the resonance frequency of zzso zzso zzso With the moderate degrees of zzso injury produced by short-term zzso a dose of zzso about 25 times the usual clinical dose of zzso zzso would be required to zzso the injury by dynamic zzso
