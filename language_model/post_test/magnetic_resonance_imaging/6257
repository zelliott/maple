The aging of human zzso stored in zzso at 4 degrees C was studied by the zzso zzso zzso were subjected to a sudden zzso stress by suspension in solutions of varying zzso in the presence of the spin label zzso The zzso obtained when the amount of the spin label zzso in the ghosts after zzso was plotted against the zzso of the buffer solutions exhibited an zzso which increased with time of the in zzso storage of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the aged zzso by addition of zzso restored the zzso zzso to shapes nearly similar to those obtained with zzso collected zzso days zzso
