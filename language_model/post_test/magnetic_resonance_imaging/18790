zzso analysis of the upper airway has not been performed in children with zzso sleep zzso We used magnetic resonance imaging and automatic zzso to delineate the upper airway in 20 children with zzso sleep zzso and in 20 control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso years, zzso We measured mean and minimal zzso area, zzso and volume of: zzso the total zzso zzso regions along the zzso zzso and where zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 10 segments at zzso increments along the zzso The mean zzso area of the total airway of the zzso sleep zzso group was significantly smaller in comparison with the control group, zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area and airway volume were smaller in this group, zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 515 versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Regional analysis suggested that the upper airway in children with zzso sleep zzso is most restricted where zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the upper airway is restricted throughout the initial two-thirds of its length and that the narrowing is not in a discrete region adjacent to either the zzso or zzso but rather in a continuous fashion along zzso
