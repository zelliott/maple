We compared quantitative analysis of conventional MR and zzso transfer zzso images with visual zzso assessment of standard images in the zzso of zzso zzso patients with zzso were zzso zzso Relative signal zzso on zzso and zzso images, zzso signal zzso on zzso and zzso zzso images and zzso ratios were zzso In 16 zzso the zzso ratios were correlated with the volume fraction of tumor cell zzso in zzso zzso Among the conventional sequences zzso images were most accurate for quantitative zzso signal zzso was more accurate than relative signal zzso zzso ratios were superior to quantitative analysis of conventional images and equal to visual zzso evaluation in discriminating between zzso and high-grade zzso and correlated with the volume fraction of zzso in the tumor tissue zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The results indicate that quantitative analysis is generally of minor value in the grading of zzso In spite of sensitivity to tissue changes associated with zzso zzso imaging cannot significantly improve MR zzso of zzso
