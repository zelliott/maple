A method was developed for magnetic resonance imaging zzso of human autopsy brains stored long-term at zzso degrees zzso zzso brains at temperatures between zzso and zzso degrees C gave minimal zzso signals consistent with zzso having limited freedom of movement at low zzso Raising brain temperature improved the signal such that scanning at zzso degree C generated images with good zzso resolution, zzso matter contrast, and fine detail of cortical zzso zzso To validate the method, volume and area zzso were made using computerized image analysis on stored digital images of 14 brains from adult subjects of both genders and various zzso The data confirmed that brain volume was zzso correlated with age, and female subjects had smaller zzso This is a valuable new method for acquiring zzso data from previously zzso zzso brains that are to be used for zzso and molecular zzso
