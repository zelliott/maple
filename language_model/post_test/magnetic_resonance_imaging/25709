An experimental short echo delay zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso sequence was compared with a conventional zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso sequence in the assessment of normal and abnormal lung zzso zzso was also made with high-resolution CT of abnormal lung zzso 

At zzso zzso an experimental short echo delay zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso 7 zzso was compared with an optimal conventional zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso 20 zzso spatial zzso Ten healthy volunteers were examined with both zzso The mean signal intensity and zzso ratios were calculated in lung zzso for both zzso Two zzso compared the zzso of normal lung zzso structures with the two zzso In 24 patients with diffuse lung disease, results with both MR sequences and with high-resolution CT were zzso 

The signal intensity was significantly greater zzso zzso zzso with the TE of 7 zzso than with the TE of 20 zzso resulting in a zzso improvement in the zzso zzso The zzso TE improved zzso of lung zzso structures, including peripheral vessels, zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso In the patients with diffuse lung disease, pulmonary zzso abnormalities were better zzso on the images with zzso of 7 zzso than on images with zzso of 20 zzso When compared with high-resolution CT, the sequence with a TE of 7 zzso provided comparable assessment of zzso zzso and dense consolidation, but it was inferior to high-resolution CT in the zzso assessment of lung zzso 

This experimental zzso sequence with a TE of 7 zzso significantly improves the zzso ratio, allowing improved zzso of normal and abnormal pulmonary zzso when compared with conventional zzso images with a TE of 20 zzso Although zzso detail remains inferior to that seen with high-resolution CT, the improved image quality with a TE of 7 zzso suggests that assessment and follow-up of zzso lung disease might be possible with zzso thereby avoiding zzso zzso
