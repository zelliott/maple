The reference frame used by zzso zzso zzso to zzso locations is zzso Many previous studies have suggested zzso coding, whereas we have reported that visual and auditory signals employ a hybrid reference frame zzso a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso One possible explanation for this zzso is that zzso activity, which we studied zzso is hybrid, whereas zzso activity might be eye zzso Here, we examined the reference frame of visual and auditory zzso activity in the lateral and zzso banks of the zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso area zzso and zzso zzso area zzso of 2 zzso zzso We recorded from 275 single zzso as monkeys performed visual and auditory zzso from different initial eye zzso We found that both visual and auditory signals reflected a hybrid of zzso and zzso coordinates during both target and zzso task periods rather than shifting to an zzso format as the zzso zzso This account differs from numerous previous recording zzso We suggest that the geometry of the receptive field sampling in prior studies was biased in favor of an zzso reference zzso zzso the overall hybrid nature of the reference frame was overlooked because the zzso response patterns were not fully zzso
