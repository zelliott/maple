Brain anatomy is characterized by dramatic growth from the end of the second zzso through the zzso zzso The characterization of normal zzso growth of the white matter tracts has not been well-documented to date and could provide important clues to understanding the extensive zzso of white matter injuries in cerebral zzso zzso zzso However, anatomical studies of human brain development during this period are surprisingly scarce and zzso zzso have become available only zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso can reveal detailed anatomy of white zzso We acquired diffusion zzso images zzso of zzso fetal brain samples and in zzso zzso and zzso zzso structures were zzso in two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso measured, and reconstructed zzso zzso The growth status of various white matter tracts was evaluated on zzso at zzso zzso weeks, and compared with zzso zzso and zzso to 6-year-old zzso zzso zzso association, and projection white matter tracts and gray matter structures were illustrated in zzso and zzso characterized to assess their dynamic zzso The overall pattern of the time courses for the development of different white matter is that zzso fibers develop first and association fibers last and zzso and projection fibers are forming from anterior to zzso part of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso human brain data will be a valuable resource for human brain zzso study and will provide reference standards for diagnostic zzso of premature zzso
