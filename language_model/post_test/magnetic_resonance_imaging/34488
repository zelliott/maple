In 6 patients, ranging in age from 26 to 71 years, we analyzed zzso fluid and zzso studied zzso zzso located at the zzso of the zzso 

Digital zzso examination, zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and aspiration of zzso fluid were performed to evaluate size, zzso and location of the zzso zzso A zzso needle was inserted into the zzso zzso zzso under ultrasound zzso After zzso fluid for zzso and measurement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso from the prostate involving the zzso wall was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were zzso 

All zzso fluid specimens were zzso and clear without any zzso or zzso zzso The zzso levels in the fluid ranged between 90 and 670 zzso zzso zzso while the zzso levels were between zzso and 4,000 zzso These levels of zzso and zzso were significantly higher as compared with those in the zzso The zzso wall was lined with zzso or zzso zzso Some zzso cells from the zzso wall showed positive zzso for zzso 

Not all zzso zzso located at the zzso of the prostate are zzso duct zzso and there is a high probability that the zzso could be a zzso or a simple zzso of the zzso
