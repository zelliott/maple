zzso disease is a progressive, zzso neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded zzso repeat in the zzso zzso which encodes an zzso long zzso repeat in the zzso zzso zzso disease has served as a model for the study of other more common neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's zzso These disorders all share features zzso delayed zzso selective zzso vulnerability, despite widespread expression of zzso proteins during the whole zzso abnormal protein processing and zzso and cellular toxic effects involving both cell autonomous and zzso interaction zzso zzso pathways of zzso disease are beginning to be zzso offering targets for zzso Additionally, zzso genetic testing and findings of zzso studies show that, as in some other neurodegenerative disorders, zzso in affected individuals begins many years before onset of zzso signs and symptoms of zzso disease, and it is accompanied by subtle zzso zzso and psychiatric changes zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso disease is also emerging as a model for strategies to develop therapeutic interventions, not only to slow progression of manifest disease but also to zzso or zzso zzso its zzso
