zzso resonance imaging zzso provides a method to identify and zzso abnormalities resulting from traumatic brain injury zzso zzso abnormalities in children with zzso have not been fully characterized according to the frequency, location, and quantitative measurement of a range of zzso critical for studies of zzso zzso Here, we report zzso findings from a large, zzso study of childhood zzso the Social Outcomes of Brain zzso in Kids zzso study, which compared qualitative and quantitative zzso findings in 72 children with complicated zzso zzso to 52 children with orthopedic injury zzso 

zzso analyses of zzso scans coded white matter zzso zzso zzso deposits reflecting prior zzso zzso regions of zzso and/or zzso and corpus zzso zzso and traumatic zzso zzso Two automated quantitative analyses were zzso zzso zzso methods zzso volumes for total brain, white matter zzso gray matter zzso corpus zzso zzso amygdala, zzso zzso zzso and zzso along with a zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also examined performance on the zzso Speed Index zzso from the zzso Intelligence zzso for Children, Fourth Edition, in relation to the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso deposits, and focal areas of zzso or zzso were common in children with zzso were related to injury severity, and were mostly observed within a zzso zzso zzso analyses showed zzso changes related to injury severity, especially zzso enlargement and reduced corpus zzso zzso zzso demonstrated similar findings, but, in addition, zzso reductions in the inferior zzso zzso zzso region, especially in the severe zzso zzso The complicated mild zzso group showed few differences from the zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with global zzso as measured by zzso 

zzso findings after childhood zzso are diverse and particularly influenced by injury severity, and they involve common features, group zzso and individual zzso
