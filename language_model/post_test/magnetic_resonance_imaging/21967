The presence or absence of rapidly zzso zzso or abolishing low back and radiating pain, as identified during a zzso mechanical zzso assessment of patients with chronic zzso pain, was compared zzso with zzso pain provocation and zzso zzso 

To evaluate any relation between the responses of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso of referred pain has been reported as a very common occurrence during zzso assessment and zzso Patients whose pain zzso have been shown to achieve superior treatment zzso A dynamic internal disc model has been hypothesized as an underlying mechanism for zzso that has not been studied zzso 

Patients with chronically disabling low back pain who were referred for zzso underwent preliminary blinded zzso clinical assessment and were zzso into three groups by their pain zzso zzso or lack zzso of pain response were then compared with blinded zzso pain provocation and zzso zzso 

During the zzso assessment, the referred pain of 50% zzso with zzso having positive zzso of which zzso had an intact zzso The pain of zzso zzso only zzso not zzso zzso of these had positive zzso but only zzso had an intact zzso The zzso pain of zzso did not respond at all, and only zzso of these had positive zzso 

The zzso assessment process reliably differentiated zzso from zzso pain zzso zzso zzso as well as competent from an incompetent zzso zzso zzso zzso in symptomatic discs and was superior to magnetic resonance imaging in distinguishing painful from zzso zzso
