The objective was to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in patients with zzso stress zzso 

The study group consisted of 20 patients with clinically diagnosed zzso stress injuries who were evaluated with zzso zzso were performed in 14 of the 20 zzso The zzso examinations and zzso were zzso reviewed in consensus by two musculoskeletal zzso 

All 20 patients with clinically diagnosed zzso stress injuries had zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso within the fibula on zzso The zzso reaction and bone zzso zzso were present within the zzso fibula in 14 patients, the middle fibula in 1 patient, and the zzso fibula in 5 zzso The zzso reaction was located on the anterior zzso in 1 patient, the zzso zzso in 4 patients, the lateral zzso in 11 patients, and zzso distributed throughout the zzso in 4 zzso Nine patients had abnormal zzso and zzso signal intensity within the zzso zzso zzso and follow-up zzso showed zzso reaction in zzso and 50% of patients with zzso stress injuries zzso
