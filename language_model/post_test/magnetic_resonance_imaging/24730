zzso cohort zzso 

zzso average zzso radiation dose to a cohort of children with zzso zzso syndrome zzso during assessment and treatment at a single center with vertically zzso prosthetic titanium zzso 

Children with zzso undergo extensive evaluations to characterize their zzso No standardized zzso evaluation exists, but all reports use extensive zzso The source and level of radiation these patients receive is not currently zzso 

We evaluated a retrospective consecutive cohort of 62 children who had surgical treatment of zzso at our center from zzso Typical care included obtaining serial zzso spine and chest zzso zzso zzso scans, zzso scans, and magnetic resonance zzso zzso of treatment were divided into time of initial evaluation to the end of initial vertically zzso prosthetic titanium rib zzso with each subsequent zzso delineated by the next surgical zzso The effective dose for each examination was estimated within zzso zzso Plain zzso were calculated from zzso zzso dose was directly estimated for CT scans since 2007 and an average of effective dose from zzso was used for scans before zzso zzso dose from zzso was directly zzso All doses were reported in zzso 

A cohort of 62 children had a total of zzso zzso There were a total of 290 CT scans, zzso zzso 147 magnetic resonance images, and zzso zzso zzso The average accumulated effective dose was zzso zzso for children who had completed all treatment, zzso zzso up to initial surgery, and zzso zzso for each subsequent zzso of zzso CT scans accounted for zzso of total radiation zzso 

Children managed for zzso using a consistent protocol received zzso radiation doses that were on average 4 times the estimated average US background radiation exposure of 3 zzso CT scans comprised zzso of the total zzso
