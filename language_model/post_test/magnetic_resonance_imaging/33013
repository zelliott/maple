zzso zzso is an zzso gut zzso that interacts with brain zzso receptors zzso to promote food zzso Recent research suggests that zzso acts as a zzso of motivated behavior, suggesting a direct influence of zzso on brain reinforcement zzso In the present studies, we investigated the role of zzso and zzso in brain reinforcement zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to zzso resolve the functional zzso produced by systemic administration of an zzso zzso zzso The imaging data revealed a focal zzso of a network of zzso structures that comprise brain reinforcement zzso zzso area, lateral zzso and nucleus zzso We next analyzed whether brain reinforcement circuits require functional zzso To this purpose, zzso zzso or zzso rats sustaining zzso knockout of zzso zzso zzso zzso were implanted with stimulating zzso aimed at the lateral zzso shaped to respond for zzso zzso zzso and then tested using a zzso procedure to examine zzso response zzso zzso rats were readily shaped using stimulation zzso of 75 zzso whereas zzso zzso rats required 300 zzso for zzso zzso No differences in zzso zzso were noted for zzso rats at 75 zzso and zzso zzso rats at 300 zzso When current intensity was lowered to 100 zzso zzso zzso rats did not respond for zzso Taken zzso these data suggest that systemic zzso can activate zzso zzso areas, and highlight a zzso role of zzso on the activity of brain reinforcement zzso
