Phase contrast zzso imaging is a standard method for accurate in zzso flow zzso One zzso however, is that it lengthens the scan time (or reduces the achievable zzso zzso because one has to acquire two or more images with different flow sensitivities and subtract their zzso to produce the final zzso zzso Without this step, zzso phase variations will give rise to an zzso zzso varying background zzso In this paper, we introduce a novel phase contrast zzso imaging technique that requires the acquisition of only a single zzso The idea is to estimate the background phase variation from the zzso image itself and then have it removed, leaving only the zzso phase to generate a corrected flow zzso This technique is sensitive to flow in one direction and requires 50% less scan time than conventional phase contrast zzso zzso Phantom and in zzso results were obtained and compared with those of the conventional method, demonstrating the new zzso effectiveness in measuring flow in various vessels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
