A balance of zzso and zzso mechanisms is essential for efficient and zzso zzso These mechanisms may go awry in several zzso disorders characterized by zzso repetitive zzso The zzso zzso paradigm is a well-established probe of zzso and zzso that has been used to demonstrate behavioral deficits in patients with zzso syndrome and obsessive-compulsive zzso However, the brain zzso of this zzso zzso paradigm are not yet well zzso In the present study, we used a zzso zzso paradigm and zzso functional zzso to probe zzso and zzso brain mechanisms in healthy adult zzso When subjects performed the negative zzso zzso zzso task, several regions of the prefrontal zzso were selectively activated relative to the neutral zzso zzso regions of the prefrontal zzso were zzso in the positive zzso zzso These results support the notion that the prefrontal zzso is involved in both zzso and zzso processing and demonstrate that this zzso zzso task shares brain zzso with other positive and negative zzso zzso In conjunction with functional zzso this zzso zzso task may be useful for studying the zzso of zzso disorders in which deficient zzso processing or excessive zzso is a zzso
