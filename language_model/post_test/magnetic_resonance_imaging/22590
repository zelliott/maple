To evaluate magnetic resonance zzso zzso with zzso injection of zzso iron oxide zzso for imaging zzso pathways from zzso zzso zzso 

In 24 patients with zzso cancer, zzso was injected into the zzso layer of the zzso region zzso and MR zzso was zzso In study 1, fast zzso zzso acquisition using a zzso zzso sequence was performed from the neck to the upper abdomen before and at 20, 40, and 60 minutes after injection in 10 zzso In study 2, zzso and spin echo zzso images were obtained after injection in 14 zzso Areas scanned were the neck to the upper zzso and the upper zzso 

In study 1, at 20 minutes after injection, the signal of each zzso zzso appeared attenuated when compared with zzso zzso The zzso ratio in zzso zzso exhibiting influx of zzso was significantly lower than that found on zzso images zzso zzso zzso In study 2, influx to the neck zzso zzso was detected in 8 patients zzso whereas influx to the upper abdominal zzso zzso was detected in 13 zzso 

zzso resonance zzso with zzso could zzso the zzso pathways draining from the injection site and the location of zzso zzso exhibiting influx of zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso
