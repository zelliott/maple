To investigate whether childhood sports zzso particularly zzso sports, has any effect on bone mineral content zzso zzso bone mineral density zzso and bone geometric characteristics in middle-aged zzso zzso zzso 

In this zzso comparison of two groups, 46 middle-aged women zzso age, zzso zzso zzso years; range, zzso zzso were grouped according to sport participation during zzso zzso sports, including high-impact zzso activities; and zzso zzso sports or no zzso 

zzso energy X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso spine and zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso determined bone geometric characteristics in the zzso such as zzso zzso zzso area, zzso and zzso zzso and maximum and minimum second moment of zzso 

zzso middle-aged women with participation in zzso sports during junior high to high school zzso years old) displayed significantly greater zzso in both zzso spine and zzso neck regions, and also significantly greater zzso zzso bone zzso area, zzso perimeter and maximum and minimum second moment of area than the zzso sports zzso 

Adolescent zzso exercise exerts zzso effects on zzso zzso size and shape, while zzso zzso effectively identified the same zzso zzso exercise in youth affects bone, and these effects may be preserved as zzso geometric and structural advantages even after 40 zzso
