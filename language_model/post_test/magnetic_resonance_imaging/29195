zzso zzso imaging allows the quantitative assessment of the zzso organization of tracts in zzso zzso zzso We used the new technique of MR zzso to demonstrate the effects of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso maps zzso magnitude of the bias zzso of diffusion of three patients with zzso lobe zzso were compared with zzso zzso diffusion maps of 22 control zzso All three patients were operated on for the treatment of medically intractable zzso lobe zzso and had a normal zzso examination before zzso One patient had an zzso Two patients had standard en bloc zzso one of whom developed a zzso zzso after zzso 

In the patient with zzso a significant reduction of diffusion zzso zzso than zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso was demonstrated in the zzso radiation on the side of the zzso zzso extending from the zzso to the zzso zzso In the other patient with standard en bloc zzso but clinically no zzso the zzso radiation was only marginally zzso In the third patient zzso the diffusion zzso was within the normal range in the expected position of the zzso zzso 

Our findings show that MR zzso may be a useful tool to demonstrate zzso zzso in the zzso radiation after zzso zzso in patients with zzso This is the first time that this new method has been applied in zzso zzso it enables us to zzso the zzso correlate of dysfunctional pathways after zzso surgery in zzso The potential for using MR zzso to study other aspects of zzso is zzso
