zzso functional zzso zzso was used to investigate the neural zzso of memory zzso as a function of zzso While zzso data were zzso 14 younger zzso age 21 zzso and 14 older subjects zzso age 68 zzso made zzso decisions about zzso zzso memory for these words was tested at two delays such that older subjects' performance at the short delay was comparable to that of the young subjects at the long zzso This allowed zzso changes in the neural zzso of zzso to be zzso from the zzso of differential recognition zzso zzso in left inferior prefrontal zzso and the left zzso formation was greater for subsequently recognized words in both age groups, consistent with the findings of previous studies in young zzso In the prefrontal cortex, these zzso memory zzso were, however, zzso in the younger group but bilateral in the older zzso In addition, for the younger group only, greater activity for remembered words was observed in anterior inferior zzso cortex, as were reversed effects zzso zzso zzso in anterior prefrontal zzso The data indicate that older subjects engage much of the same neural zzso as younger subjects when zzso new zzso However, the findings also point to age-related differences in both prefrontal and zzso activity during successful episodic zzso
