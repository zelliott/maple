zzso the thickness of the cerebral zzso is a key step in many brain imaging studies, revealing valuable information on development or disease zzso In this work, we present a framework for measuring the cortical zzso based on minimizing line zzso over the probability map of the gray matter in the zzso zzso We first prepare a probability map that contains the probability of each zzso belonging to the gray zzso Then, the thickness is basically defined for each zzso as the minimum line integral of the probability map on line segments centered at the point of zzso In contrast to our approach, previous methods often perform a zzso hard zzso of the gray matter before measuring the cortical zzso Because of image noise and partial volume effects, such a hard zzso ignores the underlying tissue class probabilities assigned to each zzso discarding potentially useful zzso We describe our proposed method and demonstrate its performance on both artificial volumes and real zzso brain zzso data from subjects with Alzheimer's disease and healthy zzso
