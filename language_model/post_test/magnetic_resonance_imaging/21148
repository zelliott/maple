The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between zzso functional connectivity and the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder zzso symptoms in 15 people who developed zzso following recent zzso Fifteen participants who experienced acute traumatic events underwent a zzso resting functional magnetic resonance imaging scan within 2 days zzso All the patients were diagnosed with zzso within 1 to 6 months after zzso Brain areas in which activity was correlated with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso To assess the relationship between the severity of zzso symptoms and zzso zzso contrast images representing areas positively correlated with the zzso were correlated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso scores zzso when they were zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso prefrontal zzso and bilateral zzso were selected to assess the correlation of the strength of functional connectivity with the zzso zzso state connectivity with the zzso was zzso correlated with zzso scores in the left superior zzso zzso and right zzso Furthermore, the strength of connectivity between the zzso and bilateral amygdala, and even between the bilateral zzso could predict the severity of zzso symptoms zzso These results suggest that early altered zzso functional connectivity of the zzso with the left superior zzso zzso right zzso and zzso could predict the severity of the disease and may be a major risk factor that zzso patients to develop zzso
