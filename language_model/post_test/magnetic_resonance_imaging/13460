Studies were conducted in 76 rats to describe and validate a new zzso in zzso model for acute zzso and zzso of the left coronary zzso zzso zzso distribution in six rat hearts confirmed a significant reduction in zzso flow at the center of the zzso zone zzso reduction of total zzso counts compared to zzso region, P less than zzso after 7 zzso of zzso zzso flow returned to control values upon zzso While zzso parameters in 10 rats during 7 zzso of zzso and 7 zzso of zzso were zzso end zzso pressures increased significantly zzso less than zzso during zzso Finally, the utility of this rat model was demonstrated in a study of contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (N zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be differentiated from acutely zzso zzso on zzso MR zzso After 5 zzso of zzso zzso and following contrast administration zzso the zzso zone appeared less enhanced than normal zzso Upon release of the zzso the left zzso free wall once again yielded a homogeneous signal similar to that of the normal zzso
