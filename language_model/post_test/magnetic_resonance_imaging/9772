zzso resonance imaging zzso and zzso have frequently been used to evaluate zzso zzso Many studies have compared the accuracy of zzso to that of zzso However, there have been no previous comparison studies between zzso and zzso in the evaluation of repaired cartilage after zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso Observation of zzso zzso zzso zzso scoring zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the results between zzso and zzso after zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso of the zzso using a modified zzso scoring zzso Our study investigated 27 consecutive cases in 26 patients who underwent follow-up zzso and zzso zzso 1 year following zzso zzso zzso based on their zzso zzso of the zzso zzso According to the comparison results of those 5 categories, the agreement between zzso and zzso evaluation results was statistically significant with good reliability in the categories of the degree of zzso repair and zzso zzso the quality of repaired tissue surface, and zzso However, the integration with the border zone and the zzso category showed poor to moderate zzso There has been no well-established correlation method between zzso and zzso after zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso of the zzso
