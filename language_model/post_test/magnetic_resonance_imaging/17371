Because magnetic resonance zzso imaging is a superior technique in zzso pathological changes in cerebral zzso it should also be an optimal imaging zzso in monitoring long-term changes in the brains of animals infected with zzso zzso In this study, zzso and zzso techniques were used to observe the changes in the brains of 7 rabbits infected with the third-stage larvae of zzso zzso Changes were monitored by zzso from day 0 to day zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso MR brain images were first observed on day 22 zzso and hallmarks of abnormalities were noted on day 35 zzso zzso on brain MR images remained up to day zzso zzso zzso examination from days 108 to zzso zzso revealed zzso congestion, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with embedded zzso zzso and zzso in the brain zzso These findings suggest that hosts infected with zzso zzso may undergo pathological changes in the brain zzso for more than 200 days zzso Moreover, severe abnormalities may occur as early as the fifth week zzso
