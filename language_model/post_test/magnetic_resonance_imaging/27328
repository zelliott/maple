To observe the effects of different zzso of zzso on brain regions activated by mechanical zzso and then to investigate the zzso effect of zzso 

Twenty healthy male volunteers were randomly divided into two groups: light zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso and deep zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by target controlled infusion system in pilot zzso The target effect site concentration zzso of zzso was defined as the average of the zzso from zzso 80 to 60 or zzso 60 to 40 in group L or group D zzso Mechanical stimuli were applied using von Frey filaments at the center of the left foot, and the pain threshold and zzso scores were zzso zzso examinations were taken 1 week after pilot study with the following zzso structure zzso functional zzso functional zzso zzso zzso in which the stimulus sequence was 6 zzso (20 s on + 20 s zzso This sequence was repeated after zzso zzso 

As shown by zzso in group zzso active brain regions of (the second zzso first zzso zzso were seen in zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso while active brain regions of zzso were seen in zzso zzso frontal zzso and zzso zzso In group D, the active brain region of zzso was only seen in zzso while active brain regions of zzso were seen in zzso zzso and zzso Active brain regions of zzso with zzso infusion in response to zzso stimulation were observed in zzso 

zzso at different zzso has different effect on the zzso of brain zzso It may exert its zzso effect via different zzso
