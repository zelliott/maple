This study examined whether distinct zzso profiles could be delineated in a sample with zzso zzso zzso zzso and whether white matter zzso zzso burden contributed to zzso group zzso A heterogeneous, clinical sample of 70 older adults diagnosed with zzso was assessed using cognitive scores, and zzso was zzso using a zzso zzso approach on zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso Using cluster and zzso zzso three distinct groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso derived based on cognitive zzso zzso also showed a dose dependent relationship of zzso burden to zzso zzso with the zzso Speed zzso demonstrating significantly higher levels of zzso pathology when compared to the other zzso In addition, there was a zzso of zzso type by the two most impaired zzso zzso and zzso zzso such that the zzso zzso showed higher zzso zzso zzso and lower deep white matter zzso zzso volumes, whereas the zzso Speed demonstrated higher zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that distinct zzso zzso can be zzso derived and reliably differentiated from a zzso zzso sample, and that these profiles differ according to zzso zzso Overall, findings suggest different underlying zzso within zzso and contribute to our understanding of zzso zzso
