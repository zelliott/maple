The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of zzso nerve and zzso function after zzso zzso for symptomatic cavernous zzso zzso zzso 

Between 1991 and 2007, 21 patients (19 women and 2 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring symptomatic zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso bone zzso opening of the zzso wall of the zzso and tumor zzso were zzso 

zzso the grading of zzso zzso zzso improved in 15 of the 17 patients who presented with that zzso Complete recovery could be achieved in 8 zzso Complete recovery rates in patients with zzso grading of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Improvement of zzso nerve dysfunction was found in 32 of 34 zzso No worsening of zzso nerve function zzso zzso the zzso level was zzso in 13 of the 17 patients with zzso zzso Recovery of growth hormone zzso and zzso were found in 3 patients zzso and 1 patient zzso zzso zzso patients were followed for more than 3 zzso Of these 17 patients, 12 patients received initial zzso zzso zzso The overall tumor control rate after surgery with initial zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso 65 zzso range, zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a safe and effective treatment to improve zzso nerve and zzso dysfunction in patients with symptomatic zzso zzso The less severe zzso nerve zzso before surgery, the better the chance of complete recovery of its zzso Combined with zzso zzso this minimally invasive management also provided excellent long-term tumor zzso
