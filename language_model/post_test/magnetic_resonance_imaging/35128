This study was undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of zzso imaging zzso in the differential diagnosis of zzso cerebral zzso including zzso high-grade zzso and zzso 

Nine cerebral zzso (five zzso four from zzso zzso ten zzso and five cerebral zzso in 19 patients were studied with zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso imaging zzso including calculation of mean apparent diffusion zzso zzso of the zzso core, and zzso At zzso the mean of the maximum regional cerebral blood volume zzso was calculated in the zzso peripheral solid areas and compared with that of the zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso white zzso 

zzso achieved the differential diagnosis in all cases except for the four zzso zzso At zzso the mean ratio of the zzso of the zzso portion was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the high-grade zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso 

zzso seems to be useful in the differential diagnosis of zzso cerebral zzso High zzso values in the peripheral areas appear to indicate the possibility of a zzso zzso whereas low values tend to indicate an zzso
