The zzso assessments of zzso were applied for zzso observation of tumor zzso The hypothesis that most of zzso are stable or show only slight growth was zzso 

This was an zzso zzso 

The study was performed in the university zzso 

The study group included 27 patients with 15 unilateral tumors and 12 bilateral zzso All patients had at least 2 magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and the average zzso between initial and control examinations was zzso zzso 

Volume zzso were performed on zzso weighted zzso spin echo sequences after injection of zzso using special zzso Growth of the tumors was estimated by comparison of the results of three zzso from the initial and control zzso zzso 

The growth was confirmed in 17 of 27 tumors zzso Growth was found in 10 of 12 zzso of zzso type 2 zzso In 15 unilateral zzso growth was found in 7 zzso zzso zzso were observed for a shorter period of time zzso zzso than bilateral tumors zzso zzso The correlation between a zzso volume gain and the follow-up period was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso 

The growth of tumors can be confirmed despite a short follow-up zzso
