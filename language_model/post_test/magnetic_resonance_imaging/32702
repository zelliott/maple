zzso flow, characterized by zzso zzso is a contributing factor to the zzso of several cardiovascular zzso A clinical zzso tool for assessing turbulence is zzso zzso It is well known that the occurrence of multiple spin zzso within a zzso during the influence of a magnetic zzso moment causes signal loss in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso In this paper a mathematical derivation of an expression for computing the standard zzso zzso of the blood flow zzso distribution within a zzso is zzso The zzso is obtained from the magnitude of zzso signals acquired with different first zzso zzso By exploiting the relation between the zzso and turbulence intensity zzso this method allows for quantitative studies of zzso For zzso the zzso in an in zzso flow phantom was zzso and the results compared favorably with previously published laser zzso zzso zzso zzso This method has the potential to become an important tool for the zzso assessment of turbulence in the zzso zzso
