The goat is one of the most commonly used zzso models for focal zzso repair and zzso While the zzso of the human knee has been studied zzso less is known about the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso between human and zzso knees have not been zzso and their significance is largely zzso 

We conducted a zzso analysis of the differences in goat and human knees to assess the zzso of these zzso in zzso zzso 

CT and zzso scans revealed several differences in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso were more convex and the zzso were significantly thicker and covered a larger proportion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cartilage thickness was consistently thinner, while elastic zzso on zzso testing was consistently stiffer than human cartilage measured at eight different zzso zzso zzso area and pressure were measured with electronic pressure sensors under loads zzso by multiples of body weight and at knee zzso angles reported for zzso The highest zzso in contact pressure were measured in the zzso joint in goat and human zzso Peak contact pressure measured at 2 times body weight at the goat zzso joint at zzso zzso was significantly higher than for any other condition at the human zzso zzso 

These differences in contact conditions might explain the lower quality of local repair reported for zzso zzso zzso defects relative to zzso zzso Further comparative analysis, including zzso response, is necessary to determine the extent to which the goat knee reproduces clinical zzso
