Early disruption of steroids affects the development of zzso neural circuits underlying affective zzso In humans, patients with classic zzso adrenal zzso zzso can serve as a natural model to study early hormonal zzso on functional brain zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso zzso leading to altered zzso zzso function, and zzso Using zzso we compared zzso adolescents with zzso to 14 healthy controls on zzso response to a face viewing zzso In response to negative facial emotions, zzso females activated the zzso significantly more than healthy zzso whereas zzso males did not differ from control zzso Furthermore, females with zzso showed a similar pattern of zzso zzso to control zzso suggesting zzso zzso function in females with zzso These findings suggest a prominent effect of early zzso on the development and function of the zzso in females with zzso whereas no effects were detected in males with zzso This study provides data that can be further tested in a model of the zzso mechanisms underlying early zzso organizational effects on zzso zzso
