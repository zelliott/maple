In magnetic resonance imaging zzso artifacts occur at the interface of substances with large magnetic zzso differences, resulting in geometric zzso of the image at those zzso The zzso artifacts are often subtle on clinical images and if not carefully examined they may lead to zzso zzso zzso artifacts are prevalent on the boundary of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso tissue zzso in the spinal zzso The appearance of these artifacts on images from three different magnetic field strength instruments, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso spin echo and zzso recalled echo pulse sequences were selected to image a water phantom containing substances of varying zzso The effects were also studied in MR images of the head in a normal human zzso At any given field strength the artifacts were more prominent in the zzso echo imaging than in the corresponding spin echo pulse zzso As expected, the zzso were also greater at higher field zzso The results in human subjects paralleled the findings in the phantom zzso
