A zzso retrospective study using zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging data to establish zzso reliable criteria of canal compromise and zzso zzso in patients with cervical spinal zzso zzso 

To develop and validate a zzso assessment tool of spinal canal compromise and zzso zzso in cervical spinal zzso injury for use in clinical zzso 

There are few zzso reliable criteria for zzso measurement of cervical spinal canal compromise or zzso zzso after acute spinal zzso zzso 

The study included 71 patients (55 men, 16 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso zzso with acute cervical spinal zzso zzso zzso of spinal zzso injury included motor vehicle accidents zzso zzso zzso falls zzso zzso zzso zzso injuries zzso zzso zzso sports zzso zzso zzso assault zzso zzso 1), and farm accidents zzso zzso zzso Canal compromise was measured on zzso zzso scan and zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso zzso at the level of maximum injury was measured on zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso All films were assessed by two independent zzso 

There was a strong correlation of canal compromise and/or zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso Spinal canal compromise assessed by zzso zzso showed a significant although moderate correlation with spinal zzso zzso assessed by zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso Virtually all patients with canal compromise of zzso or more on zzso zzso scan had evidence of some degree of zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging, but a large number of patients with less than zzso canal compromise on zzso zzso scan also had evidence on magnetic resonance imaging of zzso zzso 

In patients with cervical spinal zzso injury, the zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging provides an objective, zzso and reliable assessment of spinal zzso zzso that cannot be adequately assessed by zzso zzso zzso
