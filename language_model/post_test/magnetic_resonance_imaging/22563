To demonstrate the clinical characteristics of cerebral zzso that mainly zzso as zzso loss of consciousness and to explore the zzso of these zzso 

Twelve patients who had cerebral zzso that zzso mainly as zzso loss of consciousness were zzso zzso Their risk factors, clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were recorded in zzso The patients were followed up for at least 90 zzso 

Every patient had at least one risk factor for cerebrovascular zzso The clinical manifestations in most of the patients are zzso incidents, but the duration was longer, lasting for minutes to hours, but mostly less than 24 zzso These patients could be sorted into three types according to the zzso zzso type A severe zzso in anterior circulation zzso on both zzso type B severe zzso in zzso zzso and type C multiple severe zzso (in both anterior and zzso zzso zzso blood flow was severely reduced in the zzso arteries as shown by zzso The zzso studies in type A patients also showed diffuse zzso of zzso In one case, the patient lost his consciousness when the zzso (a protective zzso passed through the zzso and he regained consciousness when the zzso was zzso in a few zzso All the 12 patients received medical zzso Four patients who were ineffective with medical treatment along received zzso zzso and there was no incident during the zzso Six of the remaining eight patients with medical treatment alone had zzso strokes within 90 days, including two with disabling zzso 

zzso loss of consciousness is a rare manifestation of large cerebral artery zzso The probable mechanism may be diffuse zzso in zzso or zzso These patients are in high risk of zzso zzso therapy to zzso the cerebral circulation may be a rational zzso
