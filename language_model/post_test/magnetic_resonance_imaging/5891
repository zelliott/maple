zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso genetic zzso Thus, identification of zzso zzso is a challenging and time-consuming zzso zzso associations may alleviate identification of the underlying zzso 

The purpose of this study was to investigate cardiac zzso within a family harboring a familial zzso zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso 

Complete genetic and clinical analyses were performed in a family with familial zzso zzso due to the zzso zzso Family relatives were studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body surface potential zzso and cardiac magnetic resonance zzso 

A candidate gene approach resulted in identification of a zzso deletion of zzso 14 in the gene zzso zzso zzso segregating with zzso zzso in the family zzso zzso carriers suffered from familial zzso zzso associated with cardiac death between the ages of 26 and 50 zzso Interestingly, all adult zzso carriers revealed zzso attenuated R zzso on standard zzso regardless of the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed late enhancement in zzso carriers with preserved ejection zzso Late enhancement was regionally related to areas of most pronounced zzso zzso as assessed by body surface potential zzso 

zzso R zzso were identified as an early zzso zzso in a family with familial zzso zzso due to the zzso zzso All adults harboring zzso had attenuated R waves irrespective of zzso zzso The study findings suggest a zzso zzso process preceding zzso zzso
