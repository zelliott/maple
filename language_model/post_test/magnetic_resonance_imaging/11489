To identify and evaluate the lateral border zone by comparing the size and distribution of the abnormal signal area demonstrated by MR imaging with the zzso area revealed by pathological examination in a zzso zzso zzso cat zzso 

In eight zzso the left anterior descending coronary artery was zzso for 90 minutes, and this was followed by 90 minutes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were initially obtained along the short axis of the heart before the administration of contrast zzso After the injection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained for three zzso The size of the abnormal signal area seen on each image was compared with that of the zzso area after zzso zzso To assess zzso changes in the zzso at the zzso area, lateral border zone and normal zzso electron microscopic examination was zzso 

The high signal area seen on zzso images and the enhanced area seen on zzso zzso were larger than the enhanced area on zzso zzso and the zzso area revealed by zzso zzso the difference was expressed as a percentage of the size of the total left zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso changes seen at the lateral border zone were compatible with zzso zzso zzso 

In a zzso zzso zzso cat model, the presence and size of the lateral border zone can be determined by means of zzso and zzso MR zzso
