Progressive external zzso zzso and zzso can be caused by genetic zzso that affect zzso DNA zzso zzso We characterized zzso in a family with zzso inherited zzso 

We conducted clinical, zzso and genetic analyses on two affected members suffering from zzso and zzso and reviewed the cases in the zzso To clarify zzso related to multiple zzso zzso we used zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess signal changes in the zzso zzso zzso and locus zzso zzso in our patients, and compared the results to those observed in idiopathic Parkinson's disease zzso zzso 

We report the first case of a Japanese family harboring a zzso zzso zzso in zzso The clinical features of zzso related to the zzso zzso in a total of 16 patients, including our two cases, are indistinguishable from zzso However, zzso zzso showed a distinct pattern in our cases compared to zzso The zzso imaging results were consistent with the zzso findings reported in cases of zzso zzso in which zzso of the zzso were profoundly affected while those in the zzso were zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso may be useful for zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and that zzso zzso may cause selective zzso loss in the zzso via a mechanism different from that of zzso
