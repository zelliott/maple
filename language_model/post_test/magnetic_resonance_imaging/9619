Nearly universal zzso in zzso muscular zzso zzso contributes to heart failure and zzso Because zzso patients show zzso zzso well before functional zzso we zzso that earlier treatment using drugs with zzso effect may be zzso 

Three groups of 10 zzso or zzso mice, deficient for zzso and zzso for zzso with skeletal zzso and zzso that closely mimics clinical zzso were zzso One zzso group received zzso and zzso starting at 8 weeks of life zzso a second received the same starting at 4 weeks of life zzso and the third zzso group was zzso At 20 weeks, all mice had normal ejection zzso though zzso strain rate was abnormal zzso in zzso zzso This improved to zzso in zzso mice zzso and further improved to zzso in zzso mice zzso for zzso versus zzso zzso mice showed less zzso damage, with a zzso reduction in zzso serum zzso G zzso in zzso mice zzso and a further zzso reduction in zzso mice zzso versus zzso zzso zzso were similarly zzso zzso zzso and zzso function by ex zzso muscle testing remained at zzso of normal with early treatment compared to a decline to zzso of normal skeletal muscle function without zzso 

These findings offer clinically available medications with proven zzso effect as a new therapeutic strategy in zzso Early initiation greatly attenuated zzso disease and, for the first time with these drugs, improved skeletal zzso Thus, early initiation of such agents warrants further clinical evaluation to maintain zzso zzso and cardiac function for patients with zzso and related zzso
