The trust region method which originated from the zzso zzso zzso for mixed effect model zzso are considered in the context of second level functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data zzso We first present the mathematical and zzso details of the method for the mixed effect model analysis, then we compare the proposed methods with the conventional zzso zzso zzso based on a series of zzso zzso and real human zzso zzso From simulation studies, we found a higher zzso factor for the zzso zzso is better than lower zzso factor for the zzso data zzso More importantly, in most cases, the expectation trust region zzso is superior to the zzso zzso in terms of accuracy if the random effect zzso is zzso We also compare these zzso on real human zzso which comprise repeated measures of zzso in zzso and random block experiment zzso We observed that the proposed method is faster in zzso and robust to zzso noise for the zzso zzso The advantages and limitations of the suggested methods are zzso
