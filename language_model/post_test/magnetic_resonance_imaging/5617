A common feature of zzso models of colitis is that the zzso zzso and persistence of inflammation vary considerably within the experimental animal zzso zzso zzso serial zzso of zzso inflammation could zzso guide dosing regimens and assess drug zzso thus enhancing the value of colitis models in zzso This investigation using magnetic resonance imaging zzso was therefore undertaken to zzso determine inflammatory zzso zzso and response to therapy associated with zzso zzso acid zzso colitis in zzso zzso 

zzso underwent zzso treatment on Day 0 and received zzso or vehicle zzso orally, daily, from Day zzso zzso or Day 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was repeated over zzso days to measure colon wall thickness and zzso aspects of zzso zzso zzso stool consistency, and disease activity were scored throughout and colon pathology determined zzso 

Principal component analysis of the zzso zzso highlighted colon wall and zzso zzso which increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso artifacts were distinguished from zzso changes using the zzso zzso standard zzso zzso correlated strongly with terminal colon weight zzso correlation r zzso zzso well with body weight change zzso zzso zzso but little with conventional clinical zzso zzso reduced inflammation administered zzso and zzso 

zzso and therapeutic efficacy can be sensitively zzso zzso using zzso in zzso zzso This methodology provides unique and objective in zzso measures of inflammation that can guide dosing strategies, enhancing colitis research effectiveness and the assessment of potential zzso zzso
