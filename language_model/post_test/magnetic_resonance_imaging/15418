The known regional zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and its role in various neural circuits in schizophrenia has given prominence to its importance in studies on the zzso associated with zzso zzso functional zzso of the zzso have been found during various zzso zzso however, the occurrence of the zzso during rest in patients with schizophrenia has rarely been zzso In the present study, we selected bilateral zzso area 46 as region of interest and analyzed the differences in the zzso functional connectivity pattern between 17 patients with zzso schizophrenia zzso and 17 matched controls using zzso zzso We found that the bilateral zzso showed reduced functional zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We also found enhanced functional connectivity between the left zzso and the left zzso zzso lobe and the zzso regions in zzso zzso Our results suggest that functional zzso associated with the zzso exists in schizophrenia during zzso This may be partially related to zzso in the intrinsic brain zzso
