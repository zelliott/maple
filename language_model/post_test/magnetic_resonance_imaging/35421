zzso and zzso zzso are small molecules specifically zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso We present here data of an exploratory study evaluating zzso zzso in patients with zzso or progressive zzso zzso 

21 patients with zzso or progressive zzso zzso were included in this zzso zzso treatment was started at a median of zzso years zzso zzso to zzso after initial zzso zzso patients had undergone zzso and all patients had received at least one zzso 1 to 5, median 2) line of systemic zzso zzso Patients received 100 or 150 zzso zzso or 250 zzso zzso orally per zzso 

Median age at primary diagnosis was zzso years zzso zzso to 76 zzso 18 patients received a total of zzso months zzso zzso of zzso treatment and 3 patients received a total of zzso months zzso zzso of zzso zzso The best responses were partial zzso in one patient receiving zzso and in two patients receiving zzso zzso Median time to progression was zzso zzso Six months after start of zzso treatment, zzso zzso patients were zzso and zzso patients were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in tumor cells did not significantly associate with time to progression or survival zzso In one patient zzso administration had to be discontinued due to toxicity zzso 3 zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with therapeutic efficacy in only a small fraction of patients with zzso zzso zzso reliably predicting tumor response to zzso need to be zzso
