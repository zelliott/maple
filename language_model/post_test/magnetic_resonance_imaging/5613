zzso zzso perceive particular colors when seeing a letter, word or number zzso zzso zzso studies have provided some evidence in favor of a neural basis for this type of zzso Most of these studies have reported extra zzso in the zzso zzso which is known to be involved in color, letter and word zzso The present study examined different zzso features zzso cortical zzso cortical volume and cortical surface zzso in a sample of 48 subjects (24 zzso zzso and 24 control zzso and revealed increased cortical zzso volume and surface area in the right and left zzso zzso and in adjacent regions, such as the zzso zzso and the zzso cortex, in zzso zzso In addition, we set out to analyze structural connectivity based on fractional zzso zzso zzso in a zzso of 28 subjects zzso zzso and 14 control zzso In contrast to the findings of a recent zzso study using modern diffusion zzso imaging measurement techniques, we did not detect any statistically significant difference in zzso between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Our study thus supports the hypothesis of local anatomical differences in cortical characteristics in the vicinity of the zzso zzso The observed altered brain anatomy in zzso zzso might be the anatomical basis for this particular form of zzso but it is also possible that the detected effects are a consequence (rather than the primary zzso of the zzso experience of zzso zzso
