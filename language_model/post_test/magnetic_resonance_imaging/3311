zzso with zzso zzso cerebral zzso are typically high functioning and walk without zzso zzso The involved limb is usually smaller and zzso although it is not clear whether the difference in muscle volume has an impact on walking zzso 

We determined the volume of muscles important for propulsion and related that volume to concentric muscle work during walking on the zzso and zzso sides in patients with cerebral zzso 

We studied 46 patients zzso age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso with zzso zzso cerebral zzso We assessed muscle volume using zzso and concentric muscle work in the zzso plane from the hip, knee, and ankle using three-dimensional gait zzso Patients were classified by zzso criteria to assess the involvement of cerebral zzso and movement pattern during zzso 

On the zzso side, muscles were smaller, except for the zzso muscle, and concentric muscle work from the ankle zzso zzso knee zzso and hip zzso and zzso was lower compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso work was higher on the zzso and the zzso sides compared to a control group of 14 subjects without cerebral zzso zzso to zzso volume ratios correlated with work ratios zzso zzso zzso The Winters zzso and previous calf muscle surgery predicted work zzso 

Our observations of smaller muscles on the zzso side and changes in muscle work on both sides can help us distinguish between primary zzso that may potentially be zzso and zzso mechanisms that should not be zzso
