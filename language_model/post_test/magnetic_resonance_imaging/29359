When people detect their own errors in a discrimination task, a zzso zzso can be observed in zzso zzso that has been coined the zzso zzso zzso Generation of the zzso has been associated with structures in the prefrontal cortex, especially the anterior zzso region, but also the supplementary motor zzso and zzso zzso There is some controversy as to whether the zzso is a necessary zzso to error zzso We examined the zzso in five patients with damage to the zzso prefrontal cortex, including the anterior zzso zzso Our findings support the implication of the zzso anterior zzso in zzso production, but they also show that subjects can be aware of errors and yet not produce an zzso Thus, error detection leads to the zzso process and damage to the anterior zzso region may interrupt this relay, suggesting that error detection may be supported by circuits outside the anterior zzso zzso
