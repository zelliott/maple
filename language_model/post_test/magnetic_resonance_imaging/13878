A zzso zzso framework is proposed to better understand the role and the zzso correlate of spatial attention zzso in visual zzso The model consists of several interconnected zzso that can be related to the different areas of the zzso and zzso paths of the visual zzso Competitive neural interactions are implemented at both microscopic and zzso levels, according to the biased competition zzso This hypothesis has been zzso confirmed in studies in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques and also in zzso recording studies in zzso Within this zzso approach, zzso simulations are carried out that describe both the zzso and the zzso zzso The proposed model draws together data of different spatial and zzso resolution, as are the zzso imaging and zzso zzso
