To assess associations between subcutaneous zzso zzso and internal zzso in patients with zzso type 1 zzso and to determine whether the association between zzso and peripheral zzso was zzso to internal zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso zzso Between 2005 and 2008, 110 zzso adults having two or more zzso were individually matched for age, sex and hospital with 110 controls who had no zzso Patients underwent standardized zzso of the spinal cord, nerve roots and zzso nerves and an zzso zzso zzso used adjusted zzso zzso zzso zzso to estimate the risk of the presence of internal zzso or peripheral zzso associated with patients presented 2 to 9 zzso at least 10 zzso as compared to patients without any zzso zzso 

Cases had a mean age of 41 zzso zzso years; 85 zzso had two to nine zzso and 21 zzso at least ten zzso zzso were more strongly associated with internal zzso in patients with ten or more zzso than in patients with fewer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The association with zzso was stronger for zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso internal zzso than with other internal zzso zzso zzso with slowed zzso zzso zzso was more strongly associated with having at least ten zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso than with having fewer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso analyses showed that the association between zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso was zzso by the association between zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso patients with zzso is zzso to associations linking zzso to internal zzso at risk for zzso transformation and to zzso zzso with slowed zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso are particularly common in patients with at least ten zzso
