Some of the outstanding cognitive capabilities of humans are commonly attributed to a disproportionate enlargement of the human frontal lobe during zzso This claim is based primarily on comparisons between the brains of humans and of other zzso to the exclusion of most great zzso We compared the relative size of the frontal zzso in living specimens of several zzso species, including all extant zzso using magnetic resonance zzso Human frontal zzso were not disproportionately large in comparison to those of the great zzso We suggest that the special cognitive abilities attributed to a frontal advantage may be due to differences in individual cortical areas and to a richer zzso none of which required an increase in the overall relative size of the frontal lobe during zzso zzso
