zzso monitoring of zzso in diseased tissue is an important aspect of stem cell zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso based tracking of cells zzso with zzso has the potential for zzso in zzso detection and zzso assessment of implanted zzso zzso zzso with zzso appear as zzso regions on MR images and thus can be distinguished from the zzso Application of this methodology to zzso disc zzso zzso and detection of zzso cells implanted into the disc for tissue zzso was zzso zzso stem cells zzso with a zzso contrast agent were zzso in zzso to zzso characterize the signal intensity loss using zzso relaxation parameters zzso zzso and zzso To determine whether zzso cells could be detected within scaffolds suitable for zzso zzso cells were seeded within both natural and synthetic zzso and zzso using zzso zzso cells were loaded within zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso using both zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were also loaded into zzso gels, and detected ex zzso within rat zzso using zzso Lastly, the effect of zzso zzso on cell viability was zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrate the greatest signal intensity loss and contrast on zzso zzso zzso cells can be detected in both synthetic and natural zzso and can be distinguished from the native tissue environment of the rat zzso Finally, zzso does not significantly impair cell zzso zzso this technique shows promise as a potential method for in zzso zzso tracking of stem cell based zzso of the zzso
