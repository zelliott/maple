Early detection and site location of zzso cerebral zzso helps design optimum therapeutic regimen, which contributes to prolonged survival time of the zzso However, diagnosing the zzso growth at the zzso site is a difficult zzso The diagnostic zzso to provide the most extensive zzso data is dynamic MR zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso changes can be best diagnosed using the PET and zzso techniques of nuclear medicine that employ zzso zzso acid 131 zzso zzso as the zzso Thus, for comprehensive zzso of brain zzso it is most effective to combine both the zzso and evaluate the fused zzso The aim of the present study was to verify the usefulness of the calculated zzso for a digital fusion of zzso images for the assessment of zzso site of cerebral zzso 

The findings of MR and zzso imaging for 21 patients who had surgery for cerebral zzso were subject to zzso Diagnosis was based on zzso results (8 cases of zzso zzso and 13 cases of zzso zzso The site and size of the contrast enhancement areas from MR was compared with the hot focus location from zzso 

The study confirmed the feasibility of digital fusion of images yielded by zzso and zzso The fused images reflect the zzso of the zzso site of cerebral zzso zzso enhancement areas only partially overlapped with the hot zzso which, zzso were found to be substantially zzso 

The consistency of zzso locations detected with MR and zzso was higher for zzso of the zzso zzso type than for zzso zzso zzso zzso of pathological zzso
