Working memory involves the short-term maintenance of an active representation of information so that it is available for further zzso Visual working memory tasks, in which subjects retain the memory of a stimulus over brief delays, require both the zzso zzso of the stimulus and the subsequent maintenance of its representation after the stimulus is removed from zzso Such tasks activate multiple areas in visual and prefrontal zzso To delineate the roles these areas play in perception and working memory zzso we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to obtain dynamic measures of neural activity related to different components of a face working memory zzso transient responses to visual zzso selective transient responses to faces, and sustained responses over memory zzso Three zzso areas in the zzso object vision zzso had mostly transient responses to zzso indicating their zzso role in zzso processing, whereas three prefrontal areas demonstrated sustained activity over memory delays, indicating their zzso role in working zzso This distinction, however, was not zzso Additionally, the visual areas demonstrated different degrees of zzso and the prefrontal areas demonstrated different strengths of sustained activity, revealing a zzso of functional zzso from zzso through multiple prefrontal areas, regarding each area's relative contribution to zzso and zzso zzso
