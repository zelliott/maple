zzso implants are in most cases a strict zzso for zzso zzso as zzso zzso applied during the zzso measurement can lead to severe heating of the surrounding zzso zzso and mapping of these heating effects is therefore crucial for determining the circumstances under which patient examinations are zzso The use of zzso zzso is the standard procedure for monitoring these heating zzso However, the observed temperature increase is highly dependent on the positioning of such a probe, as it can only determine the temperature zzso zzso mapping with zzso after zzso heating can be used, but cooling effects during imaging lead to a significant zzso of the heating zzso In this work, an zzso zzso method was combined with an zzso heating zzso allowing for temperature mapping during zzso zzso This technique may provide new opportunities for implant safety zzso
