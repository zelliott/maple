The zzso degree of pancreatic zzso can be assessed preoperatively by using the zzso intensity curve zzso of the zzso obtained from dynamic magnetic resonance zzso 

To identify risk factors for zzso pancreatic zzso leakage and to assess the impact of pancreatic zzso on this complication, 89 patients who underwent a pancreatic head zzso with an zzso zzso between December 1998 and August 2005 were zzso zzso The pancreatic zzso profiles were classified into 3 zzso type I, indicating a normal zzso without zzso and types II and III indicating zzso zzso 

zzso zzso leakage occurred in 14 patients zzso In a zzso analysis, pancreatic texture zzso zzso versus zzso zzso versus soft, zzso p zzso zzso pancreatic duct size zzso 3 zzso zzso versus zzso 3 zzso zzso p zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso II, III, zzso versus type I, zzso p zzso zzso were notably associated with pancreatic zzso zzso In a multivariable analysis, pancreatic zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was the only marked independent predictor of zzso pancreatic zzso A zzso of 52 patients with type I pancreatic zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso to be a notable predictor of leakage and pancreatic leakage developed in diabetic patients with a high zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso than in those with a normal zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso from dynamic zzso provides reliable information for predicting risk of pancreatic zzso leakage after pancreatic head zzso Especially in patients with type I pancreatic zzso the presence of uncontrolled diabetes is considered a primary risk factor for zzso pancreatic zzso
