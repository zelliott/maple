The human zzso virus zzso damages zzso regions, and is associated with deficits in executive zzso We recently developed a semantic event sequencing task based on the Picture zzso zzso of the zzso Adult Intelligence zzso for use with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and found recruitment of zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso in healthy zzso To assess the impact of zzso on the functioning of the zzso zzso and prefrontal cortex, we administered this task to 11 zzso and 11 Control participants matched for age and zzso zzso evaluation demonstrated that the zzso group had mild impairment in memory retrieval and motor zzso but was not zzso zzso zzso suggested no zzso in zzso zzso zzso The results of the zzso analysis revealed zzso of the left zzso left zzso prefrontal cortex, and bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso in the zzso zzso zzso connectivity analysis demonstrated less functional connectivity between the zzso and prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso regions in the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso group demonstrated increased zzso of right zzso zzso and greater connectivity between the zzso and this same anterior zzso zzso The results of this study extend previous investigations by demonstrating compromised function of the zzso and connected prefrontal regions in zzso during zzso This disruption of zzso zzso likely precedes the development of cognitive impairment in zzso
