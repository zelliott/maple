The use of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging as a quantitative lung imaging tool has progressed rapidly in the past decade, mostly in the assessment of the airway diseases chronic zzso pulmonary disease and zzso This technique has shown potential to assess both structural and functional information in healthy and diseased zzso In this study, the regional zzso of structure and function were applied to a zzso rat model of zzso lung zzso 

Male zzso rats zzso zzso zzso were administered zzso zzso After 3 weeks, apparent diffusion zzso and fractional ventilation were measured by zzso magnetic resonance imaging and pulmonary function testing using a zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy animals were then compared using threshold analysis to assess the potential sensitivity of these techniques to pulmonary zzso 

No significant changes were observed in total lung volume and compliance between the two zzso zzso resistance elevated and forced zzso volume significantly declined in the zzso zzso rats, and fractional ventilation was significantly decreased compared to control animals zzso zzso zzso The apparent diffusion zzso of zzso showed a smaller change but still a significant decrease in zzso zzso animals zzso zzso zzso 

zzso results suggest that quantitative zzso magnetic resonance imaging can be a sensitive and zzso tool to assess changes in an animal zzso lung disease zzso This technique may be useful for zzso animal studies and also in the investigation of human zzso lung zzso
