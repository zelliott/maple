zzso of the liver to a predetermined size after zzso or transplantation is a well described phenomenon, but the time course over which these events occur has not been well zzso It is not clear how initial liver mass, zzso zzso or zzso influence this zzso 

Liver zzso was assessed zzso by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in living right lobe liver donors and the recipients of these zzso Imaging was performed at regular intervals through 60 days after zzso and liver mass was zzso Liver function tests and synthetic function were monitored throughout the study period in donors and recipients of these zzso as well as recipients of zzso zzso 

zzso consistently overestimated liver mass by a mean of 45 g zzso zzso zzso zzso liver mass increased by zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 7, 14, 30, and 60 days after zzso zzso zzso liver mass increased by zzso zzso and zzso at 7, 14, 30, and 60 days after zzso zzso zzso did not influence the degree of zzso or graft function, nor was there a functional difference between zzso of zzso graft to recipient body weight ratio or zzso 

zzso accurately determines right lobe zzso Most liver zzso occurs in the 1st week after zzso or zzso and the time course does not differ significantly in donors or zzso The mass of the graft or remnant segment affects the duration of the zzso process, with a smaller initial liver mass zzso the zzso zzso of zzso had no bearing on liver function or zzso and, therefore, should not be an absolute criterion for exclusion of zzso A calculated graft to recipient body weight ratio of zzso is adequate for right lobe living donor liver zzso
