zzso brain imaging studies have shown abnormal neural activity in individuals recovered from anorexia zzso zzso during both cognitive and emotional task zzso It has been suggested that this abnormal activity which persists into recovery might zzso the zzso of the disorder and constitute a neural zzso for zzso However, no study to date has assessed functional changes in neural networks in the absence of zzso activity in those recovered from zzso zzso the aim of this study was to investigate whole brain resting state functional connectivity in zzso women recovered from anorexia zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 16 zzso participants recovered from anorexia zzso and 15 healthy control zzso Independent component analysis revealed functionally relevant resting state zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed increased zzso correlation zzso in the default mode network zzso which is thought to be involved in self-referential zzso Specifically, compared to healthy control participants the recovered anorexia zzso participants showed increased zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso frontal zzso The findings support the view that dysfunction in resting state functional connectivity in regions involved in self-referential processing and cognitive control might be a vulnerability marker for the development of anorexia zzso
