zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso brain maturation during the first 7 weeks after birth zzso zzso to zzso were assessed in zzso by diffusion zzso imaging zzso at zzso zzso zzso of apparent diffusion zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso were used to assess zzso zzso Because zzso zzso color zzso maps provide an efficient and straightforward way to zzso zzso direction, they were used to highlight the zzso zzso zzso In the corpus zzso the increases in zzso zzso zzso to approximately zzso from zzso to zzso were primarily dominant in the zzso direction, whereas the zzso decreased slightly zzso zzso zzso zzso to approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso Similar increases in zzso zzso zzso to approximately zzso from zzso to zzso and decreases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso were found in the cingulate, but these zzso changes were dominant in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso there were significant zzso increases zzso zzso to approximately zzso from zzso to zzso dominant in the zzso and zzso directions, whereas the zzso increased rapidly early in development zzso zzso zzso zzso to approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso There were no significant changes in tissue zzso in the zzso regions zzso zzso but the zzso decreased slightly zzso zzso zzso zzso to approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso Although the major differences in zzso values were mainly observed in white matter zzso other cortical and zzso regions showed some potential zzso changes that were consistent with classical zzso zzso In zzso these results show that high-resolution zzso at high magnetic fields allows detection and zzso of brain structures throughout normal development in zzso mice in zzso
