The desire to understand complex mental processes using functional zzso drives development of imaging techniques that scan the whole human brain at a high spatial and zzso zzso In this work, an accelerated zzso three-dimensional zzso imaging sequence is proposed to increase the zzso resolution of these zzso A combination of two modern acceleration techniques, zzso and zzso is used in the secondary phase zzso direction to reduce the scan time zzso The sequence zzso time of zzso zzso was compared with standard two-dimensional zzso imaging (3 zzso and zzso three-dimensional zzso imaging (3 zzso sequences with both block design and zzso functional zzso zzso With the same experimental setup and imaging time, the zzso resolution improvement with our sequence yields similar zzso regions in the block design functional zzso paradigm with slightly increased zzso Moreover, additional information on the timing of rapid dynamic changes was extracted from accelerated images for the case of the event related complex mental zzso
