There is no gold standard diagnostic test for zzso and evaluation of present diagnostic criteria has almost exclusively been done in populations of which the vast majority is prone to develop zzso Patients referred for a potential zzso diagnosis in whom ultimately another or no diagnosis is made are zzso reported in a systematic zzso We report, after 7 years, on the diagnoses made in a cohort of patients with suspected though zzso zzso 

We retrieved information on the current diagnosis of all patients who had visited our center between 1998 and 2001 for a second opinion concerning a possible zzso diagnosis and in whom no diagnosis had been made at that zzso 

Seventy-five patients zzso could be retrieved and zzso In seven patients, a diagnosis of zzso in eight patients another neurological diagnosis had been zzso In the remaining 60 patients, still no neurological diagnosis had been zzso 

In potential zzso patients seen in a zzso referral center, the likelihood that a patient who is not diagnosed with zzso will in the future develop a neurological disease is zzso This study suggests that, in addition to playing a role in diagnosing zzso zzso can be helpful to exclude zzso in clinically doubtful zzso
