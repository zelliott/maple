To zzso evaluate comfort and image quality of prostate zzso using two different zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty consecutive patients were zzso zzso to receive prostate zzso using either a prostate zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Patients and operators were surveyed with regard to zzso zzso Four Body zzso trained zzso rated image quality for each examination and additional selected blinded zzso zzso weighted zzso 

Average patient discomfort (on a zzso pain zzso was greater with the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso with a statistically significant difference zzso zzso to identify the zzso bundle zzso was zzso times more likely to be rated excellent with the zzso compared with the zzso zzso Image quality with zzso was zzso times more highly rated zzso In particular, zzso ratio zzso with the zzso was zzso times more highly rated than with the zzso zzso 

The smaller zzso was better tolerated by patients than the traditional zzso and resulted in at least zzso and in some instances improved image zzso This may result in fewer aborted cases and lead to decreased procedural intolerance to zzso zzso zzso
