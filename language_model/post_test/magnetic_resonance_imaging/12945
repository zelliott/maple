A limited number of reports on the long-term zzso outcome of patients with zzso treated by surgery and/or zzso are available in the zzso The aim of our study is to zzso evaluate these patients at 2 different follow-up zzso after surgery, to demonstrate a possible late zzso deterioration after an initial zzso 

Between January 1987 and May 2002, 29 patients with zzso were operated on at the zzso Department of zzso In this group we zzso identified 16 patients who had 2 different clinical zzso at a mean of zzso and zzso years, zzso We compared their zzso status using the zzso All these data were obtained from clinical charts and phone zzso 

The zzso clinical, and zzso features of our group of patients are very similar to those previously described in the zzso Comparing the global clinical status between the 2 different follow-up zzso we observed a late deterioration in 8 cases zzso A worsening of the mean G and M values of the ALS was also zzso Spinal zzso and zzso zzso did not show any signs of recurrence of the zzso 

Our study confirms the possible occurrence of a late clinical deterioration in as many as 50% of patients surgically treated for a zzso We deem that the main zzso mechanism underlining this phenomenon is a gradual and irreversible decline in spinal function related to those zzso modifications induced by the zzso and to the persistence of a state of zzso zzso of the spinal zzso zzso
