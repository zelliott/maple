The goal of this study was to examine the mechanical properties of living rat zzso contents and corresponding brain structural zzso following zzso cerebral zzso zzso 

After being zzso young adult rats were subjected to zzso zzso followed by cortical zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to zzso the zzso At the site of zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed 2 hours to 21 days later on the intact zzso zzso The zzso zzso relationship was used to calculate elastic zzso zzso and strain changes over time, and constant hold or zzso stress was used to evaluate zzso zzso These zzso were followed by zzso zzso 

At zzso sites, the zzso zzso was significantly decreased at 1-3 days and tended to be above control values at 21 zzso zzso zzso showed that the brain tended to accumulate more strain (an indicator of zzso by 1 day after the zzso Imaging and zzso studies showed local zzso and zzso at 6 hours to 3 days and zzso of zzso zzso which began at 3 days and was pronounced by 21 zzso 

The zzso properties of living rat brain change following zzso Initially, zzso and tissue necrosis occur, and the brain becomes less elastic and less zzso Later, along with undergoing zzso zzso changes, the brain tends to become stiffer than zzso These quantitative data, which are related to the physical changes in the brain following trauma and which reflect zzso impressions upon zzso will be useful for understanding emerging diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance zzso
