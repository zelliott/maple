The current study was conducted to determine whether the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso boost results in excess local failures in children with zzso 

Fifty children with a median age of zzso years underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or tumor bed zzso boost, and zzso chemotherapy for zzso For zzso patients, the zzso dose was 18 to zzso grays zzso and was followed either by an zzso zzso boost to 36 zzso and a zzso boost of 54 to zzso zzso zzso zzso 29) or by an zzso zzso boost to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For high-risk patients, the zzso dose was 36 to zzso zzso followed by an zzso zzso boost to 54 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso boost to 45 zzso and a zzso boost to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso boost to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For the zzso boost, a zzso margin around the surgical bed was treated in most zzso 

The zzso overall and zzso survival rates zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for all zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for high-risk zzso The zzso zzso control rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso failures occurred in 3 patients (including 2 patients who had distant zzso whereas an isolated zzso zzso failure occurred in 1 zzso 

The use of zzso was associated with excellent local control and did not result in excess zzso failures outside of the zzso
