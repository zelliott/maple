zzso CT zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso are being used increasingly in clinical zzso zzso offers superb spatial and contrast resolution, resulting in excellent zzso zzso zzso has the advantages of low cost, zzso and live zzso imaging without zzso zzso We sought to compare both zzso and zzso zzso of left zzso size and function with the standard reference technique, cardiac MR zzso 

In 31 patients, zzso data sets zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained on the same day without zzso All images were analyzed to obtain zzso and zzso volumes and ejection zzso using the same zzso analysis to eliminate possible zzso zzso zzso agreement was tested through linear zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to determine zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso resulted in high correlation zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso However, zzso significantly overestimated zzso and zzso volumes zzso and 19 zzso P zzso zzso resulting in a small but significant bias in ejection fraction zzso zzso underestimated zzso and zzso volumes only slightly (5 and 6 zzso with no significant bias in zzso zzso P zzso zzso The limits of agreement with zzso were comparable for the 2 zzso The zzso in the zzso zzso was roughly half of that in either zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso provides highly zzso zzso of left zzso volumes, which are significantly larger than zzso zzso zzso zzso compared more favorably with the zzso reference, albeit with higher zzso
