To date no comparison between zzso zzso zzso and 3 T magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans have been performed in assessing hip reduction in patients with hip zzso This study compares the use of these scans in assessing hip zzso 

A retrospective review of zzso T and 3 T zzso pelvic zzso in zzso zzso of the hip patients for scanner time, zzso requirement, and zzso image quality scores were zzso zzso and zzso agreement of state of hip reduction was zzso A scoring system was used to zzso compare zzso sequences between the zzso T and 3 T zzso 

Of the 37 zzso scans, scanner time and zzso requirement was not significantly different between zzso T and 3 T scans zzso zzso zzso The 3 T scans showed slightly better image quality than zzso T scans zzso zzso zzso but not significant zzso zzso zzso With regards to state of hip reduction, zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso T and zzso with 3 zzso whereas zzso agreement was zzso with zzso T and zzso with 3 zzso revealing greater consistency with 3 zzso Mean zzso score comparison of hip zzso markers show no overall statistical difference between fast hip protocol sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or magnet strength zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso fast spin echo demonstrated a statistically higher score on the 3 T versus the zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our study affirms that adequate images are zzso with fast hip zzso without additional zzso Good agreement was reached on image quality and hip state of reduction between readers for zzso T and 3 T scans, with more consistency with 3 zzso
