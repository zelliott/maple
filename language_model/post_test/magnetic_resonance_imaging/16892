This article investigates the functional connectivity patterns of the nucleus zzso zzso in 18 healthy participants using a resting state functional connectivity zzso zzso Also, a zzso connectivity modeling zzso was used to characterize patterns of functional zzso involving zzso The results of a zzso zzso of 57 zzso and PET studies were submitted to zzso likelihood zzso analysis to estimate consistent zzso patterns across the different imaging zzso The results of the combined zzso and zzso analyses show that spontaneous activity in zzso predicts activity in regions implicated in reward zzso including zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso thalamus, zzso amygdala, and zzso This confirms the key role of zzso in the zzso system, which zzso zzso from zzso and cortical zzso We also detected activity in brain regions having few or no direct anatomical connections with zzso such as zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso cortex, supporting the view that not all functional connections can be explained by anatomical connections but can also result from connections zzso by third zzso Our zzso findings are in line with the results of the zzso zzso zzso maps are zzso with zzso zzso results, and the reward paradigm class is the one that most frequently generates zzso in zzso Our results overlap considerably with recently proposed zzso of the main zzso systems in the zzso zzso and in the anterior part of the zzso zzso in zzso and nonhuman zzso
