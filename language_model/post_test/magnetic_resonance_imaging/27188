zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso in learning and memory zzso A functional genetic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which leads to blunted zzso zzso has previously been associated with explicit memory performance in several independent zzso but the underlying neural mechanisms are thus far zzso The human zzso plays a critical role in memory, particularly in the detection and zzso of novel zzso Here we investigated the relationship of zzso zzso and zzso novelty processing in 41 young, healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Participants performed a zzso task with complex scene zzso which was followed by a delayed recognition memory test 24 hours zzso Compared to His zzso zzso carriers exhibited a diminished zzso response to novel stimuli and a higher tendency to judge novel stimuli as familiar during delayed zzso Across the zzso the false alarm rate during delayed recognition correlated zzso with the zzso novelty zzso Our results suggest that previously reported effects of zzso on explicit memory performance may, at least in part, be zzso by zzso of zzso novelty zzso
