In zzso zzso of kidney and liver damage by zzso zzso Imaging zzso may offer an advantage when there is a need for a simple, zzso and rapid method for screening of the effects of potential zzso and zzso substances in chronic zzso Here, we used zzso for monitoring chronic intoxication with zzso zzso in zzso Male adult zzso rats were treated every other day for eight months, either with zzso (10 zzso zzso or zzso (10 zzso zzso Control groups were treated with vehicle zzso zzso zzso were acquired before and at the end of the eight months experimental zzso zzso injury induced by the zzso presented with the increased intensity of zzso zzso of the zzso and liver as compared to these zzso from the control animals treated for eight months, either with the vehicle solution or with zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso correlated with the increased volume density of heavily injured zzso zzso zzso zzso with heavily damaged zzso zzso zzso zzso and with volume density of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso The changes in the MR signal intensity probably reflect the presence of an abundant zzso material within the zzso zzso and proliferation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a valuable method for the in zzso screening of kidney and liver damage in rat models of intoxication with zzso and zzso agents, such as zzso
