zzso is increasingly being used to treat zzso base zzso Since 1989, 55 patients with zzso base zzso were treated at Stanford University Medical Center with linear accelerator zzso An analysis of the clinical and zzso results of this patient population was the focus of this zzso 

The mean patient age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso The mean tumor volume was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The radiation dose averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delivered with an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients were evaluated zzso through clinic notes from follow-up zzso and residual tumor volume was measured during follow-up imaging zzso The length of follow-up averaged zzso months zzso zzso zzso 

zzso stabilization after zzso was noted in 38 patients zzso shrinkage in 16 patients zzso and enlargement in only 1 patient zzso The results of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated decreased central contrast zzso in 11 zzso zzso possibly indicating evidence of central tumor necrosis or tumor vessel zzso Neurological status was improved in 15 patients in the series zzso and unchanged in 34 patients zzso Three patients zzso died during the follow-up period, all as a result of causes other than tumor zzso Three patients zzso developed new permanent symptoms (one patient with seizures, one patient with mild right zzso and one patient with both zzso and zzso nerve zzso All other complications were zzso including partial zzso nerve zzso in seven patients and zzso in three zzso The zzso zzso tumor control rate was zzso 

Although our follow-up period is short, this experience corroborates previous reports that zzso can be used to zzso selected small zzso base zzso with good clinical results and modest zzso
