In several previous studies, including one of our own, CT and zzso provided similar information on zzso detection in the staging of lung zzso Both imaging techniques can be considered effective in detecting enlarged zzso zzso zzso but the results are often inaccurate when confronted with pathological zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of zzso enhanced zzso in the detection of zzso zzso zzso in lung zzso 

A prospective study to compare standard zzso zzso and zzso enhanced zzso was carried out in patients with diagnosed lung zzso The study focused on the status of zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered at a dosage of zzso zzso before zzso weighted zzso zzso visual analyses of both standard and contrast enhanced zzso images were performed on each patient by 2 independent zzso The imaging results were then compared to pathological findings obtained after surgical zzso 

In the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso was zzso sensitive, zzso specific and zzso accurate whereas zzso enhanced zzso was zzso sensitive, zzso specific and zzso zzso 

zzso enhanced zzso was more accurate than standard zzso in the detection of zzso zzso zzso in patients with lung zzso These initial results can be considered encouraging especially with regards to the reduction of false negative findings although further confirmation is, zzso zzso
