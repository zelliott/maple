zzso evoked activity of the human zzso produces fast changes in optical properties that can be detected zzso zzso optical zzso or zzso In the present study a fast zzso response zzso approximately 100 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso by visual stimuli showed spatial zzso with zzso signals and zzso correspondence with zzso thus combining zzso spatial zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso signals were recorded from zzso and zzso zzso Both areas showed zzso peaks, but at different zzso after stimulation zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso localized zzso activity associated with information zzso The zzso resolution and spatial zzso of this signal make it a promising tool for studying the time course of activity in localized brain areas and for bridging the gap between electrical and zzso imaging zzso
