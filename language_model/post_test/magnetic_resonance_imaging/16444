To reassess the utility and zzso of ultrasound zzso screening in infants with zzso zzso skin zzso zzso that may be associated with zzso of the spinal zzso 

We conducted a prospective zzso study of 254 infants under age 6 months with suspicious zzso zzso between 2005 and zzso All infants were examined by US and zzso clinical zzso and 50 infants also underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso The US and zzso findings were analyzed for zzso zzso between the imaging findings and the presence of the low-risk skin zzso simple zzso zzso zzso and deviated zzso fold zzso 44 zzso also were zzso 

Analysis of US and zzso results for the cohort of 50 zzso in whom both examinations were performed showed high zzso The low-risk group of infants with simple zzso and zzso constituted 157 US procedures, zzso of which were of high quality, providing clear zzso of spinal zzso None demonstrated any clinically significant pathological zzso 

Our data zzso the reliability of US as a screening tool for zzso zzso zzso zzso with low-risk zzso such as simple zzso and zzso may be zzso from US zzso because these findings alone do not indicate underlying pathological zzso We propose a simplified diagnostic zzso system for zzso
