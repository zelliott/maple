zzso resonance imaging zzso has significantly extended the understanding of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso to its ability to sensitively depict the dynamics of the disease process in zzso The subject of this review is the use of zzso in the zzso setting, with emphasis on how it may be used to improve the zzso selection process at zzso zzso with active zzso are highly interesting in the study of zzso zzso but are rare in a typical autopsy material of chronic zzso The yield of zzso zzso in autopsy zzso selection can be increased by the use of zzso tissue zzso as a significant proportion of abnormalities detected by zzso zzso are not zzso zzso The majority of these zzso abnormalities have been found to represent either discrete areas of zzso zzso with no zzso zzso zzso zzso or active zzso zzso zzso by further zzso zzso The presence and extent of zzso pathology outside of the focal zzso zzso is more readily appreciated by zzso zzso zzso as has been shown in the study of extensive areas of partial zzso loss in the spinal zzso A further advantage of zzso zzso sampling is the ability to use three-dimensional and quantitative zzso The potential of zzso these with zzso data may be further exploited in the zzso The technical procedure for zzso tissue sampling at autopsy is zzso and the limitations of the technique are zzso
