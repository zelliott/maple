zzso zzso is zzso after radical zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we examined features of the male zzso and accompanying muscular zzso to predict zzso after zzso radical zzso zzso 

80 patients underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length was measured in the zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso were completed by patients at monthly zzso The primary end point was time to zzso defined as zzso 0 to 1 pad per day zzso zzso analysis was performed using Cox zzso models to create both zzso and zzso survival zzso 

Mean age was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had bilateral nerve zzso Mean zzso length was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean prostate size was zzso g zzso zzso By 3 months, 60 patients achieved 1 zzso zzso zzso weeks, zzso zzso and 34 patients achieved 0 zzso zzso zzso weeks, zzso zzso Time to social zzso was significantly related to prostate size both as a continuous variable zzso and as a zzso variable of zzso 50 zzso g zzso Increased zzso length was related to decreased time to zzso both as a continuous variable zzso and when zzso to zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso In addition to larger prostate size zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso older age zzso zzso was also associated with a longer time to achieve 0 zzso zzso analysis revealed that longer zzso length was associated with a faster recovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso After controlling for age and zzso zzso patients with a prostate size zzso 50 g had zzso lower likelihood of achieving zzso at all time points when compared with patients with prostate size zzso g zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso length increased the likelihood of achieving zzso at all time points zzso Advanced age and larger prostate size were zzso associated with zzso zzso
