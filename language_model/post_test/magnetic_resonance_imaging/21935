To ascertain whether the use of zzso transfer zzso in MR imaging can characterize tissue destruction in human zzso virus zzso patients with presumed progressive zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Brain MR studies that included zzso were obtained in three groups: 11 healthy control subjects, 10 zzso patients with clinical and zzso findings of zzso and 13 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were calculated in zzso and zzso encephalitis zzso and in zzso white matter in the patients and control zzso 

zzso zzso revealed a dramatic decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encephalitis zzso had statistically significantly higher zzso values zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso The zzso of zzso white matter was significantly higher in the control subjects zzso zzso zzso than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso or the zzso encephalitis group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso suggest the possibility of distinguishing zzso from zzso encephalitis and of indicating whether zzso encephalitis is involved in white matter that appears normal on conventional MR zzso
