To study the ability of low-cost zzso dedicated zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess and predict zzso joint damage in the wrist and zzso zzso zzso of patients with early zzso zzso 

24 previously zzso patients with zzso arthritis with joint symptoms for zzso year were evaluated at the time of diagnosis and after 6 and 12 months of zzso treatment with conventional clinical or zzso zzso zzso rays of both hands and zzso and zzso of the dominant wrist and zzso zzso 

At zzso all patients showed magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in 21 bones (10 zzso 6 zzso of these, distributed among two patients, were seen on zzso zzso One zzso ray erosion was not detected by zzso At 1 year, zzso and zzso ray detected 15 and 8 new zzso respectively, and zzso of zzso zzso at baseline had progressed to zzso ray zzso In bones with zzso zzso at zzso the relative risk of having zzso ray zzso at the zzso follow-up was zzso compared with bones without baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso If bones with baseline zzso ray zzso were zzso the relative risk was zzso In patients with baseline zzso bone erosion or zzso the relative risk of having zzso ray zzso at 1 year was zzso compared with patients without these signs at baseline zzso zzso 

In this group of patients with early zzso arthritis who were treated zzso baseline zzso zzso in zzso or wrist bones markedly increased the risk of zzso ray zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso dedicated zzso zzso is promising for assessment and zzso of early zzso zzso
