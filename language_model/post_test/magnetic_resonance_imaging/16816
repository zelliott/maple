To assess zzso the ability of quantitative zzso three-dimensional magnetic resonance zzso zzso to help identify the cause of acute graft zzso 

This zzso study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was zzso Between December 2001 and May 2009, sixty patients with transplanted zzso (41 men and 19 zzso mean age, 49 years; age range, zzso zzso were zzso Thirty-one patients had normal function and 29 had acute dysfunction due to acute rejection zzso zzso zzso acute zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso chronic rejection zzso zzso zzso or drug toxicity zzso zzso zzso MR zzso was performed at zzso T with three-dimensional zzso zzso With use of a zzso zzso model, the zzso zzso rate zzso and the mean transit time zzso of the zzso for the vascular compartment zzso the zzso compartment zzso and the collecting system compartment zzso were zzso Also derived was zzso for the whole kidney zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso and fractional zzso of each compartment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These parameters were compared in patients in the different study zzso zzso analysis was performed by using analysis of zzso 

There were significant differences in zzso and zzso between the acute dysfunction group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso seconds zzso zzso zzso and the normal function group zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso seconds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso The zzso was significantly higher in the acute rejection group zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the normal function group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso was significantly higher in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the normal function group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or in the acute rejection group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso MR zzso analyzed by using a zzso zzso kinetic zzso model may help to differentiate zzso between acute rejection and zzso after kidney zzso
