The zzso zzso and associated neural structures are hypothesized to contribute to individual differences in human spatial zzso However, functional imaging studies and theoretical models underscore the importance of zzso regions as zzso The purpose of the present study was to examine age differences in virtual environment navigation and to assess possible relationships between navigation and structural integrity of zzso and zzso brain zzso Healthy adult volunteers completed a virtual navigation task and underwent magnetic resonance imaging to assess volumes of the zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary visual zzso zzso demonstrated robust age-related differences in place zzso Moreover, individual differences in regional brain volumes as well as performance on the tests of memory and executive functions contributed to age differences in human place zzso High performance in a virtual navigation task was associated with larger volume of the zzso and prefrontal gray and white zzso zzso zzso volume was associated with improved performance in the young but not old zzso We conclude that human navigation requires both zzso and zzso brain systems and draws on executive resources for successful zzso
