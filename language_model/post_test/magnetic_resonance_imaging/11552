The authors performed this study to assess brain zzso during zzso and successful recall with a zzso memory paradigm that has previously been demonstrated to be effective for teaching students about the zzso zzso 

zzso students underwent functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging during zzso and recall of the name, number, and function of the 12 zzso zzso The students viewed zzso graphic and text slides related to individual nerves, as well as their respective control zzso For the recall zzso students were prompted with the numbers zzso zzso zzso zzso with the number 14 zzso zzso zzso were tested about their knowledge of zzso nerves outside the MR unit before and after functional MR zzso 

Students learned about the zzso nerves while undergoing functional MR imaging zzso zzso vs zzso score, zzso zzso zzso zzso a possible zzso vs zzso zzso zzso bilateral prefrontal cortex, left greater than right; P zzso zzso zzso zzso and maintained this knowledge at I zzso The zzso and recall zzso zzso distributed networks of brain zzso zzso revealed statistically significant zzso in the bilateral prefrontal cortex, left greater than right zzso bilateral zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso region, zzso zzso and zzso zzso recall activated the left much more than the right zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso bilateral zzso and zzso and right more than the left zzso zzso 

A predictable pattern of brain zzso at functional MR imaging accompanies the zzso and successful recall of the zzso nerves with this zzso memory zzso
