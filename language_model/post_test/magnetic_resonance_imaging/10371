Regional abnormalities in zzso zzso function can be detected with zzso strain zzso derived from zzso tissue zzso We studied zzso strain zzso in patients with evidence of zzso zzso by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether zzso strain could identify the severity of the zzso 

A total of 20 patients with chronic zzso zzso and 10 healthy volunteers underwent zzso zzso and cardiac magnetic resonance with delayed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso Delayed zzso zzso was graded using the following zzso 0 zzso none, 1 zzso less than zzso 2 zzso zzso to zzso 3 zzso 51% to zzso and 4 zzso greater than zzso 

There was a progressive decrease in peak zzso strain in the zzso segments as the zzso extent of zzso zzso When compared with the peak zzso strain in remote segments without evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso the strain was significantly lower in segments with greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso grade 3, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso grade 4, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

In patients with chronic zzso zzso strain zzso with zzso show a graded response of decreasing regional strain in segments with increasing zzso extent of zzso defined by zzso zzso
