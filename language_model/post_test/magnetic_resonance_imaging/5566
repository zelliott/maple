While much is known about zzso affinity profiles of antipsychotic medications, less is known about their impact on functional brain systems in patients with zzso We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies with zzso schizophrenia patients as they made zzso to unpredictable visual targets before and after 4-6 weeks of antipsychotic zzso zzso healthy individuals were scanned at similar time zzso zzso patients had less zzso in frontal and zzso eye fields and zzso After treatment these disturbances were not present, suggesting improved function in zzso and zzso zzso Other zzso abnormalities were noted in sensory and zzso prefrontal cortex, but after treatment these abnormalities were absent or less zzso in line with improved function in zzso zzso In addition, although not abnormal at zzso there was reduced activity after treatment in zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso and zzso thalamus, suggesting a potential adverse effect of treatment on zzso systems, perhaps related to zzso blockade in the zzso These findings provide evidence for a complex impact of antipsychotic medication on functional brain systems in schizophrenia and illustrate the potential of zzso zzso for both adverse and beneficial drug effects on functional brain zzso
