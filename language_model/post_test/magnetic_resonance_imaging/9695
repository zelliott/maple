zzso abnormalities in early diabetic zzso are poorly zzso We employed zzso to zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and kidney size in zzso volunteers and type 1 diabetic patients without and with early zzso zzso 

We studied ten control participants zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso nine longstanding zzso type 1 diabetic patients zzso age zzso zzso years, estimated zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and eight zzso type 1 diabetic patients zzso age zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Six zzso patients were zzso after 4 weeks without zzso system zzso Phase contrast zzso and kidney blood oxygen level dependent zzso zzso zzso were performed, before and during water zzso zzso zzso was performed at baseline urine flow zzso Renal artery flow, zzso vascular resistance zzso cortical and zzso volumes, and zzso were zzso 

Renal cortical and zzso volumes were similar in all groups zzso C 108 zzso 16, zzso 112 zzso 21, zzso 111 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso C 35 zzso 14, zzso 29 zzso 10, 33 zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso increased from control to zzso to zzso type 1 diabetic patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso correlated zzso with zzso in zzso but not in zzso diabetic zzso Renal artery flow was lower in the whole diabetes cohort zzso zzso zzso 205 vs diabetes 591 zzso 128 zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso volumes remain normal in early diabetic zzso zzso zzso flow in longstanding zzso type 1 diabetic patients may reflect zzso vascular zzso whereas in the zzso patients it may also reflect increased zzso zzso
