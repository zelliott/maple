zzso zzso tumors typically exhibit regions of zzso zzso regions within the tumor make cells less sensitive to zzso and radiation zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso has been shown to be a zzso The goal of this research was to zzso the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso zzso 

A rat zzso zzso model was zzso The zzso zzso cells were zzso injected into the rat brain to create a zzso Two weeks later, MR imaging was used to confirm the presence of a zzso Following demonstration on MR imaging of a brain zzso animals were zzso into 1 of 2 groups: 1) zzso alone zzso zzso or 2) saline zzso zzso zzso were inserted into the brain tumor and zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso were recorded before and after intravenous infusion of either zzso or zzso 

Not surprisingly, tissue zzso zzso revealed that the brain tumor was hypoxic relative to the zzso cerebral zzso brain zzso Two to 8 minutes after zzso was zzso tissue zzso zzso in the brain tumor increased above baseline by as much as zzso After this temporary zzso following zzso infusion, tumor zzso zzso returned to zzso No significant zzso in tissue zzso were seen on the zzso zzso Similarly, the saline vehicle was not observed to increase tissue zzso in either the brain tumor or the zzso brain zzso 

Administration of zzso zzso improves tissue zzso in hypoxic zzso Such an effect is one potential mechanism for the zzso previously observed after addition of zzso
