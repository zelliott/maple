zzso flow and diffusion zzso have been made for water in model porous media, using magnetic resonance zzso zzso The samples consisted of zzso glass beads of various sizes down to 1 zzso zzso Typical flow and diffusion images exhibited a spatial resolution of 117 zzso zzso 117 zzso and zzso in the range 1-2 zzso zzso of volume flow rates calculated from the flow zzso maps with values measured directly yielded good agreement in all zzso There was also good agreement between the mean diffusion zzso of water calculated from the diffusion maps and the bulk diffusion zzso for pure water at the same zzso In addition, the mean diffusion zzso did not depend on the pore sizes in the zzso diameter range of 1-3 zzso Our results also show that partial volume effects can be compensated by appropriate zzso of the images prior to the final zzso transformation in the zzso zzso
