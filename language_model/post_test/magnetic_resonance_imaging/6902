zzso cerebral zzso zzso associated with massive brain swelling is known as zzso zzso because of the rapid clinical deterioration and mortality as high as zzso unless appropriate treatment is zzso zzso zzso is an effective treatment, but patient selection, timing, functional recovery, and complications remain zzso 

Seventy-one patients with massive zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso associated with brain swelling were zzso divided into 3 groups according to the therapeutic zzso 21 patients were treated conservatively zzso zzso 50 patients were treated by external zzso zzso with zzso in 2 zzso 29 patients treated after the appearance of clinical and zzso findings of brain zzso zzso surgery zzso and 21 patients treated before the onset of brain zzso zzso surgery zzso 

The mortality at 1 and 6 months in the conservative group were zzso and zzso zzso The mortality at 1 and 6 months in the late surgery group were significantly improved to zzso and zzso respectively, zzso zzso zzso and in the early surgery group were further improved to zzso and zzso zzso The functional recovery of the patients was estimated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Index zzso at 6 months after the zzso The zzso scores of the early surgery group were significantly better than that of the late surgery group zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso score of the survivors in the late surgery group zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different from that of the conservative group zzso zzso zzso but was significantly improved in the early surgery group zzso zzso zzso compared with the late surgery group zzso zzso zzso 

Early zzso zzso with zzso before the onset of brain zzso should be performed to achieve satisfactory functional recovery if the zzso volume of the zzso cerebral zzso is more than 200 zzso and zzso zzso on the second day after the zzso shows mass zzso
