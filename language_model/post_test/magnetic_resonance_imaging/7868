To evaluate the effect of flip angle zzso on accuracy and zzso zzso of zzso zzso fat fraction zzso zzso with complex zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso was estimated at zzso in 30 subjects using two sets of five zzso sequences with zzso from zzso to zzso in each zzso One set used 7 zzso repetition time and acquired 6 echoes zzso the other used 14 zzso and acquired 12 echoes zzso For each zzso in both sets the accuracy of zzso was assessed relative to MR zzso zzso using four zzso parameters zzso zzso average bias, zzso zzso Each subject had four random sequences zzso zzso zzso of zzso for each zzso was assessed with zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso comparisons were made using zzso zzso 

Most zzso provided high zzso zzso accuracy zzso range zzso to zzso slope zzso average bias zzso zzso zzso Most comparisons of zzso parameters between zzso were not zzso zzso in the zzso set, zzso of zzso and zzso provided the highest zzso while zzso of zzso and zzso provided the zzso In the zzso set, accuracy parameters did not differ consistently between zzso zzso in both sets provided high zzso zzso zzso range zzso 

zzso was zzso and, for most zzso accurate in both sequence zzso In the zzso sequence set, zzso of zzso and zzso informally provided the highest zzso In the zzso sequence set, all zzso provided similar zzso
