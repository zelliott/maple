zzso change along the zzso tract commonly occurs in association with zzso The aim of this study was to clarify whether it occurs in association with other common zzso region tumors and to zzso its mechanism as seen on MR zzso 

Fifty patients with zzso region tumors that were touching or zzso the zzso zzso underwent heavily zzso MR imaging before and after zzso 

zzso change along the zzso tract was visible on the images of four of 25 zzso zzso eight of 11 zzso one germ cell zzso and one zzso zzso and was not visible on the images of seven zzso and five zzso zzso zzso After therapeutic zzso of the zzso pathway, the zzso change disappeared and large zzso spaces, present under normal conditions, became visible along the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso view MR images revealed that the zzso change had been located at, along, and/or around the large zzso spaces along the zzso zzso 

zzso change occurs in association with zzso region tumors other than zzso It is related with zzso of normally present large zzso spaces adjacent to the zzso zzso Because zzso spaces are speculated to be a drainage route of zzso fluid into the zzso space, their zzso may be related to the fluid retention in and along the zzso spaces, the outlet of which into the zzso and/or zzso zzso is blocked by zzso region zzso
