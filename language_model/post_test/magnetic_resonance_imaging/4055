zzso evidence has suggested that the abnormalities in brain zzso observed in schizophrenia are similar to those seen in zzso lobe zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the features of these groups directly with measures of the brain using magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso measures of zzso and zzso volumes obtained from zzso MR images were studied in 32 patients with zzso schizophrenia zzso 39 patients with zzso (21 left, 18 zzso and 42 healthy zzso 

zzso volumes in the zzso and zzso groups were both significantly larger that those seen in controls and did not differ from each zzso The zzso group showed significantly larger zzso zzso while the zzso group had relatively larger frontal zzso zzso of zzso volumes revealed a significant group by zzso zzso The zzso group showed relative reductions in left zzso volume that were comparable only to zzso patients with zzso originating from the left zzso 

The results indicate that zzso and zzso groups both show evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormalities of the zzso formation in zzso and left zzso are comparable, and may be specific to zzso zzso
