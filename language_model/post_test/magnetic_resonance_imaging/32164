zzso zzso is a new oral zzso agent under evaluation for the treatment of zzso multiple zzso 

We randomly assigned 281 patients to receive oral zzso at a dose of zzso zzso or zzso zzso or a zzso once daily, and we followed these patients for 6 months with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and clinical evaluations zzso study, months 0 to zzso The primary end point was the total number of zzso zzso recorded on zzso zzso at monthly intervals for 6 zzso In an extension study in which the investigators and patients remained unaware of the dose assignments zzso 7 to zzso patients who received zzso underwent zzso again to one of the zzso zzso 

A total of 255 patients completed the core zzso The median total number of zzso zzso on zzso was lower with zzso zzso of zzso (1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso (3 zzso zzso than with zzso (5 zzso The annualized zzso rate was zzso in the zzso group, as compared with zzso in the group given zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the group given zzso zzso of zzso zzso For the 227 patients who completed the extension study, the number of zzso zzso and zzso rates remained low in the groups that received continuous zzso and both measures decreased in patients who switched from zzso to zzso zzso events included zzso zzso headache, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels were more frequent with zzso (10 to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso One case of the zzso zzso zzso syndrome occurred in the zzso zzso zzso was also associated with an initial reduction in the heart rate and a modest decrease in the forced zzso volume in 1 zzso 

In this zzso study, zzso reduced the number of zzso detected on zzso and clinical disease activity in patients with multiple zzso zzso in larger, longer-term studies is zzso zzso numbers, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
