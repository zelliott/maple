There is limited knowledge of the zzso pattern of the development of fetal zzso bulbs and zzso 

To describe the zzso appearance of zzso bulbs and zzso in normal in zzso fetuses according to zzso zzso 

zzso bulbs and zzso were zzso assessed on brain zzso examinations of 88 normal fetuses between 24 and 39 weeks zzso zzso Two reference zzso were involved in the study and both used routine protocols that included zzso and zzso zzso and zzso sequences at zzso zzso The results were compared both with the commonly used zzso data in the literature and with personal zzso zzso zzso zzso test or zzso exact test were zzso One case of zzso zzso associated with CHARGE syndrome was zzso 

zzso zzso sequences were the most sensitive for detecting zzso bulbs and zzso zzso zzso were significantly better detected from 30 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso development of these zzso zzso bulbs were better detected from 30 to 34 weeks zzso zzso zzso with zzso data confirmed the zzso development of the zzso and showed an important delay in detection of the zzso structures zzso and zzso No difference was observed between the two zzso zzso 

To date, fetal zzso can depict zzso zzso from 30 weeks zzso age zzso and zzso bulbs from 30 to 34 weeks zzso zzso This preliminary reference standard is useful to assess the zzso of the zzso system and to diagnose zzso zzso
