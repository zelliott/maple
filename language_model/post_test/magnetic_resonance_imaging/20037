Recent reports have shown abnormalities on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with right zzso zzso tract zzso zzso 

zzso of this study were to demonstrate abnormalities on zzso and zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso and their correlation with the outcome of zzso zzso zzso 

We studied 41 patients with symptomatic zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso and cardiac zzso were performed on every zzso An evaluation of structural zzso chamber size, function, and wall motion zzso of the left and right zzso was performed by zzso zzso wall thinning was evaluated by the black blood technique and fatty zzso was evaluated by the zzso image with and without fat zzso 

zzso abnormalities were demonstrated in 24 zzso patients with zzso zzso The abnormalities included localized wall bulging in 22 zzso focal wall thinning in 10 zzso and fatty replacement in 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in only one patient in the control group zzso zzso zzso Late zzso from zzso were demonstrated in six zzso patients but none in the controls zzso zzso zzso Among 29 patients who underwent zzso zzso 3 patients had a failed procedure and 3 having zzso recurrence needed repeated zzso zzso abnormalities and late zzso were associated with an zzso outcome of zzso zzso 

zzso abnormalities were frequently found in patients with zzso zzso zzso abnormalities and late zzso can predict outcomes of zzso zzso
