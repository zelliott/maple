Human language requires constant learning of new words, leading to the acquisition of an average vocabulary of more than 30,000 words in adult zzso The ability to learn new words is highly variable and may rely on the integration between auditory and motor zzso Here, we combined diffusion imaging zzso and functional zzso to study whether the strength of anatomical and functional connectivity between auditory and motor language networks is associated with word learning zzso Our results showed that performance in word learning zzso with zzso properties and strength of functional connectivity of the direct connections between zzso and zzso territories in the left zzso This study suggests that our ability to learn new words relies on an efficient and fast communication between zzso and frontal zzso The absence of these connections in other animals may explain the unique ability of learning words in zzso
