zzso zzso is a prominent feature of abdominal zzso aneurysm zzso zzso We used a combined imaging approach with zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso to study zzso zzso and zzso in experimental AAA zzso zzso zzso were created via zzso infusion of zzso pancreatic zzso Mice were zzso over 14 days after injection of prepared zzso zzso For zzso zzso were from transgenic mice expressing zzso For zzso zzso were labeled with iron oxide zzso zzso zzso during aneurysm progression was observed by in zzso zzso and by in zzso zzso zzso Mice were sacrificed after imaging for zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated high signal in the AAA by days 7 and 14, which correlated significantly with zzso number and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at day 14 demonstrated zzso signal loss in the AAA and not in sham zzso zzso and zzso blue zzso confirmed the presence of injected zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso provide complementary approaches to track zzso zzso and zzso in experimental zzso Similar dual imaging strategies may aid the study of AAA biology and the evaluation of novel zzso
