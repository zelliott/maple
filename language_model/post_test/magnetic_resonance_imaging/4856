We have been engaged in the zzso phase zzso synthesis zzso synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously demonstrated to bind to the so-called zzso domain of the zzso protein zzso Analysis of the target zzso by a combination of zzso zzso and zzso revealed the presence of two zzso arising out of the zzso of the zzso zzso with the percentage of the zzso component assessed as zzso We performed the synthesis of zzso zzso using different zzso and conventional zzso zzso conditions in attempts to reduce the level of zzso of the zzso zzso and to determine at which part of the synthetic cycle the zzso had zzso We determined that zzso occurred mainly during the zzso removal and, to a much lesser extent, during zzso of the zzso zzso We were able to obtain the desired zzso with a zzso zzso purity zzso zzso as zzso by utilizing zzso zzso at zzso and power 22 Watts, when the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used, together with zzso as an zzso base, for the incorporation of this zzso and zzso zzso as an zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso analogue of the above zzso zzso zzso was always obtained as a single zzso by using a range of standard zzso and zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso of zzso under both zzso and zzso conventional zzso zzso conditions, is very facile but can be limited through the use of the above stated zzso
