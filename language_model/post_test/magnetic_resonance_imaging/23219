zzso stress disorder zzso is an unusual diagnosis in requiring an external environmental zzso to be present, in addition to the conventional signs and zzso Early controversies surrounded the zzso of its criteria and whether there was a common neural basis for this zzso This review summarizes recent zzso studies, which have begun to clarify the basis of zzso by combining imaging data with investigations of the stress response, and by employing fear and extinction learning zzso to probe the underlying neural changes in those with the zzso 

We examine the recent literature with three main zzso First, to assess whether structural changes in zzso are zzso of or secondary to the zzso Second, to zzso current understanding of the relationship between neural zzso and the stress responses within the zzso nervous system in zzso patients and zzso Finally, we examine neural mechanisms underlying the response to fear and zzso demonstrating how these are altered in zzso 

A greater understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying healthy responses to fear and stress, and their zzso in zzso has opened up a new spectrum of possible pharmacological agents by which to approach to zzso therapy and has begun to reveal the neural processes underlying the common failure of response to current zzso
