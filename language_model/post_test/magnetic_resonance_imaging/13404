The intensity of MR signal depends on several zzso such as zzso density zzso relaxation times zzso and zzso repetition time zzso and echo time zzso A theoretical model describes this zzso which is currently employed for image zzso It allows the evaluation of image contrast once the tissue parameters are zzso The zzso theoretical model was tested with the use of zzso samples at various zzso for which zzso and zzso values were known from the zzso Our unit was an zzso MR zzso which employed a zzso zzso magnetic zzso We used zzso sequences with zzso zzso 500, 1000 zzso and TE ranging from 50 to 150 zzso Signal intensity was measured both by direct access to the data zzso and with the use of the zzso intensity calculation program for regions of zzso The difference in the signals corresponding to the various samples were determined to evaluate the zzso Our results are in strict agreement with those from the theoretical zzso The latter can thus be employed for image zzso
