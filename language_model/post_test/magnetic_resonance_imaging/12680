In acute zzso with zzso zzso status zzso zzso zzso white matter zzso on zzso images are sometimes encountered on magnetic resonance imaging zzso such as in acute zzso with zzso zzso and late reduced diffusion zzso We report here a severe case of zzso following respiratory zzso virus infection, with emphasis on the zzso zzso zzso zzso in this patient showed widespread zzso along the cerebral cortical gray matter from day 3 to day zzso zzso with reduced diffusion were noted on day 3 in the deep zone of gray matter of the left zzso cortex, but on day 7 they shifted to the zzso white matter of both the cerebral zzso These zzso findings provide zzso evidence for damage to the cortical gray matter in zzso The serial change of zzso images suggests that the cortical gray matter may be injured prior to the involvement of the zzso white zzso
