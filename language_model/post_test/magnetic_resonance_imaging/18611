Is there a single executive process or are there multiple executive processes that work together towards the same goal in some zzso In these experiments, we use counter switching and response zzso tasks to examine the neural zzso of two cognitive processes that have often been identified as potential executive zzso the switching of attention between tasks, and the resolution of interference between competing task zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso for both zzso and blocked design tasks, we find evidence for common neural areas across both tasks in bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso BA zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) and zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso However, we also find areas zzso involved in the switching of attention between mental counts zzso 7, BA zzso and the zzso of a zzso motor response zzso 6, BA 10), zzso These findings provide evidence for the zzso of cognitive processes underlying executive zzso
