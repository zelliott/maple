zzso magnetic stimulation zzso is progressively gaining relevance as a tool in cognitive zzso and clinical zzso However, most studies in this field do not consider individual zzso zzso devices allow to guide the zzso to a specific cortical area, predetermined by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso it is crucial to know whether the area of a certain function as identified by zzso zzso to the area where the zzso should be placed in order to influence this zzso 

We investigated the spatial relation between the cortical area activated by a motor task in zzso and the area of zzso evoked motor zzso zzso in 8 subjects, using a spacing of zzso zzso A zzso system was adapted for zzso positioning and for the registration of the stimulation zzso 

A spatial divergence of the centers of gravity from zzso and zzso was found with a mean distance of about 10 zzso with the zzso centers being, by a mean derivation of zzso zzso consistently anterior to the center of zzso zzso However, regarding zzso areas and zzso activities, a large overlap was found for stimulation zzso of both 110 and zzso motor zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso zzso is useful for zzso investigation of individual cortical functions predetermined by zzso Whereas both are zzso by and large zzso zzso in the exact spatial relation between zzso and zzso areas should be considered and further zzso
