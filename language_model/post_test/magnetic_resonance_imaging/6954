Here we report our experience in a general hospital setting using zzso zzso to diagnose patients with suspect Parkinson's disease zzso 

Thirty consecutive patients zzso zzso mean age: zzso zzso were zzso zzso Patients underwent zzso zzso at zzso or CT zzso when zzso was zzso to rule out focal brain zzso Motor and cognitive function were evaluated by zzso with zzso and zzso e zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assessed with zzso was classified as normal, zzso abnormal zzso or zzso Imaging results zzso were correlated with the neurological zzso 

In 5 patients the zzso brain zzso was normal, suggesting that their symptoms could be related to a benign disorder such as essential zzso Two patients had zzso zzso brain zzso with zzso findings compatible with zzso cerebrovascular zzso In the remaining 23 patients abnormal zzso zzso zzso correlated with neurological findings, significantly increasing the probability of Parkinson's zzso In these patients zzso scans were normal, or showed a mild BA, or mild cerebral vascular disease zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso scan could be used routinely in clinical practice to support the diagnosis of zzso and to differentiate between other zzso Moreover, zzso could significantly impact treatment selection and follow-up of these zzso
