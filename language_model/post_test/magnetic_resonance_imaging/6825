To evaluate the magnetic resonance zzso zzso findings in patients with frozen zzso 

zzso MR zzso of 22 patients (six women, 16 zzso mean age, zzso zzso with frozen shoulder treated with zzso zzso were compared with zzso of 22 zzso and zzso control subjects without frozen zzso The thickness of the zzso ligament zzso and the joint zzso as well as the volume of the zzso zzso were measured zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso fat, superior zzso zzso superior border of the zzso tendon, long biceps tendon, and zzso recess were analyzed in consensus by two blinded zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with frozen shoulder had a significantly thickened zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso in zzso and a thickened joint capsule in the rotator cuff zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso for both zzso zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso The volume of the zzso recess was significantly smaller in patients with frozen shoulder than in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to 4 zzso or more had a specificity of zzso and a sensitivity of 59% for diagnosis of frozen zzso zzso of the capsule in the rotator cuff zzso to 7 zzso or more had a specificity of zzso and a sensitivity of zzso zzso abnormalities at the superior border of the zzso zzso were significantly more common in patients with frozen shoulder than in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Complete obliteration of the fat triangle between the zzso and the zzso process zzso triangle zzso was specific zzso but not sensitive zzso 

zzso of the zzso and the joint capsule in the rotator cuff zzso as well as the zzso triangle sign, are characteristic MR zzso findings in frozen zzso
