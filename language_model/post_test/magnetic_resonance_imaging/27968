A technique for zzso zzso muscle forces based on zzso and anatomical parameters is zzso In the present study, we record zzso from five muscles acting at the zzso during a series of zzso zzso in zzso extension, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The method then uses these zzso signals and the necessary anatomical data to estimate individual muscle zzso For one subject, complete anatomical parameters were estimated by zzso reconstruction of muscle moment arms and lines of muscle zzso In all subjects, the errors associated with zzso in the zzso signals were reduced through the use of signal processing techniques and intensive subject zzso These zzso force estimates were then validated by evaluations at zzso directions in which no mechanical zzso zzso The stability of the solution space was examined using zzso Carlo zzso The results of our study show that individual muscle forces at the wrist can be estimated with considerable zzso without assuming any control strategy (as is done with zzso zzso However, due to the limited mechanical zzso of the zzso it is uncertain whether the method can be used to estimate muscle forces in more highly redundant zzso
