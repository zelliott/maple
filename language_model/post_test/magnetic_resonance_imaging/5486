zzso imaging studies of single word production have consistently reported zzso of the lateral prefrontal and zzso zzso Its contribution has been shown to be sensitive to task demands, which can be manipulated by the degree of response zzso Compared with classical verbal zzso free word association relies less on response restrictions but to a greater extent on zzso binding zzso usually zzso by the zzso To zzso the relevance of the frontal and zzso areas during verbal retrieval tasks, we applied varying degrees of response zzso During zzso data zzso 18 subjects performed a free verbal association zzso a semantic verbal zzso zzso task, and a zzso verbal zzso zzso zzso zzso guided word production served as a baseline condition to control for basic zzso and reading zzso As expected, increased brain activity was observed in the left lateral and bilateral zzso frontal zzso for zzso and zzso The anterior zzso zzso was the only structure common to both zzso tasks in direct comparison to the less restricted zzso zzso The zzso was engaged during zzso and semantic zzso Interestingly, zzso activity was selectively evident during zzso in direct comparison to zzso when it was controlled for zzso zzso The current data confirm the role of the left zzso network in constrained word zzso zzso activity during spontaneous word production is a novel finding and seems to be dependent on the retrieval process zzso zzso zzso rather than the variety of zzso relationships that is zzso
