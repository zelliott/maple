zzso is associated with zzso decreases of cortical zzso Whether these zzso decreases imply abnormalities in cortical zzso surface, or cortical folding is not zzso Due to differences in zzso cortical zzso and zzso might be zzso affected by zzso zzso we examined differences in zzso and zzso cortical zzso surface, zzso and volume between a minimally treated male adolescent population with zzso zzso psychosis zzso and a healthy control group, with zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging brain scans were obtained from 49 adolescent zzso patients and 34 healthy control zzso zzso were younger than 18 years (age range 12 zzso zzso and zzso patients had a duration of positive symptoms of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso psychosis was associated with local bilateral cortical thinning and volume deficits in both the zzso and zzso of the superior zzso zzso and the inferior, middle, zzso and superior prefrontal zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of patients, zzso cortical thickness was thinner, whereas zzso thickness was zzso Patients exhibited cortical thinning together with a decreased degree of cortical folding in the right superior frontal zzso 

zzso thinning of both zzso and zzso seem to zzso most cortical volume deficits in adolescent patients with zzso Except for the right superior frontal region, the degree of cortical folding was normal in regions showing decreased cortical zzso suggesting that the process of cortical thinning in adolescent patients with zzso primarily takes place after the formation of cortical zzso
