zzso has advanced to become a complete zzso platform with applications across many disciplines of scientific zzso While optical techniques are primarily used as modes of zzso magnetic resonance zzso is emerging as a potentially powerful and complementary tool because of its zzso operation and zzso zzso Two prevailing limitations currently inhibit MR techniques on zzso zzso poor sensitivity and the relatively slow time scale of dynamics that can be zzso It is commonly assumed that the time scale of observation of one variable limits the certainty with which one can measure the complementary zzso For example, short observation times imply poor spectral zzso In this article, we demonstrate a new methodology that overcomes this fundamental limit, allowing in principle for arbitrarily high zzso resolution with a sensitivity across the entire zzso device several orders of magnitude greater than is possible by direct MR zzso The enhancement is evidenced by recording chemically resolved fluid mixing through a complex zzso zzso device at 500 frames per second, the highest recorded in a magnetic resonance imaging zzso The key to this development is combining remote detection with a time zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso detection zzso the problem of insensitive direct MR detection on a zzso device where the direct sensitivity is less than zzso relative to traditional zzso while the time slicing eliminates the constraints of the limited observation time by converting the time variable into a spatial variable through the use of magnetic field zzso This method has implications for observing fast zzso such as fluid zzso rapid zzso and certain classes of chemical reactions with zzso zzso time resolution and as a new zzso for zzso zzso
