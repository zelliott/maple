In this work, we report a zzso zzso zzso system, zzso zzso as an zzso contrast agent zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso B zzso zzso It was prepared by zzso decomposition and modified zzso zzso The zzso with varying iron to zzso ratios displayed different saturated zzso and zzso In zzso zzso of rats injected zzso with zzso zzso exhibited enhancement of the zzso contrast in brain zzso in particular a zzso enhancement in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This is attributable to the gradual degradation of zzso zzso in the liver, resulting in the slow release of zzso zzso into the blood pool and, zzso zzso in the brain zzso Thus, zzso contrast enhancement was clearly detected in the zzso structure of the brain as time zzso In addition, zzso images of the liver showed a gradual zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate the concept of the slow release of zzso for zzso This new zzso zzso contrast agent allows one simple intravenous injection (rather than multiple zzso of zzso zzso and results in zzso of the detailed zzso zzso in zzso zzso this provides the advantage of the long-term study of neural zzso
