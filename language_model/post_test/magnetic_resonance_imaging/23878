We used zzso to examine neural responses when subjects experienced a tactile stimulus that was either self-produced or zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed increased levels of activity when the stimulus was zzso zzso In the zzso there was less activity associated with a movement that generated a tactile stimulus than with a movement that did zzso This difference suggests that the zzso is involved in predicting the specific sensory consequences of movements and providing the signal that is used to zzso the sensory response to zzso zzso In this paper, we use zzso analyses to test this hypothesis zzso Specifically, we predicted that activity in the zzso contributes to the decrease in zzso zzso activity during self-produced tactile zzso Evidence in favor of this hypothesis was obtained by demonstrating that activity in the zzso and primary and secondary zzso zzso significantly zzso on activity in the zzso when tactile stimuli were self-produced but not when they were zzso zzso This supports the proposal that the zzso is involved in predicting the sensory consequences of zzso In the present study, this prediction is accurate when tactile stimuli are self-produced relative to when they are zzso produced, and is therefore used to zzso the zzso response to the former type of tactile stimulation but not the zzso
