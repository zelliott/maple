White matter zzso zzso are frequently observed on zzso scans of elderly zzso people and have been associated in the past with cognitive impairment and physical zzso Individual differences in the prevalence and severity of zzso have been documented and more recently we reported on the significant contribution of genetic influences to this zzso The objective of the present study was to further zzso in the context of a behavioral genetic zzso the nature of the association between zzso and cognitive and physical zzso zzso brain scans and a battery of zzso and physical function tests were given to 142 zzso twin pairs zzso zzso zzso and 70 zzso zzso participants in the 4th exam of the zzso Twin zzso zzso genetic modeling was used to estimate the genetic and/or environmental zzso between zzso and cognitive and physical summary zzso The zzso association between zzso and cognitive function in this sample of twins was modest but statistically zzso zzso analyses of cognitive and physical function summary scores found that zzso to zzso of the observed zzso was due to genetic zzso A further decomposition of the zzso association between zzso and cognitive function found that zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso was due to common genetic zzso Similar results explained the association between zzso and performance on two physical function zzso We conclude from these analyses that common genetic influences explain to a large extent previously observed zzso associations between large amounts of zzso and poor cognitive and physical function in the zzso
