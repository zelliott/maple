Human brain functional networks are embedded in anatomical space and have zzso zzso zzso zzso degree zzso are comparable to many other complex zzso Although a sophisticated set of measures is available to describe the zzso of brain networks, the selection pressures that drive their formation remain largely zzso Here we consider zzso models for the probability of a functional connection (an zzso between two cortical regions zzso separated by some zzso distance in anatomical zzso In particular, we propose a model in which the embedded zzso of brain networks emerges from two competing factors: a distance penalty based on the cost of maintaining long-range zzso and a zzso term that favors links between regions sharing similar zzso We show that, together, these two biologically plausible factors are sufficient to capture an impressive range of zzso properties of functional brain zzso Model parameters estimated in one set of functional zzso zzso data on normal volunteers provided a good fit to networks estimated in a second independent sample of zzso zzso Furthermore, slightly zzso model parameters also generated a reasonable simulation of the abnormal properties of brain functional networks in people with zzso We therefore anticipate that many aspects of brain network organization, in health and disease, may be zzso explained by an economical zzso rule for the probability of functional connectivity between different brain zzso
