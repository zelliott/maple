zzso spin labeling zzso is a magnetic resonance imaging zzso method that provides a highly zzso quantitative measure of cerebral blood flow zzso As compared to the more commonly used blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso methods, zzso techniques measure a more biologically specific correlate of neural activity, with the potential for more accurate zzso of the location and magnitude of neural zzso Recent advances in acquisition and analysis methods have improved the somewhat limited sensitivity of zzso to zzso changes associated with neural zzso In addition, zzso zzso measures are insensitive to the zzso fluctuations commonly observed in zzso experiments and can make use of imaging sequences that are less sensitive than zzso contrast to signal loss caused by magnetic zzso zzso zzso measures of zzso can aid in the interpretation of the zzso signal change and, when combined with zzso can measure the change in oxygen zzso accompanying changes in behavioral zzso Whether used alone to probe neural activity or in combination with zzso techniques, zzso methods are contributing to the field's understanding of healthy and zzso brain zzso
