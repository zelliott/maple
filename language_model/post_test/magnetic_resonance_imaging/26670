We wanted to compare the two-dimensional zzso fast spin echo zzso techniques and the three-dimensional zzso fast field echo techniques for the evaluation of the zzso zzso using a zzso zzso 

Twenty five patients who underwent total knee zzso were included in this zzso zzso zzso evaluation of the zzso was performed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso fast spin echo images zzso the zzso zzso images zzso the intermediate zzso suppressed fast spin echo images zzso the zzso zzso field echo images zzso the zzso water selective cartilage scan zzso and the zzso water selective fluid scan zzso were obtained on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso cartilage was evaluated in nine zzso the superior, middle and the inferior portions that were subdivided into the zzso central and lateral zzso in a total of 215 zzso zzso the zzso grading system, the zzso grade zzso II and III zzso were compared using the gross and microscopic zzso The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were evaluated for each zzso The significance of the differences for the individual sequences was calculated using the zzso zzso 

The gross and microscopic findings demonstrated 167 grade zzso zzso 40 grade II zzso and eight grade III zzso zzso had the highest accuracy zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso respectively), zzso zzso respectively), zzso zzso respectively), zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso There were statistically significant differences for the zzso and zzso and for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso images obtained with a zzso zzso show best diagnostic performance among the zzso and zzso zzso images for evaluating the zzso zzso
