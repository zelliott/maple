A mathematical analysis of zzso artifacts often seen in zzso zzso images zzso is zzso These artifacts result from phase and zzso zzso between lines of zzso in the zzso direction, and timing zzso from system filter zzso Phase zzso and time delays are often measured using zzso scans, to reduce zzso through zzso From the expressions describing zzso artifacts, criteria were established for reducing zzso to acceptable zzso zzso the zzso ratio zzso requirements for zzso of time delays and phase zzso determined from reference scans, was evaluated to establish the effect of zzso error on artifact reduction for zzso zzso zzso resulting from these effects can be reduced to very low levels when appropriate reference scan zzso is zzso This has important implications for functional zzso zzso and applications involving small changes in signal zzso
