We studied the utility of magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies for workers' compensation patients with hand conditions in which the referring doctor obtained the zzso We compared the zzso findings with the eventual clinical zzso We also investigated the approximate cost of these zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed the charts of all workers' compensation patients seen in a hand and upper zzso practice over the course of 3 zzso We selected patients who had zzso studies of the affected upper zzso before referral to the senior author zzso We reviewed the charts for information regarding zzso referral diagnoses, zzso diagnoses made by the zzso the area of the upper zzso zzso and eventual clinical diagnoses by the senior zzso We made a determination as to whether a hand surgeon could have adequately diagnosed and treated the patients' conditions without the imaging zzso We also investigated the cost associated with these zzso 

We included 62 patients with a total of 67 zzso scans in this zzso The zzso studies did not contribute to clinically diagnosing the patients' conditions in any of the cases we zzso The hand zzso clinical diagnosis disagreed with the zzso zzso diagnosis in zzso of zzso The zzso was unnecessary to arrive at the clinical diagnosis and did not influence the treatment offered for any of the 62 zzso The total cost for the 67 zzso zzso studies was approximately zzso 

Costly imaging studies are frequently done to determine the zzso of a patient's reported zzso unfortunately, these tests are frequently unnecessary and waste zzso zzso resonance imaging scans may not be the standard for accurate diagnosis and can zzso zzso
