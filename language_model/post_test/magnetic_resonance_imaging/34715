We reviewed zzso zzso MR images in zzso subjects to analyze the size of the zzso zzso 

The zzso height in female subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater than that in male subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the data were analyzed for different age zzso sex-related differences were statistically significant only in the zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and 50- to zzso age zzso The zzso height peaked in the zzso age group and tended to decline with zzso In female subjects, however, there was a tendency for zzso height to increase again in the zzso age zzso 

The zzso height may reflect zzso neuroendocrine differences between younger and older subjects and between male and female zzso The second increase observed in female subjects may likewise reflect high zzso of zzso hormones, apparently due to an age-related decline in circulating zzso steroids and an increase in zzso zzso
