The zzso evaluation of the quantity and regional distribution of zzso tissue is one objective measure in the investigation of zzso The aim of this article was to report a comprehensive and automatic zzso method for the determination of the volumes of subcutaneous fat tissue zzso and visceral fat tissue zzso in either the whole human body or selected slices or regions of zzso Using an zzso protocol in an examination position that was convenient for volunteers and patients with severe diseases, 22 healthy subjects were zzso The software platform was able to merge zzso scans of several body regions acquired in separate zzso Through a cascade of image processing steps, zzso and zzso volumes were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as fat zzso of defined body zzso were zzso in zzso Complete three-dimensional zzso were zzso in a zzso manner with as few zzso interventions as zzso In order to determine the zzso volume, the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The advantage of the zzso zzso was the zzso of zzso volumes in regions in which standard region grow techniques zzso Using the zzso algorithm, an automatic zzso volume detection was zzso zzso data analysis was able to determine zzso and zzso volume percentages using new zzso zzso With the techniques zzso it was possible to detect changes in zzso and zzso percentages of the whole body and selected zzso The techniques presented in this study are likely to be of use in zzso zzso as well as in the examination of zzso changes in weight during various medical zzso
