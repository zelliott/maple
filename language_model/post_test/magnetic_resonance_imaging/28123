A heavily zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso echo sequence utilizing a 180 degrees inversion pulse has become available for clinical use, called zzso prepared rapid acquisition zzso echo zzso With the appropriate choice of repetition time, echo time, flip angle, and inversion time zzso zzso imaging can be performed with excellent zzso detail and a good zzso zzso We performed an initial evaluation of this sequence for detection of abnormalities of the internal auditory canals compared with conventional spin echo zzso zzso Fifteen men and 15 women were zzso zzso included normal zzso zzso 15 zzso acoustic zzso zzso zzso 7 tumors in 4 zzso zzso angle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for acoustic zzso without residual tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso with evidence of residual tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), Bell zzso zzso zzso 1), and zzso enhancement of probable viral zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso study consisted of 128 zzso zzso zzso 10 degrees flip angle, 130 zzso 256 zzso 2 zzso slice zzso zzso time of 350 zzso 1 s recovery time, and zzso zzso examination zzso All enhancing zzso identified on the conventional zzso zzso imaging were also identified on the zzso zzso No diagnostic difference existed between the zzso and conventional zzso sequences when pathology was present, but the zzso sequence did have poorer resolution in the zzso zzso related to the 130 zzso 256 zzso zzso While not currently able to replace conventional two-dimensional zzso imaging, zzso zzso may provide a valuable adjunct to the routine imaging zzso This technique could replace the zzso zzso zzso sequence and provide excellent zzso differentiation and many zzso thin sections without a great increase in overall examination zzso
