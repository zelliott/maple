To explore cortical zzso responses using zzso in the context of three zzso listening zzso 

zzso listening is a widely used behavioral technique indicating brain zzso during which subjects are presented with two different auditory signals at the same time, one arriving at each zzso zzso offers the potential to explore the zzso response during zzso listening and to relate the behavioral zzso with these cortical zzso 

zzso was performed for 10 right-handed normal subjects listening to zzso syllable pairs with the task of detecting a zzso syllable by pressing a zzso The target stimulus appeared equally often in the left and right zzso The subjects were instructed to either concentrate on the stimuli presented in both ears zzso or only in the left ear zzso or right ear zzso In addition, a control condition was used during which the syllables were presented zzso zzso responses were measured by applying zzso echo zzso imaging techniques and statistically analyzed by using statistical zzso mapping zzso zzso 

During zzso zzso there were generally extended zzso in zzso zzso For the zzso condition, the authors found strong bilateral zzso in the inferior frontal zzso zzso area, the left middle frontal zzso and in the left superior zzso zzso During the FL condition, there was an additional cluster in the right inferior frontal zzso For the zzso condition, there were stronger zzso in zzso area and the left superior zzso zzso 

These findings were taken as evidence that zzso listening is more zzso requiring more processing capacity distributed in zzso zzso The behavioral measures of zzso listening were not simply a function of zzso lobe zzso Rather, the cortical zzso support the notion that different processing strategies controlled by different neural structures are applied during zzso zzso
