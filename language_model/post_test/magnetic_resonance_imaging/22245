Before zzso can be used for guiding vascular interventions, the problem of dependably visualizing zzso must be zzso zzso the position and zzso of the tip of the zzso should be visible to facilitate steering through the vascular zzso In this paper, various antennas are described that can be incorporated into a zzso zzso These antennas allow the zzso to be zzso with high zzso Computer simulation and experimental evidence are presented showing the value of adding a passive MR signal source, with a short zzso internal to the zzso The internal source increases the available zzso zzso the apparent zzso of the zzso and allows the use of fast imaging zzso
