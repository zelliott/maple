The judgment of the zzso of others based on their facial appearance often precedes social zzso Whether we ultimately approach or avoid others may depend on such zzso 

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the neural basis for such zzso judgments and the relationship between these judgments and trait zzso Participants viewed ambiguous zzso zzso or relatively zzso zzso angry, zzso faces, assessing either the zzso or the sex of the person zzso 

zzso faces zzso more inconsistent responses within participants only during zzso judgment, suggesting ambiguous property as zzso The contrast pertaining to the interaction between task and face zzso demonstrated zzso in several areas, such that the left zzso and zzso middle and inferior frontal zzso were responsive to angry faces when subjects were asked to recognize the sex zzso zzso and to neutral faces when required to discern the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the blood zzso zzso change within the left zzso in response to neutral faces during the judgment of zzso was positively correlated with participant trait zzso 

These findings extend a proposed model of social zzso by highlighting the functional engagement of the zzso in zzso judgments, which zzso an zzso sensitivity to ambiguous sources of probable zzso
