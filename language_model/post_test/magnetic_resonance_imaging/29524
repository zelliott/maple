This study describes the linguistic and zzso findings in three right-handed patients with crossed zzso zzso Despite the location of the zzso in the right hemisphere, all patients displayed a combination of linguistic deficits typically found in zzso zzso following analogous damage to the left zzso Associated cognitive deficits varied across the three zzso In addition, all cases showed deficits classically attributed to zzso zzso damage zzso deficits and reduced zzso zzso As a result, zzso relationships in our study sample indicate both dominant and zzso qualities of the right zzso
