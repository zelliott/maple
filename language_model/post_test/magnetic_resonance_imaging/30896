We have encountered five cases of zzso large zzso zzso zzso presenting with central nervous system zzso mass zzso during their clinical zzso The age of the patients ranged from 50 to 74 years and three patients were zzso All of these cases zzso showed typical zzso zzso of the zzso cells in the initial biopsy specimens obtained from sites other than the zzso Despite zzso chemotherapy, patients suffered from single or multiple zzso mass zzso zzso months after the initial diagnosis of zzso except for one case in which zzso and the zzso mass zzso were diagnosed at the same zzso The subsequent biopsy and autopsy specimens obtained from the zzso mass zzso revealed diffuse zzso of the tumor cells with zzso zzso but minimal or no zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso tumor cells and zzso mass zzso revealed expression of zzso zzso zzso and negative for zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso The overall features of the zzso mass zzso were very similar to or indistinguishable from those of the primary zzso zzso This implies that zzso mass zzso in the zzso cases can be correctly diagnosed only by careful attention to clinical and pathological zzso Moreover, there is the possibility that some cases previously diagnosed as primary zzso zzso may have include zzso zzso Further investigation is needed to explore this unusual zzso
