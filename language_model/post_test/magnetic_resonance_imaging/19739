The natural history and zzso of zzso spinal zzso zzso remain largely unknown because most clinical studies have included mostly patients with zzso zzso associated with zzso surgery or prolonged zzso zzso 

To assess the zzso mechanisms and outcomes of these zzso zzso based on clinical findings and spinal vascular zzso 

zzso zzso 

We analyzed the clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data for 27 patients with acute spinal zzso zzso admitted between 1990 and zzso There were 11 men and 16 women (age range, zzso years zzso age, 56 zzso 

Ten patients had anterior spinal artery patterns, 4 each had anterior and zzso unilateral patterns, 3 had central patterns, and 2 each had zzso spinal artery patterns, zzso zzso and zzso clinical zzso Twenty patients had no identifiable zzso Patients with a central or zzso zzso showed a high frequency of peripheral vascular disease, and all zzso zzso occurred following prolonged zzso zzso The onset of all other zzso was associated with mechanical triggering movements zzso zzso zzso and these patients frequently had diseases of the spine zzso zzso zzso at the level of the spinal zzso with the clinical data suggesting root involvement at the level of the spinal zzso zzso and pointing to mechanical injury of a zzso zzso The outcomes were zzso with only 13 patients showing significant gait impairment on leaving the zzso 

There are 2 main types of spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso artery territory zzso zzso anterior or zzso spinal artery zzso and unilateral zzso and zzso extensive spinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each type has characteristic clinical, imaging, zzso and zzso zzso
