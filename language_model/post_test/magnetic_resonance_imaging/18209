In the clinical practice, zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with knee trauma is performed at different times after the zzso This is due to the limited availability of zzso Related causes, but also clinical considerations, cause the performing of zzso in a different time from the zzso zzso To assess whether the time that zzso between the injury and zzso has an impact on the magnetic resonance diagnostic ability and whether it is affected by the time zzso between zzso and zzso The results of the zzso and zzso were analyzed in the group of 128 patients, 56 zzso women and 72 zzso men aged zzso years zzso zzso after the knee zzso Next, the group of patients was divided depends on whether zzso examination was performed in shorter or longer time then 6 weeks after the zzso into two zzso 52 patients (21 women and 31 zzso with recent injury and 76 patients (35 woman and 41 zzso with inveterate zzso Moreover, the group of patients was divided into two zzso 60 patients zzso women and 34 zzso with the time between zzso examination and zzso no longer than 30 days and group of 68 patients (30 women and 38 zzso with time of waiting for zzso longer than 30 zzso zzso to the structures of the knee observed in zzso were classified in terms of location and zzso We compared the diagnostic ability of zzso and zzso in the presence and severity of zzso zzso of the zzso The statistical significance of presence of the injury in zzso and zzso was estimated by the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the structures of the knee joint which are most commonly damaged after the zzso which means both zzso and the anterior cruciate ligament zzso - was performed in whole group and separately in each zzso The results were compared between corresponding subgroups, and also between each zzso and whole zzso The diagnostic efficacy zzso were compared using the test for differences between two structure zzso The zzso of statistically significant differences was performed at the level of zzso There was no statistically significant differences zzso the indicators of the efficacy of zzso in recent and inveterate injuries, and also with increased delay between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the time between the injury and the zzso examination does not reduced the diagnostic efficacy of this zzso zzso the time zzso between zzso and zzso does not matter about the zzso of the results received in both zzso
