To characterize the relationship between motor zzso connectivity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical disability in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso 

A total of 27 patients with zzso zzso zzso and 15 patients with secondary progressive zzso zzso underwent functional zzso magnetic resonance zzso Clinical disability was assessed using the Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso Independent component analysis was used to characterize motor zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis was performed in zzso between the individual expression of motor zzso connectivity in zzso and zzso scores including age as zzso Separate post hoc analyses were performed for patients with zzso and zzso 

The zzso scores ranged from 0 to 7 with a median score of zzso Motor zzso connectivity of left zzso showed a positive linear relation with clinical disability in patients with zzso This effect was stronger when considering the group of patients with zzso alone, whereas patients with zzso showed no increase in zzso strength between left zzso and the motor zzso network with increasing clinical zzso No significant relation between motor zzso connectivity of the right zzso and clinical disability was detected in zzso 

The increase in functional zzso between left zzso and the motor zzso network with increasing clinical disability can be interpreted as zzso reorganization of the motor system to maintain motor function, which appears to be limited to the zzso stage of the zzso
