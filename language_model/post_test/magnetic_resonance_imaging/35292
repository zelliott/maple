Blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to assess zzso oxygen zzso by measuring the zzso level, which reflects tissue zzso zzso This study was designed to identify the significance of zzso zzso in differentiation of acute rejection zzso and acute zzso necrosis zzso in patients within 6 months after kidney zzso 

zzso patients with normal graft function and 28 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 7) were zzso Patients with normal functioning zzso underwent zzso zzso within 2 to 3 weeks zzso while patients with zzso and zzso underwent zzso zzso within 6 days before or after kidney transplant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso 

The mean zzso level was significantly higher in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso compared to the normal group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was a significant difference also between the zzso group and normal group on zzso levels zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso level was significantly lower in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso compared to the normal group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was also a significant difference between the zzso group and normal group on zzso levels zzso zzso zzso There were no correlations between characteristics such as patient age, zzso time, zzso time, zzso level, HB level, urine output volume, zzso level, zzso trough concentration and zzso levels, except between zzso level and zzso level zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso could be a valuable method to discriminate between zzso and zzso by measuring tissue oxygen zzso in early kidney zzso zzso
