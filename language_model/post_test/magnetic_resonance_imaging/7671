In zzso zzso lobe zzso MR imaging zzso of zzso volume and zzso signal can improve the sensitivity for detecting zzso zzso However, the current contributions of these analyses for the diagnosis of zzso sclerosis in zzso zzso are not zzso Our aim was to compare visual analysis, zzso and signal zzso of the zzso for detecting zzso sclerosis in zzso zzso 

Two hundred three patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso defined by clinical and electroencephalogram criteria had zzso zzso visually analyzed by imaging zzso zzso As a second step, we performed automatic zzso of zzso volumes with zzso and zzso zzso with an in-house zzso zzso of 79 healthy controls was used for zzso 

Visual analysis classified 125 patients zzso as having signs of zzso sclerosis and 78 zzso as having normal zzso zzso Automatic zzso detected zzso in 119 zzso patients with visually detected zzso sclerosis and in 10 zzso with visually normal MR imaging zzso zzso analysis detected zzso zzso signal in 103 zzso patients with visually detected zzso sclerosis and in 15 zzso with visually normal MR imaging zzso zzso together, zzso plus zzso detected signs of zzso sclerosis in all except 1 zzso patient with visually detected zzso sclerosis and in 22 zzso with visually normal MR imaging zzso 

In zzso zzso visually inspected by experts, zzso of zzso volume and signal can increase the detection of zzso sclerosis in zzso of patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso
