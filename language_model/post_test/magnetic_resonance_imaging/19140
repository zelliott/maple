We performed this study to evaluate the accuracy of zzso imaging zzso in detecting focal zzso and to predict the role of zzso in the management of patients with zzso in the zzso zzso 99 patients with clinically diagnosed acute zzso cerebrovascular disease were studied with zzso within 6 hours after onset of zzso In 88 of 99 patients, early zzso zzso were identified on initial zzso as zzso zzso The initial zzso findings were classified into 4 types according to the location and extent of the zzso zzso The patients with type 1 (no zzso zzso were clinically diagnosed as zzso or complete stroke within 2 hours after the zzso 28 patients out of the patients with type 2 zzso area in the zzso zzso were diagnosed with zzso zzso and the remaining 13 patients were diagnosed as victims of stroke caused by main trunk zzso Except for 2 patients with zzso the patients with type 3 zzso zzso areas in the zzso had main trunk zzso and showed a more extended zzso area on zzso than zzso area on zzso All the patients with type 4 zzso zzso zzso had main trunk zzso and showed severe zzso in the affected area on zzso and the area of zzso was well matched with the zzso area on zzso Comparing zzso findings with zzso on zzso a significant difference was noted in zzso between zzso and zzso zzso We considered that emergence of zzso on zzso was related to both the time of duration and the degree of zzso and the reduced zzso area where zzso showed no zzso was thought to be the zzso zzso Our study indicated zzso had high diagnostic accuracy in zzso zzso cerebrovascular disease and could furnish useful information to reveal the zzso zzso In addition, zzso is expected to be available for selection as a therapeutic zzso
