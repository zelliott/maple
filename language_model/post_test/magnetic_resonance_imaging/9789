zzso zzso zzso zzso shows promise for spatial control and acceleration of zzso zzso zzso The investigators hypothesized that zzso generated by zzso could enhance high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso zzso zzso by controlling and increasing local energy zzso 

zzso zzso were produced in zzso zzso using focused ultrasound zzso zzso with a focal intensity of zzso W zzso zzso in zzso water at zzso The average zzso volume was measured by visible change in optical zzso and by zzso magnetic resonance zzso In addition, in zzso zzso zzso were generated in a canine liver before and after an intravenous injection of droplets with a similar acoustic zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso larger in zzso containing droplets (3 zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso without zzso The mean zzso volume with a zzso zzso exposure in zzso zzso was comparable to that made by a zzso exposure in zzso without zzso In the in zzso study, the average zzso volumes without and with droplets were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4; zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3; zzso zzso respectively, a factor of 15 zzso The shape of zzso bubbles zzso with zzso ultrasound was very similar to the actual zzso shape as measured zzso and by magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso bubbles may facilitate clinical zzso zzso by reducing treatment time or requisite in zzso total acoustic power and provide zzso imaging feedback of the zzso zzso
