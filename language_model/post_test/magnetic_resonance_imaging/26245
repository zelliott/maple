We present the results of 100 consecutive magnetic resonance zzso zzso in cases where zzso zzso zzso guiding was considered dangerous or zzso 

MR guiding was preferred to CT guiding for cases where zzso were located in the central area, or were not clearly visible on CT zzso or where the zzso of vessels was considered zzso For most of the patients, calculation of target zzso was performed using dedicated software enabling trajectory zzso There were 62 cases of contrast enhanced zzso 32 cases of zzso without contrast enhancement, and 6 cases of very small zzso appearing zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso allowed a zzso diagnosis in 92 zzso In 8 cases, the biopsy was negative zzso zzso or normal brain zzso Three patients had a transient worsening of their neurological zzso Two patient had a zzso loss of motor zzso No patient zzso 

MR guiding for zzso zzso was effective for zzso or zzso zzso zzso located in functional or densely zzso areas and in the brain zzso The rate of zzso complications was equivalent to or less than that reported in series of zzso zzso
