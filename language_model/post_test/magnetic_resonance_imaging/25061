The role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in term infants is not clear, and zzso factors are being implicated in the zzso zzso for these zzso However, there is no evidence that brain damage occurs before zzso We aimed to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso early zzso seizures, or both result from early zzso zzso 

We used brain zzso or zzso examination in zzso zzso infants with zzso zzso early seizures, or both to distinguish between zzso acquired zzso and those that developed in the zzso and early zzso zzso We excluded infants with major zzso zzso or obvious zzso zzso zzso were divided into two groups: those with zzso zzso (with or without zzso and evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and those without other evidence of zzso but who presented with zzso within 3 days of birth zzso zzso 

Brain images showed evidence of an acute insult without established injury or zzso in 197 zzso of infants in group 1, zzso showed evidence of established injury in only 2 infants zzso although tiny zzso of established white matter zzso in addition to acute injury, were seen in three of 21 on zzso zzso In group 2, acute focal damage was noted in 62 zzso of zzso Two zzso also had evidence of zzso zzso 

Although our results cannot exclude the possibility that zzso or genetic factors might zzso some infants to zzso brain injury, our data strongly suggest that events in the immediate zzso period are most important in zzso brain zzso
