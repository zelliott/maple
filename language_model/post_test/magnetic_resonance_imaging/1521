The aim of this study was to evaluate zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso and to determine a correlation with pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso 

This prospective study included 19 patients who underwent zzso with PG between 1992 and zzso There were 12 men and 7 women, with a mean age of 58 years zzso 35 to 76 zzso The mean zzso between operation and evaluation was zzso months zzso 3 to 104 zzso zzso for zzso were benign zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the pancreatic zzso margin was normal in all patients with zzso and the pancreatic remnant was zzso normal without evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso functions were respectively evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso blood zzso zzso PG zzso was determined by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was considered good in seven patients zzso 1, zzso moderately zzso in six patients zzso 2, zzso significantly zzso in four patients zzso 3, zzso and zzso in two patients zzso 4, zzso zzso zzso concentration was decreased in 18 patients, with a mean concentration of 80 zzso in group 1, 98 zzso in group 2, 67 zzso in group 3, and 0 zzso in group zzso There was a statistically significant correlation between zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were normal for 14 of 19 zzso There was no correlation between pancreatic zzso function and zzso zzso 

zzso pancreatic zzso was presented in zzso of the patients despite a PG zzso in zzso These results may be explained in part by zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso by gastric zzso
