The study evaluated the relationship between age and frontal and zzso lobe volumes in young zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal control zzso Ten CD, nine Am, and 16 zzso and zzso control subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso The volume of the frontal and zzso zzso was measured from an zzso positioned slab of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measures of the gray and white matter zzso of these volumes were also zzso Both CD and Am groups had a significantly smaller zzso lobe volumes, but only the CD group demonstrated a significantly greater decline in zzso lobe volume with age zzso volume, education, and race were controlled for in all statistical zzso zzso the brain regions into gray and white matter revealed that the negative correlation between age and zzso lobe volume of CD patients was mostly due to a significant age-related decline in the gray matter zzso zzso trends between age and gray matter volumes were also observed in the Am and normal zzso In the frontal zzso age was zzso correlated with gray matter volume in the control, CD, and Am zzso Unlike the consistent decreases in gray matter volumes, white matter showed zzso increases in volume with zzso The data suggest that CD patients may have an accelerated age-related decline in zzso lobe gray matter volume and a smaller zzso lobe volume compared to normal zzso In the frontal zzso age-related gray matter volume reductions occur in all three zzso These age-related cortical gray matter volume reductions may be a biological marker for the risk of addictive behavior, which also decreases with zzso
