To assess explicit memory and two components of implicit zzso is, zzso skill learning and zzso zzso zzso well as resting cerebral blood flow zzso and oxygen metabolism zzso during the acute phase of transient global zzso 

In a 59 year old woman, whose zzso episode fulfilled all current criteria for transient global zzso a zzso protocol was zzso including word learning, story recall, zzso zzso mirror reading, and word stem completion zzso PET was performed using the zzso steady state inhalation method, while the patient still exhibited severe zzso zzso and was zzso with the cognitive zzso 

There was a clear cut zzso between impaired long term episodic memory and preserved implicit memory for its two zzso zzso zzso was significantly altered, suggesting word retrieval zzso than semantic zzso The PET study disclosed a reduced zzso with relatively or fully preserved zzso in the left zzso zzso and zzso nucleus, and the reverse pattern over the left zzso zzso 

The PET zzso with zzso zzso zzso would be compatible with a zzso phenomenon and indicate that the isolated assessment of zzso in transient global zzso may be zzso The pattern of zzso depression, with sparing of the zzso area, is one among the distinct patterns of brain dysfunction that zzso the zzso uniform clinical presentation of transient global zzso The finding of a left prefrontal zzso in the face of impaired episodic memory and altered verbal zzso would fit present day concepts from PET zzso studies about the role of this area in episodic and semantic memory zzso Likewise, the changes affecting the zzso nucleus but sparing the zzso would be consistent with the normal performance in zzso skill zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso effects, despite left zzso zzso zzso suggest that these processes are zzso by a more distributed zzso zzso
