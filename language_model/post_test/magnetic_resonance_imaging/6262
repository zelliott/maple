Between one and six cultured human fetal zzso were zzso into five zzso diabetic recipients and their progress monitored for a year on each zzso To prevent rejection the tissue was cultured for 1-3 weeks before zzso the zzso zzso of the donor tissue were matched with those of the recipient when a single zzso was used, and four of the recipients were zzso three because of zzso zzso zzso zzso function was observed zzso in one of the zzso In three others human fetal zzso was recovered zzso months after zzso although it was being slowly rejected during this zzso zzso cells were present in the graft but did not function adequately to enable zzso zzso to be measured in peripheral zzso The issues of rejection and zzso of the human fetal zzso will need to be zzso if the potential of the human fetal zzso to zzso blood zzso levels in diabetic man is ever to be zzso
