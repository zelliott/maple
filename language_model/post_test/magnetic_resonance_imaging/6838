To zzso assess the therapeutic procedure and outcome of magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso vascular zzso 

zzso zzso zzso treatments were performed by one zzso with real-time MR guidance in 15 patients (six female zzso mean age, zzso years zzso zzso nine male zzso mean age, zzso years zzso zzso with vascular zzso in the head and neck zzso zzso zzso spine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assessment was used to analyze zzso individual success of therapy, zzso occurrence of zzso zzso time required for minimally invasive zzso zzso in zzso analysis, zzso ability of MR imaging to depict zzso zzso changes within the vascular zzso with calculation of changes in zzso ratios, and zzso detection of volume changes at follow-up examinations with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed successfully and without complications by filling targeted vascular zzso with zzso zzso zzso vascular sclerosis was used to successfully treat individual zzso symptoms, such as zzso pain, zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso analysis focusing on the actual zzso length of time presented an acceleration over the zzso time period, matching a cubic function in zzso curve fit and taking 31 minutes 50 seconds zzso 14 zzso zzso vascular zzso was identified in all treated portions on zzso images by the statistically significant changes in zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso On follow-up images zzso those obtained after 12 weeks zzso zzso shrinkage was observed in targeted portions zzso zzso zzso 

MR imaging allows safe guidance and monitoring of minimally invasive zzso and permits zzso of therapeutic success zzso and during follow-up zzso
