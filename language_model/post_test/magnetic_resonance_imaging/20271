For zzso zzso or zzso optical zzso the zzso surface topography and internal anatomy need to be estimated for improving the quantitative accuracy of reconstructed zzso The zzso surface profile can be measured by zzso systems, but zzso of the internal anatomy using optical techniques is zzso A zzso anatomical mouse zzso may be warped to the estimated zzso However, fitting an zzso to surface topography data is challenging because of variations in the posture and zzso of zzso zzso In addition, acquisition of partial data (for example, from limited views or with limited zzso can make the zzso problem zzso Here, we present a method for fitting a zzso mouse zzso to surface zzso range data acquired by an optical zzso As an zzso zzso we match the posture of the zzso to the posture of the mouse being zzso using landmark zzso The zzso zzso zzso between the zzso surface and the mouse surface is then minimized in order to register two data zzso A zzso prior is used to ensure zzso of the surface zzso zzso Once the zzso surface is zzso to match the range data, the internal anatomy is transformed using elastic energy zzso We present results from performance evaluation studies of our method where we have measured the zzso overlap between the internal zzso delineated directly from zzso or CT and those estimated by our proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate excellent overlap in the brain and the heart, with fair agreement in the zzso and the zzso
