The technique of zzso using powerful zzso plays an important role in the diagnosis of diseases of the head and neck without any zzso zzso Because of the potential hazard imposed by the presence of zzso metals, patients with implanted metallic objects are excluded from zzso However, amalgam zzso seem to be zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso of amalgam zzso following zzso 

63 human freshly extracted zzso were divided into 3 groups based on 3 zzso zzso used to restore standard class V preparations on both zzso and zzso zzso Three different amalgam materials were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The teeth were transferred into saline solution for 2 months at room temperature and then zzso zzso zzso was randomly applied to one half of each section, and the other half was kept as a zzso Following zzso all specimens were immersed in a dye solution, zzso and scored for any zzso using a zzso 

zzso in zzso within each group following zzso were significant in the zzso and zzso groups but not in the zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference between the three groups regarding the zzso zzso 

The results of this study suggest that zzso is not a completely safe technique in patients with amalgam zzso It was shown that the main effect of fields led to the appearance of zzso zzso which is responsible for the enhancement of the diffusion process, grain boundary migration and vacancy formation resulting in zzso
