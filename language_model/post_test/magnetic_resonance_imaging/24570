Recent zzso studies demonstrated that functional connectivity is altered following cognitive tasks zzso zzso or due to various neurological zzso We tested whether real-time zzso zzso can be a tool to voluntarily reconfigure brain network zzso To zzso zzso from zzso effects, we first trained participants to voluntarily regulate activity in the auditory zzso zzso zzso and subsequently asked participants to exert learned voluntary self-regulation in the absence of feedback zzso phase without zzso Using independent component analysis zzso we found network zzso zzso in functional network zzso during the zzso training phase between the auditory target region and zzso the auditory zzso zzso visual regions related to visual feedback zzso zzso zzso related to introspection and self-regulation and zzso working memory and high-level visual attention areas related to cognitive zzso Interestingly, the auditory target region was identified as the hub of the reconfigured functional networks without zzso zzso During the transfer phase, we again found specific functional connectivity reconfiguration between auditory and attention network confirming the specific effect of self-regulation on functional zzso zzso connectivity to working memory related networks was no longer altered consistent with the absent demand on working zzso We demonstrate that zzso learning is zzso by widespread changes in functional zzso In contrast, applying learned self-regulation involves more limited and specific network changes in an auditory setup intended as a model for zzso zzso zzso training might be used to promote recovery from neurological disorders that are linked to abnormal patterns of brain zzso
