The aim of this study was to develop zzso image registration between zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images, to enhance tumor zzso and zzso during CT zzso liver tumor zzso zzso 

A zzso registration technique was evaluated with different zzso steps and zzso parameters and compared to a standard rigid registration zzso The zzso similarity zzso target registration error, zzso zzso distance, and total registration time zzso were compared using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The entire registration method was then applied during five CT zzso liver zzso cases with the zzso CT data transmitted directly from the CT zzso with both accuracy and registration time zzso 

zzso optimal parameters for registration were a section thickness of 5 zzso cropping the field of view to zzso of its original size, manual zzso of the liver, zzso control grid of 5 zzso 5 zzso 5, and spatial sampling of 50,000 zzso A mean zzso zzso distance of zzso zzso (a zzso times improvement compared to rigid zzso P zzso zzso a mean zzso similarity zzso of zzso (a zzso zzso and a mean target registration error of zzso zzso (a zzso times zzso were zzso During the zzso zzso registration between the zzso MR and the planning zzso CT imaging took a mean time of zzso minutes, MR to targeting CT image took 4 minutes, and MR to monitoring CT imaging took zzso zzso Mean registration accuracy was zzso zzso 

zzso registration allowed improved zzso of the tumor during zzso planning, zzso and evaluation of tumor coverage by the ice zzso Future work is focused on reducing zzso time to make the method more clinically zzso
