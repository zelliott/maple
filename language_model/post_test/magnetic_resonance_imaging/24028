Brain damage in patients with zzso is caused by mechanical forces and cerebral zzso The severity and zzso of impaired cerebral blood flow and metabolism are still largely zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso offers the opportunity to investigate cerebral energy metabolism and zzso damage zzso and zzso Previous zzso MR zzso studies have shown an increased zzso resonance that is suggestive of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess cerebral damage and energy metabolism in zzso zzso in adult rats by using in zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso The presence of zzso was correlated with zzso zzso metabolism and zzso zzso The measurement of relative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso served to assess zzso zzso 

zzso was induced in adult rats by surgical injection of zzso into the zzso zzso zzso resonance studies, using a zzso zzso were performed zzso in zzso animals at 1 (10 zzso 8 (six zzso and 16 weeks (six zzso thereafter, as well as in eight control zzso To evaluate zzso size and white matter zzso zzso MR imaging was zzso The zzso MR zzso were acquired from a zzso zzso positioned centrally in the brain, followed by localized zzso MR zzso on a two-dimensional column that contained the entire brain but virtually no zzso zzso The zzso and zzso MR zzso peak ratios were calculated after fitting the zzso in the time domain, zzso pH was estimated from the zzso zzso zzso chemical shift, and zzso relaxation times of zzso zzso were determined from the signal zzso at increasing echo zzso 

In zzso rats, zzso expansion stabilized after 8 zzso White matter zzso was most pronounced during acute zzso zzso zzso were increased at all time points, without a decrease in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso peak ratios, or zzso Possibly zzso production is restricted to zzso brain zzso followed by its zzso in zzso fluid, which is supported by the long zzso zzso relaxation zzso zzso zzso production may zzso impairment of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso ratios significantly decreased during the acute and chronic stages of zzso These changes were not caused by zzso in zzso zzso relaxation zzso The decreases in the zzso and zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso or changes in membrane zzso zzso as in zzso damage or zzso It is suggested that zzso MR zzso can be of additional value in the assessment of energy metabolism and cerebral damage in clinical zzso
