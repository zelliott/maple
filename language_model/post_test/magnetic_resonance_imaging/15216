To describe two symptomatic zzso gene zzso zzso 

One patient had limb zzso zzso His brother was diagnosed with limb zzso muscular zzso zzso with two zzso in the zzso gene zzso and zzso The second patient had zzso zzso He had two sons with zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso We performed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso zzso using skeletal muscle zzso We also studied zzso in peripheral blood zzso zzso by Western zzso 

In addition to the muscle zzso both patients showed elevated zzso zzso and abnormal muscle zzso They presented a zzso in only one zzso after screening of the whole gene zzso muscle and zzso zzso and zzso zzso A muscle biopsy zzso showed moderate zzso changes and zzso zzso expression in the zzso Western zzso of both zzso and skeletal muscle demonstrated a significant reduction in zzso All the other proteins including zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso showed normal levels of zzso zzso vs the patients' affected zzso 

The diagnosis of symptomatic carriers of zzso zzso should be considered when a zzso pattern of zzso protein is zzso
