zzso assessment by conventional imaging methods of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso cell zzso of the head and neck is, at best, zzso zzso zzso has shown that zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso in the number of vessels and blood zzso We assessed the ability of dynamic zzso MR imaging to differentiate normal from diseased zzso in this patient zzso 

zzso patients with newly diagnosed zzso cell zzso and no previous treatment were studied with the use of a head and neck phased array surface zzso zzso imaging included high resolution zzso zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso The dynamic zzso MR imaging was performed by using a zzso fast zzso zzso recalled sequence with single dose zzso injection of contrast zzso zzso values included time to peak, peak enhancement, maximum zzso and zzso slope for the zzso All patients underwent neck dissection as part of their indicated treatment, and imaging results were correlated with zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso MR imaging and pathology comparisons were obtained for 68 zzso There was significantly longer time to peak zzso zzso lower peak enhancement zzso zzso lower maximum slope zzso zzso and slower zzso slope zzso zzso in the zzso zzso compared with the normal zzso 

Analysis of dynamic zzso MR imaging can differentiate normal from diseased zzso zzso in patients with zzso cell zzso of the head and zzso
