A mathematical zzso which we call zzso was developed to reduce spatial blur distortion of zzso brain zzso due to transmission through the skull and other zzso zzso estimates zzso at the superficial cerebral cortical surface from zzso recorded at the scalp using a finite element model of each zzso zzso skull and cortical surface constructed from their magnetic resonance images zzso zzso indicate that zzso is zzso stable, while a comparison of zzso data with a direct cortical recording from a neurosurgery patient suggests that the procedure is zzso Application of zzso to zzso evoked potential data recorded at 124 scalp sites suggests that the method produces a dramatic improvement in spatial detail, and merits further zzso
