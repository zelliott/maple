At present, one of the most promising windows to the functional organization of the human brain is zzso zzso By mapping the magnetic field distribution outside the head the sites of neural events can be located with an accuracy of a few zzso and the zzso evolution of the zzso can be traced with a zzso zzso This paper reviews some forward field calculation approaches suitable for the interpretation of the zzso electromagnetic zzso zzso zzso with multiple zzso is described in zzso An example of the analysis of the zzso zzso illustrates the potential of multiple signal zzso zzso zzso in finding optimal zzso zzso
