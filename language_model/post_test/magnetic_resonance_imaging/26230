zzso can easily by touch discriminate fine details of the shapes of zzso The zzso of representations and the representations of objects differing in shape are, when the differences are not founded in different sensory cues or the objects belong to different categories, assumed to take place in a series of cortical areas, which only show differences at the zzso zzso How the zzso zzso zzso shape is unknown, but theoretically it should depend heavily on the zzso of the object zzso We measured regional cerebral blood flow zzso of normal volunteers with zzso zzso zzso zzso as an index of zzso zzso One group zzso a round set of zzso having a narrow spectrum of zzso and an oblong set of zzso having a broad spectrum of zzso Another group zzso zzso When the zzso from the conditions round and oblong zzso discrimination was zzso part of the zzso lining the zzso zzso had significantly higher zzso when zzso having a broader spectrum of zzso were zzso This zzso was also activated by zzso zzso The zzso is therefore regarded as crucial for the zzso of zzso and in accordance with zzso being a major zzso of object zzso this zzso is also zzso active in zzso shape zzso A comparison of the zzso with zzso zzso in the anatomical format of the standard brain for both PET and zzso brain images, revealed that this part of the zzso lining the zzso zzso is situated zzso from zzso area 1 and may involve zzso area 2 on the zzso bank of the zzso
