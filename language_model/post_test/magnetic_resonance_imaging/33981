Our purpose was to determine the brain MR imaging characteristics of zzso zzso muscular zzso in zzso 

We reviewed the MR imaging findings of the brain in three children with known zzso zzso muscular zzso to determine the presence of any cerebral or zzso abnormalities of development or abnormalities of the white zzso 

In all three patients, there was normal formation of the zzso the zzso and no evidence of zzso migration zzso All three patients had abnormal white matter in the zzso with sparing of the corpus zzso internal zzso zzso and brain zzso 

MR imaging of the brain in children with zzso zzso muscular zzso reveals a consistent pattern of white matter zzso We zzso that disruption of the zzso barrier associated with zzso zzso leads to increased water content, resulting in abnormal white matter signal zzso
