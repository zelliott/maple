To describe an unusual case of familial frontal lobe zzso zzso with probable zzso zzso zzso 

The patient's clinical zzso zzso test results, family history, and results on magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso scans, among other routine zzso are zzso His zzso zzso acid zzso was isolated, and his zzso zzso zzso gene was amplified with the zzso chain reaction and zzso using the zzso zzso 

zzso the patient had a zzso frontal lobe zzso Four of the 8 members of the generation preceding the patient had zzso zzso zzso performed on 2 of these cases revealed SE, and a pathological diagnosis of zzso disease zzso was zzso One other member of that generation died of a zzso encephalitis, although the zzso findings were zzso zzso of the patient's zzso gene did not reveal the abnormalities expected in a familial case of zzso The results of other investigations were compatible with zzso but were not specific to a particular zzso 

This case is a novel type of zzso The patient presented clinically with zzso but based on the family history and zzso a diagnosis of prion zzso seems zzso There were no zzso found in the zzso zzso so it is possible that there are zzso caused by genes or other pathological processes unrelated to the zzso zzso
