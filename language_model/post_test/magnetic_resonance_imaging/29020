There is no established tumor marker for zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is shown to be expressed by the zzso and proposed as a tumor zzso The aim of this study is to assess the relation between zzso levels and tumor volume, size and prognosis in zzso 

We studied zzso levels in serum from peripheral and zzso veins of 52 patients with zzso who underwent zzso zzso levels were measured by an zzso zzso zzso zzso volume and the largest tumor diameter were calculated from the zzso zzso 

The mean serum zzso level from the zzso vein zzso was statistically higher than the zzso level from the peripheral vein zzso zzso zzso zzso Although mean zzso level increased with increasing stage, it was not zzso While there was a correlation with tumor size, volume and zzso zzso was in correlation with disease zzso zzso in patients with zzso and/or locally advanced disease was significantly higher than the patients with localized disease zzso zzso zzso The initial zzso and zzso levels were zzso of survival zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso 

Higher levels in the zzso zzso its positive correlation with tumor size and volume suggest that zzso is expressed by zzso zzso peripheral serum values of zzso can be indicative of disease status and also be a zzso of zzso
