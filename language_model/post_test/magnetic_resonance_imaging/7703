To evaluate the zzso Imaging Reporting and Data System zzso proposed by the European Society of zzso zzso zzso for detection of prostate cancer zzso by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in a consecutive cohort of patients with magnetic zzso ultrasound zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso on zzso at zzso T were scored according to the zzso system before zzso zzso biopsy and correlated to zzso zzso zzso correlation was obtained by a zzso U zzso zzso operating characteristics zzso and optimal thresholds were zzso 

In 64 patients, zzso positive biopsy zzso were obtained out of 95 suspicious regions of interest zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso results for the zzso zzso scores exhibited higher areas under the curve compared to those of the zzso zzso zzso for the following thresholds were zzso 85 zzso % and 67 zzso % for zzso scores of 9 and 10, zzso 85 zzso % and 56 zzso % for zzso scores of 3 and 4, respectively zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso system is beneficial to indicate the likelihood of zzso of suspicious zzso on zzso It is also valuable to identify locations to be targeted with zzso The zzso zzso score achieved better results compared to the single zzso zzso zzso 

zzso The zzso zzso scoring system was evaluated using zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate suspicious findings, zzso zzso zzso biopsy was zzso zzso zzso can guide biopsy locations and improve detection of clinically significant zzso zzso zzso procedures can be zzso reducing unnecessary negative zzso for zzso zzso The zzso scoring system may contribute to more effective prostate zzso
