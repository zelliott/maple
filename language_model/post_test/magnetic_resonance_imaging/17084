In zzso the structures in which the electromagnetic field is to be zzso are sometimes defined by a fine grid of zzso zzso zzso whose tissue types are obtained by zzso A novel finite element method is proposed for such zzso A simple, regular mesh of cube elements is constructed, each containing the same, zzso number of zzso There may be several different zzso present within an element, but this is zzso by computing element basis functions that approximately respect the interface conditions between different zzso zzso are presented for a test model of 128 zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso driven by specified zzso The zzso potential zzso with the new method agrees well with that of a conventional finite element zzso the zzso difference along the sample line is zzso of the highest zzso zzso are also presented for the potential due to a current zzso placed in a brain model of 181 zzso 217 zzso 181 zzso derived from zzso zzso The new method gives zzso that are different to those obtained by treating each zzso as an element by zzso of the peak zzso yet the global finite element zzso has a dimension which is more than 50 times zzso
