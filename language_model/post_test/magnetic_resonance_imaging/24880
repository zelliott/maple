zzso sensation is highly functional early in human zzso life, with studies suggesting that zzso can influence zzso and zzso zzso Due to its good spatial properties, blood oxygen zzso zzso contrast functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has the potential to rapidly advance our understanding of the neural activity which zzso the development of zzso perception in this key zzso We aimed to design an zzso specifically for use with zzso subjects for zzso studies of zzso zzso 

We describe a fully automated and zzso zzso compatible system capable of presenting zzso zzso To prevent contamination of the system and minimize zzso zzso risk, the majority of the zzso is constructed from zzso readily available clinical zzso The system was used to present the zzso of infant formula milk in a validation group of seven zzso subjects at term equivalent zzso age zzso age zzso 

A safe, reliable and zzso pattern of stimulation was delivered leading to zzso positive zzso functional responses in the zzso cortex, amygdala, thalamus, insular zzso and zzso 

The described system is therefore suitable for detailed studies of the zzso of zzso sensation and perception during early human brain zzso
