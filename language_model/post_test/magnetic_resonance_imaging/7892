Multiple cerebral cavernous zzso zzso are known as potentially zzso zzso Treatment might be zzso Management of patients with zzso and zzso is zzso 

To evaluate zzso zzso therapeutic sequences in patients with zzso associated to zzso zzso whether there are zzso parameters to anticipate the development of drug-resistant zzso and zzso seizure after zzso surgery compared to zzso drug-resistant zzso 

All zzso and zzso with zzso associated to zzso from 1990 to 2010 and follow-up zzso months available were zzso zzso 

zzso patients matched inclusion zzso zzso became drug-resistant in zzso zzso zzso No zzso were found for development of drug-resistant zzso Median follow-up for both groups was zzso zzso Nine patients did not qualify for surgical therapy and were treated zzso One patient of this cohort zzso was zzso zzso League Against zzso zzso class zzso zzso treatment was performed in 9 zzso zzso zzso of these patients were zzso zzso class 1) after zzso surgery for at least 12 months compared with zzso patients in the zzso zzso In zzso cases zzso the largest zzso was zzso In zzso zzso not all zzso were zzso 

After initial diagnosis of zzso associated to zzso a primary conservative approach is zzso zzso treatment can be successful in a large fraction of cases with drug-resistant zzso where an zzso zzso is zzso Cases where surgery is not undertaken are likely to remain zzso
