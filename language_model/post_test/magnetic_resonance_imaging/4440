zzso zzso data on the distance from the zzso zzso to the internal carotid artery in children, and relate this distance to age and weight zzso 

A prospective study of 100 children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging studies for pathology unrelated to the upper zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to the lateral extent of the zzso zzso and was used as the reference site for zzso One hundred children zzso 7 days to 18 years; zzso 6 zzso were zzso entered into the zzso zzso criteria included any zzso abnormalities of the upper zzso zzso The study defined the distance from the zzso zzso to the internal carotid zzso zzso of this distance were defined for both age and weight zzso 

With increasing age and weight, the distance between the zzso zzso and the internal carotid artery increases in a regular fashion to a value approaching 25 zzso Both relationships are exponential with zzso being achieved by 56 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso value, zzso or 12 years of age zzso zzso zzso zzso value, zzso 

Age and weight parameters can be used to predict the distance from the zzso zzso to the internal carotid artery in zzso
