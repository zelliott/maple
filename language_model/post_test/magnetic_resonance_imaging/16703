zzso zzso surgery of the zzso junction is performed to manage a variety of conditions, including zzso zzso which can be associated with zzso We have noted that the zzso changes of zzso could affect the height of the zzso over a line drawn along the zzso cavity floor, the zzso line zzso This zzso change may influence the use of zzso zzso surgery for patients with zzso who also have zzso zzso We investigated whether the height of the zzso junction is elevated over the zzso in patients with and without zzso 

We conducted a retrospective review of consecutive zzso junction surgical cases during a zzso zzso During that time we treated 12 patients, including 4 with zzso and 8 zzso The average age was 50 years zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso images were evaluated and charts zzso 

The mean height of the zzso over the zzso without zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In those with zzso it was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a statistically significant increase in the height of the zzso tip and C1 ring in patient with zzso as zzso 

zzso is associated with an increase in the zzso and zzso junction over the zzso This increase in height has implications for zzso approach selection in patients with zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso may be better suited to a zzso zzso
