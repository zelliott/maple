Numerous zzso children are evaluated for growth hormone zzso zzso zzso In most patients, zzso provocative tests are normal and are thus in zzso zzso 

A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify zzso of growth hormone zzso zzso zzso in children seen for short zzso and to construct a very sensitive and fairly specific zzso tool to avoid unnecessary zzso provocative zzso zzso was defined by the presence of 2 zzso concentration zzso zzso 10 zzso Certain zzso was defined as zzso and viewing zzso stalk interruption syndrome on magnetic resonance zzso Independent zzso were identified with zzso and zzso analyses and then combined in a decision rule that was validated in another zzso 

The initial study included 167 patients, 36 zzso of whom had zzso including 5 zzso with certain zzso Independent zzso of zzso were: growth rate zzso zzso zzso zzso odds zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso 0 zzso zzso A clinical decision rule suggesting that patients be tested only if they had a growth rate zzso zzso zzso and a zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso achieved zzso sensitivity zzso for certain zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso this rule to the validation population zzso zzso 40, including 13 patients with certain zzso the sensitivity for certain zzso was zzso zzso and the specificity zzso zzso 

We have derived and performed an internal validation of a highly sensitive decision rule that could safely help to avoid more than 2/3 of the unnecessary zzso zzso External validation of this rule is needed before any zzso
