Although symptoms arising from the esophagus such as heartburn and pain can at times become challenging clinical problems, zzso zzso especially with regard to chemical stimulation in humans, is incompletely zzso Our aims were 1) to characterize and ascertain the zzso of cerebral cortical registration of heartburn and 2) to zzso the differences between these findings and those of zzso subliminal acid stimulation in zzso zzso We studied 11 zzso zzso disease zzso patients (9 zzso zzso zzso and 15 healthy controls (8 zzso zzso zzso zzso cortical functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso activity was recorded twice in each subject, during two zzso intervals of zzso N zzso separated by 5 zzso of zzso zzso Time from onset of acid zzso to instant of zzso signal increase and first report of heartburn averaged zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Average maximum percent signal increase in the zzso patients zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater than that of healthy controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso signal characteristics during heartburn were significantly different from those of subliminal acid stimulation in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso cortical regions included zzso zzso zzso and prefrontal regions, and the zzso There was zzso zzso between the activated zzso areas in repeated studies of zzso zzso zzso activity associated with perceived and zzso zzso acid exposure in zzso patients and healthy controls, respectively, involves multiple brain regions but occurs more rapidly and with greater intensity in zzso patients than the activity in response to subliminal acid exposure in healthy zzso The cortical zzso zzso seems to be involved in perception of zzso acid exposure and could explain the variations encountered in clinical practice defining this zzso
