Imaging diagnosis of zzso disease zzso the leading cause of zzso requires evaluation of the extent of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images of patients with zzso often demonstrate outward rotation of the zzso that is altered from a long horizontal elliptical to a long vertical elliptical zzso Such rotation may be related to the disease process of zzso 

To determine whether zzso rotation is associated with zzso we investigated MR images from 11 patients with zzso and 11 normal controls, measuring the zzso angle zzso and the volume of the left zzso on zzso zzso MR zzso The zzso is the angle between a horizontal line zzso to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso line between the deepest point of the zzso zzso and the point nearest to the side of the ambient zzso in the zzso zzso facing the zzso zzso The zzso is measured on the most zzso slice in which the zzso zzso can be identified and increases with zzso zzso 

We found correlation between the zzso and standardized zzso volume in the zzso group, but not in zzso 

zzso rotation is a new marker associated with the pathology of zzso
