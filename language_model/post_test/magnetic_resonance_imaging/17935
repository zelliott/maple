While staging patients with zzso melanoma, cerebral zzso zzso on zzso imaging zzso sequences without a correlate on zzso zzso images can be zzso Without intravenous contrast enhancement, zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent possible differential diagnoses for these zzso The purpose of this study was to find out, how often such zzso zzso to zzso 

Brain MR images zzso of zzso patients with zzso melanoma but without cerebral zzso in the initial staging by zzso were reviewed zzso zzso patients (5 female, 13 zzso with zzso melanoma and signal intensity loss on zzso were included in our zzso The average observation period was zzso zzso zzso 

In each of these 18 patients between one and seven zzso zzso on zzso were zzso None of these zzso developed into zzso 

zzso areas of zzso zzso in the brain zzso without corresponding abnormalities in zzso zzso weighted images are unlikely to represent brain zzso 

zzso In melanoma patients early diagnosis of zzso brain zzso is zzso zzso zzso content and zzso are potential reasons for zzso characteristics of melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso zzso do not convert into melanoma zzso zzso zzso sequences cannot replace zzso zzso
