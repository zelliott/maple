Numerous studies have established a role for the zzso in cognitive zzso Current theories are at odds as to whether zzso itself directly engages or alternatively recruits other frontal cortical areas that implement zzso The zzso task, in which subjects are required to make a zzso to the location opposite a suddenly appearing visual zzso is a simple zzso paradigm that has been used extensively to investigate flexible zzso zzso Here, we tested a zzso role of the zzso zzso in cognitive control by applying electrical zzso during a zzso period while monkeys performed alternating blocks of zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced significant changes in zzso zzso zzso in both zzso On zzso trials, zzso were increased for zzso zzso to and decreased for zzso zzso to the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso were decreased for both zzso and zzso directed zzso These data show that zzso administered during response preparation facilitated the performance of zzso and are suggestive of a direct role of zzso in the zzso of cognitive zzso
