We investigated our 12-year experience of traumatic zzso injury zzso in our emergency medical zzso This study aimed to clarify clinical features of TDI and identify factors affecting mortality and morbidity in TDI zzso 

We analyzed clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso probability of survival zzso and mortality of patients treated for TDI at the zzso Emergency Medical Center of Tokyo Metropolitan zzso Hospital between January 1999 and December zzso 

TDI occurred in 28 zzso Of 21 TDI patients (75 zzso who underwent surgery, 2 died zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso presented with zzso arrest, and TDI was detected during zzso in the emergency room; all of these patients zzso zzso TDI occurred in 12 zzso penetrating TDI in zzso zzso trauma patients had significantly more injured zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower Ps zzso zzso zzso zzso of intensive care unit zzso stay and hospital stay were greater in blunt cases than in penetrating cases zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso lower Ps zzso zzso zzso and larger injured zzso size zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In blunt cases, delays in diagnosis and repair of TDI led to significantly increased zzso stay zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

TDI occurs in cases of multiple zzso Higher zzso and lower Ps predict zzso therefore, prompt diagnosis of TDI and immediate repair of zzso injury are zzso
