The role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso remains zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incremental benefit of zzso after ultrasound zzso for a large cohort of zzso patients at risk for a zzso zzso 

A retrospective review of outcomes in women with risk factors for a zzso zzso between November 1995 and February 2008 was zzso zzso criteria were high-risk women with abnormal zzso zzso on US or operative diagnosis of zzso zzso with or without a prenatal zzso zzso mode, diagnosis, and zzso requirements were zzso 

zzso in age from 19 to 43 years, with zero to five prior zzso zzso 139 women met inclusion zzso The zzso was performed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and operative diagnoses were highly correlated zzso zzso zzso Women who underwent both US and zzso were more likely to deliver by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the cohort is zzso by outcome diagnosis zzso zzso zzso no difference in delivery mode is zzso regardless of whether subjects were zzso by US alone or US and zzso zzso requirements were highest in the US and zzso group zzso of zzso units zzso zzso units in the US only group, P zzso zzso 

This study fails to demonstrate that the incremental use of zzso for zzso zzso changes delivery mode in zzso zzso Patients who underwent both US and zzso were most likely to have a zzso zzso delivery, and required more blood products, suggesting that undergoing tests may be indicative of an abnormal and at risk patient zzso
