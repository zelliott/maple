The aim of the study was to compare the accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso for the measurement of zzso length in silicone zzso zzso 

This was a prospective zzso study of 70 zzso zzso was performed using zzso in 33 patients zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 37 patients zzso zzso The difference between predicted and final refraction was measured and evaluated zzso 

In patients with zzso length zzso zzso the mean zzso of the final from predicted refraction was zzso zzso zzso D in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso D in the zzso zzso The difference between these two groups was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso length zzso zzso the mean zzso of the final from predicted refraction was zzso zzso zzso D in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso D in the zzso zzso There was no statistical significance between the two groups zzso zzso zzso 

For highly zzso patients zzso zzso was a more accurate measurement of zzso length in silicone zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were comparably accurate in measuring zzso length in patients with zzso length zzso zzso
