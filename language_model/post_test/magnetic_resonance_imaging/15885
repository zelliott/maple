The authors analyzed zzso and zzso agreement with respect to interpretation of simple magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso and zzso images for the diagnosis of zzso lateral disc zzso including zzso and zzso disc zzso 

zzso patients in whom zzso lateral disc zzso was suspected or confirmed by simple magnetic resonance imaging at one institute between May 2003 and December 2004 were zzso The magnetic resonance images consisting of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso images, and these were reviewed blindly and independently by three zzso spine surgeons in a random zzso The images were interpreted as positive or negative for lateral disc zzso on 2 different occasions 3 months zzso zzso were analyzed using Cohen's zzso zzso and strengths of agreements were determined using the Landis and Koch zzso 

The zzso values for zzso agreement averaged zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the first occasion, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the second occasion, with an overall mean value of zzso Thus, the strength of agreement was only zzso according to the Landis and Koch zzso Kappa values for zzso agreement averaged zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), indicating moderate zzso 

The present study indicates that simple magnetic resonance imaging is not a reliable imaging zzso for diagnosing zzso lateral disc zzso Another imaging study with improved diagnostic values should be developed to diagnose this zzso zzso
