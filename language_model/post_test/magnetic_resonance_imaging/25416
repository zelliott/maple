zzso zzso twin cohort zzso 

Our goal was to investigate the associations between different spinal zzso findings and zzso past year, and lifetime low back pain after adjusting for occupational physical zzso smoking, zzso and early family zzso 

The role of spinal pathology in back symptoms continues to be zzso 

The study participants consisted of 115 zzso male twin pairs 35 to 69 years of zzso The zzso assessed zzso parameters were as zzso disc zzso bulging, zzso zzso tears, zzso spinal zzso and zzso zzso Signal intensity was measured zzso 

After controlling for age, disc height was associated with all back pain variables studied and zzso tears with zzso frequency and intensity during the 12 months before zzso Both were associated with lifetime frequency of low back pain interfering with daily activities, zzso and intensity of the worst lifetime pain zzso Other zzso findings did not explain the various symptom zzso zzso for physical loading in the past 12 months increased the associations of zzso tears and zzso back pain zzso and 12-month low back pain zzso After controlling for zzso and other familial zzso the zzso differences in disc height and zzso tears accounted for zzso to zzso of the total zzso in the zzso differences of low back pain zzso 

These findings raise new questions about the underlying mechanisms of zzso The sensitivities of the only significant zzso zzso disc height narrowing and zzso tears, are poor, and these findings alone are of limited clinical zzso
