zzso therapy with zzso increases the risk of zzso transformation zzso after cerebral zzso We employed contrast enhancement zzso with zzso to detect zzso in a rat model of zzso stroke treated with zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 4 h after zzso zzso Male zzso rats were subjected to zzso stroke and treated with the combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso or with saline zzso at 4 h after onset of zzso zzso studies were performed immediately and at 24 h after zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained at 48 zzso With zzso zzso images and zzso related zzso parameters (the zzso transfer constant, zzso and the distribution volume of mobile zzso zzso of 15 out of 18 animals showed zzso regions in gross or microscopic zzso areas at 24 zzso confirmed zzso at 48 h post zzso zzso enhancement zzso detected six of seven zzso animals with gross zzso and nine of zzso zzso animals with microscopic zzso at 24 h after zzso Two of zzso animals with zzso had zzso zzso of zzso at 3 h post zzso However, compared to zzso data measured zzso at 48 h in zzso stroke rats, the enhanced areas by zzso at 24 h were larger, and the patterns zzso intensity and zzso did not directly correlate to the zzso of zzso zzso gross or microscopic zzso zzso enhancement zzso using zzso provides a method to detect gross and microscopic zzso after stroke in zzso
