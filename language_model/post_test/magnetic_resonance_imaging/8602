We used a zzso resonance imaging technique to investigate abnormalities in the locus zzso in zzso We examined 20 patients with major depression and 43 zzso controls using a 3 T scanner with a zzso zzso The signal zzso of the areas corresponding to the zzso middle, and zzso portions of the locus zzso were measured, and the contrast ratio relative to the adjacent zzso zzso was zzso In controls, the contrast ratio in the middle portion was higher than in the zzso and zzso zzso In patients, contrast ratios in the zzso and middle portions were significantly decreased in comparison with controls, suggesting dysfunction of the ascending zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging can be used to zzso abnormalities in the locus zzso of depressive zzso
