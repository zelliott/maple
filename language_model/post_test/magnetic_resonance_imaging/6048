The distinction between zzso of the deep zzso space and those of the carotid space has been greatly facilitated by zzso imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging zzso due to 1) good assessment of zzso fat zzso and 2) reliable and consistent identification of the carotid zzso While zzso space masses consistently zzso the carotid artery zzso it is generally assumed that carotid space masses, particularly zzso zzso the carotid artery zzso We report on a patient with a rare zzso zzso of the carotid space that caused zzso displacement of the carotid zzso 

A 38-year-old female presented with headaches and a zzso sensation of a foreign body without zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a left carotid space mass, suggestive of a zzso although the internal carotid artery was displaced zzso The mass was zzso at zzso The patient underwent surgical zzso of her zzso via a left zzso zzso 

In our patient with a carotid space mass, all imaging features suggested a zzso except for zzso displacement of the carotid zzso A zzso nerve zzso was found at zzso zzso of the zzso nerve are zzso and those originating from the zzso course of the nerve are extremely zzso 

zzso of the zzso carotid space most commonly arise from the zzso nerve and have a typical pattern, which includes anterior displacement of the carotid zzso A rare exception to this has been reported in zzso of the sympathetic zzso which may zzso the carotid artery zzso Our patient had a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which caused zzso carotid zzso
