A primary function of the zzso zzso lobe zzso is to signal prior encounter with zzso relevant zzso zzso match zzso zzso when viewing previously encountered zzso been observed for zzso stimuli in nonhuman primates during zzso tasks and in humans during more complex zzso memory zzso Match enhancement may alternatively reflect zzso an zzso response to familiar relative to novel stimuli or zzso the retrieval of contextual details surrounding the past encounter with familiar zzso To gain leverage on the functional significance of match enhancement in the zzso high-resolution zzso of human zzso was conducted while participants attended, ignored, or passively viewed face and scene stimuli in the context of a modified zzso zzso On each zzso trial, two zzso stimuli were encountered before a probe that either matched or mismatched one of the attended zzso enabling examination of the consequences of encountering one of the zzso stimuli as a match probe on later memory for the other zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso was insensitive to the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was modulated by zzso attention, and zzso zzso showed more subtle and general effects of zzso By contrast, all zzso zzso demonstrated match enhancement to the probe, and a zzso test revealed more accurate recognition memory for the zzso zzso stimulus on match relative to mismatch zzso These data suggest that match enhancement in human zzso reflects retrieval of other zzso contextual details surrounding a zzso prior zzso
