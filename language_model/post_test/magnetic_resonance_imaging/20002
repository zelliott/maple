zzso marking with zzso fine needles enables the optical zzso zzso zzso scanning plane to be localized within the zzso zzso to an accuracy of approximately 50 zzso zzso water content is an especially important zzso for in zzso zzso zzso tends to produce an increase in surface reflections and a reduction in imaging zzso 

The aim of this in zzso study was to evaluate parameters relevant to the zzso and conservation process to allow optimal images to be generated for later differentiation between healthy and zzso tissue in zzso 

Various methods of marking samples were applied in zzso to achieve accurate zzso of the zzso scanning plane and the corresponding section of the zzso zzso The influence of temperature and tissue water content was investigated using both zzso and human zzso zzso were marked using fine needles, zzso craters generated by laser application, and zzso markers introduced into the zzso 

It was demonstrated that the water content of tissue exerts a direct influence on zzso imaging, whereas above 15 degrees C temperature had no effect on image zzso With regard to the marking of samples, the best results were obtained using zzso fine zzso
