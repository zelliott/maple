zzso contours zzso edges that exist in the absence of local stimulus zzso demonstrate that perception is an active process, creating features not present in the light patterns striking the zzso zzso contours are thought to be processed using mechanisms that partially overlap with those of zzso zzso but questions about the neural zzso of these zzso zzso Here, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to obtain zzso signals from human visual zzso while subjects viewed different types of zzso both real and zzso We sampled these signals independently from nine visual areas, each defined by zzso or other independent zzso Using both zzso and zzso analysis, we found evidence for overlapping sites of zzso most areas responded to most types of zzso However, there were distinctive differences in the strength of activity across areas and zzso zzso Two types of zzso contours differed in the strength of zzso of the zzso areas, but both types activated zzso zzso visual areas, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The extent of zzso was largely zzso across a range of stimulus sizes that produce zzso contours zzso but it was related to the spatial frequency of zzso zzso Finally, there was a striking similarity in the pattern of results for the zzso zzso shape and a similar shape defined by zzso zzso These and other results suggest a role in surface perception for this lateral zzso region that includes zzso zzso zzso and zzso
