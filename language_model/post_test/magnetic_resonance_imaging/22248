The effects of zzso pulse parameters on zzso transfer contrast zzso were investigated using a zzso prepared segmented fast zzso echo zzso zzso was found not to be uniquely determined by the specific zzso rate zzso zzso pulse parameters zzso zzso number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso also affect zzso There can be zzso variation in zzso due to differences in zzso parameters at zzso zzso 1 zzso for a zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso is a more efficient way to increase zzso than increasing zzso zzso This phenomenon is likely caused by the fact that the time scale for zzso transfer between the free and restricted zzso pools is on the same order or longer than the duration of the zzso zzso zzso increase in the zzso pulse duration by increasing the number of zzso zzso in the zzso pulse allows more effective zzso zzso Such information can be used as a guide to select zzso pulse parameters for a zzso transfer zzso zzso An zzso zzso pulse designed under this guide for coronary MR zzso improved the depiction of zzso zzso
