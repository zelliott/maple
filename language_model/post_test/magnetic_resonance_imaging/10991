Forty-eight patients with swelling of the zzso region were zzso The relationship between the zzso and the zzso zzso and the displacement of the anterior facial vein were zzso 

The accuracy of the predictions based on the relationship between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was zzso on zzso CT zzso zzso on CT zzso zzso and zzso on zzso Although the displacement of the facial vein outside the zzso suggested an zzso zzso and inside the zzso suggested an zzso zzso these were not sufficient to differentiate the zzso in 7 out of 23 zzso cases and 4 out of 11 zzso zzso 

The finding of a relationship between the zzso and the zzso is the most important finding of this zzso
