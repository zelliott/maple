To investigate the neural activity zzso by conflict zzso we recorded zzso zzso during a spatial version of the Simon zzso In this task, participants have to release a key according to the direction of an zzso while ignoring the side on which this stimulus is zzso zzso are, zzso faster when stimulus and response side match zzso zzso than when they do not match zzso zzso zzso showed that, in incompatible trials, a negative potential arising before response execution and corresponding to the zzso zzso potential component was zzso The zzso analysis localized this potential to the anterior zzso zzso We suggest that this brain region is involved in the zzso of incorrect responses in incompatible zzso
