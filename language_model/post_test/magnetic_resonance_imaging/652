To evaluate the safety and zzso of a newly developed MR contrast medium consisting of very small zzso iron oxide particles zzso coated with zzso zzso in a clinical phase I zzso 

A total of 18 healthy subjects received either zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso total zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso in water at zzso T zzso zzso and zzso 30 zzso at doses of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 per zzso or zzso zzso zzso 1 per zzso as intravenous zzso Physical status and vital parameters were recorded, blood samples were collected for clinical chemistry and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed before and for up to 2 weeks after zzso 

No serious adverse events zzso The most pronounced adverse events occurred in 2 subjects of the highest dose group zzso minutes after zzso These were a drop in blood pressure and a drop in oxygen zzso which were considered to be possibly drug-related and rapidly resolved without zzso Otherwise, no relevant changes in vital and laboratory parameters were zzso The parameters of iron metabolism exhibited zzso zzso zzso The injection of zzso decreased zzso relaxation time of blood below 100 milliseconds for 18 minutes after a dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso and for 60 minutes after zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The favorable data on the safety, zzso and efficacy of zzso justify further clinical phase II and III trials as a contrast medium for zzso
