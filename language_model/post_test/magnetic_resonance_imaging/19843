A quantitative method was applied to measure the volume of white matter zzso zzso in different brain regions of subjects with Alzheimer's disease zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and normal healthy zzso controls, and the relationship between regional zzso and age and cognitive function was zzso 

zzso subjects were included in this study, 27 zzso 15 zzso and 14 normal zzso zzso A zzso software was developed for zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso State zzso and cognitive scores in performing naming, language zzso and memory tasks were obtained for correlation zzso 

zzso patients had the greatest total zzso volume, followed by zzso then zzso However, there was a large variation within each group, and the difference did not reach a significant zzso There was a positive linear correlation between the total zzso zzso zzso zzso and the frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After age correction the Boston Naming Test scores were zzso correlated with the total zzso volume in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the control zzso zzso zzso groups, and with the frontal zzso in controls zzso zzso zzso 

We demonstrated a quantitative analysis method to measure regional zzso Although zzso was not strongly associated with disease severity or zzso it may provide a characteristic zzso zzso in the study of zzso zzso
