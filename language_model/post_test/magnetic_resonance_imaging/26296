The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in evaluating zzso disease zzso zzso The zzso inflammatory activity is usually present in patients under zzso treatment, despite their clinical zzso 

Twenty patients with CD, all under zzso treatment, were zzso studied by zzso at zzso T as a periodic zzso zzso of three zzso zzso was considered an index of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso intravenous injection, were zzso A negative zzso contrast agent was orally zzso The following zzso parameters were zzso evaluated by three zzso at the level of the affected zzso and compared with clinical zzso wall thickness zzso wall zzso signal zzso wall contrast enhancement zzso amount of zzso proliferation zzso and zzso signal of zzso proliferation on zzso images zzso The zzso zzso of agreement was zzso The zzso rank correlation was used for the analysis of clinical and zzso zzso 

zzso of 20 patients were in clinical zzso zzso Disease zzso Index zzso zzso On the basis of laboratory tests, nine of 20 patients had biologically active zzso An excellent correlation was found between BA and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a lower correlation was found between BA and zzso and between BA and zzso zzso and zzso Excellent statistical correlation was also found between WE and zzso and between WE and zzso zzso and zzso 

An excellent statistical correlation was found between biologically zzso disease and the following zzso zzso wall zzso enhancement, wall zzso on zzso zzso images, and zzso of zzso proliferation on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be valuable in assessing CD zzso
