Dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging zzso allows imaging of the physiology of the zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic efficacy of time intensity curve zzso and zzso parameters for characterization of zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso before zzso For each zzso peak height zzso maximum enhancement ratio zzso time of peak enhancement zzso and maximum rise slope zzso were plotted and zzso zzso operator characteristics zzso analysis was conducted to assess the appropriate zzso zzso 

All 26 zzso that demonstrated persistent pattern zzso zzso were zzso Most of the masses with the zzso pattern zzso zzso were zzso zzso including zzso zzso and melanoma zzso The zzso of benign zzso was statistically lower than zzso ones, while the zzso and zzso values of benign zzso were significantly zzso No statistical difference was found in zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso benign zzso zzso from zzso ones were zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the three zzso zzso zzso zzso value of zzso provided the highest sensitivity of zzso however, the corresponding specificity was low zzso The zzso zzso value of zzso and zzso zzso value of zzso respectively offered the best diagnostic zzso 

zzso especially the qualitative zzso pattern and quantitative value of zzso zzso and zzso could be a complementary investigation in distinguishing zzso zzso tumor from benign zzso
