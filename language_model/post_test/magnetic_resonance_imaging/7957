To compare the performance of zzso imaging using MR zzso correction zzso zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer patients with that of zzso using zzso zzso correction and to compare the zzso accuracy in zzso and in normal organ zzso 

A total of 36 patients underwent a zzso zzso scan zzso after injection and an average of 62 zzso later a second scan using a hybrid zzso zzso zzso and zzso were compared visually by rating zzso allocation and image zzso Regional zzso zzso in zzso was zzso using volumes of interest, and zzso and mean standardized zzso values zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso tumor volume (MTV) of each zzso was zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso in normal organ tissue was assessed as zzso and zzso in liver, zzso left zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso 74 zzso positive zzso were zzso by both zzso and zzso No significant differences in zzso allocation scores were found between zzso and zzso while contrast score of zzso on zzso was significantly zzso Both zzso and zzso of zzso were significantly higher on zzso than on zzso with strong correlations between zzso and zzso data zzso zzso of all zzso were zzso lower on zzso than on zzso but no statistically significant difference was observed, and an excellent correlation between zzso of MTV with zzso and zzso was found zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were significantly lower by zzso than by zzso for zzso liver and muscle, no significant difference was observed for zzso while either zzso and zzso of zzso were significantly higher by zzso High correlations were found between zzso and zzso for both zzso and zzso of the left zzso zzso zzso zzso while moderate correlations were found for the other normal organ zzso zzso zzso 

zzso showed equivalent performance in terms of qualitative zzso detection to zzso Despite significant differences in zzso zzso zzso due to either zzso and biological factors, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and normal organ zzso correlated zzso This study demonstrates that integrated zzso zzso is feasible in a clinical setting with high quality and in a short examination zzso
