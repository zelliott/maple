Recently, the type 2 diabetes medication, zzso has come under scrutiny for possibly increasing the risk of cardiac disease and zzso To investigate the effects of zzso on the diabetic heart, we performed cardiac zzso profiling and imaging studies of a zzso model of type 2 diabetes, the zzso zzso zzso 

We compared cardiac gene expression profiles from three groups: zzso zzso mice, zzso mice after zzso treatment, and zzso zzso zzso Prior to zzso we also performed cardiac magnetic resonance zzso and zzso As expected, overall the zzso gene expression signature was markedly different from control, but to our surprise was not significantly reversed with zzso In particular, we have uncovered a number of zzso modulated genes and pathways that may play a role in the zzso of the increase in cardiac mortality as seen in several recent zzso Specifically, the cumulative zzso of zzso a zzso zzso gene that has previously been implicated in plaque zzso zzso zzso channel genes involved in membrane potential maintenance and action potential generation, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso together give cause for concern over zzso zzso Lastly, in zzso imaging studies revealed minimal differences between zzso and zzso zzso mouse hearts, indicating that zzso effects on gene expression in the heart do not immediately turn into zzso gross functional zzso 

This study maps the zzso expression patterns in the hearts of the zzso zzso model of diabetes and illustrates the impact of zzso on these zzso The zzso gene expression signature was markedly different from control, and was not reversed with zzso A smaller number of unique and interesting changes in gene expression were noted with zzso zzso Further study of these genes and molecular pathways will provide important insights into the cardiac zzso associated with both diabetes and zzso zzso
