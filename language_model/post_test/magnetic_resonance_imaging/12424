zzso zzso zzso is a zzso idiopathic zzso of zzso bone structure with the risk for secondary damage to adjacent zzso cartilage and the development of premature zzso The exact zzso of zzso is unknown, although repetitive zzso and vascular zzso have been previously zzso A genetic predisposition has been suggested, but the existing evidence is zzso There are multiple case reports of twins and siblings with zzso and a few large family series in the literature, promoting the theory that zzso may have a genetic component to its zzso This article describes 2 sets of zzso twins presenting zzso with zzso of their dominant knees, offering further support for a genetic component to the zzso of zzso Interestingly, in both sets of zzso 1 was left-handed and 1 was zzso Both sets of twins had simultaneous presentations and clinical courses, lending support to a genetic element to zzso The development of the zzso zzso in the dominant knee of each patient suggests an environmental influence, perhaps due to repetitive zzso and zzso Recently, a zzso linkage study identified a prime candidate locus for zzso However, despite the suggested association, genetic and zzso factors in the development of zzso remain relatively zzso The authors believe zzso twins provide an excellent clinical opportunity for future examination of the role of familial inheritance in the zzso of zzso
