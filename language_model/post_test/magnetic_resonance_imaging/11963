Renal cortical and zzso zzso zzso relaxation times were measured at various time points over a period of 56 days following the administration of a single zzso injection of 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso zzso zzso or 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso to male zzso zzso Administration of a single injection of zzso caused a dramatic, immediate rise in the cortical zzso values above control values, and these levels remained elevated zzso by Day 28 zzso the levels were back to control zzso Administration of zzso also caused an zzso in cortical zzso values, but in this case these values remained above control values for the rest of the zzso The administration of zzso did not produce any significant increases in cortical zzso values until 14 days zzso The elevated zzso values remained above control values for the rest of the zzso These increases observed in cortical zzso values appeared to be mirrored by decreases in zzso zzso zzso zzso in cortical zzso values were accompanied by visual changes in the zzso images and enlargement of the zzso The zzso findings were consistent with the zzso data, confirming that zzso the zzso did show a full recovery by Day 28 in the zzso zzso This was not the case following injection of both zzso and zzso where necrosis was not zzso and there was no recovery of the zzso
