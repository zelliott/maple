The objective of this study is to evaluate zzso accuracy and time requirements of zzso image fusion of the zzso spine after zzso zzso MR and CT images derived from standard imaging protocols zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso spine with correct zzso zzso 5) and incorrect zzso zzso 5) implant position were fused by two readers zzso zzso using zzso in two sessions placing one zzso 1) or two zzso 2) reference zzso on the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso from the second zzso to the first zzso zzso zzso was an experienced musculoskeletal zzso zzso a spine surgeon, both had received a short training on the software zzso Fusion times and fusion zzso defined as the largest zzso between MR and CT in the median zzso plane on the zzso tip of the zzso end plate of the most zzso vertebra visible on the CT, were measured in both zzso zzso or incorrect implant position was evaluated upon the fused images for all patients by an experienced senior staff musculoskeletal zzso Mean fusion time zzso zzso 2; in zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mean fusion zzso zzso zzso 2; in zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso implant position was identified correctly in all zzso In conclusion, zzso image fusion of the spine with metallic implants is zzso fast, accurate and easy to implement in daily routine zzso
