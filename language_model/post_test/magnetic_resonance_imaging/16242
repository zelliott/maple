zzso necrosis factor alpha was recently implicated as an important zzso of communication between the peripheral and cerebral immune systems in an animal model of chronic zzso The purpose of this study was to examine by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso the influence of inflammation on cerebral metabolism in patients with zzso arthritis zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was performed on 35 zzso patients (6 men and 29 zzso mean zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso and 28 healthy zzso and zzso control subjects (9 men and 19 zzso mean zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the study subjects had any zzso signs or zzso Clinical markers of disease activity were correlated with the zzso zzso 

Patients with active zzso as reflected by an elevated zzso zzso rate zzso had a significantly higher ratio of zzso to zzso and a significantly lower ratio of zzso to zzso than did patients with inactive zzso as reflected by a normal zzso Moreover, the ratios of zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso were significantly correlated with the zzso after correction for age, sex, smoking status, zzso alcohol consumption, medication use, and disease zzso Medication use had no additional effect on these zzso 

Our data show that systemic inflammation in zzso is associated with zzso changes in the zzso
