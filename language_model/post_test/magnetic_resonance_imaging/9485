Violent content in video games evokes many concerns but there is little research concerning its rewarding zzso It was demonstrated that playing a video game leads to zzso zzso zzso It is zzso however, which aspects of the game cause this reward system zzso and if violent content contributes to zzso We combined functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso with individual affect measures to address the zzso zzso of violence in a video zzso 

Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter game zzso zzso zzso on zzso during zzso zzso We defined success as eliminating opponents, and failure as being eliminated zzso zzso was measured directly before and after game play using the Positive and zzso zzso Schedule zzso Failure and success events evoked increased activity in visual zzso but only failure decreased activity in zzso zzso and zzso zzso A negative correlation between negative affect and responses to failure was evident in the right zzso pole zzso 

The zzso of the zzso nucleus during failure is in accordance with its role in zzso zzso it occurred whenever subject missed an expected reward zzso eliminated rather than eliminating the zzso We found no indication that violence events were directly rewarding for the zzso We addressed zzso evaluations of affect change due to zzso to study the reward zzso zzso reporting greater negative affect after playing the game had less zzso activity associated with zzso The zzso may therefore be involved in evaluating the failure events in a social context, to regulate the players' zzso
