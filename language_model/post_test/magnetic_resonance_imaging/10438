An association between zzso spectrum disorder and zzso impairment might result from dysfunction in mirror zzso zzso that serve to relate observed actions to motor zzso To explore this hypothesis, we employed a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso protocol previously used to identify the neural zzso of zzso and human MN function, to compare 16 adolescent males of normal intelligence with zzso spectrum disorder zzso and age, sex and zzso matched zzso In the control group, in zzso with previous findings, we identified activity attributable to zzso in areas of the right zzso zzso zzso in this area was less extensive in the zzso group and was absent during zzso action zzso zzso area was minimally active during zzso in zzso zzso patterns of activity during zzso and action observation in zzso and controls were most evident in an area at the right zzso junction also associated with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso participants also failed to show zzso of left zzso activity during zzso that was evident in the zzso This may have implications for understanding the zzso of emotional stimuli in zzso Overall, we suggest that zzso is associated with altered patterns of brain activity during zzso which could stem from poor integration between areas serving zzso zzso zzso and emotional zzso Such poor integration is likely to adversely affect the development of zzso through zzso as well as other aspects of social cognitive function in zzso
