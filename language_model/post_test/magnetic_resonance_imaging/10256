zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may help zzso the zzso zone zzso by detecting changes in regional cerebral blood flow induced by zzso zzso This imaging method also reveals zzso in areas of seizure zzso including the zzso zzso to the zzso We have studied the zzso the topography, and the clinical value of such zzso zzso zzso areas zzso 

We examined data from zzso evaluations of 36 consecutive patients with zzso partial zzso of various zzso zzso and zzso zzso examinations were made with zzso and the scans were processed for zzso zzso zzso and merging with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were observed in zzso of the zzso 50% of zzso zzso cases with zzso zzso zzso of the other zzso zzso zzso of zzso lateral zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were usually symmetrical to the zzso forming a mirror image, observed in zzso of the zzso They could be slightly zzso in zzso zzso perhaps because of the particular zzso pathways linking zzso zzso In zzso zzso they were located in the zzso zzso to the zzso 

We show that the symmetrical nature of the mirror image usually does not disturb zzso zzso It can confirm the location of the zzso (11 zzso and even occasionally improve the precision of its definition zzso zzso by restraining several potential zzso zzso to a single one or by permitting a restricted zzso of the zzso in a large zzso
