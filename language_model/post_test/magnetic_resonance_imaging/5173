The collateral zzso complex is an important landmark on the zzso surface of the zzso zzso zzso it zzso the zzso regions of the zzso zzso from the zzso areas of the zzso zzso zzso it continues into the zzso zzso bearing no relationship to the zzso zzso zzso Given the considerable extent of the zzso and functional zzso of the surrounding cortex, an investigation of the zzso of this zzso was carried out to examine whether it is continuous or a series of zzso parts, zzso independent zzso classified together under the name collateral zzso We investigated the collateral zzso complex using magnetic resonance images taking into account the three-dimensional nature of the zzso Our examination demonstrated three separate zzso segments: zzso an anterior segment, the zzso zzso zzso the zzso from the adjacent zzso zzso zzso a middle segment, the collateral zzso proper, forming the lateral border of the zzso zzso cortex, and zzso a zzso segment, the zzso extent of the collateral zzso within the zzso zzso Three relationships exist between the zzso zzso and collateral zzso proper, only one being clearly identifiable from the zzso zzso the collateral zzso proper and the zzso collateral zzso although appearing continuous on the brain surface, can be separated in the depth of the zzso in all zzso These results provide zzso of the location and zzso within standard zzso space for the three collateral zzso segments that could be used to aid accurate identification of functional zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso
