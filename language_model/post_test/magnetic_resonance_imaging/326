Fischer developed a scoring system in 1999 that made identifying zzso zzso much easier for inexperienced zzso Our study was performed to assess whether this scoring system would help zzso to accurately diagnose breast zzso on magnetic resonance zzso imaging and to assess the correlation between the magnetic resonance zzso Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System zzso zzso grade and the final zzso 

The zzso zzso and contrast zzso of 63 masses in 41 patients were evaluated on zzso and zzso a zzso zzso final assessment category using the Fischer scoring zzso The accuracy was evaluated after the final diagnosis was obtained by tissue sampling and follow-up zzso 

There were 25 zzso and 30 benign zzso Eight zzso were seen by zzso only and we could not verify their pathology since we did not have zzso biopsy facilities at the time of the zzso On MR zzso the proven zzso zzso were characterized as zzso category V in 16 zzso category IV in 7 zzso and category III in 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso were graded as category V in 3 zzso category IV in 6 zzso and category III in 3 zzso category II in 10 zzso and category I in 8 zzso zzso The zzso zzso category accurately predicted zzso in zzso and a benign pathology in zzso of the zzso The overlap between the zzso features of chronic inflammatory zzso and zzso resulted in a lower accuracy in diagnosing benign as compared to zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso lexicon using the Fischer scoring system is useful and has a high zzso value, especially for zzso breast zzso and is easy to zzso Overlapping features between benign inflammatory and zzso zzso might yield a reduced accuracy in inflammatory zzso
