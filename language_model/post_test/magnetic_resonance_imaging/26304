The aim of this study was to compare zzso the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT and zzso in diagnosing primary and zzso zzso zzso zzso patients (age range zzso zzso were recruited with suspicious zzso zzso at presentation zzso zzso 8) or follow-up for recurrence zzso zzso zzso All patients were scheduled for zzso and zzso zzso zzso PET with zzso zzso spiral CT of the abdomen, including the zzso and zzso of the entire abdomen were zzso Each imaging study was evaluated zzso Imaging findings were correlated with zzso zzso The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for zzso characterization in patients with suspicious zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) were, zzso 100, 67 and zzso for zzso 100, 67 and zzso for CT; and 100, 100 and zzso for zzso For the diagnosis of zzso disease zzso zzso 10), PET had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of 50% and accuracy of zzso The PET technique was the only technique which correctly identified a single zzso colon zzso zzso for CT were 40, 50 and zzso and for zzso 86, 100 and zzso zzso No statistically significant difference was zzso Neither zzso PET nor CT nor zzso can replace surgery in the detection of microscopic zzso zzso No statistically significant difference was observed for the investigated imaging zzso with regard to zzso characterization or detection of zzso zzso thus, the methods are permissible zzso The PET technique, however, has the drawback of less accurate spatial assignment of small zzso compared with CT and zzso
