zzso zzso mapping with functional MR imaging is gaining acceptance in clinical practice; however, to our knowledge, its therapeutic efficacy has not been assessed in a sizable group of zzso Our goal was to identify how zzso zzso functional studies were used to guide the treatment of zzso and zzso surgery zzso 

We zzso reviewed the medical records of 46 patients who had undergone zzso zzso functional MR imaging to document how often and in what ways the imaging studies had influenced their zzso Clinical management decisions were grouped into three zzso for assessing the feasibility of surgical zzso for surgical planning, and for selecting patients for invasive functional mapping zzso 

zzso MR imaging studies successfully identified the functional central zzso zzso to the zzso in 32 of the 46 patients, and these 32 patients are the focus of this zzso In zzso surgery candidates, the functional MR imaging results were used to determine in part the feasibility of a proposed surgical zzso in zzso of patients, to aid in surgical planning in zzso and to select patients for invasive surgical functional mapping in zzso In tumor patients, the functional MR imaging results were used to determine in part the feasibility of surgical zzso in zzso to aid in surgical planning in zzso and to select patients for invasive surgical functional mapping in zzso Overall, functional MR imaging studies were used in one or more of the three clinical decision-making categories in zzso of tumor patients and zzso of zzso surgery zzso 

zzso functional MR imaging is useful to clinicians at three key stages in the zzso clinical management paradigm of a substantial percentage of patients who are being considered for zzso tumor or zzso zzso
