A method for performing nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso simultaneously from more than a single zzso zzso zzso is zzso The method employs the detection of magnetic resonance signals in an array of zzso where each detector is responsible for detecting a unique frequency bandwidth or a magnetic resonance signal from a unique location in a region in a primary, substantially zzso zzso magnetic zzso The detectors may be separated logically into groups, zzso all the detectors in a given group are essentially zzso from each other to substantially eliminate zzso by switching circuits or by being placed from each other sufficiently zzso zzso of detected signals from detectors in this array is done simultaneously over groups of zzso zzso The detected signals from all detectors in a given group are simultaneously transmitted to a single zzso thus increasing significantly the zzso ratio zzso in that zzso Prior to zzso each detected zzso signal of each detector to the zzso each detected signal is separately and uniquely zzso zzso This provides a method zzso the signal of each detector is uniquely zzso zzso all these zzso signals, which were simultaneously received in a number of zzso detectors into a single amplifier, results in the total signal having a high zzso zzso This total amplified signal is later zzso into each zzso original signal by a decoding zzso Conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques may be thereafter applied to obtain an zzso Or else, conventional zzso techniques may be thereafter applied to obtain an improved zzso from a sample, using a single zzso with a multitude of zzso zzso this method to a large number of miniature and closely packed zzso detectors placed in an zzso zzso results in an zzso technique with a very fast acquisition time, an increased zzso and a high spatial resolution equivalent to the number of detectors per unit of zzso zzso and decoupling zzso allow for images from layers as deep as 6 zzso to be zzso
