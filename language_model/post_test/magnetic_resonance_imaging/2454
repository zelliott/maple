The advantages of zzso zzso in the management of primary zzso have not been clearly zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso the accuracy of three zzso techniques in patients with this zzso 

zzso consecutive patients with primary zzso underwent zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso scanning before surgery, during which an attempt was made to identify all zzso zzso A scan was regarded as correct if it identified an enlarged zzso zzso on the correct side of the neck as subsequently demonstrated at zzso 

zzso had a sensitivity of 38 per cent (18 correct scans in 47 zzso with a positive zzso value of 78 per zzso The sensitivity of zzso was 72 per cent zzso of zzso with a zzso value of 92 per zzso zzso scanning was 60 per cent sensitive zzso of zzso with a zzso value of 85 per zzso Two patients with negative neck explorations were subsequently found to have zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso scanning have limited value as zzso techniques and the relatively low sensitivity of these investigations means they are of no value before first-time zzso
