The use of repeated measures of an outcome variable to improve statistical power and precision in zzso clinical trials and cohort studies is well zzso Linear mixed models have great utility in the analysis of such studies in many medical applications including zzso However, in imaging studies and other applications the basic outcome can be a zzso measure of change in a zzso as opposed to a difference calculated by zzso of one measured value from zzso The correlation structure of such repeated measures of zzso change, in particular the zzso of zzso consecutive measures, adds complexity to the zzso In this paper, we present a family of zzso mixed models for the analysis of such data and explain how to implement them using standard statistical zzso We illustrate the use of our models with data from a cohort of patients with Alzheimer's zzso
