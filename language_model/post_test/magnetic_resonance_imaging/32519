We used the zzso auditory zzso response zzso to compare for the first time zzso frequency representations in the region of primary auditory zzso zzso between subjects with chronic zzso and hearing impairment and normal hearing zzso zzso representations were measured in normal hearing zzso and zzso zzso subjects using eight carrier zzso between zzso and zzso zzso each zzso modulated zzso at zzso on trials of 3 zzso duration under passive zzso In normal hearing subjects, frequency zzso were observed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were consistent with the orientation of zzso zzso and with functional organization revealed by zzso zzso The frequency representation in the right zzso was approximately 5 zzso anterior and approximately 7 zzso lateral to that in the left hemisphere, corroborating with zzso zzso zzso zzso reported by zzso studies of the zzso and by zzso zzso In the left hemisphere, frequency zzso were zzso near 2 zzso in normal hearing zzso These zzso frequency zzso were attenuated in both zzso in zzso zzso zzso power was also elevated in zzso suggesting that more zzso were zzso zzso by the AM zzso These findings are consistent with animal experiments reporting altered zzso and changes in the response properties of auditory cortical zzso after hearing loss induced by noise zzso zzso frequency representations in zzso may reflect a loss of zzso zzso in zzso frequency regions of the zzso after hearing zzso
