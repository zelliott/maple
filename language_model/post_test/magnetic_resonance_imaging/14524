The zzso effects of zzso on brain functional connectivity are incompletely zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is widely used to assess the functional connectivity in humans and zzso zzso is an zzso agent with desirable characteristics for functional zzso in animals but its zzso effects on zzso functional connectivity have not been zzso Here we tested the hypothesis that brain functional connectivity zzso specific changes in distinct neural networks at zzso depths associated with loss of zzso We acquired spontaneous blood oxygen zzso zzso signals simultaneously with zzso zzso signals from rats under zzso zzso administered zzso at increasing doses from light sedation to deep zzso zzso 40, 60, 80, and 100 zzso zzso Power zzso and burst suppression ratio were calculated from the zzso to verify zzso zzso zzso connectivity was determined from the whole brain correlation of zzso data in regions of interest followed by a zzso of the correlation maps into zzso defined regional zzso We found that zzso produced zzso dose dependent changes in functional connectivity of various cortical and zzso zzso zzso analysis predicted segregation of connectivity into two cortical and two zzso zzso In one cortical cluster zzso and zzso the early reduction in connectivity was followed by transient zzso in the other cluster zzso motor and zzso this rebound was zzso The connectivity of the zzso cluster zzso zzso and zzso was strongly reduced, whereas that of another zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did zzso zzso connectivity increased again in deep zzso associated with zzso burst zzso Regional correlation analysis confirmed the breakdown of connectivity within and between specific cortical and zzso networks with deepening zzso zzso zzso connectivity was suppressed before zzso connectivity at a critical zzso dose associated with loss of zzso
