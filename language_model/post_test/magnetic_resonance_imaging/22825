The effects of exercise on zzso zzso zzso cartilage have traditionally been examined in animal models, but until recently little information has been available on human zzso zzso resonance imaging now permits cartilage zzso and composition to be zzso zzso in zzso This review briefly describes the zzso background of quantitative cartilage imaging and summarizes work on short-term zzso zzso and long-term zzso zzso effects of exercise on human zzso zzso Current findings suggest that human cartilage zzso very little in zzso during zzso activities and recovers from deformation within 90 zzso after zzso Whereas cartilage deformation appears to become less with increasing age, sex and physical training status do not seem to affect in zzso zzso zzso There is now good evidence that cartilage zzso some type of zzso zzso under reduced loading conditions, such as with zzso zzso and zzso However, increased loading (as encountered by elite zzso does not appear to be associated with increased average cartilage zzso zzso in zzso however, suggest a strong genetic contribution to cartilage zzso Potential reasons for the inability of cartilage to adapt to mechanical stimuli include a lack of evolutionary pressure and a decoupling of mechanical competence and tissue zzso
