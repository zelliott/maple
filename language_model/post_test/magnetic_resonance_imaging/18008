We investigate a zzso zzso model for the analysis of zzso zzso data from sedation measurement for zzso zzso Imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso Data for each patient is observed at different time points within the time up to zzso A model for the sedation level of patients is developed by zzso at the first stage of a zzso model, a zzso model for the response, and then subsequent terms are zzso To estimate the model, we use the Gibbs sampling given some appropriate prior zzso
