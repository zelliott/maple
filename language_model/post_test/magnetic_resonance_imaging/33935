Bone zzso is a common site of zzso in patients with small cell lung zzso zzso and female breast zzso zzso zzso bone zzso involvement is found in approximately 50% of zzso patients and up to zzso of zzso patients at zzso zzso staging procedures detect zzso bone zzso zzso in only zzso of patients with these zzso This study was performed to assess whether zzso can improve the detection rate of bone zzso zzso in tumors with a high zzso of skeletal zzso 

zzso patients with zzso verified zzso zzso with limited stage disease and 27 with extensive stage disease) and 33 women with zzso were entered into a prospective zzso The zzso protocol was comprised of zzso slices in the pelvic region and zzso slices of the whole spine utilizing a zzso spin echo sequence with a field of view of 50 zzso All patients underwent initial routine diagnostic staging procedures including bone zzso unilateral crest zzso and plain film zzso of suspicious skeletal zzso 

Only in two zzso patients, zzso was positive in 25 zzso All zzso patients with bone zzso zzso zzso verified, diagnosed by crest biopsy (six zzso or by bone scan zzso zzso had the correct diagnosis of zzso by zzso In addition zzso revealed zzso bone zzso zzso in 14 zzso In contrast, 28 of 33 zzso patients examined during the initial staging procedure showed no evidence of bone zzso zzso zzso was not superior compared with bone zzso in zzso zzso 

The staging results obtained in zzso and zzso patients are different, although both tumors have a high zzso of bone zzso zzso It may be assumed that the zzso behavior of these tumors is reflected by the initial bone zzso zzso Because of its superiority compared with biopsy and bone zzso the authors believe zzso should become an integral part of the initial staging procedures in patients with zzso When staging patients with zzso zzso should be applied only in clinically indicated zzso
