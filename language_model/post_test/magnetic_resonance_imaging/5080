To monitor zzso changes using zzso zzso zzso in patients with an zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso surgery zzso 

The study comprised 22 patients (17 men and 6 women, mean age 42 years, range zzso zzso with an zzso zzso fed by only the middle cerebral artery zzso or its zzso zzso zzso profiles from zzso zzso were analyzed and correlated with treatment zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso as means zzso standard zzso revealed significantly higher mean blood flow zzso zzso and lower mean zzso index zzso in zzso zzso to zzso than in zzso zzso zzso 102 zzso zzso 29 vs 66 zzso zzso 16, P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No correlation was found between zzso volumes and zzso zzso zzso values in zzso zzso were lower at 6 months zzso zzso zzso 26) after zzso than at baseline zzso zzso zzso At 2 years after zzso a further decrease in mean zzso and an increase in mean zzso were observed in zzso zzso which then zzso the values of zzso zzso zzso 71 zzso zzso 30 vs 61 zzso zzso 11, P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the same time revealed total obliteration of zzso in 11 zzso Changes in zzso and zzso values were found to be correlated with the zzso of zzso However, no correlation was found between baseline zzso zzso and level of zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso measured by zzso was found to be correlated with zzso obliteration after zzso However, significant zzso improvements may develop after zzso before obvious obliteration by zzso zzso
