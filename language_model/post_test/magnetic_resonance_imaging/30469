Although face perception is often characterized as depending on zzso rather than zzso processing, there is behavioral evidence for independent representations of face zzso Recent work has linked zzso regions defined with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to holistic processing, but the response of these areas to face parts remains zzso Here we examine zzso versus holistic processing in zzso visual areas using face stimuli manipulated in zzso disparity to appear either behind or in front of a set of stripes zzso zzso zzso zzso & Silverman, zzso zzso zzso zzso Its relation to image zzso zzso and the recognition of zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso While the first case will be zzso zzso by the visual system and perceived zzso we demonstrate zzso that the latter cannot be completed zzso and thus is perceived as zzso Using these stimuli in zzso we found significant responses to both depth zzso in inferior zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso zzso zzso regions, suggesting that neural populations in these areas zzso both parts and zzso In comparison, applying these depth zzso to control stimuli zzso zzso zzso much smaller signal changes within zzso regions, indicating that the zzso representation for faces is separate from that for zzso The combined adaptation data also showed an interaction of depth and familiarity within the right zzso with greater adaptation in the back zzso condition relative to parts for familiar but not unfamiliar zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso regions of zzso zzso engage in both zzso and holistic zzso The relative recruitment of such representations may be additionally influenced by external factors such as zzso
