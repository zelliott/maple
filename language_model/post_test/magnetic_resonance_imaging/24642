zzso of word production and word recognition generally agree that multiple word candidates are activated during zzso The zzso and zzso effects of these zzso zzso have been studied extensively using behavioral methods and have spurred theoretical development in zzso but relatively little is known about the neural basis of these effects and how zzso may affect zzso This study used zzso zzso overlap zzso to examine semantic and zzso neighbor effects in spoken word production following left zzso zzso Increased zzso effects of near semantic neighbors were associated with inferior frontal lobe zzso suggesting impaired selection among strongly activated zzso related zzso Increased zzso effects of zzso neighbors were associated with zzso superior zzso and inferior zzso lobe zzso In combination with previous studies, these results suggest that such zzso cause zzso feedback to more strongly activate zzso related zzso zzso The comparison of semantic and zzso neighbor effects and how they are affected by left zzso zzso provides new insights into the cognitive dynamics and neural basis of zzso semantic, and cognitive control processes in spoken word zzso
