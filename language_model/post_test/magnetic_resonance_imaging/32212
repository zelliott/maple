The purpose of this study was to calculate the gain in zzso ratio zzso of four human abdominal zzso at zzso zzso zzso compared with standard zzso T and to validate this calculation in zzso 

The expected gain in zzso at zzso T in the liver, zzso zzso and kidney compared with standard zzso T was zzso theoretically for a zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Fifteen healthy male subjects underwent abdominal MR imaging using a zzso T and zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso images and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were acquired using the sequence parameters zzso by the zzso 

Except for zzso imaging of pancreatic zzso in zzso adjusted zzso values of all abdominal zzso were significantly higher at zzso T for all sequences zzso zzso zzso The highest overall gain in zzso was achieved with the zzso sequence ranging from zzso for zzso imaging to zzso for zzso zzso The theoretical calculation of zzso gain was in good agreement with the zzso measured gain in zzso for the zzso and the zzso zzso 

zzso abdominal MR imaging at zzso T offers significantly higher zzso compared with standard zzso T MR zzso
