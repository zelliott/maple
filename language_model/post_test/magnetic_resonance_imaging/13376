This study reports the first in zzso results using an MR contrast agent zzso zzso zzso zzso designed to estimate the functional status of the zzso Thirty New Zealand white rabbits were studied in groups of 5 as zzso zzso 1, control, zzso scans only; zzso 2 zzso before and up to 90 zzso following 50 zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3, rabbits received zzso g zzso and zzso zzso 4, as in zzso 3 but following zzso zzso 5, zzso as in zzso 2 but 18 zzso following 1000 zzso zzso used to induce zzso zzso and zzso 6, rabbits received zzso and zzso In this study significant zzso and zzso zzso damage was indicated by the increased zzso serum levels in the zzso The use of zzso allowed detection of early zzso necrosis in these animals whereas conventional zzso zzso did zzso The fact that zzso zzso with and without zzso were not significantly different indicated virtually no membrane transport or metabolism of zzso in the zzso Ethanol zzso were not normal, but there was still considerable residual zzso zzso zzso appears to be an attractive agent in assessing zzso zzso
