The purpose of this study was to compare zzso zzso zzso zzso and the reference standard, bone zzso aspiration and zzso to determine the best imaging technique for assessment of disease activity in multiple zzso 

zzso patients (13 women, 11 zzso mean age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso with bone zzso zzso multiple myeloma were included in the zzso All patients underwent zzso and zzso zzso within 10 days of each zzso Eight patients underwent more than one follow-up zzso and zzso zzso examination, for a total of 34 pairs of zzso zzso was defined as zzso with a maximum standardized zzso value greater than zzso at PET and as evidence of zzso packing at zzso zzso PET and zzso zzso results were correlated with findings at bone zzso aspiration zzso 

PET had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso positive zzso value of zzso and negative zzso value of 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso positive zzso value of zzso and negative zzso value of 59% zzso zzso zzso In zzso of cases, PET and zzso zzso findings were zzso When PET and zzso zzso findings were zzso and positive, no zzso results were found, yielding a specificity and a positive zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso performed better than PET in the assessment of disease activity, having a higher sensitivity and zzso The positive zzso value of zzso zzso in the assessment of active disease was high at zzso When used in combination and with zzso findings, PET and zzso zzso were found to have a specificity and positive zzso value of zzso which may be of value to clinicians assessing the effectiveness of aggressive and expensive treatment zzso
