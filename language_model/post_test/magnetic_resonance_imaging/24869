zzso changes of the facet zzso including zzso zzso facet joint zzso and facet joint zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso have been associated with zzso degenerative zzso The cervical zzso have not been examined for associations with cervical degenerative zzso similar to those seen in the zzso zzso 

To define abnormalities of the facet zzso seen on zzso zzso that correlate with cervical zzso seen on upright zzso 

zzso zzso review of consecutive patients with a universally applied zzso 

A total of 204 consecutive patients from a single institution, with both an zzso and upright zzso were zzso 

zzso plane displacement on upright lateral zzso was compared with zzso The total area of the facet joint and the amount of facet joint asymmetry were measured on an zzso zzso 

The data were analyzed to determine a significant association between the cervical degenerative zzso and the zzso facet joint zzso increased total area of the facet joint, and zzso 

zzso zzso was seen in 26 patients at zzso and in 27 patients at zzso zzso zzso identified significantly more degenerative zzso than zzso at levels zzso and zzso 26 versus 6 zzso at zzso and 27 versus 11 zzso at zzso Patients with degenerative zzso were more likely to be older, have a larger total facet area, and more facet asymmetry at zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso underestimate zzso displacement compared with upright lateral zzso zzso facet zzso at zzso and zzso is associated with degenerative zzso on upright lateral films even in the absence of zzso on zzso zzso
