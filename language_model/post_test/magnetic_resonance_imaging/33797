The association between brain zzso and permanent functional deficits in multiple sclerosis and the zzso relation between zzso and the clinical disease course have seldom been zzso This study aims to determine the amount of zzso and zzso zzso in patients by comparison with healthy controls, to establish the relation between zzso and zzso and to derive the rates of volume loss in individual patients from their estimated disease zzso 

Three zzso acquired zzso was performed on 20 zzso and 20 secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients and 10 control zzso Volume data on zzso and zzso structures were obtained using the zzso method of modern design zzso in combination with point zzso Corpus zzso zzso area and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso reduced zzso and cerebral white matter volumes and corpus zzso zzso areas occurred in all patients compared with controls zzso Mean estimates of volume loss in the cohort were zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the brain zzso zzso upper cervical zzso and white matter, respectively, and zzso for the corpus zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the amount of zzso zzso differences between patients and zzso showed that upper cervical zzso and cerebral white matter zzso correlated with the expanded disability status scale zzso and zzso zzso and the Scripps zzso rating scale scores zzso and zzso zzso There was no relation between estimated volume loss in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso enlargement and corpus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rates correlated with baseline zzso rates zzso to zzso zzso and were higher in zzso than secondary progressive patients zzso 

zzso cerebral and spinal zzso volume reductions occurred in both patient zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso were found with estimated volume loss in the upper cervical zzso and cerebral white zzso Particularly for zzso structures, estimated rates of zzso were higher in zzso than secondary progressive patients, suggesting that zzso perhaps mainly due to tract zzso begins early in multiple sclerosis and may relate predominantly to acute inflammatory events, with or without other gradual zzso processes later in the disease zzso
