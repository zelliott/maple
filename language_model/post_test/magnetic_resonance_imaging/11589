zzso zzso detection methods, such as zzso could be difficult to apply in zzso functional zzso data because accurate a zzso knowledge about the zzso signal patterns is often not zzso As a result, several categories of zzso data analysis techniques have been introduced in the zzso zzso One previously described zzso zzso detection technique is based on the feature that activated zzso yield zzso time course patterns as the subject zzso the same simulation in repeated zzso In this paper, spatial information is incorporated as a second feature and a combined zzso measure is zzso The resulting method is shown to offer measurable improvement in detecting zzso regions in simulated data in a highly zzso efficient zzso Its practical utility is demonstrated with an experimental data set obtained with a visually guided motor zzso
