The goal of the study was to demonstrate a zzso structure of resting state activity in the healthy brain using a zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was applied to resting state zzso data in cortical and zzso gray matter from two groups acquired zzso one of 17 healthy individuals and the second of 21 healthy zzso Different numbers of clusters and different starting conditions were zzso A cluster zzso measure determined the optimal numbers of zzso An inner product metric provided a measure of similarity between different zzso The two cluster result found the zzso and zzso zzso The cluster zzso measure was minimized with seven and zzso zzso Each of the clusters in the seven and zzso cluster result was associated with either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso to find seven clusters recovered previously described resting state networks, including the default mode network, zzso control network, zzso and zzso attention networks, zzso zzso and language zzso The language and zzso attention networks had significant zzso zzso This zzso was consistently found in a large majority of zzso runs under different conditions and was robust to different methods of zzso 

The zzso of resting state activity using different optimal numbers of clusters identified resting state networks comparable to previously obtained zzso This work reinforces the observation that resting state networks are zzso zzso
