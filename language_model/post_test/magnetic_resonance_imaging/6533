zzso activity in the brain is accompanied by changes in cerebral blood flow zzso and blood zzso that are zzso with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso In this paper, recent mathematical models of this zzso response are reviewed and zzso Models are described for: zzso the blood zzso level dependent zzso signal as a function of changes in cerebral oxygen extraction fraction zzso and cerebral blood volume zzso zzso the balloon model, proposed to describe the transient dynamics of zzso and zzso zzso and how they affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relating the responses in zzso and cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso to the neural activity zzso and zzso a simple model for the zzso zzso of the neural response zzso These models are integrated into a mathematical framework describing the steps linking a stimulus to the measured zzso and zzso zzso Experimental results examining transient features of the zzso response zzso zzso and initial zzso zzso of the zzso response, and the role of the zzso baseline state in altering the zzso signal are discussed in the context of the proposed zzso zzso modeling of the zzso response, when combined with experimental data measuring both the zzso and zzso responses, makes possible a more specific and quantitative assessment of brain physiology than is possible with standard zzso imaging zzso This approach has the potential to enhance numerous studies of brain function in development, health, and zzso
