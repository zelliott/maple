Whether an zzso zzso is detected with MR imaging depends on the quality of the images and the expertise of the zzso We analyzed the role of zzso MR imaging in the zzso evaluation of patients with drug-resistant zzso at one zzso 

In a zzso prospective study, 385 patients with drug-resistant zzso underwent standardized MR imaging at zzso zzso We analyzed whether zzso were zzso whether they were precisely characterized by MR imaging, and whether zzso characterization allowed us to estimate seizure zzso 

zzso were found on MR images in zzso patients zzso Following zzso zzso 209 zzso underwent surgery, and 109 zzso did zzso Freedom from zzso was achieved in 130 zzso of 186 zzso Nine zzso of 66 patients without an MR imaging zzso underwent zzso zzso findings were zzso in seven patients, and five zzso achieved freedom from zzso zzso sclerosis was the most common zzso zzso and correctly characterized in 101 zzso of 104 zzso zzso tumors zzso were sometimes imprecisely zzso Four zzso zzso were mistaken for focal cortical zzso Outcomes were not different between zzso zzso However, there were trends toward a favorable outcome for focal cortical zzso with balloon cells and an zzso outcome for zzso zzso 

MR imaging detection of zzso influences further zzso zzso though zzso characterization does not allow us to predict seizure zzso If MR imaging fails to depict a zzso and patients undergo surgery because of zzso findings, zzso findings are often zzso
