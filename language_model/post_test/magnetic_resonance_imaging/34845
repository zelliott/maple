zzso zzso of the breast has been one of the most controversial areas of zzso Even though most investigators have, in selected zzso been able to improve accuracy by the additional use of zzso zzso its abuse has been feared not only because of increased costs for imaging, but also because of increased biopsy rates caused by false positive calls and because of errors caused by insufficient zzso In this article an overview is given of the present knowledge about zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that influence the accuracy and zzso of zzso zzso are zzso 

zzso that influence accuracy include: zzso technical factors that influence zzso zzso slice thickness zzso volume zzso motion reduction, reduction of zzso artifacts, dosage of contrast agent, choice of pulse sequence and zzso and choice of the method for elimination of fat zzso zzso zzso factors zzso of the examination with reference to the zzso cycle, hormonal replacement zzso They influence accuracy and must be taken into zzso zzso zzso zzso choice influences sensitivity and specificity mostly zzso and the use of information from conventional imaging appears zzso zzso Patient selection influences accuracy for statistical and for biological zzso 

Based on the present literature and on the experiences gathered in six German universities zzso zzso zzso an excellent sensitivity zzso zzso can be achieved for the combination of zzso and zzso However, specificity strongly varies with the zzso zzso indications include examination of breasts with impaired evaluation due to severe zzso after silicon implants and in the dense breast, exclusion of zzso and search for primary zzso zzso under investigation include high risk patients and strictly selected problem zzso 

If appropriately applied and used for selected zzso zzso zzso may allow a significant diagnostic zzso In order to take advantage of the full zzso of zzso zzso the development of commercially available biopsy coils is zzso
