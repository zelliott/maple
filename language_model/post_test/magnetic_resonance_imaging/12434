zzso zzso is a crucial complication of deep brain stimulation zzso zzso The bleeding caused by mechanical tissue injury due to zzso and/or zzso zzso lead zzso has been well zzso However, zzso caused by a zzso underlying disease such as vascular zzso has not been examined zzso 

We encountered a case of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging did not show any zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso images taken immediately after the surgery did not show any zzso zzso and other abnormal zzso However, the patient did not recover from the general zzso and zzso in the left zzso lobe was detected by CT performed a day after the zzso The location of the zzso was markedly distant from the trajectory of zzso zzso Evacuation of the zzso under general zzso was immediately zzso 

As an zzso finding, we noted the presence of abnormal vessels inside the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso specimens including the abnormal vessels were obtained for zzso analysis, results of which led to the diagnosis was zzso 

Despite its low zzso we would like to advise that such a type of zzso could occur and measures should be taken to prevent its occurrence as much as zzso zzso detection of abnormal vessels by MR zzso and/or CT zzso might be zzso Moreover, paying close attention to the possible leakage of zzso fluid during surgery might be zzso
