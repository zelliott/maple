Investigation of zzso 

This study presents a novel method of accurately determining relative bone position in zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso modeling of the human body requires measurement of the relative positions of skeletal zzso Spinal orientation is particularly difficult to measure due to small joint movements, relative zzso of the bones to direct zzso and joint zzso 

A process incorporating both zzso and conventional zzso was used to measure the skeletal positions of the zzso spine and zzso The method uses higher quality conventional zzso to determine bone zzso and then registers these with lower resolution, zzso zzso images of various postures to determine the relative locations of the zzso zzso lateral zzso and zzso twist zzso were measured for each zzso 

The results indicate good zzso zzso with a maximum zzso difference for all zzso registrations of less than 1 degrees and a maximum zzso difference of less than 3 zzso While there did not appear to be significant patterns between the 2 zzso there were trends within each zzso as well as identifiable zzso zzso 

Although processing times are currently lengthy, the data collected are zzso and represent the anatomy and movement of a specific zzso
