The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the reduction in plasma volume zzso induced by resistance exercise reflects fluid loss to the zzso space and subsequently selective increase in zzso area zzso of active but not inactive skeletal zzso We compared changes in active and inactive muscle zzso and zzso after zzso squat zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to zzso muscle involvement in exercise and to determine zzso of muscle groups or individual muscles zzso zzso zzso zzso hamstring zzso and zzso zzso zzso Muscle involvement in exercise was determined using zzso contrast shift in zzso relaxation time zzso MR images immediately zzso zzso in muscle size were based on the mean zzso of individual zzso zzso zzso and Evans blue dye were used to estimate changes in zzso Muscle zzso and zzso data were obtained zzso and immediately zzso and 15 and 45 zzso zzso A hierarchy of muscle involvement in exercise was found such that VS zzso Add zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso showing essentially no zzso zzso of the VS and Add muscle groups were increased 10 and zzso respectively, immediately after exercise in each thigh with no changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso was decreased zzso immediately following zzso The absolute loss of zzso was correlated zzso zzso zzso with absolute increase in muscle zzso immediately zzso supporting the notion that increased muscle size after resistance exercise reflects primarily fluid movement from the vascular space into active but not inactive zzso
