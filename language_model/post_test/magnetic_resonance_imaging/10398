zzso zzso language mapping has become an established procedure in patients operated on for zzso in the area of the language zzso zzso zzso surgery has specific risks and patients are exposed to an increased physical and mental zzso The aim of the study was to establish an zzso that enables tailoring the zzso and zzso techniques to the individual zzso 

A total of 25 patients underwent awake zzso for zzso language mapping between 1999 and zzso Following zzso under analgesia and sedation without rigid pin fixation of the head, cortical language mapping was performed in the fully zzso zzso The results of functional magnetic resonance imaging and of cortical language mapping were incorporated into the zzso zzso for zzso Depending on the functional data and the individual operative risk zzso zzso then proceeded either under conscious sedation with the option of zzso language monitoring or under general zzso 

After cortical language mapping patients are assigned to one of four groups: zzso zzso awake zzso zzso zzso zzso I (9 zzso adequate functional zzso risk not zzso zzso in the awake zzso zzso II (4 zzso limited functional zzso risk not zzso zzso in the awake patient with the option of language monitoring as zzso zzso III (9 zzso adequate functional zzso operative zzso zzso under general zzso using functional zzso zzso IV (3 zzso limited functional zzso operative zzso zzso in the awake patient with the option of language monitoring as zzso We observed less adverse events in group zzso zzso No permanent deterioration of language function occurred in this zzso 

The zzso protocol for awake zzso provides for zzso zzso under general zzso in selected patients using functional zzso Our experience with the zzso suggests that it is a useful tool for preserving function in patients undergoing surgery of the language zzso while reducing the operative risk on an individual zzso
