zzso restriction zzso reduces bone quantity but not bone quality in zzso Nothing is known regarding the long-term effects of zzso with adequate intake of vitamin and minerals on bone quantity and quality in middle-aged lean zzso In this study, we evaluated body zzso bone mineral density zzso and serum markers of bone turnover and inflammation in 32 volunteers who had been eating a zzso diet zzso zzso less calories than zzso for an average of zzso zzso zzso years zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso and 32 zzso and zzso sedentary controls eating Western diets zzso In a zzso of 10 zzso and 10 zzso volunteers, we also measured zzso bone zzso zzso of the zzso radius using high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso We found that the zzso volunteers had significantly lower body mass index than the zzso volunteers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ; P zzso zzso zzso of the zzso spine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso , P zzso zzso and hip zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso , P zzso zzso was also lower in the zzso than in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alkaline zzso concentration were similar between groups, while serum zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , P zzso zzso was lower in the zzso zzso zzso bone zzso parameters such as the erosion index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were not significantly different between zzso These findings suggest that markedly reduced zzso is not associated with significantly reduced bone quality in middle-aged men and women practicing long-term calorie restriction with adequate zzso
