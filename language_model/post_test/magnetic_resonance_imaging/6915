Information processing in the zzso brain is based on the complementary principles of modular and distributed information zzso The former emphasizes the specialization of functions within different brain zzso The latter emphasizes the zzso parallel nature of brain networks and the fact that function also emerges from the flow of information between brain zzso The zzso of function to specific brain areas zzso zzso is the zzso approach to investigating zzso however, an emerging, complementary approach zzso zzso describes function in terms of the information flow across networks of zzso Here, we highlight recent advances in zzso methodology that have made it possible to investigate the anatomical architecture of networks in the living human brain with diffusion zzso imaging zzso We also highlight recent thinking on the ways in which functional imaging can be used to characterize information transmission across networks in the human brain zzso and effective zzso
