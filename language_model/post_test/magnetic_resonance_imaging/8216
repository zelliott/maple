zzso and clinical studies show a clear association of diabetes zzso with zzso heart failure and cardiovascular events independent of blood pressure and zzso heart zzso The definition of zzso zzso as a clinical entity, however, relies on distinct zzso and zzso zzso found in the zzso of patients with zzso The zzso findings comprise zzso zzso zzso of zzso basement zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso on the zzso zzso For clinical routine, early detection of diabetic zzso seems crucial for identification of patients at cardiovascular risk since the prevalence of heart failure in individuals with diabetes is markedly zzso Recent technical developments in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso as well as nuclear zzso have advanced the diagnostic applications for the detection of diabetic heart zzso This review aims to present distinct aspects of diabetic zzso that were identified using zzso invasive imaging zzso Due to the wide availability and the low costs of zzso it is the most frequently used imaging technique to detect left zzso dysfunction in patients with zzso zzso on the other hand can provide assessment of zzso structure with higher spatial resolution and allows objective assessment of left zzso zzso This makes zzso an attractive alternative for the detection of discrete zzso particularly in patients with poor zzso zzso Finally, nuclear zzso can provide information on cardiac zzso integrity and accurately detect defects in zzso control, which are considered a major cardiovascular risk factor in patients with zzso
