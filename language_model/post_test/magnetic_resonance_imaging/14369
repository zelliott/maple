zzso MR images were compared with zzso MR images and correlated with zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso for zzso h following a unilateral middle cerebral and bilateral carotid artery zzso in eight zzso zzso images using strong zzso strengths zzso values of zzso zzso displayed a significant relative zzso in zzso regions as early as 45 zzso after onset of zzso whereas zzso zzso images failed to clearly demonstrate brain injury up to 2-3 h zzso Signal intensity ratios zzso of zzso to normal zzso were greater in the zzso images at all times than in either TE 80 or TE 160 zzso zzso MR zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not correlate for the first 1-2 h zzso Good correlation was found between zzso zzso and zzso disturbances of energy metabolism as detected by zzso and zzso MR zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso may be zzso due to rapid zzso of zzso water in the zzso space zzso zzso resulting from the breakdown of the zzso pump and/or to microscopic brain zzso
