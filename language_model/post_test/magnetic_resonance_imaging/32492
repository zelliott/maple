The aim of this study was to describe the anatomy correlated to the normal magnetic resonance imaging zzso images of the zzso thigh region and the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso sequences were obtained from 20 zzso volunteers (10 male and 10 zzso aged 20 to 38 years zzso age: 28 zzso and then they were compared with 2 anatomical zzso and 7 zzso of 6 zzso zzso 

The anatomical specimens were directly correlated with zzso zzso From the comparison it could be seen how the zzso zzso sequences well outlined the zzso zzso usually observed oval in shape with moderate signal intensity, and thus easily zzso from other surrounding zzso Other structures were also identified by zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso origin of the hamstring muscles arising from the zzso and the related zzso the zzso zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso a triangular zzso body and zzso zzso scans also showed well the hamstring muscles, both in length and zzso 

Both zzso images and zzso zzso showed the zzso zzso as an interesting intersection area that could be zzso as zzso on the zzso border the zzso zzso and its zzso on the zzso side the hamstring muscle origin, and on the zzso side the zzso zzso muscle with its zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These anatomical and zzso descriptions are very useful to give a contribution to the right explanation of zzso symptoms caused by those sports specifically overloading the hamstring zzso zzso in fact, in these athletes a zzso syndrome arise drawing the zzso attention to the zzso joint or to the zzso nerve course near the zzso zzso Another very important site where the zzso symptoms can rise, indeed, could also be found in the hamstring muscle region, where the nerve run under the zzso zzso beside the zzso zzso Athletes who manifest notorious muscle overload in this anatomical region usually show zzso pain symptoms that are not to be related with zzso of the zzso junction nor to relationships of the zzso nerve with the zzso muscle but rather to relationships that this nerve acquires with either zzso muscles as well as with muscles of the underneath zzso zzso
