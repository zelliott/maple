We sought to confirm earlier findings in the literature that zzso zzso of the zzso nerve might cause unilateral zzso hearing zzso We measured the length and zzso of the internal auditory canal zzso to investigate a possible association between a narrow zzso the presence of an anterior inferior zzso artery zzso loop, and the development of a zzso zzso zzso 

We performed a prospective blinded analysis of 167 magnetic resonance imaging scans of the zzso zzso The presence of an zzso loop was zzso We analyzed these 167 patients for unilateral zzso hearing loss, which was defined as an zzso difference of 20 zzso at 1 frequency or 10 zzso at 2 or more zzso Furthermore, the zzso and length of the zzso on magnetic resonance imaging were zzso 

An zzso loop was identified in zzso of the 167 zzso There were 196 type I zzso 106 type II zzso and 14 type III zzso zzso patients had unexplained unilateral hearing zzso There was no association between type II and III vascular zzso the zzso of the zzso and unilateral hearing loss zzso zzso zzso 

In this study we found no association between the depth of extension of the zzso loop into the zzso and the presence of unilateral hearing zzso
