The structure and function of the superior zzso zzso zzso a structure involved in receptive and zzso auditory and language processing, is zzso in zzso stress disorder zzso zzso potential abnormalities were previously reported in zzso implicating the existence of dysfunction in the primary auditory zzso and adjacent anterior auditory zzso of the zzso in adult zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso analysis of the superior zzso zzso were performed in 43 zzso children and adolescents with zzso and 61 zzso healthy control zzso 

zzso zzso gray matter volumes were larger in zzso subjects with zzso than in control subjects, whereas zzso white matter volumes were smaller in zzso subjects with zzso than in control zzso After adjusting for differences in cerebral volume, right, left, and total superior zzso zzso volumes were relatively larger in zzso subjects compared with control zzso After zzso for differences in cerebral gray matter volumes, zzso analysis showed that zzso subjects had significantly greater zzso gray matter volumes in most, and in particularly zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, findings of significant zzso interactions for zzso and zzso gray but not white matter zzso volumes suggest that there is a more pronounced right zzso left asymmetry in total and zzso zzso volumes but a loss of the left zzso right asymmetry seen in total, zzso and zzso zzso gray matter volumes in zzso subjects compared with control zzso 

These zzso findings may suggest zzso zzso in zzso pediatric zzso
