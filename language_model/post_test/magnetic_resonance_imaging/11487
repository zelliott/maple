zzso syndrome appears in more then 100 diseases, therefore subject of intensive zzso Insufficient research has been done on zzso syndrome in patients on chronic program of zzso The aim of this study is to search anatomical and structural changes on blood vessels of the brain by zzso techniques, as well as increased circulatory resistance on zzso in patients on chronic program of zzso 

The research has been done on 30 patients with zzso syndrome, 22 males and 8 zzso average age zzso years, average duration of zzso zzso zzso zzso In all patients relevant diagnostic procedures had been done zzso zzso audio zzso X-ray of cervical zzso and in 14 patients with increased circulatory resistance zzso we have done zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been found in zzso zzso of the patients have had normal zzso finding, while 50% had slowing zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso had been done in 14 patients of average age zzso zzso zzso In 13 patients we had a pathological finding of zzso and zzso while in one patient only we had normal finding of zzso and another one patient with normal zzso zzso In zzso of the sample we have had cortical cerebral zzso in zzso cortical zzso of zzso while in zzso apart from the mentioned changes zzso of zzso zzso had been zzso In zzso of all patients cerebrovascular disease zzso could be zzso zzso changes in blood vessels of anterior or zzso circulatory segment were found in zzso of the patients, while zzso of arteries had been registered in zzso of the zzso 

zzso and zzso of the brain brought light on zzso aspect of vertigo in these zzso zzso of our research indicate vascular zzso of zzso syndrome in patients on chronic program of zzso
