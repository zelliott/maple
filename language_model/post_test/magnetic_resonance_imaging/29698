Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies with human subjects have explored the neural zzso involved in forming associations in zzso fear zzso Most of these studies used delay procedures, in which the zzso stimulus zzso and zzso stimulus zzso zzso Less is known about brain regions that support trace zzso a procedure in which an zzso of time zzso zzso zzso between zzso termination and zzso zzso Previous work suggests significant overlap in the neural zzso supporting delay and trace fear zzso although trace conditioning requires recruitment of additional brain zzso In the present zzso zzso study, skin zzso and continuous measures of zzso expectancy were recorded zzso with zzso blood zzso zzso zzso imaging during direct comparison of delay and trace discrimination zzso zzso zzso was observed within the visual zzso for all zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity reflected zzso learning common to both delay and trace zzso zzso within the supplementary motor area zzso frontal zzso middle frontal zzso and inferior zzso zzso were specifically associated with trace zzso zzso The zzso displayed zzso signal increases early in training during all zzso however, differences were observed in zzso response magnitude related to the accuracy of predicting zzso zzso These results demonstrate overlapping patterns of zzso within the anterior cingulate, zzso thalamus, and visual zzso during delay and trace procedures, with additional recruitment of the zzso zzso frontal zzso middle frontal zzso and inferior zzso zzso during trace zzso These data suggest that the zzso codes zzso information during trace zzso whereas brain regions supporting working memory processes maintain the zzso representation during the trace zzso
