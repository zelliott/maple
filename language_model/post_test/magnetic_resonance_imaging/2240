Dynamic studies of zzso contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging zzso are increasingly being used for tumor characterization as well as therapy response zzso Because detailed knowledge regarding the zzso properties, which in turn are responsible for differences in contrast enhancement, remains fairly zzso it was the aim of this project to: zzso examine the relationship between zzso dynamic zzso characteristics and zzso zzso density counts, a recognized surrogate of tumor zzso from primary or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso correlate these parameters with zzso involvement to characterize tumor aggressiveness in terms of zzso zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso exchange rate constant, zzso were calculated from a zzso dynamic zzso series in 55 patients zzso zzso years; mean, 50 zzso with zzso primary zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cervical zzso Both zzso parameters were correlated to zzso determined zzso density counts zzso zzso zzso and other pathological tumor characteristics obtained from the operative specimens after radical zzso In addition, the magnetic resonance and zzso data were correlated to the presence or absence of zzso system zzso zzso zzso parameters (A and zzso increased with increasing zzso zzso density counts with r zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso involvement was more zzso assessed by the zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso density, resulting in a higher sensitivity, overall zzso and comparable zzso zzso zzso parameters might prove to be zzso for zzso of tumor zzso in zzso cervical zzso thus, zzso may become an additional tool to characterize zzso progression in terms of zzso involvement in zzso cervical zzso
