zzso development during human childhood and adolescence involves highly coordinated and zzso events, characterized by both progressive and zzso zzso Despite a multitude of results demonstrating the zzso development of gray matter, white matter, and total brain volume, a reference curve allowing prediction of structural brain maturation is still lacking but would be clinically zzso For the first time, the present study provides a validated reference curve for structural brain maturation during childhood and adolescence, based on structural zzso zzso 

By employing kernel zzso methods, a novel but zzso zzso framework uses the complex zzso maturation pattern across the whole brain to estimate an zzso brain zzso The zzso framework was applied to a large human sample zzso of healthy children and zzso whose image data had been acquired during the zzso zzso study of normal brain zzso Using this approach, we were able to predict individual brain maturation with a clinically meaningful zzso the correlation between predicted brain age and zzso age resulted in zzso The mean absolute error was only zzso zzso Moreover, the predicted brain age reliably differentiated between all age groups zzso preschool childhood, late childhood, early adolescence, middle adolescence, late zzso zzso the framework to zzso adolescents resulted in a significantly lower estimated brain age than zzso age in subjects who were born before the end of the 27th week of zzso demonstrating the successful clinical application and future potential of this zzso 

zzso in the future this novel zzso approach may prove clinically valuable in detecting both normal and abnormal brain zzso providing important zzso zzso
