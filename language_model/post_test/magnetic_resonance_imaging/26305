The aim of this study was to assess whether magnetic resonance imaging could predict the outcome of attempted zzso delivery in a group of pregnant women whose zzso had to be induced by zzso The signal intensity and zzso zzso in the zzso of 21 zzso pregnant women were analyzed before the induction of zzso zzso zzso echo sequences were zzso and signal intensity in the zzso was measured from the anterior and zzso lips of the zzso An index indicating the brightness range of the zzso was formulated to overcome the effects of the individual intensity zzso Imaging features including the signal intensity and the evidence of zzso were correlated with the actual type of delivery zzso Images were also assessed visually by two independent zzso zzso analysis of brightness indexes that were considered to have a zzso value as an indicator for possible delivery was not zzso However, visually assessed signal intensity of the zzso correlated strongly with the type of zzso zzso itself was the most reliable zzso in predicting the progress of the zzso In conclusion, MR imaging seems to be useful for predicting normal zzso in zzso pregnant women who need zzso zzso However, the presence of zzso seems to be a more reliable and practical zzso that will be preferred in that zzso
