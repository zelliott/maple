The spectrum approach was used to examine contributions of zzso symptom dimensions of substance abuse and eating disorder to abnormal zzso and zzso activity to happy and fear faces previously demonstrated in bipolar disorder zzso 

Fourteen zzso zzso I and zzso healthy individuals viewed neutral, mild and intense happy and fear faces in two zzso zzso zzso All individuals completed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses for bilateral prefrontal and zzso regions were zzso 

BD individuals scored significantly higher on these spectrum measures than healthy individuals zzso and were distinguished by activity in prefrontal and zzso zzso BD relative to healthy individuals showed reduced zzso zzso activity to all zzso Only BD individuals showed greater zzso activity to happy and neutral zzso In BD individuals, negative correlations were shown between substance use severity and right zzso activity to intense happy faces zzso and between substance use severity and right zzso nucleus activity to neutral faces zzso Positive correlations were shown between eating disorder and right zzso zzso activity to intense happy zzso and neutral faces zzso zzso analyses revealed few significant relationships between illness variables and medication upon neural activity in BD zzso 

Small sample size of predominantly zzso BD zzso 

This study is the first to report relationships between zzso symptom dimensions of substance abuse and eating disorder and zzso and zzso activity to facial expressions in zzso Our findings suggest that these zzso features may contribute to observed patterns of functional abnormalities in neural systems underlying mood regulation in zzso
