To study the outcome after zzso zzso in a homogeneous adult patient population with zzso zzso zzso 

Fourteen adult patients submitted to zzso were zzso Patients had to be at least 18 years old, and have zzso zzso clearly focal zzso zzso and unilateral zzso consistent with early middle cerebral artery zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso All patients were submitted to functional zzso We analyzed age of seizure zzso age by the time of surgery, zzso seizure type and frequency, zzso and zzso zzso zzso findings, zzso and zzso scores zzso seizure frequency, drug regimen, and zzso outcome were studied zzso 

Mean follow-up was 64 zzso All patients had frequent daily zzso zzso All patients had unilateral simple partial motor zzso zzso 11 patients had zzso generalized zzso zzso zzso and five patients had complex partial zzso zzso zzso All patients had zzso and zzso Twelve patients had unilateral zzso findings, and in two zzso zzso were seen exclusively over the apparently normal zzso Twelve patients were zzso after surgery and two patients had at least zzso improvement in seizure zzso zzso and zzso mean general zzso was 84 and 88, zzso Five of the twelve Engel I patients were receiving no drugs at last zzso There was no mortality or major zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso adult patients might also get good results after zzso Although good results were obtained in our adult series, the same procedure yielded a much more striking result if performed earlier in zzso
