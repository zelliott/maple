zzso zzso zzso provides a zzso tool for modulating neural activity in the human zzso In healthy participants, zzso applied over the zzso areas in the left hemisphere, including the left zzso zzso area of zzso zzso and inferior frontal area of zzso have been shown to affect performance on word recognition zzso To investigate the neural zzso of these behavioral effects, zzso zzso was combined with zzso acquired during the performance of a word recognition zzso Twenty right-handed healthy men underwent zzso scans before and after a session of zzso zzso applied outside the magnetic resonance zzso zzso magnetic resonance images were acquired during the performance of a word recognition task that used English or foreign-language zzso zzso was applied over the zzso in one group of 10 participants zzso group), whereas the zzso region in the right zzso was zzso in another group of 10 participants zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso response zzso minus foreign zzso and task performances zzso time and zzso were measured in both groups and compared between zzso and zzso Our results showed that zzso increased zzso zzso response in the zzso areas zzso to the zzso zzso We also found an effect of zzso on response time for the zzso group zzso These findings provide insights into changes in neural activity in cortical regions connected to the zzso site and are consistent with a hypothesis raised in a previous review about the role of the zzso areas in the zzso zzso for preserving behavior after neural zzso
