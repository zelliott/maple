The zzso place zzso zzso responds more strongly in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to scenes than to faces, objects, or other visual zzso We used an zzso zzso adaptation paradigm to test whether the zzso represents scenes in a zzso or zzso zzso The zzso responded just as strongly to viewpoint changes that preserved intrinsic scene geometry as it did to complete scene changes, but less strongly to object changes within the zzso In contrast, lateral zzso zzso responded more strongly to object changes than to spatial zzso These results demonstrate that scene processing in the zzso is viewpoint specific and suggest that the zzso represents the relationship between the observer and the surfaces that define local zzso
