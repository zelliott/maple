zzso drainage into the cortical veins results in poor outcome in patients with an zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso features of zzso zzso zzso remain zzso This study aimed to clarify zzso and zzso conditions in these patients using zzso zzso zzso 

This study included eight patients with an zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients had cortical zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso Regional cerebral blood flow zzso regional cerebral blood volume zzso regional cerebral zzso rate for zzso and regional oxygen extraction fraction zzso were measured before and after surgical or zzso treatment using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that all patients had abnormal zzso and zzso parameters in the area that was drained by the involved cortical zzso A severe increase in zzso was noted in seven of the eight zzso A significant decrease in zzso also was observed in all eight zzso A negative correlation was observed between zzso and zzso Three patients had an elevated zzso zzso metabolism was impaired in seven zzso All patients underwent successful zzso zzso studies demonstrated significant improvements in zzso zzso and regional cerebral zzso rate for zzso The improvement in regional cerebral zzso rate for oxygen varied among the zzso zzso of zzso also was confirmed in three patients who had increased zzso before the zzso 

The present results suggest that zzso and zzso characteristics vary widely among patients with cortical zzso zzso It is essential to precisely evaluate zzso and zzso conditions to predict their outcomes and therapeutic zzso
