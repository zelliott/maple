zzso autobiographical memory zzso consists of personal events embedded within a specific zzso zzso Patients with semantic zzso zzso generally show preserved recent zzso but a controversy remains concerning their ability to retrieve remote zzso Only one zzso study examined remote autobiographical memory in zzso through a zzso case study zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso Here, we propose a zzso study to test the zzso zzso hypothesis, through a zzso approach zzso matter volume, zzso connectivity zzso directly comparing recent and remote autobiographical memory retrieval and collecting data to zzso zzso zzso zzso retrieval recruits a distributed network of brain regions, notably the zzso which is shown to be zzso in zzso although some studies report no zzso zzso in zzso Using zzso we examined recent and remote zzso retrieval in two zzso patients with different profiles of zzso zzso compared to 12 healthy elders zzso zzso presented severe bilateral zzso zzso while zzso showed sparing of both zzso zzso zzso was impaired at retrieving zzso from both life periods and showed poorer use of visual mental imagery than zzso while zzso retrieved memories which were as episodic as those of HE for both periods and relied on greater use of visual mental imagery than zzso zzso results showed that, for zzso zzso of the residual zzso tissue and of zzso lateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not efficiently compensate his autobiographical memory zzso zzso however presented zzso in similar zzso regions which appeared to be more efficient in zzso for zzso elsewhere, since zzso zzso retrieval was zzso zzso connectivity analyses focusing on the zzso showed how the residual zzso activity was connected to other brain zzso For zzso recent autobiographical retrieval was associated with connectivity between the zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso while for zzso connectivity was detected between the anterior zzso and numerous regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for both recent and remote zzso These findings suggest that zzso of zzso zzso in zzso strongly affects both recent and remote autobiographical zzso zzso of zzso regions and functional zzso connectivity within the autobiographical network may be insufficient to compensate the lifelong episodic memory deficit for patients with extensive zzso zzso
