zzso of hind foot bone motion is important for understanding gait as well as various foot zzso but the three-dimensional zzso motion of these bones remains incompletely zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso the motion of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in normal adult feet during open chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance images of the right feet of six normal young adult males were taken from which zzso virtual models were made of each hind foot zzso The zzso motion of these models was zzso Each hind foot bone rotated in the same plane about half as much as the foot zzso zzso degrees of bone rotation per degree of foot motion, range zzso degrees per degree of foot motion as measured relative to the fixed zzso zzso motion was primarily zzso but the zzso zzso and zzso bones exhibited zzso (sometimes zzso translation in addition to zzso zzso Net zzso motions of these bones averaged zzso zzso of bone translation per degree of foot motion zzso zzso zzso per degree of foot zzso These data reflect the functional anatomy of the foot, extend the findings of prior studies, provide a standard for comparison to patients with zzso or acquired foot zzso and establish an objective reference for zzso assessing the efficacy of various hind foot zzso
