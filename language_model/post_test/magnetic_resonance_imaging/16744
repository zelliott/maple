To review the current knowledge on magnetic resonance imaging zzso safety of the Vibrant zzso zzso system, an zzso active middle ear zzso 

National Library of Medicine's online database and clinical zzso 

All available articles from 1995 to 2010 on zzso zzso of the zzso and other active middle ear zzso 

Minor zzso was found for alignments of the magnets zzso to the magnetic field of the zzso which played no clinically important zzso In some cases, the zzso forces upon zzso scanning can lead to pain and/or dislocation of the implant or dislocation of the floating mass zzso zzso depending on its type of positioning and attachment in the middle zzso zzso need of revision surgery is zzso zzso induction may cause loud audible zzso however, there were no reports for cochlear hearing zzso No significant heating effects upon zzso scanning were zzso Image artifacts occur especially because of the large zzso In none of the patient or zzso bone studies, the zzso round or oval window, or other middle ear structures were injured, and there was no functional loss of the implant performance zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso examinations of up to zzso may be of crucial diagnostic importance to the patients implanted with a zzso but there seems no serious risk of harm to the patient or damage to the zzso A dislocation of the zzso can be possible during zzso and this does depend on zzso position and the security of the zzso to the zzso structure and the zzso mode zzso The next generation of zzso systems should consider those possible changes in its zzso
