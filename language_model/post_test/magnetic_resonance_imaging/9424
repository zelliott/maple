In zzso effects indicate a putative beneficial effect of zzso zzso on cartilage zzso however, in zzso protective effects on cartilage have yet to be zzso A zzso zzso scanner was used to derive zzso of zzso surface area and volume of the zzso zzso cartilage and to assess their precision (in the case of volume also zzso against the volumes of dissected cartilage measured by water zzso zzso zzso were made in 16 zzso 6 months after unilateral zzso zzso and zzso of the anterior cruciate zzso after which eight of these were given a proprietary extract of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso grading of the zzso cartilage was also compared with a zzso grading based on direct visual inspection of dissected zzso The zzso precision for zzso measurement was zzso zzso zzso correlated well with volumes of surgically zzso cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso random difference zzso The zzso zzso cartilage thickness and volume were about zzso smaller in the operated knees than in the zzso zzso knees zzso The findings suggest that zzso is a precise and accurate tool for evaluating cartilage in a rabbit model of zzso The difference between the intact and operated knee in thickness and volume of the zzso zzso cartilage was slightly but not significantly smaller in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso
