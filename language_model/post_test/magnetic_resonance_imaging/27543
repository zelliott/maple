zzso to a given face leads to zzso specific zzso Recently, this topic has attracted a lot of attention because it clearly shows that adaptation occurs even at the higher stages of visual cortical zzso However, during our zzso life, faces do not appear in isolation, rather they are usually surrounded by other zzso Here, we used zzso and zzso adaptation methods to test whether humans adapt to the gender properties of a composite multiple face stimulus as zzso As zzso we used stimuli composed of eight different individual faces, positioned peripherally in a ring around a fixation zzso We found that the gender discrimination of a subsequent centrally presented target face is significantly biased as a result of long-term adaptation to either male or female multiple face zzso Similar to our previous results with zzso zzso zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso a concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation experiment revealed the strongest blood oxygen zzso signal adaptation zzso in the zzso face zzso Our results suggest that humans extract the statistical features of the multiple face stimulus and this process occurs at the level of zzso face zzso
