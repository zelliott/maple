We describe the design and operation of an zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso system for in zzso zzso zzso imaging of the human zzso This system permits the study of lung function in both horizontal and upright zzso a capability with important implications in pulmonary physiology and clinical medicine, including asthma and zzso The zzso uses a zzso zzso zzso design that produces an zzso 65 G zzso zzso magnetic field for zzso zzso at 210 zzso Three sets of zzso coils produce the zzso zzso and zzso magnetic field zzso while providing a zzso zzso gap for the imaging zzso We use zzso zzso zzso coils for operation at low zzso and are able to exploit insignificant sample loading to allow for zzso schemes and for accurate zzso of flip zzso We obtain sufficient zzso to acquire zzso zzso images with up to zzso resolution, and present initial zzso and zzso zzso images of human lungs in both zzso and upright zzso zzso zzso can also be performed for diagnostic and zzso zzso
