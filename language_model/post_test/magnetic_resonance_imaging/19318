This paper describes a zzso framework for modeling zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso images based on a zzso model for the zzso response and zzso random field zzso image zzso The model is fitted to image data by maximizing a lower bound on the log zzso The result is an approximate maximum a zzso estimate of the joint distribution over the model parameters and zzso zzso Examples show how this technique can used to segment two-dimensional zzso zzso images, or parts zzso into regions with different characteristics of their zzso zzso
