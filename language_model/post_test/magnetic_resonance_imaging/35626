Loss of function and subsequent spontaneous recovery after zzso stroke are associated with functional and structural zzso in brain zzso Acute functional tissue damage involves distortion of key zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and neurotransmitter zzso Nevertheless, initially zzso metabolism may be restored at later zzso zzso in zzso areas, which could play a key role in zzso recovery of brain zzso The pattern of zzso recovery in relation to zzso tissue damage, however, is basically zzso The goal of our study was to reveal changes in zzso and zzso neurotransmitter metabolism that could zzso zzso changes in functional zzso We performed in zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso during zzso zzso infusion, and zzso at 24 h zzso zzso 6) and 3 weeks zzso zzso 8) after stroke in a rat model to characterize zzso in baseline zzso levels, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and active zzso zzso formation in areas with different degrees of zzso zzso Inside the zzso we detected significant reductions in baseline zzso levels, ongoing zzso formation and seriously diminished zzso and zzso turnover at both time points, indicative of irreversible functional tissue zzso In zzso areas, significant decrease of zzso zzso zzso levels, and zzso and zzso turnover indicated zzso dysfunction at 24 zzso After 3 weeks, when animals showed significant neurological improvement, zzso zzso had zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso turnover was maintained and zzso turnover had zzso These findings point out that early zzso impairment in the zzso zzso can be restored over zzso zzso in brain metabolism in zzso areas probably contribute significantly to changes in functional status in stroke subjects, and may provide a gateway for therapeutic strategies directed at improvement of functional recovery after zzso
