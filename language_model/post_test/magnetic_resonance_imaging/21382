To evaluate the safety and efficacy of zzso high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso 

A total of 76 women with 78 zzso zzso zzso zzso type II zzso 10 type I zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso diameter ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso using a power output of zzso During zzso the volume shrinkage of the zzso zzso was continuously observed on zzso MR and/or zzso ultrasound zzso The change of symptoms was evaluated by using the symptom severity score zzso 

zzso zzso was well tolerated in all zzso No major complications zzso The mean zzso zzso ratio was zzso on zzso During zzso the zzso zzso shrank significantly over zzso The symptoms were alleviated zzso No patients had zzso after zzso zzso expulsion of zzso tissue was seen in zzso zzso of patients after zzso zzso which disappeared after 2-4 zzso zzso Four patients received repeated zzso zzso for enlarged residual zzso 

zzso zzso zzso may be a safe and effective treatment for zzso zzso Further studies are warranted to observe its influence on zzso 

zzso zzso focused ultrasound zzso is a new minimally invasive therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso may be safe and effective for treatment of zzso zzso zzso Treatment is minimally invasive and zzso zzso zzso expulsion of zzso tissue is common after zzso
