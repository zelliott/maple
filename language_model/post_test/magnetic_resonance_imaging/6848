zzso zzso zzso hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso results from a zzso of the zzso zzso virus in the zzso zzso has been supported by the demonstration of zzso zzso viral DNA in the zzso zzso of the side with facial paralysis in patients with zzso Hunt syndrome, with the use of the zzso chain zzso Similarly, DNA of the zzso zzso virus has been identified in the spiral and zzso zzso as zzso We report on three patients with zzso symptoms as the first manifestations of zzso Hunt zzso A zzso old woman and a zzso old man presented with vertigo and an zzso zzso zzso Only the woman developed later on a mild facial zzso A zzso old man presented with an acute zzso syndrome, zzso proven to be a zzso zzso viral zzso which was followed three weeks later by the typical zzso zzso We believe that these cases result from zzso of zzso zzso zzso virus in the spiral and/or zzso zzso As the zzso zzso virus is dormant in the zzso satellite cells, the facial symptoms in our patients as well as the high zzso of zzso symptoms in classical zzso Hunt syndrome can be explained by viral transmission across the nerves inside the internal auditory zzso zzso we think there are grounds to recommend a prompt treatment with an zzso and a zzso agent, not only in case of an acute facial paralysis but also when confronted with an acute zzso zzso
