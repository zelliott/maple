We test the hypothesis that motivational and cognitive processes are linked by a specific neural system to reach zzso zzso We studied six normal subjects performing a working memory paradigm zzso zzso associated with different levels of monetary reward during an zzso zzso The study showed specific brain zzso in relation with changes in both the cognitive loading and the reward associated with task zzso First, the working memory tasks activated a network including the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso area zzso zzso and, in addition, in the lateral zzso areas zzso 10), but only in the more demanding condition zzso zzso This result suggests that lateral prefrontal areas are organized in a zzso zzso in relation with the increase in executive zzso Second, reward zzso an increased zzso in the areas already activated by working memory processing and in a supplementary region, the zzso frontal pole zzso 10), regardless of the level of cognitive zzso It is zzso that the latter region plays a specific role in monitoring the reward value of ongoing cognitive zzso Third, we detected areas where the signal decreases zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso in relation with both the increase of cognitive demand and the zzso The zzso may represent an emotional gating aimed at zzso adverse emotional signals to maximize the level of zzso Taken together, these results suggest a balance between increasing activity in cortical cognitive areas and decreasing activity in the zzso and zzso structures during ongoing higher cognitive zzso
