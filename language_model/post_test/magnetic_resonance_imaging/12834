Just as typical development of anatomical zzso in the human brain has been linked with normal zzso of motor and cognitive functions, disruption of asymmetry has been implicated in the zzso of zzso disorders such as zzso disorder zzso No study has examined the development of cortical asymmetry using zzso zzso zzso 

To delineate the development of cortical asymmetry in children with and without zzso 

zzso zzso 

Government Clinical Research zzso 

A total of 218 children with zzso and zzso typically developing children, from whom 1133 zzso magnetic resonance images were acquired zzso 

zzso thickness was estimated at 40 zzso zzso points in the left and right zzso and the trajectory of change in asymmetry was defined using zzso zzso 

In right-handed typically developing individuals, a mean zzso increase in the relative thickness of the right zzso and inferior frontal zzso with age of zzso zzso zzso per year zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was balanced against a relative zzso increase in the zzso cortical regions of zzso zzso zzso per year zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso change in asymmetry in zzso typically developing individuals was less extensive and was localized to different cortical zzso In zzso the zzso component of this evolving asymmetry was intact, but the prefrontal component was zzso 

These findings explain the way that, in typical development, the increased dimensions of the right frontal and left zzso cortical regions emerge in adulthood from the reversed pattern of childhood cortical zzso Loss of the prefrontal component of this evolving asymmetry in zzso is compatible with disruption of prefrontal function in the disorder and demonstrates the way that disruption of typical processes of asymmetry can inform our understanding of zzso zzso
