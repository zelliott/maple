zzso focused ultrasound has been discovered to be able to locally and zzso increase the zzso of the zzso barrier zzso which can be detected using magnetic resonance imaging zzso However, side effects such as zzso zzso zzso or even extensive zzso may also zzso Although current zzso zzso zzso can be used to detect the changes in zzso zzso its efficacy in detecting tissue zzso after zzso zzso remains zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso for identifying possible tissue zzso associated with disruption of the zzso induced by focused ultrasound in a rat zzso The brains of 42 zzso rats were subjected to 107 zzso either unilaterally or zzso zzso zzso opening was achieved by delivering zzso focused ultrasound energy into brain tissue in the presence of zzso zzso were studied by zzso and zzso zzso zzso techniques, as well as by zzso zzso changes were analyzed zzso and the extent of zzso was investigated with the terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso The results demonstrated that zzso is more sensitive than standard zzso and zzso zzso zzso techniques in detecting zzso after brain zzso zzso study showed that zzso is sensitive to the recovery process of the damage and, therefore, could provide important and complementary information to the conventional MR zzso Potential applications such as drug delivery in the brain might be zzso
