Unlike in zzso imaging, zzso zzso allows for invasive examination of the tissue zzso immediately after the MR zzso However, natural tissue decomposition and chemical fixation cause the zzso zzso zzso properties to be different from those found in zzso Moreover, these properties change as zzso fixation time zzso The goal of this study was to characterize the zzso relaxation changes that occur over time in zzso human brain zzso during zzso Five zzso immersed in zzso solution were scanned on a weekly basis for 3 months zzso and once again at 6 months zzso The zzso relaxation times were measured throughout the zzso Over time, zzso values near the edges of the zzso decreased rapidly after death, while zzso values of deep tissue decreased more zzso This difference is likely due to the relatively large distance from the zzso surface, and other barriers limiting diffusion of zzso molecules to deep zzso In addition, zzso values in deep tissue did not continuously zzso to a zzso but instead reached a minimum and then increased to a zzso This final increase may be due to the effects of prolonged tissue decomposition, a hypothesis that is supported by zzso simulations of the fixation zzso
