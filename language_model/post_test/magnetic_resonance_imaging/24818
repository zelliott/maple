Due to improved tissue zzso and the enabling of zzso minimally invasive interventions in the same vessel segment, zzso zzso scaffolds represent a competitive approach to permanent metallic zzso in vascular zzso Despite these advantages some challenges, such as the improvement of the scaffold mechanics and enhancement of scaffold visibility during the zzso zzso are zzso zzso the scope of our studies was to investigate the potential of gold, silver and zzso zzso incorporated in a zzso blend of zzso for image enhancement in zzso magnetic resonance or zzso zzso Their impact on mechanical properties of such modified scaffold materials was also zzso
