To investigate retrograde zzso zzso for its potential to cause zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso that has been previously described in patients with zzso zzso To identify risk factors for zzso and to expand the zzso knowledge on zzso 

zzso case zzso 

We included 117 consecutive patients and 180 eyes with confirmed zzso zzso of variable zzso Patients with glaucoma were zzso 

We determined age, sex, visual zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso and spatial characteristics of zzso zzso with zzso were compared with eyes with zzso zzso alone and to healthy fellow zzso With retinal layer zzso we zzso measured the zzso zzso 

zzso data, distribution of zzso in the zzso and thickness of retinal layers were zzso 

We found zzso in 16 eyes zzso from 9 patients, none of whom had multiple sclerosis or zzso zzso The zzso was restricted to the inner nuclear layer zzso and had a characteristic zzso circular zzso Compared with healthy controls, zzso was associated with significant thinning of the zzso cell layer and nerve fiber layer, as well as a zzso of the zzso and the deeper retinal zzso Youth is a significant risk factor for zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is not specific for zzso zzso It is a sign of zzso zzso irrespective of its zzso The distinctive zzso anatomy suggests that zzso is caused by retrograde zzso of the inner retinal zzso resulting in impaired fluid zzso in the zzso
