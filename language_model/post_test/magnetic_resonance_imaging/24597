Huntington disease zzso is zzso characterized by a selective zzso of vulnerable populations of zzso with an early marked zzso loss and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso originate in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Few studies investigated the zzso loss and the functional role of the zzso zzso in modulating clinical features in zzso 

12 patients and 12 zzso controls underwent zzso scans with zzso and a zzso zzso scan with inversion recovery zzso The association between both clinical and zzso features and zzso zzso and volume of zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower in patients with respect to zzso Further, the volume of zzso zzso was reduced in HD when compared to controls zzso No relationship between the volume of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found as well as between clinical and zzso features with the zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results confirm that the zzso of zzso zzso may occur in symptomatic HD zzso If confirmed by larger studies, the lack of any kind of correlation between clinical and zzso features with zzso zzso and volume of zzso zzso suggests that motor and cognitive aspects in HD are not directly related to zzso zzso
