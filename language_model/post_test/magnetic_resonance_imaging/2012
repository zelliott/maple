When zzso zzso visual stimuli are presented in zzso subjects may perceive a single stimulus moving between the two positions zzso zzso By adjusting spatial and zzso zzso an ambiguous condition can be created in which perception of back-and-forth motion zzso with the perception of two stationary blinking zzso We presented subjects with such ambiguous zzso asked them to signal periods of perceived motion and zzso and measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance zzso Multiple zzso analysis revealed that early visual areas responded with equal strength during both zzso conditions, whereas zzso (the human motion complex that includes the human zzso of zzso and its zzso was more active during the perception of apparent zzso These results indicate that zzso in zzso participate in the constructive process that creates a continuous motion zzso from a zzso visual zzso
