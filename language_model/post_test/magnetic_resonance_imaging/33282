Does the zzso elevated neural activity observed during working memory tasks reflect the short-term retention of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data of delayed recognition of visual motion in human participants were analyzed with two zzso a general linear model zzso and zzso pattern zzso Although the zzso identified zzso elevated zzso activity in superior and lateral frontal zzso and in zzso zzso pattern zzso were unable to recover zzso stimulus information from these zzso zzso The zzso zzso elevated zzso activity but successful zzso of zzso stimulus zzso true of zzso visual regions, including area zzso (which contains both middle zzso area and zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to stimulus information, pattern zzso were able to extract zzso task zzso information from frontal and zzso areas showing elevated zzso zzso Thus, the elevated zzso activity that is measured with zzso may reflect processes other than the storage, per se, of zzso stimulus zzso It may be that the short-term storage of stimulus information is represented in patterns of zzso zzso activity distributed across regions of low-level sensory zzso that zzso methods cannot zzso
