zzso complex II zzso is a rare form of zzso disease, accounting for approximately zzso of all respiratory chain zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and transcribe the zzso zzso of complex II via the action of two known assembly factors zzso and zzso Only a handful of reports describe inherited zzso gene defects as a cause of zzso zzso disease, involving either zzso zzso syndrome, zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, all four zzso zzso together with zzso have known zzso zzso functions, with numerous zzso and zzso zzso reported in association with zzso cancer zzso including zzso and zzso 

Here, we report the clinical and molecular investigations of two patients with zzso and zzso evidence of a zzso isolated complex II zzso due to novel zzso gene zzso the first patient presented with zzso and zzso due to compound zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while the second patient presented with zzso and zzso with elevated brain zzso demonstrated by MR zzso due to a novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso studies confirmed decreased zzso levels of the relevant zzso zzso and impairment of complex II zzso Evidence from zzso zzso studies provided additional support for zzso of the zzso zzso 

Our report represents the first example of zzso zzso as a cause of inherited zzso respiratory chain disease and extends the zzso zzso spectrum in patients with isolated complex II zzso
