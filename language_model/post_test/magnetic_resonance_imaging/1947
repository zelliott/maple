zzso the investigation of the internal zzso of insects relies on zzso methods, zzso the preparation of thin tissue zzso However, the preparation of serial sections is time consuming and means the irreversible loss of the zzso In the present investigation, we have analyzed the potential of zzso imaging as a tool for the zzso zzso of insects with sufficient spatial zzso With a 512 zzso 15 zzso zzso 200 zzso slice zzso images with an zzso spatial resolution of 30 zzso are obtained with a zzso ratio of zzso These conditions require only seven averages, resulting in an experimental time of only 50 zzso Such image quality already permits the differentiation of fine structural and zzso details such as zzso zzso tracts and zzso organ in a zzso Also, wing controlling zzso muscle groups as well as leg structures and zzso are clearly zzso We conclude that the spatial resolution and contrast condition of MR imaging are quite promising for the new approach of zzso insect zzso using zzso zzso Further principally available technical enhancement of sensitivity and spatial resolution will provide an attractive alternative to invasive techniques for the zzso of, sometimes, rare and precious insect zzso
