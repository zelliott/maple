The zzso of the zzso is considered the hallmark of zzso zzso and has high potential as a zzso in structural MR zzso This study aimed at comparing automated and manual zzso zzso 

In this zzso zzso study in 40 patients with HD and 30 healthy controls, a fully automated zzso measurement by zzso was used for the first time in HD and was directly compared with manual zzso as the generally accepted criterion standard of zzso 

It could be shown that both techniques were able to separate patients and controls to a similar zzso The differences between the 2 zzso zzso ranged within the limits of zzso the systematically lower values by manual zzso were caused by the different assessment of the zzso zzso tail, which is hard to delineate zzso 

zzso may be used instead of manual zzso to zzso zzso volume zzso Additionally, the zzso technique has the advantage of being much faster, is less laborious, and is free of a zzso zzso interest zzso zzso might serve as a tool in potential future clinical trials of zzso treatments in zzso
