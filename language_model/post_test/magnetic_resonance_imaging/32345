Many methods have been proposed to extract pressure zzso maps from magnetic resonance zzso zzso They were based on the resolution of the zzso model of zzso and needed the flow acceleration to be zzso Most used zzso data acquisition and zzso acceleration from zzso and spatial derivatives of the zzso zzso However, MR sequences have been developed in order to acquire the acceleration field zzso Here we compared direct MR zzso of acceleration field components with those calculated from MR zzso zzso Two experimental zzso were used to separately evaluate the zzso and zzso components of the zzso zzso simulation of the zzso phantom further explained the origin of the noise generated by the spatial and zzso derivatives of the zzso data, and the zzso zzso due to MR zzso We found that direct measurement of the acceleration field generates less noise and fewer zzso than calculation from zzso zzso
