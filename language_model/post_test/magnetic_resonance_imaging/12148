Due to the nature of three-dimensional zzso transform zzso data acquisition in magnetic resonance imaging zzso the spatial relation between a resolved volume element (a zzso and the object can be manipulated zzso Those zzso have practical consequences in terms of registering slice positions with respect to features of interest in producing zzso zzso images where volume resolution is zzso and in generating zzso images that project the viewing plane onto a surface through the object that has an arbitrary zzso
