We review two complementary zzso imaging zzso to characterize structure and function of zzso networks in the human brain, and their application to subjects with severe brain zzso The structural imaging zzso diffusion zzso imaging, is based on imaging the diffusion of water zzso in the brain zzso From the diffusion zzso several quantities characterizing fiber structure in the brain can be zzso The principal direction of the diffusion zzso has been found to depend on the fiber direction of zzso zzso It can be used for white matter fiber zzso The zzso (or directional zzso of diffusion has been shown to be sensitive to zzso as well as white matter changes during training and recovery from brain zzso The functional zzso imaging zzso resting state zzso concerns the functional connectivity of zzso networks rather than their anatomical zzso zzso undergo a conventional zzso imaging protocol without performing specific zzso Various resting state network patterns can be zzso by zzso that reveal correlations in the zzso zzso Often, zzso structures are involved, suggesting that resting state zzso could reflect global brain network zzso Clinical applications of resting state zzso have been reported, in particular relating signal abnormalities to neurodegenerative zzso To better understand to which degree resting state patterns reflect zzso network function, we are comparing network patterns of normal subjects with those having severe brain zzso in a small pilot zzso
