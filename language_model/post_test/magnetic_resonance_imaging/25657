This study evaluates the ability of magnetic resonance zzso zzso to detect zzso failure of lower zzso bypass zzso and questions whether conventional zzso is necessary for this zzso 

A prospective surveillance protocol with zzso zzso and color flow zzso scanning has been used to detect zzso graft failure in 110 patients with 120 lower zzso bypass zzso (90 zzso 30 zzso Twenty zzso bypass zzso fit the criteria for impending failure zzso in zzso index determination greater than or equal to zzso zzso less than 45 zzso focal zzso two to three times mean graft zzso zzso digital zzso zzso and zzso studies were performed on all 20 zzso 

zzso digital zzso zzso showed graft zzso in two zzso severe native artery progression in three zzso graft wall defects in six zzso and zzso strictures in nine zzso zzso results showed an exact correlation in 15 zzso of 20 zzso zzso tests occurred in four cases zzso and zzso tests occurred in one case zzso Common reasons for interpretation error were metallic clips and zzso zzso These problems are zzso When zzso results were compared with color flow scan data, overall accuracy improved to zzso 

Our studies suggest that zzso can be useful in graft surveillance and that the need for conventional zzso may be reduced in the zzso
