Internal zzso zzso zzso function can be expected in approximately zzso of cases of high or intermediate zzso anomaly reconstruction if the zzso region is preserved and zzso to become the new zzso zzso 

To investigate the zzso of the zzso structure, magnetic resonance zzso imaging was performed zzso in 14 patients operated on with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results were compared with the appearance of the zzso canal in seven normal zzso In addition, comparison was made with the images of five patients operated on with earlier zzso techniques, in which the zzso region was zzso 

In all patients operated on with zzso and zzso technique, the zzso displayed an zzso smooth muscle structure zzso a closed zzso zzso In comparison with normal controls, the image of this zzso was more irregular and had greater variations in thickness in different zzso Moreover, the area of the zzso structure was larger in comparison with the zzso Eleven of the 14 patients showed a positive zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, the MR findings of the three cases lacking the zzso were not different compared with the rest of the zzso The five patients operated on with earlier techniques demonstrated an open zzso canal without a measurable zzso smooth muscle zzso 

An zzso smooth muscle structure was seen by zzso in all patients operated on with zzso and zzso technique independently of the severity of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, this structure was in most cases more zzso and irregular compared with normal zzso
