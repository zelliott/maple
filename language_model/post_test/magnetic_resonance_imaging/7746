The zzso zzso zzso is a highly connected and metabolically active brain zzso Recent studies suggest it has an important cognitive role, although there is no consensus about what this zzso The region is typically discussed as having a zzso function because of a common pattern of relative zzso observed during zzso demanding zzso One influential hypothesis is that the zzso zzso zzso has a central role in supporting zzso zzso It is a key zzso in the default mode network and shows increased activity when individuals retrieve autobiographical memories or plan for the future, as well as during zzso zzso when activity in the brain is zzso However, other evidence suggests that the region is highly zzso and may play a direct role in regulating the focus of zzso In addition, its activity varies with zzso state and its interactions with other brain networks may be important for conscious zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function is likely to be of clinical zzso It is well protected against zzso stroke, and so there is relatively little zzso data about the consequences of focal zzso However, in other conditions abnormalities in the region are clearly linked to zzso For example, zzso deposition and reduced metabolism is seen early in Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso studies show abnormalities in a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease, zzso zzso depression and attention deficit zzso disorder, as well as zzso Our own work has consistently shown abnormal zzso zzso zzso function following traumatic brain injury, which predicts zzso zzso Here we review the anatomy and physiology of the region and how it is affected in a range of clinical conditions, before discussing its proposed zzso We zzso key findings into a novel model of the region's function (the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are functionally separated and differences in regional activity are explained by zzso zzso zzso state; zzso whether attention is focused internally or zzso and zzso the breadth of zzso zzso The predictions of the model can be tested within the framework of complex dynamic systems theory, and we propose that the zzso zzso zzso zzso influences zzso focus by zzso zzso zzso and so adjusts how stable brain network activity is over zzso
