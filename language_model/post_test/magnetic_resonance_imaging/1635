To study the characteristics of zzso zzso zzso in B mode zzso zzso computerized zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso so as to increase the zzso diagnostic zzso 

The data of zzso cases with zzso zzso zzso who underwent operation during the period January 1984 to December 2000 were analyzed and compared with the pathological findings of the zzso zzso All of the cases were examined by zzso and CT, and 12 of them were examined by zzso 

The imaging characteristics of the 46 cases were divided into three zzso zzso (41 cases, zzso zzso zzso cases, zzso and cavity with zzso zzso cases, zzso Nine imaging signs were found to be specific to zzso zzso zzso and of diagnostic zzso halo belt sign, zzso sign, annual ring sign, zzso sign, cavity with zzso sign, zzso sign, peninsula sign, zzso zzso With these signs, the diagnostic accuracy rate reached zzso in this zzso 

There are nine imaging diagnostic signs specific to zzso zzso zzso They help detect the location, pathology of this disease and determine operation zzso Identification of only one of them is adequate for diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso
