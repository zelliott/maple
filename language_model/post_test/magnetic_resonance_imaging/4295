Although recent zzso studies suggest that prefrontal zzso zzso is involved in working memory zzso the relationship between zzso activity and memory load has not yet been zzso in zzso Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to probe zzso activity during a sequential letter task in which memory load was varied in an incremental zzso In all nine subjects zzso zzso and left inferior regions of zzso were identified that exhibited a linear relationship between activity and zzso zzso Furthermore, these same regions were independently identified through direct correlations of the zzso signal with a behavioral measure that indexes zzso function during task zzso A second experiment, using zzso imaging techniques, both zzso these findings and identified additional brain regions showing a linear relationship with load, suggesting a distributed circuit that zzso with zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide a zzso zzso describing the involvement of both zzso and related brain regions in zzso function, and highlight the benefits of using zzso zzso designs in zzso zzso
