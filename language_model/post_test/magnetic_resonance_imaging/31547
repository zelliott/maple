Despite the importance of the tobacco smoke particulate matter in the lungs to the zzso of pulmonary disease in cigarette smokers, little is currently known about the spatial distribution of particle deposition or the persistence of the resulting deposits in humans, and no satisfactory technique currently exists to directly observe tobacco smoke zzso in zzso In this zzso work, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are introduced as zzso for tobacco smoke deposition in porous zzso A reduction in the zzso zzso zzso relaxation of up to zzso under zzso zzso pressure and temperature conditions was observed when the krypton gas was brought into contact with surfaces that had been exposed to cigarette zzso This zzso acceleration of the zzso zzso was observed for model glass surfaces that, in some experiments, were coated with bovine lung zzso zzso However, a similar effect was not observed with zzso indicating that the zzso sensitivity to smoke deposition was not caused by zzso species but rather by zzso relaxation due to high zzso affinity for the smoke zzso The zzso zzso differences between zzso and zzso surfaces were sufficient to produce a strong contrast in variable flip angle zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be a promising contrast agent for in zzso pulmonary zzso
