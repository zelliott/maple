The zzso zzso test is commonly used as a predictor of memory zzso after anterior zzso lobe zzso zzso for intractable zzso zzso in memory scores can provide focus zzso zzso In this study the zzso value of a set of Wada test parameters was zzso including patients with symmetrical memory zzso 

The Wada test was carried out in 226 patients undergoing ATL zzso zzso 132 zzso Data were collected on item recognition (five zzso story recall, zzso dose, presentation time, zzso and zzso filling of zzso A zzso zzso analysis was performed on these data in order to find a set of variables which could best predict the side of seizure zzso 

The analysis yielded four zzso zzso both memory scores, story recall after zzso injection and presentation time of stimuli after zzso injection which could correctly predict seizure zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso was lower for right zzso than for left zzso zzso outcome was four times more zzso in the correctly classified zzso 

The results suggest that prediction of focus zzso in zzso lobe zzso can be fairly exact even if zzso memory scores are zzso Performing the Wada test with only five memory items keeps the time window of active zzso short enough and gives accurate information about zzso zzso lobe zzso The zzso scheme can be useful in predicting a lowered chance of seizure zzso
