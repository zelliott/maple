zzso is an essential metal that zzso as a zzso in a number of critical biological functions such as electron zzso zzso of free zzso and synthesis of zzso Like other heavy metals, high zzso of zzso are zzso For example, chronic zzso to zzso leads to movement zzso In order to maintain this balance between being an essential participant in zzso function and being a toxic heavy metal, a rich biology has evolved to transport and store zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso are potent zzso relaxation zzso Indeed, zzso was the first contrast agent proposed for use in zzso Recently, there is renewed interest in combining the strong zzso relaxation effects of zzso with its unique biology in order to expand the range of information that can be measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso is being developed to give unique tissue contrast, assess tissue zzso act as a surrogate marker of calcium influx into cells and trace zzso zzso In this article we review recent work and point out prospects for the future uses of zzso enhanced zzso
