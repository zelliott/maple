Fast, zzso shoot functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso based on the blood zzso zzso zzso effect, was combined with optical recording of intrinsic signals zzso and zzso labeling in zzso barrel zzso We observed over the activated barrel a positive zzso signal and increased levels of zzso and total zzso during each period of prolonged (30 zzso zzso zzso zzso These data show that the zzso basis of this zzso signal is not necessarily a zzso of zzso as generally zzso Instead, they suggest that a positive zzso signal can also be caused by a local increase of blood volume, even if zzso levels are persistently zzso We also show that this alternative interpretation is consistent with theoretical models of the zzso zzso The changes in zzso signal and blood volume, which are most tightly correlated with the periodic zzso peak at the site of zzso zzso These results contribute to the understanding of the zzso mechanisms underlying the zzso signal and also suggest analysis methods, which improve the spatial zzso of zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso
