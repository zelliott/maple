zzso zzso zzso is often found after the manifestation of cerebral zzso though the zzso is still zzso We present a case of cerebral zzso secondary to zzso zzso zzso which presented a slow expansion on magnetic resonance imaging despite severe zzso This case suggests a possible mechanism for development of cerebral zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

This case report was conducted in a university zzso zzso resonance imaging and zzso imaging were performed to assess the evolution of zzso and the total blood volume and cerebral blood flow were determined with the use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was performed, but intervention was not zzso The manual muscle test and sensory zzso were assessed by the same zzso throughout the clinical zzso 

A zzso male patient with zzso zzso zzso had a cerebral zzso A subtle change was observed on CT scan on the third day after the onset of zzso and a small signal was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging on the fourth zzso The cerebral zzso expanded slowly in size and reached a maximum on day zzso A diagnosis of cerebral zzso secondary to zzso zzso zzso was made, and treatment by zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Though the zzso zzso he became ambulatory with a brace, as do patients with zzso zzso 

It is suggested that the delayed manifestation and slow expansion of cerebral zzso caused by elevated zzso might be derived from a zzso different from zzso zzso
