It has been suggested that compared with other brain zzso the zzso in particular is vulnerable to chronic zzso We investigated whether total zzso cerebral blood flow zzso was associated with zzso zzso and also whether this relationship was modified by white matter zzso zzso In a zzso analysis within the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso study, which is a cohort study among patients with zzso disease, total zzso zzso and zzso volume were assessed in zzso patients zzso age: zzso years, zzso zzso Total zzso was expressed in per 100 zzso brain volume for obtaining zzso Manual zzso zzso of the zzso were carried out on a three-dimensional fast zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging scan with zzso zzso zzso brain zzso was used to zzso volumes of the zzso and the total zzso A linear zzso analysis showed that reduced zzso was not associated with smaller zzso volume after adjustments were made for age and zzso The association attenuated further after additional adjustments were made for vascular risk factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso per zzso decrease in zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso The association was not modified by zzso zzso for interaction term zzso We found no evidence of the fact that lower zzso blood flow contributes to the zzso of the zzso in a population of patients with zzso zzso
