To improve analysis of cerebral white matter zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso analysis technique zzso zzso and registered zzso PET zzso was used for quantitative assessment of zzso zzso Data processing included zzso transformation of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and subsequent automated zzso and zzso to zzso PET zzso Color model transformations were used for combined zzso the hue zzso value color model was regarded as a three-dimensional data zzso zzso quantitative zzso data of both zzso The technique was applied in normal subjects and in patients suffering from different zzso zzso Regional analysis was performed to zzso zzso impairment on a zzso zzso 

Using zzso a considerable gain in image contrast for zzso was achieved in all zzso In the normal subjects, zzso metabolism was shown to be zzso zzso zzso scores of regional analysis revealed zzso zzso changes in all zzso zzso of zzso zzso exceeded the extent of the zzso as delineated by zzso signal zzso 

The potential of the method for further zzso of the role of zzso diseases in brain dysfunction in patients is zzso
