A new zzso to zzso zzso relaxation zzso maps in magnetic resonance imaging zzso by using fast imaging protocols and monitoring the zzso evolution towards a steady state is zzso This zzso uses a general zzso fit to multiple point experimental data and is thus much more precise than the standard zzso zzso Since this imaging protocol is designed to consume time comparable to that of standard clinical zzso it has an advantage in comparison to traditional multiple point zzso which require considerably longer scanning zzso In addition to zzso maps the protocol can generate final images suitable for clinical zzso Thus it is possible to generate relaxation data without considerably lengthening the total required zzso study zzso The results of phantom testing of this protocol are zzso
