The pathology of restless legs syndrome zzso is still not zzso To investigate the zzso of the disorder further we recorded a surface zzso zzso of the anterior zzso muscle during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with idiopathic zzso 

Seven subjects with moderate to severe zzso were investigated in the present pilot zzso Patients were lying zzso in the scanner for over 50 zzso and were instructed not to move zzso zzso leg discomfort zzso was evaluated on a zzso zzso zzso For brain image analysis, an zzso for the calculation of zzso zzso values was zzso 

We found a negative correlation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This finding provides evidence for the clinical experience that zzso zzso leg discomfort increases during muscle relaxation at zzso In the zzso analysis, the zzso zzso was associated with zzso in motor and zzso pathways and also in some regions that are not primarily related to motor or zzso zzso 

By using a newly developed zzso for the investigation of muscle zzso changes in cerebral activity, we identified structures that are potentially involved in zzso zzso Our method, with some zzso may also be suitable for the investigation of zzso muscle activity that occurs during periodic leg zzso
