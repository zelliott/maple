To evaluate disk zzso in human and animal models by using a zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging technique to help in understanding the natural history and progression of zzso disk zzso 

After institutional review board approval was zzso 80 subjects (54 men and 26 zzso mean age zzso standard zzso zzso years zzso zzso with 400 zzso zzso disks were examined at MR zzso With approval from the animal care committee, six zzso monkeys received two levels of either zzso zzso puncture or zzso zzso injection at zzso and zzso to mimic disk zzso zzso spines of all the animals were examined at zzso and MR imaging preoperatively and 1 day and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 13 months zzso zzso grading system and zzso zzso were used to evaluate the degenerative degree of the disks of both humans and zzso 

The mean zzso values of zzso zzso disks of human subjects were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso grades II and III, zzso The zzso values in zzso zzso disks of the zzso monkey models of disk zzso had a rapid decrease from approximately 110 zzso to 80 zzso and then tended to stabilize after zzso There was a large zzso value decrease between zzso grades II and III in human subjects that coincided with the rapid zzso process of zzso zzso disks in the zzso zzso zzso grades were significantly correlated with zzso values in both humans zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso monkeys zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The data demonstrate that rapid zzso disk zzso occurs early in the degenerative zzso between zzso grades II and zzso
