Performing zzso actions toward an object in accordance with contextual constraints, such as the presence or absence of an obstacle, has been widely used as a paradigm for assessing the capacity of infants or nonhuman primates to evaluate the zzso of others' zzso Here, we have used this paradigm in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment to zzso the cortical regions involved in the assessment of action zzso while controlling for visual differences in the displays and directly zzso magnetic resonance activity with zzso zzso zzso middle zzso zzso zzso regions, anterior to zzso body area and the human middle zzso complex, were involved in the visual evaluation of action zzso These zzso regions are embedded in the superior zzso zzso regions processing the zzso of observed zzso Our results suggest that zzso is assessed initially by purely visual zzso combining the zzso of the action with the physical constraints of the environmental zzso The zzso region seems to be sensitive to the contingent relationship between a zzso biological action and its relevant environmental constraints, showing increased activity when the expected pattern of rational goal zzso is zzso
