zzso conceptual and diagnostic approaches to defining mild cognitive impairment zzso have led to highly variable prevalence and progression zzso We sought to examine whether bilateral zzso volumes and cerebrovascular risk factors in individuals characterized by two different zzso definitions of zzso zzso would also zzso Participants were 65 zzso zzso older adults, ages zzso years, drawn from a larger group of individuals enrolled in a zzso study of normal zzso A comprehensive zzso definition of zzso that required the presence of more than one impaired score in a cognitive domain resulted in expected anatomical results; zzso volumes were significantly smaller in the zzso group as compared to cognitively normal or zzso zzso zzso However, a typical definitional scheme for zzso zzso based only on the presence of one impaired score within a cognitive domain did not result in zzso differences between zzso Global stroke risk factors did not differ between the two definitional schemes, although the relationship between stroke risk variables and zzso performance did vary by diagnostic zzso The comprehensive approach demonstrated associations between stroke risk and zzso whereas the typical approach did zzso Use of more sophisticated clinical decision-making and diagnostic approaches that incorporate comprehensive zzso assessment techniques is supported by this convergence of zzso zzso and stroke risk zzso
