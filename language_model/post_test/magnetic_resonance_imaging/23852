A number of zzso and zzso techniques have been evaluated in the research setting to assess upper motor zzso zzso damage in zzso Changes in tissue structure in the zzso modify the zzso behavior of water zzso which can be detected by diffusion zzso zzso 

To explore the hypothesis that zzso of the motor fibers in ALS would be reflected by changes in the diffusion characteristics of the white matter fibers in the zzso limb of the internal capsule and that these changes could be detected by diffusion zzso zzso 

We studied 22 patients with El zzso zzso zzso or possible zzso with limb onset zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso and 11 with zzso onset zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso compared them with 20 healthy, zzso controls zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso We assessed central motor zzso time zzso threshold to zzso and silent period using zzso magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed using a zzso GE zzso system zzso zzso fitted with Advanced zzso hardware and software capable of producing echo zzso MR zzso Data were acquired from seven zzso slices centered to include the zzso limb of the internal zzso zzso of the mean zzso fractional zzso and zzso signal intensity were zzso 

There were no differences between the subject groups on measures of zzso threshold to zzso and silent zzso However, the zzso correlated with clinical measures of zzso zzso We found a significant increase in the mean zzso and reduction in fractional zzso along the zzso tracts between the three subject groups, most marked in the zzso zzso The fractional zzso correlated with measures of disease severity and zzso involvement, whereas the mean zzso correlated with disease zzso 

The results support the use of diffusion zzso zzso in detecting pathology of the zzso tracts in zzso
