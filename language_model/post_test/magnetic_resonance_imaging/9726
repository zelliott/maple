Development and evaluation of a realistic hybrid head phantom for the validation of quantitative CT brain zzso zzso 

A zzso or hybrid, of CT images of an zzso head phantom together with clinically acquired zzso brain images was used to construct a dynamic hybrid head zzso Essential CT imaging parameters such as zzso dependent noise, effects of resolution, tube settings, and reconstruction parameters were zzso included by scanning a skull phantom using CT zzso zzso protocols with varying zzso These data were combined with processed high resolution zzso clinical zzso images to include healthy and diseased brain zzso as well as the cerebral vascular zzso Time zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso passage based on zzso as observed in clinical studies were zzso Using the zzso zzso images were generated using three brain zzso calculation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso and accuracy of the three calculation methods was zzso zzso of zzso outcome on calculation method was compared to clinical zzso Furthermore, the potential of the phantom to zzso brain zzso packages was zzso 

All zzso calculation methods showed zzso of low zzso values and zzso of high zzso zzso Good correlation in behavior between phantom and clinical data was found zzso zzso zzso 

A dynamic hybrid head phantom constructed from CT and zzso data was demonstrated to realistically represent clinical zzso studies, which is useful for assessing CT brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso
