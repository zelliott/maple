zzso and behavioral abnormalities in facial emotion processing zzso have been consistently found in schizophrenia patients, but studies assessing brain functioning in early zzso are scarce and the variety of experimental zzso in current literature make comparisons zzso The present work focuses on assessing zzso in people experiencing a psychotic episode for the first time with different experimental paradigm zzso 

Twenty-two patients with a first psychotic episode zzso (13 zzso took part in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study zzso examining neural responses to explicit and implicit processing of fearful and happy facial expressions presented at two different zzso 50% and zzso Their brain zzso was compared to that of 31 healthy subjects (15 zzso 

Control subjects show differential patterns of brain zzso regarding the task demands zzso or explicit zzso the emotional content zzso or zzso and the zzso of the emotion zzso or zzso such differences are not found in participants with a first psychotic episode zzso No interaction or group effects are seen between control and zzso participants with any of the emotional tasks zzso although zzso subjects show worse behavioral zzso 

No brain areas recruited for zzso emerge as significantly different between people with a zzso and healthy subjects, independently on the demands of the task, the emotion zzso or the intensity of the zzso but zzso participants show a limited recruitment of differential brain regions that could be associated with poor emotional processing in the short zzso Our results outline the need of investigating the underlying processes that lead zzso participants to worse zzso zzso
