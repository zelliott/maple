In major depression, prefrontal regulation of zzso brain areas may be a key mechanism that is impaired during the processing of affective zzso This zzso interaction has been shown to be modulated by zzso zzso zzso indicating a higher risk for major depressive disorder zzso with increasing number of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess neural response to zzso unpleasant affective pictures in 21 zzso patients with zzso compared to 21 matched healthy controls, taking into account genetic influences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Healthy controls displayed greater prefrontal zzso zzso to zzso negative pictures compared to patients with zzso While in healthy controls prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased with the number of zzso zzso risk zzso this effect was zzso and even zzso in patients with zzso In zzso connectivity decreased with severity of depressive symptoms zzso total zzso 

These findings suggest that increased zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso connectivity may counteract the risk for zzso in healthy carriers of zzso zzso zzso while this protective factor might be lost in patients who actually suffer from zzso zzso regulation in risk populations could be a target of early interventions and should be the focus of further zzso
