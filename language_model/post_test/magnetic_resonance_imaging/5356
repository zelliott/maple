Depression has been associated with changes in responses within the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso during emotional information zzso zzso drug treatment has been shown to modify neural responses in healthy volunteers early in treatment within similar zzso It is zzso however, whether the same early effect occurs in depressed patients, before changes in zzso The current study therefore investigated the effects of zzso administration of the selective zzso inhibitor zzso vs zzso in volunteers zzso at a high risk for the development of depression, using the personality zzso of high zzso in a zzso zzso zzso On the last day of treatment, resting zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data were acquired during a self-referential words zzso zzso A significant zzso in a cluster of zzso areas, including zzso anterior zzso and right zzso zzso was revealed, driven by decreased responses to the negative zzso following zzso compared with zzso in the absence of any mood zzso These findings show a zzso of neural abnormalities zzso and zzso population early in treatment, supporting the theory that zzso may indeed act by zzso specific neural zzso correlated to negative cognitive zzso
