zzso containing live Japanese quail zzso were zzso using zzso resonance imaging zzso at zzso intervals from Day 0 to 8, the period during which the main body axis is being laid down and zzso is taking zzso zzso detail of zzso structures such as the zzso was revealed at early stages but the zzso could only be zzso around Day zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso length and volume were zzso and also changes in volume in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso increased in length by zzso and nearly zzso in volume between Day 4 and Day zzso Although the amount of zzso remained fairly constant over the first 5 days, the amount of zzso decreases significantly and was replaced by zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation times of different regions within the eggs were determined over the first 6 days of zzso The zzso zzso mirrored the changes in image intensity observed, which can be related to the zzso protein zzso In addition, a comparison of the development of Day 0 to 3 quail zzso exposed to zzso zzso zzso 7 T zzso magnetic fields and magnetic field zzso for an average of 7 h with the development of control zzso did not reveal any gross changes, thus confirming that zzso is a suitable tool for following the development of live avian zzso over time from the earliest zzso
