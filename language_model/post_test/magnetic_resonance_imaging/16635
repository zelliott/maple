The zzso in proximity to zzso zzso zzso still differ from that under zzso zzso This may prevent desired cardiac zzso and promote zzso zzso Further improvements in prosthetic technology require an accurate survey of the flow conditions on the prosthetic level and in the ascending zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso may have the potential to provide more information by determining the prosthetic orifice area and visualizing the zzso flow zzso We tested the feasibility to better characterize the zzso of various zzso zzso in a zzso flow phantom by using zzso 

The custom-made model consisting of a commercially available pump generating zzso flow, a tube system filled with a zzso mixture, and a zzso zzso cylinder holding the zzso and simulating the zzso zzso was located in a clinical zzso zzso zzso In this study, 10 zzso zzso zzso were investigated zzso 21, 23; zzso 19, 25; zzso 21, 23, 25; zzso zzso zzso zzso 21, zzso The prosthetic orifice area was zzso using zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso by manual zzso and compared with published zzso zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso flow mapping zzso zzso zzso was applied to analyze the zzso flow zzso 

zzso of the prosthetic orifice area and the zzso flow pattern was feasible in all zzso All orifice areas obtained by zzso in zzso were within one standard zzso of the mean of the published reference values obtained by zzso in zzso zzso flow with vortex formation occurred both in proximity to the zzso and on the zzso zzso zzso zzso prosthetic sizes led to decreased flow zzso but not zzso to less zzso 

zzso allowed for a detailed interrogation of the fluid dynamics of various heart valve zzso in a zzso flow zzso It is an attractive tool to define proprietary reference values of the orifice area under standardized conditions and provides novel information regarding the flow pattern in proximity to the zzso
