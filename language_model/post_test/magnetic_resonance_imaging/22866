To determine whether the appearance of the inner ear on zzso follow-up magnetic resonance imaging zzso with hearing status after zzso surgery for zzso zzso 

zzso chart zzso 

zzso referral medical zzso 

The study includes patients undergoing zzso surgery for zzso zzso from 1998 to zzso 

zzso evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso 

Hearing results as reported in charts was correlated with appearance of zzso labyrinth on zzso magnetic resonance images obtained at least 1 year after zzso 

zzso patients were identified, 16 of whom satisfied the inclusion zzso All 16 of the patients underwent middle zzso removal of zzso zzso zzso hearing according to American Academy of zzso and Neck Surgery criteria was preserved in eight patients zzso Of the eight patients without serviceable hearing, six had the cochlear nerve sacrificed at the time of zzso All patients with serviceable hearing had normal appearing zzso signal on zzso images, whereas six of eight patients zzso with no hearing or poor hearing had abnormal low signal in the inner ear, suggesting inner ear zzso The positive zzso value of a normal labyrinth for preserved hearing was zzso whereas the negative zzso value of an abnormal labyrinth for no hearing was zzso All but one patient who had the cochlear nerve sacrificed showed abnormal zzso of the labyrinth on zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

We describe the zzso magnetic resonance findings after zzso surgery for acoustic tumor zzso Loss of inner ear signal on zzso images zzso with loss of hearing zzso whereas preserved inner ear signal zzso with hearing preservation after middle zzso surgery for zzso zzso zzso
