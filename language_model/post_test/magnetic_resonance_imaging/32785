Recent work suggests the existence of a specialized neural system underlying social processing that may be relatively spared with age, unlike pervasive zzso decline occurring in many cognitive zzso We investigated how neural mechanisms underlying social evaluation are engaged with age, and how age-related changes to zzso goals affect recruitment of regions within this zzso In a functional zzso study, 15 young and 15 older adults formed zzso impressions of zzso They also responded to a prompt that was zzso zzso social but zzso zzso or zzso Both age groups engaged regions implicated in zzso and impression formation when making social relative to zzso evaluations, including zzso and zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso Older adults had increased zzso over young in right zzso pole when making social relative to zzso evaluations, suggesting reliance on past experiences when evaluating zzso Young adults had greater zzso than old in zzso zzso zzso when making zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso evaluations, potentially reflecting enhanced valuation of this zzso The findings demonstrate the age-related preservation of the neural zzso underlying social zzso and suggest that functioning in these regions might be zzso by age-related changes in zzso zzso
