Neonatal zzso zzso remains a major cause of chronic disability in zzso Early diagnosis and prognosis are necessary for the zzso to adapt the zzso However, there is yet no reliable test to predict the patient's zzso 

The aim of our study was to evaluate the zzso value of a personal magnetic resonance imaging zzso scoring system and of magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

We included 26 term newborns in condition of zzso brain zzso MR examination was performed during the first week of life for all patients and zzso and MRS data were zzso zzso follow-up visits were made for all zzso Finally, zzso value of the different criteria was evaluated with statistical zzso 

Our zzso scoring system proved to be linked to zzso A high zzso score, abnormal signal in the internal zzso white matter or zzso zzso abnormalities with diffusion imaging were associated with zzso zzso These results confirmed the data of the literature concerning the zzso zzso zzso Our study also confirmed zzso interest of zzso particularly, ratios using zzso were significantly linked to prognosis in our zzso zzso of the zzso of these ratios was interesting but sensibility was less zzso 

We suggest using our zzso scoring system which associates standard zzso and diffusion imaging, which is significantly related to zzso We confirm the zzso value of MRS in this pathological zzso MR with diffusion sequence and zzso performed three to four days after birth appears to be an essential tool to manage these zzso
