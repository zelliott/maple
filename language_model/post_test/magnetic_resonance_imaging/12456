Studies have shown that fat zzso follow resolution of inflammation in the spine of patients with zzso zzso zzso Fat zzso at zzso corners have also been shown to predict development of new zzso zzso scoring of fat zzso in the spine may constitute both an important measure of treatment efficacy as well as a surrogate marker for new bone zzso The aim of this study was to develop and validate a new scoring method for fat zzso in the spine, the Fat zzso zzso zzso zzso which in contrast to the existing scoring method addresses the zzso and zzso diversity of fat zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

Fat zzso at zzso anatomical locations at each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed zzso zzso on spine zzso Two readers independently evaluated zzso obtained at two time points for 58 patients zzso 1), followed by zzso of scoring methodology and reader zzso zzso the same readers read 135 pairs of zzso scans zzso 2; including the 58 pairs from exercise 1 randomly mixed with 77 new zzso 

In Exercise 2, the mean zzso baseline zzso score for the two readers was zzso and zzso respectively, and the zzso change score was zzso and zzso zzso reliability assessed as zzso correlation zzso zzso for status and change scores were excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and very good zzso zzso to zzso zzso The smallest zzso change zzso was zzso for the 135 zzso Good reliability of change scores was also observed for zzso scans conducted one year apart zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso For the 58 zzso assessed in both exercises, zzso zzso for the total zzso status score improved from very good zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in exercise 1 to excellent in exercise 2 zzso zzso to zzso and improved substantially for the total change score (from zzso zzso to zzso to zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso meets essential validation criteria for zzso of a common structural zzso in clinical trials of zzso zzso
