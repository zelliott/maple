There are many reports about complications of zzso surgery for zzso zzso We report a patient who suffered severe zzso zzso due to an indirect injury of the zzso internal carotid artery during or immediately after zzso surgery for zzso zzso An autopsy suggested that a small branch of the zzso internal carotid artery was strongly adherent to the zzso portion of the tumor capsule and its zzso from the internal carotid artery might have been caused as the capsule fell down during the zzso removal of the zzso In a case of zzso zzso operated by the zzso approach the possibility of zzso zzso due to this type of zzso injury, though rare, should be kept in zzso
