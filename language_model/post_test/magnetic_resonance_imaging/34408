The purpose of this study was to zzso bone zzso intensity patterns in zzso anemia with zzso zzso and to compare them with MR zzso findings zzso and zzso 

Twelve patients with zzso anemia and six normal volunteers were examined with a zzso T MR zzso zzso SE, fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso GE images zzso were acquired with MR images, while MR zzso was performed with a zzso echo acquisition mode without water zzso 

Three bone zzso patterns were determined in zzso anemia with MR zzso zzso a with low intensity on fast STIR and high intensity on zzso imaging and zzso zzso b with low intensity on zzso imaging and zzso and high intensity on fast zzso and zzso c with low intensity on zzso imaging and high intensity on fast STIR and zzso MR zzso zzso showed that the ratio of water to fat of zzso a significantly decreased zzso zzso and that of zzso c increased zzso zzso compared with those of zzso b zzso zzso and normal bone zzso zzso zzso There were no differences of the types of fat signals between zzso anemia and normal bone zzso with MR zzso 

MR imaging and zzso were zzso methods of zzso bone zzso patterns and zzso bone zzso content in zzso zzso which may improve the results currently obtained with zzso
