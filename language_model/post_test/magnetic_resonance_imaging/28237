This study examined whether the correlation of zzso wall zzso zzso by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso imaging with wall zzso by zzso zzso is improved by using a three-dimensional volume element model of the left zzso zzso 

Left zzso wall zzso with respect to the imaging plane causes zzso of wall thickness by zzso imaging zzso Wall thickness perpendicular to the zzso surface can be accurately calculated by three-dimensional reconstruction of left zzso wall zzso 

zzso were placed zzso in 11 dogs zzso anterior descending artery zzso with an imaging marker, visible on zzso imaging, zzso to the zzso zzso Two adjacent zzso zzso image planes were zzso segmented by four perpendicular zzso planes zzso dividing the zzso into eight volume zzso one of which contained the zzso crystal zzso Left zzso thickness and zzso were calculated by four zzso 1) linear zzso distance between zzso and zzso at zzso in the segment with the zzso 2) zzso zzso area of that segment divided by the mean of the zzso and zzso arc zzso 3) zzso zzso average of wall thicknesses calculated by the zzso method from the segment with zzso and the corresponding segment located in the adjacent zzso imaging zzso and 4) three-dimensional zzso volume of the element with the zzso divided by the mean of the zzso and zzso surface zzso

Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging with tissue tagging allows accurate zzso assessment of zzso wall zzso The three-dimensional volume element approach, by accounting for zzso between the image plane and the left zzso wall, provides the strongest correlation between zzso imaging and percent zzso wall zzso by zzso zzso
