zzso refers to knowledge and monitoring of one's own zzso zzso monitoring can be done zzso with respect to subsequent memory retrieval or zzso with respect to previous memory zzso In this study, we used zzso to compare neural activity during prospective zzso and retrospective confidence tasks in order to examine common and distinct mechanisms supporting multiple forms of zzso zzso Both zzso tasks, compared to zzso tasks, were associated with greater activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso regions, which have previously been implicated in internally directed zzso Furthermore, compared to zzso tasks, zzso tasks were associated with less activity in zzso regions, and in lateral inferior frontal and zzso zzso prefrontal regions, which have previously shown involvement in visual processing and zzso attention, zzso Thus, neural activity related to zzso is characterized by both a shift toward internally directed zzso and away from zzso directed zzso Several regions demonstrated differences in neural activity between zzso and confidence tasks, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso these regions also showed interaction effects between task and the zzso zzso rating, suggesting that they are sensitive to the information monitored in each particular zzso These findings demonstrate both common and distinct neural mechanisms supporting zzso processes and also serve to zzso the functional roles of previously characterized brain zzso
