In healthy controls, zzso zzso effects are observed with zzso dependent zzso functional zzso zzso the zzso response function zzso to the second stimulus in a pair of stimuli with short zzso zzso zzso shows a decreased zzso and an increased zzso We zzso that there may be zzso zzso abnormalities in zzso 

An zzso zzso design with paired face stimuli and varying zzso was used to measure zzso zzso in the face recognition area of patients with migraine without aura zzso and zzso Net responses to the second stimulus in a pair were calculated and averaged per zzso Several characterizing parameters of the net responses were zzso and examined within each zzso 

zzso effects were not observed in our patient zzso There are no changes in the net responses compared with the reference situation in patients, irrespective of the ISI, whereas in controls all zzso parameters are decreased or delayed for an zzso of zzso 

This is the first zzso study investigating the zzso zzso effects in zzso zzso Unlike in controls, these effects are not observed in zzso Although currently zzso it is tempting to speculate that this observation reflects the zzso correlate of lack of zzso measured with evoked zzso in zzso
