Pulmonary hypertension is a source of zzso mortality after zzso liver transplantation zzso The purpose of this study is to zzso characterize the pulmonary zzso response in zzso candidates, and zzso determine whether portal flow index zzso a magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso is a useful predictor of the pulmonary zzso zzso 

Twenty-five consecutive zzso candidates underwent right heart zzso with pressure zzso at baseline and after infusion of 1 L of zzso zzso chest zzso zzso and zzso were also performed as routine screening zzso Sixteen patients in intensive care unit with normal liver function served as zzso 

After volume infusion, pulmonary hypertension zzso pulmonary artery pressure greater than 25 zzso zzso developed in 9 of 25 zzso candidates with zzso in both pulmonary zzso wedge and mean pulmonary zzso In contrast, 0 of 16 controls experienced pulmonary hypertension zzso zzso zzso Although routine zzso did not predict this zzso response, zzso had a zzso specificity and zzso zzso 

zzso candidates exhibit zzso pulmonary hypertension with responses suggestive of left zzso zzso The significance of this observation is unknown, but the zzso zzso zzso may serve as a screening technique to limit zzso to a select group of zzso zzso
