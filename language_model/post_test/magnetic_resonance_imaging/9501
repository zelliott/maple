zzso is a significant risk factor for zzso involving altered cell zzso central zzso and peripheral zzso zzso Though changes in zzso cartilage contact pressure are known, changes in zzso mechanical parameters within zzso cartilage are not well zzso Recent imaging research has revealed the effects of zzso on the zzso deformation of zzso loaded zzso zzso To determine zzso cartilage mechanics that zzso observed zzso a novel finite element modeling approach using imaging data and a zzso zzso boundary condition was zzso The zzso method reproduces observed zzso surface deformation and avoids assumptions about zzso zzso zzso of results from an zzso model with a traditional zzso model verified the method, giving errors in zzso solid and fluid stress, and strain below zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the absolute maximum of the parameters of zzso zzso finite element models using real joint image data showed increased fluid pressure, fluid zzso loss of fluid load support, and increased zzso strains centrally on the zzso zzso after zzso corresponding to clinical observations of cartilage zzso damage and zzso zzso there was decreased consolidation, which zzso to reduced contact and fluid pressure in this zzso zzso these areas have exhibited advance of the zzso growth front, biological destruction of the cartilage zzso cartilage zzso and eventual replacement of the cartilage via zzso zzso zzso the changes in cartilage mechanics with zzso and correspondence with observed zzso effects may help zzso the zzso of zzso degradation seen in zzso
