This study contrasts zzso zzso and response selection signals in the right zzso junction zzso with functional magnetic resonance zzso The overall goal was to investigate whether spatial zzso signals and motor signals zzso or were independent in zzso The right zzso showed a greater response to targets at zzso rather than zzso cued locations, but no significant zzso from the zzso used to zzso We suggest that zzso may work as a zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso attention system, directing attention to salient events and enabling a variety of responses to those zzso
