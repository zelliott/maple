Brain imaging studies in zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso have shown that zzso short-term memory tasks depend on zzso zzso zzso Knowing the zzso dynamics of this network would provide further understanding of the neural bases of the zzso zzso We combined zzso zzso with zzso and zzso techniques to study this network in a task, in which participants had to judge the symmetry in position of two dots, presented either simultaneously zzso zzso or successively zzso of a first dot and zzso zzso after 3 zzso with a second zzso With zzso larger zzso was observed in the zzso zzso component zzso zzso in the immediate and zzso zzso than in zzso condition, where topography at this time was more anterior and right zzso zzso provided a more accurate zzso and zzso variations of sources, revealing a strong zzso component at 450 zzso in the zzso condition, with two sources localized in zzso and right zzso zzso These zzso are consistent with both zzso zzso and zzso cortical current source zzso zzso but only zzso revealed the strong increase in zzso region at 450 zzso related to zzso These combined results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso zzso components reflect two different dynamics in zzso zzso the zzso zzso indexes a decision mechanism during the immediate and zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso with a larger right zzso source, reflects the zzso process in zzso short-term zzso
