The present study examined the effects of a selective zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cell survival and post-traumatic recovery in rats following a lateral fluid zzso brain zzso Daily treatment of AG at the dosage of 100 zzso or normal saline was given zzso into rats starting 2 h before or 30 zzso after brain zzso Treatment with AG significantly reduced zzso volumes in the brains of rats after injury, as evaluated by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso analysis showed a marked induction of zzso expression in brain zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso were observed in the zzso cerebral zzso by in zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In rats receiving zzso or zzso treatment of zzso the number of zzso zzso was markedly reduced in the zzso compared to those receiving saline zzso The location and extent of these zzso changes correlated with zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso performance, zzso score, total and ambulatory locomotor responses and acoustic startle response were reduced in rats subjected to the injury but were significantly improved in zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso of zzso by AG may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of traumatic brain zzso
