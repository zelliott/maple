To study the possible application of zzso zzso zzso in specific MR imaging of brain zzso both components of these zzso were tested for their ability to penetrate the zzso during conditions of local zzso barrier zzso zzso The passage of zzso particles zzso across a disrupted zzso barrier was studied in a freezing zzso model using electron zzso zzso and MR zzso One hour after zzso injection, focal zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells within the freezing zzso was shown by zzso In parallel with this, MR imaging indicated a strong contrast enhancement in the zzso zzso observations showed that the particles were still present in the zzso cells four and eight hours after zzso The passage of an zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso zzso across the zzso of zzso zzso human zzso was studied using zzso zzso It was found that passage across zzso cell occurred in the tumor within four hours after zzso
