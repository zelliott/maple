We determined the positive zzso value zzso for zzso in complex zzso zzso with focal zzso enhancement seen on magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

A surgical database was reviewed to identify all patients having both a zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and a radical or partial zzso from January 2000 through April 2004 at our zzso A group of 21 patients were identified with focal zzso enhancement within zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation was made in each zzso 

We performed zzso zzso during the study zzso Of these patients, 159 zzso had a zzso zzso zzso There were 21 of 159 zzso patients with complex zzso zzso that displayed focal zzso enhancement, 14 of which zzso measured 10 zzso or larger in zzso Twenty zzso of the 21 zzso were zzso cell zzso The single, benign zzso was a zzso zzso zzso grade 1 or grade 2 zzso were found in the majority of patients zzso and there were no grade 4 zzso Fifteen patients had a zzso computerized zzso zzso scan as well and zzso enhancement was suspected in only 4 patients zzso zzso findings upgraded these zzso in 11 patients zzso 

The demonstration of solid enhancing zzso components with high-resolution zzso zzso provides excellent positive zzso value for diagnosing zzso zzso zzso zzso including a large percentage 10 zzso or larger in zzso Our experience suggests a zzso likelihood that zzso zzso zzso with focal zzso enhancement are zzso We recommend that such zzso be considered zzso
