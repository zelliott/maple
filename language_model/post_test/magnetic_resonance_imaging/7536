To compare accuracy and zzso agreement between zzso with limited experience in the evaluation of abdominal zzso zzso and zzso with longer MR reading experience zzso in reading zzso in patients with suspected zzso 

MR imaging was performed in 223 adult patients with suspected zzso and read independently by two members of a team of eight zzso zzso who were trained with 100 MR examinations previous to this study zzso zzso Expert reading was performed by two zzso with a larger abdominal MR experience zzso zzso in zzso A final diagnosis was assigned after three months based on all available information, except zzso zzso We estimated zzso sensitivity and specificity for zzso and for all urgent diagnoses zzso zzso agreement was evaluated using zzso zzso 

zzso diagnoses were assigned to 147 of 223 zzso 117 had zzso zzso for zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso in zzso reading zzso zzso was zzso for zzso versus zzso for zzso reading zzso zzso and zzso agreed on zzso in zzso of cases zzso zzso zzso in detecting urgent diagnoses was significantly lower in zzso compared to zzso reading: sensitivity zzso versus zzso zzso and specificity zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso on urgent diagnoses was zzso zzso zzso 

zzso have sufficient sensitivity in reading zzso in patients with suspected zzso with good agreement with zzso reading, but accuracy of zzso reading was zzso
