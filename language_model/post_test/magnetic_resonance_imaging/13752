Recent work has suggested an association between the zzso zzso in humans and practical decision zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the profile of cognitive deficits, with particular emphasis on decision-making zzso following damage to different sectors of the human prefrontal zzso Patients with discrete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and large frontal zzso zzso were compared with matched controls on three different decision-making tasks: the Iowa zzso Task and two recently developed tasks that attempt to zzso some of the cognitive components of the Iowa zzso A comprehensive battery including the assessment of recognition memory, working memory, planning ability and zzso zzso was also zzso zzso combined frontal patients were impaired on several of the tasks zzso distinct profiles emerged for each patient zzso In contrast to previous data, patients with focal zzso zzso performed at control levels on the three decision-making tasks (and the executive zzso but showed some evidence of prolonged zzso DL patients showed pronounced impairment on working memory, planning, zzso shifting and the Iowa zzso zzso zzso patients were impaired at the Iowa zzso Task and also at zzso The Large group displayed diffuse zzso but were the only group to exhibit risky decision zzso zzso differences from previous studies of zzso patient groups are discussed, with particular attention to zzso zzso zzso size and psychiatric zzso zzso and zzso aspects of prefrontal zzso must interact in the maintenance of rational and zzso decision zzso
