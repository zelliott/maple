In recovered zzso stroke, the pattern of motor network zzso during motor execution can appear normal or not, depending on the zzso Whether this applies to other aspects of motor function is zzso We used functional zzso to assess motor imagery zzso a promising new approach to improve motor function after stroke, and contrasted it to motor zzso 

Twenty zzso patients with zzso zzso stroke zzso zzso mean age, zzso zzso and 17 zzso control subjects were zzso zzso behavioral screening excluded 8 patients and 4 control subjects due to impaired zzso zzso zzso performed zzso and motor execution of a paced zzso opposition sequence using a functional zzso paradigm that monitored zzso zzso within the primary motor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and supplementary motor areas was zzso 

The pattern of zzso during zzso motor execution was not different from control zzso zzso zzso zzso was also largely similar to control subjects, including involvement of zzso but with important zzso zzso unlike control subjects and the zzso hand, zzso in zzso and zzso zzso was not lower during zzso as compared with motor execution; zzso the zzso balance of zzso zzso was significantly less zzso than control zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso positively correlated with motor zzso 

In zzso zzso stroke, the motor system, including zzso zzso is activated during zzso despite the zzso It, however, remains zzso in proportion to residual motor zzso Thus, components of movement upstream from execution appear zzso affected after stroke and could be targeted by rehabilitation in more severely affected zzso
