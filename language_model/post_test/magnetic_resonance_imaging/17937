To evaluate the relationship between multiple MR zzso parameters and symptoms of patients with zzso zzso after zzso laser zzso 

MR zzso studies of 20 patients diagnosed with an zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso laser therapy, were zzso zzso Multiple zzso parameters correlated with the treatment outcome and the presence of zzso zzso zzso 

There were 16 successful treatments, 6 zzso and a significant difference in the zzso parameters of these groups zzso Patients with successful treatment demonstrated delayed progressive enhancement or no enhancement zzso time to zzso mean delay to the zzso zzso Patients with treatment failure demonstrated an early and steep enhancement zzso time to zzso and mean delay to the zzso zzso zzso volume and transfer constant values significantly changed after successful treatment zzso MR zzso has a sensitivity and a specificity higher than zzso in the detection of zzso zzso zzso 

The identification of an early and steep enhancement with short time to peak and a short delay between the zzso and zzso zzso on MR zzso in the zzso setting is highly indicative of an zzso zzso zzso Key points zzso zzso resonance zzso is becoming widely used for several zzso zzso MR zzso zzso correlate well with zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso has high diagnostic performance for zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso can improve the diagnostic confidence of zzso zzso zzso
