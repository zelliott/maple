While zzso has described certain zzso changes in bone zzso in patients after anterior cervical zzso and fusion zzso no study has evaluated specific zzso signal changes in the fusion mass zzso and zzso The goal of the present study was to zzso evaluate zzso changes in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in the evaluation of seven zzso zzso zzso were obtained in a zzso zzso GE zzso immediately zzso and at 1, 3, and 6 months in most zzso All patients received at least three sequential zzso Two patients had greater than one level zzso zzso and zzso images were evaluated in all patients at each available zzso zzso images were not found to be helpful secondary to a prohibitive amount of zzso For single level fusion masses, zzso images showed a very intense homogeneous graft signal in the immediate zzso period which decreased slightly at 1 zzso At 3 months the signal intensity of the graft was similar to the 1 month image, but was slightly less zzso At 6 months, the zzso signal had greatly decreased in much of the zzso Immediate zzso specimens showed zzso high signal on zzso images which increased at 1 month in the whole zzso and then seemed to increase at the zzso while decreasing in the graft at 3 zzso At 6 months the graft was becoming difficult to delineate on zzso images in many zzso The two and three level zzso had a more zzso image progression without clear evidence of solid fusion at 6 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
