We investigated the brain zzso of word repetition effects on the implicit memory task using zzso electromagnetic zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and individual zzso as a realistic head zzso Thirteen zzso healthy subjects performed a zzso discrimination task, in which the words and zzso were presented zzso and some of the words appeared twice with a lag of one or five zzso All of the subjects exhibited word repetition effects with respect to the behavioral data, in which a faster reaction time was observed to the repeated word zzso zzso than to the first presentation of the word (new zzso The old words zzso more zzso zzso than the new words, beginning at 200 zzso and lasting until 500 zzso zzso We conducted source reconstruction using zzso at a zzso of 400 zzso with the peak mean global field zzso and used statistical zzso mapping for the statistical zzso We found that the source zzso by the old words exhibited a statistically significant current density reduction in the left inferior frontal zzso This is the first study to investigate the generators of word repetition effects using zzso statistical mapping of the current density with individual zzso and zzso zzso
