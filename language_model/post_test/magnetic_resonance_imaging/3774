This study investigates zzso zzso zzso content changes in early zzso zzso and whether zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of cartilage in zzso may identify early event of zzso zzso 

zzso plugs from patients with hip zzso or zzso neck fracture zzso zzso were collected and zzso by zzso T zzso with zzso as a measure of cartilage contrast zzso zzso zzso contents of zzso cartilage zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined and zzso grading was zzso 

zzso content correlated to zzso although no difference in either of these parameters was zzso between zzso and reference cartilage at 4 h of contrast zzso In contrast, zzso analysis of other cartilage zzso constituents showed distinct zzso typical for early cartilage degradation in zzso cartilage and with clear evidence for increased zzso zzso 

In the present in zzso study, cartilage zzso content could not distinguish between early zzso cartilage and reference zzso Given, that delayed zzso enhanced zzso of cartilage zzso indicates early events in the zzso of zzso in zzso our results from the in zzso studies imply other, additional factors than cartilage zzso content, zzso zzso in diffusion or increased supply of contrast agent in the diseased zzso zzso an altered zzso reflects later stages of zzso when zzso content zzso Further investigations are warranted, to understand variations in zzso content in pathology, an essential background for interpreting zzso zzso
