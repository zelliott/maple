This report illustrates the contrast enhancement characteristics on MR imaging of three patients with zzso zzso and provides an explanation for the observed imaging zzso 

A differential pattern of enhancement, consisting of intense enhancement of the peripheral margin of the abnormal zzso was present in all zzso In two patients, much of the remaining abnormal zzso did not enhance at zzso On the basis of the microscopic pathology of zzso zzso the physiology of normal zzso enhancement on MR imaging, and the described MR appearance of other zzso zzso this differential pattern of enhancement should strongly suggest the diagnosis of zzso zzso
