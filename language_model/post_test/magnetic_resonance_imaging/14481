Most men have a zzso pattern of zzso and zzso sexual zzso responding much more strongly to erotic stimuli depicting their preferred sex than to erotic stimuli depicting their zzso zzso In contrast, women tend to have a less specific zzso zzso To better understand this sex difference, we used zzso to explore its neural zzso zzso and homosexual women viewed erotic photographs of either men or zzso zzso neural activity was monitored via zzso and compared with responses to the same stimuli in zzso and homosexual zzso Overall, a network of zzso (as well as the anterior zzso and visual processing regions showed significantly less zzso activity in women than zzso This was primarily driven by weaker overall zzso to zzso stimuli in women, though there was also some evidence of stronger zzso zzso to zzso stimuli in zzso zzso results were similar for zzso and homosexual zzso Women did show some evidence of zzso responses in the visual processing regions, although even in these regions they exhibited less differential activity than zzso In the anterior cingulate, a region with high zzso of zzso zzso zzso and neural category specificity measures correlated positively for women but zzso for men, suggesting a possible sex difference in the role of the anterior zzso Overall, results suggest that men tend to show more differentiated neural responses than do women to erotic photographs of one sex compared to the other sex, though women may not be entirely indifferent to which sex is zzso
