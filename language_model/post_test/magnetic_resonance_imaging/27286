The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of zzso visual functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in very zzso zzso 

zzso infants born at less than 32 weeks zzso age zzso zzso 22 zzso mean zzso age at birth zzso zzso zzso were scanned using zzso T zzso as part of a zzso zzso zzso These infants were scanned at zzso age zzso 2 zzso of zzso and at zzso zzso zzso zzso data and zzso in response to visual stimuli zzso zzso were acquired in this zzso zzso values were compared at zzso age and at zzso age using a zzso zzso A general linear model was used to evaluate zzso lobe response to visual zzso 

zzso values were significantly higher at zzso age than at zzso age in both the zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso term zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso lobe zzso zzso was found in 3 out of 65 zzso zzso carried out at zzso age and in 19 out of 26 zzso scans carried out at zzso zzso 

Visual stimuli do not elicit a reliable blood oxygen zzso zzso response in very zzso infants during the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso may not be the appropriate zzso for investigating zzso lobe function in very zzso zzso
