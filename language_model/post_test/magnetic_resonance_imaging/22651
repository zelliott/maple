To study behavioral and brain responses to variations in zzso ratio zzso of cognitive visual zzso 

We presented meaningful words zzso embedded in varying amounts of dynamic noise, and zzso zzso zzso to measure responses to the zzso A zzso model of the evoked fields was constructed to zzso the strengths and zzso of the zzso sources at each noise zzso The recognition rates of the words were measured in separate behavioral zzso 

zzso revealed sequential zzso of zzso and zzso areas zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by activity in superior zzso zzso zzso zzso The strengths and zzso of all identified sources followed functions similar to the zzso of the zzso The peak zzso and shortest zzso of all sources coincided with the maximum zzso of the zzso The zzso and zzso sources as well as the word recognition rate accurately followed the zzso of the stimulus whereas the early zzso source exhibited a more peaked dependence on the zzso 

zzso responses zzso peaked at the maximum zzso of the zzso Interestingly, early visual responses showed sharper zzso than zzso sources as a function of the noise zzso This can be understood as the zzso processes analyzing the stimuli more zzso and thus being less sensitive to the zzso of simple visual zzso The similar zzso of the zzso sources and the recognition rate provides new evidence for the relevance of these zzso in the recognition of written zzso 

This study contributes to the understanding of brain activity evoked by zzso stimuli with cognitive zzso
