It is important to know whether a zzso zzso zzso is in the superficial or deep lobe for zzso zzso We aimed to investigate the ability of zzso T magnetic resonance zzso imaging with surface coils to identify the zzso facial nerve and locate zzso zzso zzso in comparison to other indirect landmark zzso 

We zzso evaluated 50 consecutive patients with primary zzso zzso zzso The position of the facial nerve was determined by tracing the nerve in the zzso zzso and then following it on sequential MR sections through the zzso zzso The zzso vein and the facial nerve line zzso line) were also zzso For each zzso and each method, we determined the diagnostic ability for deep lobe zzso and superficial lobe zzso as well as zzso These abilities were compared among the three methods using the zzso test with zzso zzso 

Mean diagnostic ability for deep lobe zzso the diagnostic ability for superficial lobe zzso and accuracy were zzso zzso zzso respectively, for the direct identification zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, for the zzso vein zzso and zzso zzso zzso , respectively, for the zzso line zzso The direct identification method had significantly higher diagnostic ability for deep zzso than the zzso line method zzso but significantly lower diagnostic ability for superficial lobe zzso than the zzso line method zzso 

zzso identification of the zzso facial nerve enables zzso zzso zzso to be correctly located, particularly those in the deep zzso
