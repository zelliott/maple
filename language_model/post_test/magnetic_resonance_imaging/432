To evaluate the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso zzso in the assessment of zzso zzso zzso in a head-to-head comparison with abnormal zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso studies in patients with predominantly known coronary artery disease zzso 

zzso patients zzso age 65 zzso 10 zzso with zzso zzso zzso defects on zzso images during zzso zzso were recruited for study zzso Within 5 days of the zzso study, zzso zzso was studied again with zzso during zzso stimulation and at zzso Overall, zzso identified 30 zzso regional zzso zzso The sensitivity to detect zzso segments was zzso zzso with the zzso zzso analysis with zzso as zzso When patients were zzso according to the extent of regional zzso zzso defects on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 8) zzso defects were also identified by zzso zzso analysis in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso stress zzso imaging may not identify up to zzso of zzso zzso defects in a group of zzso patients with predominantly known zzso and abnormal zzso zzso
