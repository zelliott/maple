Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we recently demonstrated that zzso patients with a first episode of zzso major depression zzso compared to matched controls exhibited an abnormal neural filtering of irrelevant visual information zzso et zzso zzso During zzso subjects performed a visual attention task imposing two different levels of zzso load at fixation zzso or zzso while zzso colored stimuli were presented in the zzso In the present study, we focused on the zzso system and used zzso zzso zzso zzso on the same zzso to assess how attention influences a network of three zzso brain regions zzso areas zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients and healthy zzso zzso model selection zzso and model space zzso zzso were used to determine the best model in each zzso The best model for the controls revealed that the increase of zzso activity by high attention load was selectively associated with a negative zzso of P on zzso consistent with high attention reducing the processing of irrelevant colored peripheral zzso The best model accounting for the data from the zzso patients showed that both low and high attention levels exerted zzso effects on zzso The present results document abnormal effective connectivity across zzso networks in zzso which likely contributes to deficient zzso filtering of zzso
