zzso partial zzso zzso results from coding sequence zzso either in zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso or in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso form is called zzso zzso zzso and the zzso form is called zzso zzso zzso 

Our objective was to investigate whether the clinical zzso of this zzso is due to zzso in zzso 

This is a case zzso Patient and zzso A zzso female with the clinical zzso of zzso zzso zzso and early childhood diabetes with extreme insulin resistance and zzso leading to zzso zzso was assessed at an academic medical zzso 

The zzso was zzso for a novel zzso zzso in the zzso gene that led to the substitution of zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso located in the zinc finger structure involved in DNA zzso by zzso zzso The zzso was absent from the zzso of 100 healthy zzso In zzso analysis of the zzso protein showed that zzso (and zzso in zzso zzso could not bind to DNA and had no zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso had no zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso in zzso zzso its DNA binding activity and through zzso leads to clinical manifestation of zzso and the associated zzso zzso
