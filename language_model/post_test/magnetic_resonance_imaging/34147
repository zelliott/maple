This study was undertaken to correlate functional recovery from zzso after acute stroke with the zzso evolution of the zzso zzso and functional changes as measured by zzso 

Blood zzso zzso contrast and zzso zzso were used to map language comprehension in 6 normal adults and in 2 adult patients during recovery from acute stroke presenting with zzso zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso zzso were used to follow zzso and structural zzso 

The normal zzso pattern for language comprehension showed zzso predominately in zzso zzso and zzso areas, with zzso ratios of zzso and zzso zzso Recovery of the patient confirmed as having a completed stroke affecting zzso area occurred rapidly with a shift of zzso to the zzso region in the right zzso within 3 days, with continued rightward zzso over 6 zzso In the second patient, in whom mapping was performed zzso before stroke, recovery of a zzso zzso showed a similar increasing rightward shift in zzso recruitment over 9 months after the zzso 

Recovery of zzso in adults can occur rapidly and is zzso with an zzso pattern that changes from left to a zzso right zzso zzso Such recovery occurs even when the stroke zzso to zzso Such plasticity must be considered when evaluating stroke interventions based on behavioral and neurological zzso
