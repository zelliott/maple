It is known that low intensity magnetic fields increase zzso zzso production during the respiratory burst of rat zzso zzso in zzso We investigated whether the high intensity magnetic fields zzso zzso during magnetic resonance imaging can influence the human zzso function under in zzso zzso Blood samples were obtained from 12 patients immediately before and after magnetic resonance imaging zzso time zzso zzso The induced respiratory burst was investigated by the zzso zzso transformation of zzso 123 to the fluorescent dye zzso 123 via flow zzso The respiratory burst was induced either with zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso or zzso with tumor necrosis factor followed by zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the respiratory burst before and after magnetic resonance imaging, irrespective of the stimulating zzso Short time exposure to a high intensity magnetic field during magnetic resonance imaging seems not to influence the production of radical species in living zzso
