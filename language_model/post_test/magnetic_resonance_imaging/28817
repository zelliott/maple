A new technique for the evaluation of bone zzso using magnetic resonance zzso phase images has been recently zzso This technique zzso the phase zzso in a region of interest zzso on the phase images of a zzso echo zzso In this study, a computer program was developed which simulates the phase distribution in zzso echo acquired phase images of a structure that mimics zzso bone, consisting of a three-dimensional connected network of zzso bone zzso Several tests were performed in order to assess the influence of imaging parameters such as the echo time, the zzso size and the slice zzso on phase zzso The results from this work show that with selection of appropriate imaging zzso phase zzso strongly reflects variations in zzso bone zzso Representative MR experiments were performed in the zzso radius to verify the simulation zzso
