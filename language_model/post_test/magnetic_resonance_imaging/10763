It is well established that the zzso potential of the developing human brain is superior to that of the adult brain, but whether zzso differences exist already in the prenatal and zzso period is not zzso We have studied zzso reorganization in 34 patients with zzso zzso (age range, zzso zzso using zzso magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging during simple hand zzso zzso zzso were brain zzso zzso and second zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), zzso brain zzso zzso third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and middle cerebral artery zzso zzso third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of this zzso eight patients with zzso and all patients with zzso zzso have been published zzso In all three groups of zzso zzso magnetic stimulation identified patients in whom the zzso hand was controlled via zzso zzso projections from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In these patients, the motor dysfunction of the zzso hand correlated significantly with the timing period of the underlying brain zzso This demonstrates that the efficacy of reorganization with zzso zzso tracts indeed decreases during zzso
