zzso magnetic zzso zzso investigation was performed on zzso samples of patients with neurological inflammatory diseases including 52 cases of multiple sclerosis zzso 12 acute idiopathic zzso 20 acute zzso (10 viral and 10 zzso zzso were compared with those acquired in 18 neurological zzso High zzso zzso levels were found in zzso patients during clinical zzso of zzso course zzso zzso zzso vs neurological zzso In zzso patients with zzso evidence of zzso plaques zzso zzso was higher than in patients with zzso inactive plaques zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with number of zzso zzso cells in zzso patients with clinical activity zzso zzso zzso as well as in zzso patients with zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso A comparative zzso investigation in zzso on localized zzso areas confirmed an elevated zzso signal in zzso zzso more frequently than in zzso zzso plaques zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with high zzso signal in active plaques showed high zzso levels in zzso Increased zzso zzso was found also in patients with acute meningitis and idiopathic zzso These data suggest that changes in zzso levels may depend on zzso zzso metabolism in activated zzso during inflammatory zzso A decrease of zzso formulate levels was found in zzso patients during active and inactive clinical phase zzso zzso zzso zzso vs neurological controls zzso zzso changes might be related to a disorder of zzso cycle in zzso zzso in zzso showed significant increase of zzso in acute zzso whereas a decrease of zzso zzso was found in chronic zzso these zzso are zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels were lower in bacterial than in viral meningitis zzso zzso zzso and in neurological controls zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso may be able to detect zzso zzso impairment in neurological inflammatory zzso In zzso some zzso findings reflect zzso changes occurring in brain zzso areas, and they could be useful foe evaluation of disease activity in different stages of disease zzso
