The purpose of our study is to describe shifting bone zzso zzso in the knee as the MR imaging feature of zzso regional migratory osteoporosis of the zzso 

Five men, aged zzso years, were referred by orthopedic surgeons for MR imaging evaluation of knee pain, which had been present for 2 weeks to 6 zzso One patient had a prior history of blunt zzso None had risk factors for zzso Four patients had two MR examinations and the patient with prior blunt trauma had zzso Plain zzso were obtained in all zzso 

In all cases, a large area of zzso zzso initially involved a zzso zzso with migration of the bone zzso zzso to the other zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso occurring over a zzso to zzso zzso zzso soft tissue zzso was present in all five patients, while none had a joint zzso zzso of two patients showed generalized zzso 

In the absence of acute trauma or clinical suspicion of infection, a large area of bone zzso zzso without a zone of zzso may represent zzso regional migratory zzso zzso of shifting bone zzso zzso on follow-up examinations suggests this zzso
