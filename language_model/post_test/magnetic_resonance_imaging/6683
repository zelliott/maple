It is now possible to combine continuous recording of the zzso and continuous functional zzso zzso This makes it possible to determine the regions of the brain showing changes in the zzso signal in response to zzso spikes occurring in the zzso This article reviews the experience with this method in more than 100 studies performed over the last 4 years at the Montreal Neurological zzso The technique is complex, and the authors review the various issues related to obtaining a zzso zzso in the hostile environment of the magnetic resonance zzso the statistical analysis of magnetic resonance images, in particular the issue of knowing what is the zzso response function appropriate for the analysis of zzso zzso and the combination of zzso and zzso zzso The difficult theoretical issues raised by the interpretation of zzso and zzso both frequently seen in response to zzso are zzso Finally, the authors give examples of zzso responses seen with focal spikes and with generalized spike and wave zzso
