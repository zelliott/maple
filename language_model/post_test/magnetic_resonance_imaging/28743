Minimum norm zzso for zzso source reconstruction are studied in view of their spatial resolution, zzso and zzso zzso properties, and their zzso zzso Two classes of minimum norm solutions are zzso linear least squares methods and zzso zzso zzso Two special cases of linear zzso the well known Minimum Norm zzso zzso and an zzso with zzso zzso constraints, are compared to two zzso zzso zzso sparse and standard zzso zzso In a zzso zzso two of the methods allow automatic determination of the optimum zzso zzso zzso methods for the different depth zzso of all approaches by zzso zzso are zzso zzso with zzso and zzso oriented test zzso at two different noise levels are performed to reveal and compare the properties of all zzso Finally, zzso constrained versions of the zzso are applied to two zzso spike data sets and compared to results of single equivalent zzso fits and zzso source zzso
