The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical application of imaging technology in the quantitative assessment of fatty liver with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso MR zzso 

zzso 36 patients with diffuse fatty liver who had undertaken the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso zzso zzso were zzso Their body mass index zzso was measured and their liver to zzso CT ratio zzso calculated on the plain CT zzso MR zzso imaging zzso was obtained with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso was acquired with or without the zzso zzso The liver fat content zzso was zzso as the percentage of relative signal intensity loss on zzso or zzso zzso The zzso content of zzso zzso was expressed as the percentage of peak value ratio of zzso to water by zzso zzso 

The results of zzso zzso CT zzso ratio, zzso calculated from MR zzso and zzso images, as well as zzso measured by zzso MRS were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso calculated from MR zzso zzso images and zzso measured by zzso MRS correlated significantly with the CT zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated significantly only with the liver fat contents measured by zzso zzso and zzso MRS zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso 

CT, MR imaging and zzso MRS were effective methods for the quantitative assessment of zzso The MR imaging, especially zzso zzso would be used more frequently in the clinical evaluation of fatty liver and zzso MRS could more accurately reflect the severity of fatty zzso
