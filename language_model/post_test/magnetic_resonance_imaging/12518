Brain zzso surface registration is required for zzso studies of functional and anatomical zzso zzso mapping has been applied for brain zzso due to its existence, uniqueness, zzso and zzso zzso In order to improve the registration zzso zzso landmarks are usually used as constraints for brain zzso Unfortunately, constrained harmonic zzso may not be zzso and produces invalid zzso This work zzso this problem by changing the zzso metric on the target cortical surface o a zzso zzso so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a zzso while the landmark constraints are enforced as boundary matching zzso The zzso zzso are based on the zzso flow method and zzso heat zzso Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the zzso zzso the registrations are always zzso with higher qualities in terms of landmark zzso zzso matching, area distortion and overlapping of region of zzso
