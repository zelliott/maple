zzso with zzso zzso due to either an zzso or multiple sclerosis zzso underwent two types of zzso testing zzso testing and zzso zzso for three types of sounds zzso and high and low frequency zzso zzso with two kinds of zzso differences zzso and zzso Two major types of abnormalities were revealed in the zzso performances: perception of all zzso regardless of zzso differences zzso and/or zzso in the center of the head zzso or zzso of all stimuli to one side or the other of the head zzso Similar patterns of abnormal zzso zzso and zzso occurred for zzso and stroke zzso A zzso pattern of abnormal zzso testing was the same regardless of the type of stimulus or type of zzso zzso zzso testing was a more sensitive test than zzso discrimination testing for both types of zzso zzso resonance image zzso scanning in three zzso planes of the zzso was used to detect zzso A zzso zzso superimposed the auditory zzso onto each zzso zzso Whenever a zzso overlapped the auditory pathway, some zzso performance was abnormal and vice zzso Given a zzso test zzso whether the pattern was zzso or zzso was mainly determined by zzso zzso zzso performance was principally associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso performance with zzso zzso to the superior zzso zzso For zzso restricted to the lateral zzso and/or inferior zzso whether unilateral or zzso just noticeable differences zzso were nearly always zzso but for zzso zzso zzso zzso could be normal or zzso zzso subjects were more sensitive to zzso time delays than zzso level differences particularly for zzso zzso zzso while stroke patients showed no differential sensitivity to the two kinds of zzso zzso These results suggest that neural processing of zzso stimuli is zzso and begins with independent zzso time and level zzso in the zzso zzso
