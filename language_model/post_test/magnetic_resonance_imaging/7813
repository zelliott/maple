In the present work, we demonstrate a method for concurrent collection of zzso zzso In our setup, zzso data are collected using a zzso zzso sensor zzso The zzso amplifier itself is contained in a field isolation zzso system zzso and zzso clock signals are synchronized with zzso data collection for subsequent MR artifact characterization and zzso We demonstrate this method first for resting state data zzso zzso we demonstrate a protocol for zzso data recording, while subjects listen to a tape asking them to zzso that their left hand is immersed in a zzso bath and referred to, here, as the cold glove zzso zzso differentials between each hand are measured throughout zzso data collection using an MR compatible temperature sensor that we developed for this zzso We collect cold glove zzso data along with simultaneous differential hand temperature zzso both before and after hypnotic zzso Between zzso and post sessions, single zzso zzso data are collected during the hypnotic induction and depth assessment zzso Our representative results demonstrate that significant changes in the zzso power spectrum can be measured during hypnotic zzso and that hand temperature changes during the cold glove paradigm can be detected rapidly using our MR compatible differential zzso zzso
