To compare the ability of two different zzso units and conventional zzso zzso to identify bone zzso in zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso and wrist zzso with CT scanning as the standard reference zzso 

20 patients with zzso and 5 controls underwent zzso CT and two zzso examinations zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of one hand during a zzso zzso In all zzso each bone of the wrist and zzso zzso was blindly evaluated for zzso zzso images were also assessed for the proportion of each bone being zzso 

550 bones were zzso CT, zzso zzso and zzso detected zzso zzso 55 and 45 bones with zzso zzso The majority were located in the zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso for detecting zzso was higher than that of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for detecting zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso The zzso allowed zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso diameter of the zzso In the zzso zzso of bones were zzso entirely and zzso of bones were zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of bones were zzso entirely and zzso of bones were zzso zzso 

With CT as the reference method for detecting zzso in zzso hands, the zzso showed higher sensitivity than the zzso and zzso All imaging zzso had high zzso The better performance of the zzso should be considered when selecting an imaging method in zzso
