It would be beneficial to establish pulmonary zzso as a complementary approach to CT for direct zzso of mosaic zzso zzso and zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

The purpose of this study was to compare both zzso CT and zzso using the zzso score with a special focus on reliable detection of a mosaic zzso 

Out of 51 patients examined by zzso on a zzso system during a period of 2 years, 19 patients were scheduled for additional zzso CT in a clinical zzso The zzso protocol comprised a zzso echo zzso sequence with a very short echo time zzso zzso zzso zzso in inspiration and zzso a 3-D zzso sequence in breath hold, and a fast spin echo sequence with zzso and zzso zzso zzso was carried out in inspiration and adapted to body weight using 100 or 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso slice zzso as well as low and high zzso zzso incremental slices in 3 positions were recorded in expiration for distinct detection of air zzso CT and zzso analyses were performed by two zzso readers in consensus unaware of the clinical zzso The zzso score of both examinations was zzso Mean difference and accordance were assessed in each zzso 

There was a strong correlation between CT and zzso (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso The mean zzso score for CT was zzso zzso zzso and for zzso it was zzso zzso zzso The mean difference was zzso zzso Besides this strong correlation for findings zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a prolonged zzso TE in zzso we could also state a qualitative agreement of zzso in the categories with short zzso and low signal intensity in zzso as zzso zzso and mosaic zzso 

These results suggest that in our patient group none of the relevant findings were missed by MR imaging and zzso
