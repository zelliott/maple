This study shows that by combining a zzso filtered zzso transfer zzso with an zzso TE zzso zzso that it is possible to obtain contrast between tissue compartments based on the following zzso zzso the residual zzso zzso interaction within the zzso which depends on their structure, zzso residual zzso interactions within water zzso and zzso the zzso exchange rate between zzso and zzso The technique is demonstrated in zzso zzso where the zzso tissue such as zzso and the zzso zzso of the disc are highlighted in these images, and their zzso properties along with those of bones and muscles can be zzso zzso zzso zzso also holds promise because zzso zzso that are typically invisible in conventional zzso experiments produce significant signal zzso using this zzso
