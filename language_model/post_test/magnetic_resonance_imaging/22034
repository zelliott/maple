zzso ratios in magnetic resonance imaging are crucial in determining image quality, and dependent on a number of factors, one being the signal bandwidth per zzso Not all manufacturers clearly state the bandwidth per zzso used for all zzso A small zzso portable device is described which produces bright sharp lines on the magnetic resonance image at 10 zzso intervals in the frequency zzso zzso The bandwidth per zzso can then easily be calculated using electronic distance zzso provided the image zzso and field of view are zzso The device is expected to be especially of value when acceptance testing on poorly documented imaging zzso
