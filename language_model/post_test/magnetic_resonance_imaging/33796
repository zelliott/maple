To compare the usefulness of zzso and CT in the detection of brain zzso during zzso evaluation and zzso zzso 

A prospective and sequential zzso 

Of 332 patients with potentially zzso zzso cell lung cancer who were free of zzso signs and symptoms, brain CT was performed preoperatively on 155 patients zzso zzso and brain zzso on 177 patients zzso zzso Patient characteristics in both groups were zzso In 279 patients with complete zzso of the primary lung zzso intensive follow-up with CT and zzso was performed in the respective zzso The zzso detection of brain zzso zzso zzso recurrence rates, and characteristics of detected brain tumors were compared between the two zzso The survival of patients with brain zzso was also zzso 

From the first evaluation to 12 months after surgery for primary lung cancer, brain zzso were observed in 11 patients zzso from the CT group and 12 patients zzso from the zzso zzso zzso detected brain zzso preoperatively in 6 of the 12 patients zzso of the total zzso group), whereas CT detected brain zzso preoperatively in 1 of the 11 patients zzso of the total CT zzso zzso showed a tendency toward a higher zzso detection rate of brain zzso than CT zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the mean zzso zzso zzso diameter of the brain zzso was significantly smaller in the zzso group zzso zzso than in the CT group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the median survival time and zzso survival rate after treatment of detected brain zzso respectively, were 10 months and zzso in the CT group and 17 months and zzso in the zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the groups in survival zzso 

zzso evaluation and intensive follow-up with zzso could facilitate early detection of brain zzso in patients with potentially zzso lung zzso However, further studies on detection and treatment of the zzso tumors are considered zzso
