Little is understood about the evolution of structural and functional brain changes during the course of uncontrolled focal status zzso in zzso 

We serially evaluated and treated a nine-year-old girl with zzso focal status zzso zzso zzso monitoring, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of affected cortex, and zzso examination of a biopsy zzso were conducted over a three year time zzso Imaging changes were correlated with simultaneous treatment and zzso zzso 

The zzso monitoring showed almost continuous spike zzso emanating initially from the right zzso zzso These zzso abnormalities were zzso suppressed by treatment with zzso Over time, additional brain areas developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated an evolution of changes from normal, through increased regional zzso signal to generalized zzso An zzso demonstrated zzso of the middle cerebral artery stem on the right compared to the left with a broad distribution of zzso zzso An zzso scan showed a dramatically abnormal zzso profile in the same right zzso areas, which modulated in response to treatment during the course of the zzso A right zzso zzso revealed a markedly zzso cortical focus including vascular zzso A sample of zzso zzso showed severe zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso of structural and functional imaging and its correlation with operative and pathological findings in this case illustrates the relentless progression of regional and generalized abnormalities in intractable focal status zzso that were only zzso modified by exhaustive therapeutic zzso Increased flow through large vessels appeared to be zzso and did not translate into increased zzso zzso
