zzso is a well-known technique for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso data, whose main advantage is certainly zzso given a metric on the zzso it zzso the main characteristics of the zzso But intrinsic to this approach are also the problem of defining correctly the zzso zzso and the number of clusters necessary to describe the zzso The Information zzso zzso approach to zzso zzso proposed by zzso and zzso addresses these zzso zzso it deals with an explicit zzso between zzso and data zzso zzso it does so during the zzso procedure and not post zzso zzso it takes into account the full statistical distribution of the features within the feature space and not only their most likely value; last, it is zzso through an information zzso zzso which is relevant in many zzso In this paper, we present how to benefit from this method to analyze zzso zzso Our application is the zzso of zzso according to the magnitude of their responses to several experimental zzso The zzso zzso provides a consistent representation of the data, allowing for an easy interpretation and comparison of zzso
