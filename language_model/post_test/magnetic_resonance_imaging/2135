If corpus zzso zzso mediates the zzso of the secondary zzso area zzso zzso to the side of zzso then the peak zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso activity as well as the zzso of the zzso zzso activity should correlate with the size of zzso zzso electrical stimuli of five different zzso were applied to the zzso surface of the right index finger in 15 right-handed zzso zzso was recorded using 82 closely spaced zzso The size of zzso and of seven zzso regions was measured from the zzso slice of a high-resolution anatomical zzso The zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated using zzso source zzso At the strongest stimulus intensity, the size of the intermediate part of the zzso zzso correlated zzso with the zzso zzso of the sources in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the large size of the intermediate zzso of zzso was paralleled by a zzso reduction of peak activity of the zzso zzso whereas both zzso and zzso peak zzso were positively zzso The peak zzso of the zzso zzso source correlated positively with the size of the intermediate zzso of zzso and with the peak zzso of sources in the primary zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso frontal zzso The results suggest that in right-handed zzso normal men, the size of the intermediate zzso zzso contributes to the timing and zzso of zzso zzso source zzso
