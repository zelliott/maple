We present a new zzso zzso framework that zzso cortical shape variations using a local area zzso The local area element is zzso from the zzso metric zzso which are obtained from the smooth functional zzso of a cortical zzso For the smooth zzso we have developed a novel weighted zzso harmonic zzso zzso which zzso the traditional zzso as a special zzso For a specific choice of zzso the zzso is shown to be the least squares approximation to the solution of an zzso heat diffusion on a unit zzso The main aims of this paper are to present the zzso and to show how it can be used in the zzso zzso As an zzso the methodology has been applied in the problem of detecting abnormal cortical regions in the group of high functioning zzso zzso
