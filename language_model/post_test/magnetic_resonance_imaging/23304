zzso zzso zzso can combine the high spatial resolution of zzso with the high zzso resolution of zzso zzso we applied this approach to the study of peripheral zzso More specifically, we presented visual field zzso fragments of zzso and a full central zzso in a simple detection zzso A technique called zzso was used to integrate zzso and zzso zzso In particular, we used zzso of zzso zzso zzso differences between left and right zzso zzso as zzso in an zzso zzso zzso The zzso differences for the zzso were measured at the zzso of the visual zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicated that the traditional zzso zzso analysis revealed mostly zzso in the vicinity of the primary visual zzso and in the zzso visual zzso while both zzso and zzso zzso revealed zzso of areas in the zzso zzso We conclude that simultaneous zzso in a spatial detection task can separate visual processing at zzso zzso from stimulus onset from the rest of the information processing in the zzso
