Fresh zzso clots are known to be poorly zzso by zzso zzso We have studied whether zzso of zzso clots could be enhanced by bulk transport in comparison to pure diffusion of plasma containing zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso blood clots were zzso glued by a zzso into plastic tubes and put in contact with plasma through the zzso zzso One group of clots zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) was placed under a pressure difference of 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso which resulted in an average plasma flow of zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso during the first zzso Another group of clots zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) was incubated in the zzso plasma without a pressure zzso zzso sizes were measured during zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso representing zzso areas penetrated into zzso clots with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), whereas the boundaries of zzso clots subsided with a zzso of less than zzso zzso Eight of the 10 zzso clots were zzso after 8 h and the sizes of the zzso group were reduced to zzso zzso zzso of the initial zzso The relative sizes of zzso clots after 8 h remained significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In a separate experiment good agreement was obtained between the measured zzso sizes by zzso and the residual zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
