The purpose of this study is to use magnetic resonance imaging to monitor the response of human zzso tumor zzso to single fraction radiation zzso Mice were divided into four treatment groups zzso zzso 6 per zzso that received 50, zzso 400, or 800 zzso of 200 zzso zzso zzso A fifth group zzso zzso 6) received no radiation dose and served as the zzso zzso maps of the treated tumor tissue were produced of water apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso relaxation time zzso Mice were zzso before and at multiple time points after zzso There was a statistically significant difference in tumor growth relative to that of the control for all treatment zzso Only the highest dose group showed zzso values that were significantly different at all measured time points after zzso In this group, there was an zzso increase in zzso relative to controls 2 days after treatment, but when measured 14 days after treatment, mean tumor zzso had dropped to zzso below the initial zzso zzso showed statistically significant differences from the control at all dose zzso A radiation dose dependence was zzso In the highest dose group, the fractional increases in zzso were higher than those observed for zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso changes in lower dose groups that did not have significant zzso zzso At all doses, zzso of mean tumor zzso preceded zzso in tumor growth from the zzso These observations support the potential application of zzso as a time and dose sensitive marker of tumor response to radiation zzso
