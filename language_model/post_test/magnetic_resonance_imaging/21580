Although zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso has been used as a contrast material in magnetic resonance imaging, it is known that contrast enhancement effect disappears if the concentration of zzso increases beyond some zzso In this study, to evaluate the proper pulse sequences for dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the human zzso the concentration of zzso was zzso measured by zzso coupled plasma zzso zzso zzso in human biological samples after administration of zzso and the signal intensity of zzso is the solutions of several zzso of zzso was zzso The results zzso zzso In using a low magnetic field apparatus, signal intensity zzso correlated with the concentration of zzso between 0 and zzso zzso under zzso recovery sequences zzso angle was 60 degrees or 90 zzso Using a high magnetic field apparatus, signal intensity zzso correlated with the concentration of zzso between 0 and zzso or zzso zzso under spin echo or zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration of the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso tissue at 5 zzso after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso body weight in 7 patients with adrenal tumor or zzso cell cancer, and 1 patient with both urinary zzso cancer and zzso zzso Seven of them showed normal zzso function and the other had zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cell cancer tissue were zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, at 5 zzso after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso body zzso These results suggest that the signal intensity of zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso cell cancer tissue may zzso correlate with zzso concentration of zzso at 5 zzso after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso body zzso
