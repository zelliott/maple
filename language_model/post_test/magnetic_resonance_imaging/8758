zzso studies suggest associations between zzso and large zzso zzso with thin or zzso zzso caps in advanced zzso We investigated these associations in carotid arteries with mild to severe zzso by in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso carotid zzso in at least one side by duplex ultrasound underwent bilateral zzso carotid zzso zzso zzso for wall and zzso core sizes, presence of zzso and zzso cap status zzso as intact thick, intact thin or zzso were zzso zzso with poor image quality, zzso or no zzso zzso core were zzso For the zzso zzso slices included, zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated larger zzso core zzso ratio for zzso increase, zzso zzso and presence of zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso were independently associated with a worse zzso thin or zzso stage of zzso cap zzso For zzso zzso analysis, a larger maximum zzso core and presence of zzso independently associated with worse zzso cap status zzso for zzso No zzso was detected in arteries with thick zzso zzso 

zzso and larger zzso core were independently associated with a thin or zzso zzso cap status at an early to advanced stage of carotid zzso
