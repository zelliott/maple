zzso zzso is reported to be an important factor for regulating cortisol zzso in patients with zzso syndrome due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, there have been several case reports of zzso zzso syndrome due to zzso in which the zzso role of zzso has been zzso The aim was to conduct an extensive investigation of zzso in the autonomous zzso of cortisol in zzso zzso syndrome due to zzso 

Five cases of zzso with zzso zzso syndrome underwent prospective study including physical examination, imaging zzso CT and zzso zzso and zzso evaluation that comprised zzso plasma cortisol levels and urinary zzso of steroid zzso a zzso suppression test and an zzso stimulation zzso In case 1, left zzso was performed and the pathological diagnosis of zzso was zzso An in zzso experiment using the cultured zzso adrenal cells was conducted to investigate cortisol zzso and expression of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso 

All five cases were discovered zzso to have bilateral adrenal zzso Imaging by zzso and CT revealed large zzso zzso in both adrenal zzso which showed positive zzso on zzso zzso Although the zzso values of plasma cortisol and urinary zzso of steroid zzso were within normal limits, autonomous zzso of cortisol was assumed to occur because of lack of suppression during zzso zzso The five patients had no overt signs of zzso syndrome, and they were therefore diagnosed with zzso zzso syndrome due to zzso In all five patients, zzso zzso cortisol zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso failed to affect cortisol zzso In case 1, zzso zzso cortisol zzso from cultured zzso adrenal cells, but this zzso had no relationship with zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue was determined by zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso syndrome due to zzso commonly exhibit cortisol responsiveness to zzso and this is probably zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso
