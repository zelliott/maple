Management of zzso infections relies on zzso and local delivery of zzso however, the distribution and concentration of locally delivered zzso in zzso surgical sites is zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as an imaging surrogate for zzso because it is similar in size and diffusion zzso to zzso 

Is in zzso distribution of locally delivered zzso zzso visible on zzso zzso reliably zzso by different zzso zzso affected by the zzso delivery zzso and zzso affected by the in zzso release rate from the delivery zzso 

zzso local delivery zzso were zzso in nine rabbits using two zzso sites zzso canal, zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso six of the nine rabbits also had zzso delivered in collagen at a third site zzso A total of 45,000 zzso zzso zzso scans were acquired using a zzso zzso zzso zzso nine zzso zzso slices over 10 zzso four zzso values, 25 time periods zzso every 15 minutes for 6 zzso zzso maps were constructed at every time zzso zzso distribution was observed zzso on the zzso zzso zzso reliability was zzso 

zzso delivered zzso was zzso zzso agreement was zzso zzso delivery followed zzso zzso zzso delivery was contained within the canal by zzso Distribution from collagen decreased after 1 hour but from zzso increased over 6 zzso 

zzso delivered zzso can be zzso on zzso distribution is affected by anatomical location and delivery zzso 

zzso imaging using locally delivered zzso may be useful as an zzso surrogate to determine zzso distribution in surgical zzso
