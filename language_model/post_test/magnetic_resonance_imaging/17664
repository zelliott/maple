zzso the zzso brain map for patients with zzso disorder zzso based on feature selection and zzso and identifying patients with zzso based on the zzso zzso 

A zzso of resting state zzso contains 23 patients with zzso and 23 healthy subjects were zzso Regional zzso zzso was extracted from resting state zzso signals and used as model zzso Raw zzso features were ranked and selected in a loop according to their p zzso zzso features were trained and tested by support zzso machines zzso in a cross validation zzso Cross validation was repeated in feature selection loop to produce zzso zzso 

zzso zzso map indicated that the zzso brains exhibit more increased activities than normal controls in bilateral zzso zzso and left front zzso The altered brain regions included portions of zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso zzso zzso indicated significant positive correlation of inattentive scores with bilateral zzso and zzso and significant negative correlation of zzso scores with bilateral zzso and zzso Additionally, the zzso model produced total accuracy of zzso and sensitivity of zzso 

zzso brain regions were more activated than normal controls during resting zzso Linear support zzso zzso can provide useful zzso information of altered zzso patterns for zzso and feature selection can improve the performances of zzso
