We evaluated the safety and efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso using a modified zzso 200 and compared the clinical response with that of the zzso zzso at 6 months after zzso Since 1995, 35 patients ages 66 zzso 7 years underwent zzso with the zzso 200 for symptomatic benign zzso zzso zzso under low spinal zzso The estimated zzso volume was zzso zzso zzso zzso before zzso A zzso zzso latex zzso was zzso during determination of the therapy zone and treatment so that critical tissue at the zzso was thoroughly zzso Twenty-two patients were analyzed with complete zzso follow-up zzso Side effects were transient urinary retention in four of these patients, zzso in five, and zzso in zzso Peak urinary flow rate increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During the same period, the mean International zzso zzso zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Quality of Life score improved from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging by means of an zzso surface zzso revealed significant zzso necrosis areas in the zzso zzso at 1 month on zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso for zzso using the zzso 200 produced a better clinical response than the zzso zzso and is expected to provide long-term durability of the zzso
