zzso source zzso techniques use zzso data to estimate the location of underlying neural zzso zzso source location reconstruction requires the assumption of a source model and the assumption of a zzso head zzso Brain zzso can present zzso values that are dramatically different from those of surrounding normal zzso and have to be included in head models for accurate neural source zzso It is therefore necessary to analyze subjects' zzso images zzso zzso or zzso zzso to identify zzso type and to assign the appropriate zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy may be influenced by uncertainties in tissue zzso assignment during head model zzso The authors present a sensitivity study zzso the effect of uncertainty in brain zzso zzso assignment on zzso zzso source zzso They adopted an zzso head model in which an eccentric bubble zzso the effects of actual brain zzso After simulating zzso signal measurement in 64 different zzso situations, an inverse zzso fitting procedure was carried out, assuming an incorrect zzso zzso assignment ranging from a half to twice the real zzso zzso zzso zzso assignment led to markedly wrong source reconstruction for highly zzso zzso like liquid-filled ones zzso errors as much as zzso zzso zzso low sensitivity to uncertainties in zzso assignment was found for zzso with low zzso like zzso zzso The authors propose a method based on residual error analysis to improve the zzso zzso zzso This procedure can identify zzso tissue zzso with only a few percent error and guarantees source zzso errors less than 5 zzso
