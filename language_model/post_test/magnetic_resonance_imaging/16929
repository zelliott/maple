zzso zzso is subsequently organized and replaced by zzso zzso zzso However, the sequential changes in zzso zzso are not reliably detected by current zzso diagnostic zzso The purpose of this study is to reveal whether magnetic resonance zzso can detect zzso zzso define zzso age and predict zzso zzso zzso in the rabbit jugular vein was zzso with a zzso MR system at 4 h and at 1, 2 and 4 weeks using three-dimensional zzso fast zzso spin echo zzso zzso and zzso echo zzso zzso zzso The jugular veins were zzso assessed at each time zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was also performed in zzso before and 30 zzso after tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso were comparable in size to zzso zzso The signal intensity zzso of zzso at 4 h was zzso high or low on zzso or zzso images, zzso The zzso of zzso on zzso images decreased zzso but increased on zzso images at 1 and 2 zzso zzso analysis showed zzso decreases in zzso zzso and zzso areas and zzso increases in smooth muscle cell, zzso collagen and iron zzso The zzso administration significantly decreased zzso volume at 4 h but not at 1, 2 and 4 zzso zzso zzso can be reliably and zzso detected by zzso zzso of zzso might support assessments of zzso age and zzso zzso
