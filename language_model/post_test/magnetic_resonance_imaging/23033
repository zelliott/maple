Image fusion software creates composite images from zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso fusion studies between August 2004 to July 2005 were zzso CT scan images zzso zzso were obtained on a zzso CT zzso MR images zzso zzso were obtained with a zzso volume acquisition zzso zzso fusion images were created on the zzso zzso Plus or zzso zzso 

A total of 25 patients had 27 zzso image fusion zzso zzso fusion accuracy was 2 zzso or zzso During zzso planning and zzso zzso zzso fusion facilitated the zzso of the zzso relationships between the zzso and the skull zzso 

zzso image fusion yields composite images that combine features of each component imaging zzso Image fusion, when combined with surgical zzso further enhances potential skull base applications for minimally invasive zzso zzso
