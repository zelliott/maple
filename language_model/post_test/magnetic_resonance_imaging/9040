zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have implicated the left prefrontal zzso in zzso We tested the hypothesis that object zzso activity in different prefrontal zzso regions selectively predicts subsequent object zzso and recognition zzso Participants were scanned whilst making semantic category zzso about novel object zzso One week later zzso and recognition of these objects were zzso zzso that produced long-lasting zzso in the absence of recognition memory was associated with increased activity in left inferior prefrontal zzso zzso and superior frontal zzso 8) zzso In contrast, zzso that produced object recognition one week later activated the left middle frontal zzso zzso zzso This is consistent with other evidence indicating that object zzso and recognition are independent kind of zzso zzso of measuring zzso recognition and zzso together are zzso
