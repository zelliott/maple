The goals of this study were to determine zzso the yield of zzso zzso according to zzso type, zzso if zzso spike sources zzso with focal zzso pathology, and zzso if zzso can identify the zzso zone when scalp zzso electroencephalogram zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso fail to zzso zzso Twenty-two patients with zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso and zzso lobe zzso (9 zzso were zzso A zzso zzso was used for simultaneously recording zzso with zzso During the typical zzso zzso recording session, zzso zzso activity was observed in 16 of 22 zzso zzso zzso yield was greater in patients with zzso zzso zzso than in those with zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso In 5 of 6 patients with focal zzso pathology, zzso spike sources were zzso with the zzso In 11 of 12 patients with zzso zzso abnormalities or zzso zzso zzso spike sources were localized in the region of the zzso zone as ultimately defined by all clinical and zzso information (including zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso can reliably zzso sources of spike zzso in patients with zzso and zzso lobe zzso zzso sometimes provides zzso zzso data that are not otherwise available with zzso or conventional scalp zzso zzso
