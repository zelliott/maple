zzso reorganization is a motor recovery mechanism after brain zzso The object of this study was to demonstrate the zzso zzso using functional zzso zzso and diffusion zzso zzso zzso 

Six control subjects and a 53 year-old woman with left primary zzso zzso zzso and underlying deep white matter injury were zzso The patient presented with complete paralysis of the right hand after the zzso of a zzso on the left zzso The motor function of the affected hand had recovered slowly the extent of her being able to overcome some resistance for 6 zzso At 2 years after the operation, zzso was performed at zzso T in parallel with timed finger zzso movements in all subjects and zzso was performed only in the zzso 

The zzso zzso centered on the zzso zzso was activated during hand movements of unaffected (left) side or control zzso However, the zzso area of the injured zzso was activated during affected (right) hand zzso zzso of the affected (left) zzso originated from the zzso area of the injured zzso and descended along the zzso side of injured deep white zzso 

It seems that the motor function of the affected hand was reorganized into the zzso area of the injured zzso and deep white matter in this zzso
