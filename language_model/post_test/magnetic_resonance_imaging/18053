zzso syndrome zzso cluster of cardiovascular risk zzso linked with cognitive decline and zzso However, the brain changes underlying this link are presently zzso In this study, we tested the relationship between zzso cerebral blood flow zzso white matter zzso burden, and gray matter zzso volume in cognitively healthy late middle-aged zzso Additionally, the extent to which zzso was associated with cognitive performance was zzso 

Late middle-aged adults from the Wisconsin zzso for Alzheimer's Prevention (N zzso 69, mean age zzso zzso zzso underwent a zzso blood draw, zzso spin labeling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was defined as abnormalities on three or more factors, including abdominal zzso zzso zzso blood pressure, and zzso zzso 

Mean zzso zzso was zzso lower in zzso compared to zzso zzso image analysis indicated that the zzso group had lower zzso across a large portion of the cortical surface, with the exception of zzso and inferior parts of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso group also had lower immediate memory zzso a mediation analysis indicated this relationship was partially zzso by zzso Among the zzso factors, abdominal obesity and elevated zzso were most strongly associated with lower zzso 

The results underscore the importance of reducing the number of cardiovascular risk factors for maintaining zzso and zzso in an aging zzso
