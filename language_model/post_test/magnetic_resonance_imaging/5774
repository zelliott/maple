zzso zzso interferes with zzso metabolism causing zzso thereby shifting the balance reaction of zzso zzso zzso toward zzso In this study we wanted to determine whether zzso changes could be reproduced in zzso patients with zzso and whether the results differed from those known in chronic zzso zzso zzso 

Seven patients with zzso zzso with zzso and seven healthy volunteers were investigated on a zzso We performed zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso using a short echo time zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by zzso allowing a separation of zzso and zzso at zzso Absolute values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the sum of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso was significantly decreased in the patients' group compared to the healthy zzso After separation of the signals of zzso and zzso a significant increase of zzso was observed in the zzso lobe in the patients' zzso No significant differences in the zzso zzso could be observed between the zzso 

In zzso patients the zzso of the zzso ratio differs from that in patients with zzso where zzso is markedly increased because of an increase in zzso The expected shift from the zzso balance reaction of zzso induced by zzso could be reproduced for the zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso in the zzso lobe of zzso patients most likely reflects an zzso compensation for high zzso
