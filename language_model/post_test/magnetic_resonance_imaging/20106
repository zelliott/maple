The aim of this study was to investigate the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso for zzso measurement of zzso cancer zzso and zzso 

Fifteen patients with zzso zzso underwent zzso dynamic zzso zzso and blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso and expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso 9 were measured zzso in zzso zzso sections from 12 zzso zzso zzso levels were also measured in 14 zzso zzso between quantitative imaging zzso and zzso variables were zzso 

There was good correlation between circulating zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso expression did not correlate with any dynamic zzso zzso except transfer constant, with which it correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and circulating zzso levels did not zzso and neither correlated with any zzso zzso zzso zzso No relationship was seen between zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The negative correlation between transfer constant zzso zzso blood flow and zzso zzso with zzso expression is zzso zzso zzso methods for assessing tissue zzso correlate poorly with zzso markers of zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso does not simply reflect zzso zzso vascular properties in patients with zzso zzso
