We performed functional magnetic resonance zzso involving visual stimuli on 10 zzso Half of the children were measured awake, the other half were measured under light zzso zzso corresponding to zzso mean zzso zzso Each child was presented with a flashed and a reversing zzso which previous investigations have shown to induce identical increases in cerebral blood zzso The latter stimulus activated double the number of zzso as the former so that cerebral zzso rate of oxygen consumption zzso was doubled, leading to an effective rise of the oxygen extraction zzso We measured the extent of zzso by counting the number of activated zzso and assessed the change in zzso by measuring the change in the local zzso zzso zzso using change in spin zzso In both groups of children, the extent of zzso was larger for the flashed than the reversing zzso although the absolute number of activated zzso was smaller for the children who were measured under zzso The zzso concentration was significantly higher during the presentation of the reversing compared with the flashed zzso The relative change in the zzso concentration to the flashed and reversing zzso was the same in the children who were measured under zzso as in the children who were measured zzso We conclude that light levels of zzso may reduce the extent of zzso but does not unduly influence either zzso or cerebral blood flow, thus preserving the blood zzso zzso signal zzso
