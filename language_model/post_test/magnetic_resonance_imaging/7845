The zzso relationship between the lateral zzso process and the zzso zzso has been an uncertainty for researchers over several zzso While some argue there to be no zzso relationship between these two zzso structures, others have suggested that there is an inverse relationship, the lateral zzso process forming from a part of the zzso zzso However, no previous studies have offered quantitative zzso to test these zzso In this study, we measured the size of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the size and area of the lateral zzso process in 73 subjects using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso height was measured using zzso zzso as a measurement of zzso arch in 35 of these zzso Age, body mass, and body mass index zzso were also recorded for all zzso We determined that there was a significant positive correlation between the lateral zzso process and size of the zzso zzso body mass, and zzso Thus, assertions that there is an inverse relationship between the size of the lateral zzso process and the zzso zzso are here zzso We also determined there to be a positive correlation between the zzso zzso and both the size of the zzso zzso and the height of the zzso In conclusion, we relate these novel findings to zzso fossil zzso and discuss the evolutionary and zzso zzso
