Pros and cons of this selected approach for zzso treatment and first clinical results are zzso zzso are the availability of modern high-resolution zzso zzso technology as well as strict quality control of zzso and surgical quality of total zzso zzso zzso 

By selecting patients with zzso tumors on zzso for zzso therapy, only approximately zzso patients will require zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso after primary surgery, the indication for zzso zzso is given for a rather large percentage of patients, zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, is significantly less effective and more toxic than zzso zzso A further point of concern is the assertion that patients, in whom a zzso status is achieved by surgery alone, do not benefit from additional zzso Data of the Dutch zzso trial and the British zzso zzso Research zzso zzso trial, however, suggest the zzso 

To omit zzso zzso for zzso tumors on zzso needs to be further investigated in prospective clinical zzso The German guidelines for the treatment of zzso cancer 2008 continue to indicate zzso zzso based on the zzso and zzso
