zzso low grade zzso evidence a tendency towards zzso growth, thus complicating the clinical management of zzso tumors whose clinical behavior may be difficult to zzso We decided to explore the hypothesis of possible correlation in pediatric low grade zzso between tumor volume and growth zzso We identified 6 children with zzso zzso zzso Five of these patients were treated only with biopsy and 1 with repeated partial tumor zzso All of 6 patients had zzso sequential brain zzso over a time span of zzso zzso zzso volume was determined using zzso zzso Image zzso The results were analyzed utilizing two equations for modeling tumor zzso exponential and zzso In 4 patients whose tumor volume was approximately zzso zzso at the time of diagnosis, slow spontaneous partial zzso was zzso In the other patients zzso or exponential tumor growth was zzso Our results suggest that growth of pediatric low grade zzso zzso as tumor becomes large and that the zzso model for tumor growth is useful for understanding the growth zzso of pediatric low grade zzso
