zzso zzso cartilage zzso with artificial surface zzso were zzso in a 2 zzso zzso solution to determine the effect of zzso contrast on detection of early degenerative zzso Surface zzso consisted of zzso zzso superficial zzso and coarse zzso zzso were zzso with a zzso fast zzso shot zzso and zzso zzso in the steady state zzso zzso Although both sequences were able to identify zzso zzso they underestimated the presence of superficial grooves and extent of zzso Despite greater bulk tissue contrast between cartilage and fluid for the zzso zzso detection of zzso was poorer compared with the zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that surface properties of zzso cartilage contribute significantly to the zzso of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting superficial zzso In contrast to previous papers suggesting that zzso zzso zzso imaging provides the greatest accuracy for zzso zzso our results indicate that, in the presence of joint fluid, zzso imaging increases detection of superficial zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
