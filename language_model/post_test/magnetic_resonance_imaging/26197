We sought to compare the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance zzso zzso and digital zzso zzso zzso in patients with suspected zzso or zzso Sixteen consecutive patients (4 female and 12 male, mean age zzso zzso with suspected zzso or zzso underwent zzso by a standard technique and zzso MRS was obtained with a zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso acquisition time 7 zzso using a zzso head zzso zzso zzso and a surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso symptomatic zzso were investigated with zzso eight zzso zzso in 6 patients zzso zzso and unilateral zzso zzso in 11 zzso MRS was always carried out to zzso zzso ducts zzso The zzso system was zzso in all zzso examined by zzso zzso depicted the zzso system in all 11 zzso zzso but only 4 of the 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed in three cases (one zzso two zzso zzso by MRS and in two cases by zzso zzso demonstrated zzso branching ducts and MRS secondary branching zzso MRS is able to zzso the zzso system of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and is thus not dependent on successful zzso of the orifice of the zzso zzso Our preliminary data indicate that MRS is useful for diagnosing zzso MRS allows diagnosis of zzso changes, but zzso achieves a better diagnostic performance due to higher spatial zzso
