zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso iron oxide that is of current interest as an MR contrast zzso It is believed to consist primarily of small zzso or zzso zzso that possess a zzso moment, but the exact magnetic properties and related mechanisms of zzso and zzso zzso relaxation enhancement are not well zzso We have obtained a comprehensive data set consisting of zzso curves, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic relaxation zzso zzso profiles for this contrast zzso The zzso zzso show a primary zzso consistent with a zzso moment of zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso In addition, there is a secondary zzso zzso that is consistent with a smaller zzso moment of 1600 zzso which may be responsible for the observed zzso increase in zzso Finally, there appear to be a considerable number of zzso zzso present that are needed to account for the zzso increase in zzso and that can provide an alternative explanation for the magnitude of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso appears to be successful in explaining in a zzso and quantitative manner the combined results of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Published 1999 zzso zzso
