zzso exposure to objects improves our ability to identify and name them, even after a long zzso Previous brain imaging studies have demonstrated that this zzso zzso of object naming is associated with neural changes in distinct brain zzso We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine the zzso of neural activity in the object naming system as a function of experience and zzso Pictures of common objects were presented repeatedly for naming at different time intervals (1 zzso 6 h and 3 zzso before zzso or at 30 s intervals during zzso The results revealed that as objects became more familiar with experience, activity in zzso and left inferior frontal regions decreased while activity in the left zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso regions, reductions in activity as a result of multiple repetitions did not interact with time, whereas in left inferior frontal zzso larger decreases were observed when repetitions were spaced out over zzso This differential zzso of activity in distinct brain regions provides support for the idea that long-lasting object zzso is zzso by two neural zzso The first mechanism may involve changes in zzso representations in zzso zzso the second may be a form of procedural learning involving a reorganization in brain zzso that leads to more efficient name zzso
