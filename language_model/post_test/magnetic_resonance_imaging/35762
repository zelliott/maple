Bone scans are highly sensitive for the diagnosis of acute zzso but the difficulty of separating bone-marrow processes from zzso disease limits the specificity and zzso A diagnostic technique capable of distinguishing bone-marrow processes from zzso disease would improve the diagnostic accuracy of zzso To evaluate the use of MR in the diagnosis of zzso MR examinations were performed in 35 patients with suspected acute zzso Twelve of these were proved to have zzso either by surgery zzso zzso or by clinical follow-up (three zzso In the other 23, zzso was excluded by surgery (12 zzso or by the clinical course (11 zzso Evidence of zzso on MR consisted of abnormalities of the bone zzso with decreased signal intensity on the zzso images and increased signal intensity on the zzso or zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso MR and bone zzso were interpreted by two zzso who were given no clinical information other than to rule out zzso The sensitivities of MR and zzso bone scan were zzso for bone-marrow zzso Because bone-marrow zzso in zzso associated with healing fractures was incorrectly diagnosed by MR (one zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso the sensitivities of MR and zzso for the diagnosis of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of MR and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively zzso less than zzso The overall accuracy for the diagnosis of zzso was zzso for MR and zzso for bone scan zzso less than zzso Because of its ability to separate zzso disease from underlying bone zzso MR may be used to evaluate patients with positive bone zzso to improve the specificity and accuracy of diagnosis for zzso
