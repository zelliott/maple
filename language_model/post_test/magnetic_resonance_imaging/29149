Because it diminishes the zzso of the zzso zzso disk zzso results in abnormal motions of the zzso zzso disk zzso associated with back pain may indicate spinal zzso The purpose of this study was to correlate the MR appearance and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso spinal segments were zzso with zzso The zzso disks were classified zzso 1) normal, 2) having zzso or concentric tears of the zzso zzso if MR imaging showed only these changes, 3) having zzso tears of the zzso zzso if MR imaging showed high-intensity zones in the zzso zzso or reduced signal intensity in the disk characteristic of zzso tears, or 4) having advanced zzso if MR imaging showed markedly reduced zzso large zzso or zzso The rotation occurring from the application of a zzso zzso moment of zzso zzso zzso was measured zzso Average zzso in zzso was calculated as the ratio of the zzso to the zzso 

zzso averaged zzso zzso for the normal zzso zzso zzso for the disks with concentric or zzso zzso zzso zzso for disks with zzso zzso and zzso zzso for disks with advanced zzso The differences were statistically zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso tears of the zzso disk indicate reduced zzso of the zzso disk and increased motions for a unit of applied zzso The most severely reduced zzso was found in disks with zzso tears of the zzso zzso With collapse of the disk space, zzso zzso
