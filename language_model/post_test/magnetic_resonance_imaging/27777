A number of recent studies have shown that the electric field and current density induced in the human body by movement in and around magnetic resonance imaging installations can exceed regulatory zzso Although it is possible to measure the induced electric fields at the surface of the body, it is usually more convenient to use zzso models to predict likely exposure under zzso movement zzso zzso the accuracy of these models is not in doubt, this paper shows that zzso of particular zzso movements should be treated with zzso In particular, we show that v zzso B rather than zzso zzso zzso should be used as the driving term in zzso zzso of induced zzso Although for zzso motion the two driving terms are zzso specific examples of zzso zzso motion are given where incorrect results are obtained when zzso zzso zzso is zzso In addition, we show that it is important to take into account the space charge which can be generated by zzso and we also consider particular cases where zzso the space charge generates erroneous zzso Along with zzso calculations based on simple models, zzso zzso calculations are used to illustrate these zzso
