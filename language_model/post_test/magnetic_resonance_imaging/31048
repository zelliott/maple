To report the zzso zzso discovery of clinically zzso zzso of the zzso and motor zzso 

We performed zzso evoked potential zzso and zzso electric stimulation zzso muscle motor evoked potential zzso monitoring during zzso surgery for a 16 year old patient with familial horizontal gaze zzso and progressive zzso Our routine procedures included zzso zzso cortical zzso monitoring zzso through zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which surprisingly indicated zzso zzso we also obtained zzso median nerve zzso and simultaneous bilateral muscle recordings to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and focal hand area zzso magnetic stimulation zzso zzso 

For each zzso zzso zzso distribution was zzso and median zzso zzso For each hemisphere, zzso zzso zzso had lower thresholds and zzso zzso were exclusively zzso zzso monitoring required reversed zzso zzso of an zzso zzso reported zzso disclosed a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 

The results indicate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways due to zzso zzso with absent internal zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso bilateral recording to unilateral stimulation demonstrates zzso zzso origin and is important for accurate interpretation and monitoring because zzso anomalies zzso
