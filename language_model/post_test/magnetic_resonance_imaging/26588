We examined how wide ranges in levels of risk factors for cerebrovascular disease are associated with thickness of the human cerebral zzso in 115 individuals ages zzso with no cerebrovascular or zzso zzso zzso risk factors included blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were submitted into a principal components analysis that confirmed four zzso factors zzso pressure, cholesterol, zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to create models of the zzso for calculation of regional cortical zzso zzso blood pressure factor scores were associated with numerous regions of reduced zzso zzso zzso scores were modestly associated with areas of regionally decreased zzso zzso cholesterol scores, in contrast, were associated with thicker zzso across the whole zzso All findings were primarily independent of zzso These results provide evidence that normal and moderately abnormal levels of parameters used to assess cerebrovascular health may impact brain structure, even in the absence of cerebrovascular zzso Our data have important implications for the clinical management of vascular health, as well as for what is currently zzso as zzso zzso as they suggest that zzso levels of risk may impact cortical gray matter before a disease process is zzso
