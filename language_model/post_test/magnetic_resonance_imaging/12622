We describe a new method to automatically discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso or mild cognitive impairment zzso and elderly controls, based on zzso zzso of zzso shape zzso This approach uses zzso zzso zzso zzso to model the shape of the zzso which are segmented from magnetic resonance images zzso using a fully automatic method that we previously zzso zzso zzso are used as features in a zzso procedure based on support zzso machines zzso The most relevant features for zzso are selected using a bagging zzso We evaluate the accuracy of our method in a group of 23 patients with zzso (10 zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso years, zzso score zzso 23 patients with zzso zzso (10 zzso 13 zzso zzso years, zzso and 25 elderly healthy controls (13 zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso For zzso vs controls, we obtain a correct zzso rate of zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso For zzso vs controls, we obtain a zzso rate of zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso This accuracy is superior to that of zzso zzso and is comparable to recently published zzso zzso zzso methods, which relied on a different zzso This new method may become a useful tool to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's zzso
