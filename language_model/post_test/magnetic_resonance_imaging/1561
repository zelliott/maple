The developing human zzso displays zzso changes in its patterns of zzso Among these, the zzso zone is the most prominent transient compartment because growing major zzso systems temporarily reside in this zone, establish zzso and take part in cellular interactions that are crucial for subsequent cortical zzso We explored the potential of magnetic resonance imaging zzso for tracing the zzso history of the most prominent cortical layer (the zzso zzso and other zzso compartments of the fetal cerebral wall between 15 and 36 weeks zzso We found that changes in the zzso zzso pattern of the human fetal cerebral wall are predominantly caused by changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso enables selective zzso of the zzso zone and correlation with an increase in zzso signal intensity in the zzso zone and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and their subsequent relocation to the cortical zzso Thus, dynamic changes in the zzso appearance of the zzso zone and zzso zzso of its zzso can be used as indirect parameters for an assessment of normal versus disturbed unfolding of crucial zzso events that are involved in prenatal shaping of the human cerebral zzso
