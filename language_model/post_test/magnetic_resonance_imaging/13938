zzso zzso artery zzso was performed for the treatment of symptomatic zzso zzso resonance imaging was carried out before and six months following zzso Women completed outcome questionnaires following their zzso

One hundred and zzso zzso of 114 women zzso age zzso were zzso zzso percent of women had complex zzso masses and 50% had zzso zzso or zzso in zzso The median reduction in the zzso volume was zzso The median reduction of the volume of complex zzso masses, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso with high and low signal on zzso weighted sequences were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso percent of the women's symptoms had resolved or improved following zzso
