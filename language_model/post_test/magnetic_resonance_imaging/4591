A zzso zzso pulse sequence using high zzso zzso zzso is zzso 

In order to minimize motion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with phase correction and raw data averaging using zzso echoes was zzso The in zzso ratio of diffusion zzso for water and zzso was determined and the water zzso zzso at different temperatures was zzso The pulse sequence was tested in 7 healthy volunteers and in 2 zzso patients with zzso of grades zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso techniques were zzso 

The incorporation of phase correction clearly improved the quality of both zzso images and the calculated diffusion zzso Mean values of the diffusion zzso in zzso were for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for white and zzso matter zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in combination with a high zzso strength were shown to be useful for in zzso diffusion MR zzso
