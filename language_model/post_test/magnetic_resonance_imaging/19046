To determine whether a relationship exists between increased zzso pressure and the presence of idiopathic zzso zzso 

A prospective study in which 12 consecutive patients presenting with zzso folds were evaluated by imaging studies zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and/or zzso zzso to rule out known causes of zzso zzso such as zzso disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso puncture was performed on each of these patients, and measurement of opening pressure of zzso fluid was zzso 

Twelve patients with zzso folds included nine men and three zzso Six patients zzso presented with zzso in the eye with zzso zzso The other six patients zzso presented with only zzso zzso In this study, 10 zzso of 12 patients had an opening pressure greater than 230 zzso zzso In patients presenting with only zzso zzso five zzso of six patients had an opening pressure greater than 230 zzso zzso with an average opening pressure of 290 zzso zzso 

Depending on the timing of the zzso zzso may or may not be present, and only zzso folds may be seen as a reflection of increased zzso zzso We believe that increased zzso pressure from any source zzso is, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso can present with only zzso zzso therefore, these patients should have an appropriate zzso that should probably include a zzso puncture before the title of zzso is given to their zzso
