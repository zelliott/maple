zzso is frequently associated with pronounced zzso symptoms such as zzso zzso poor zzso and memory zzso zzso zzso has revealed changes in cerebral metabolism in zzso but regional changes in cortical zzso associated with specific neurological deficits have not been studied so zzso To investigate the zzso underlying zzso neural dysfunction, we compared zzso matter volume zzso between adult zzso patients and matched healthy controls using zzso zzso zzso 

High resolution zzso zzso images were acquired by zzso zzso from 51 zzso patients and 51 zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso zzso between regional zzso and both serum free zzso hormone zzso zzso and disease duration were assessed by multiple zzso zzso 

Compared to controls, zzso volumes in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and left zzso pole were lower and bilateral supplementary motor area zzso higher in zzso zzso zzso free zzso zzso concentration was zzso correlated with the zzso regional volume zzso of the left zzso zzso and serum free zzso zzso concentration zzso correlated with the zzso of the left zzso and right zzso zzso Disease duration was zzso correlated with the zzso of the left zzso bilateral zzso zzso and left zzso zzso 

zzso patients exhibited reduced zzso in regions associated with memory, attention, emotion, vision, and motor zzso zzso correlations between zzso and both free zzso and disease duration suggest that chronic zzso zzso zzso abnormalities in the adult zzso
