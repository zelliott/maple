Multiple zzso is a rare disease with zzso zzso in multiple zzso and zzso and associated with a risk of fatal zzso 

In this patient, the bones, zzso and zzso cavities and zzso tract were zzso The patient had long-term been administered zzso that provided relief from bone pain as early as after the second zzso The effect of zzso was evaluated on CT and zzso Since zzso proliferation is associated with chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood count and zzso as well as zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso are also used to assess treatment zzso 

Before treatment, zzso levels were in excess of 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso were at measurable zzso During treatment with zzso zzso at a dose of 6 million units 3 times a week with the dose reduction after 10 month, the median zzso concentration increased to zzso zzso zzso the median zzso levels declined to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were still zzso zzso therapy zzso zzso provided reduction in the median zzso levels to zzso zzso zzso and increase in median zzso concentration to zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso were zzso CT imaging suggested significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso required dose reduction of zzso to 50 zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso provided an increase in median zzso concentration to zzso zzso and decline in the level of zzso to a median of 124 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso became zzso zzso zzso a low dose of zzso 10 zzso was combined with zzso 100 zzso and, zzso 50 zzso Treatment with zzso 10 zzso and zzso 50 zzso provided median zzso levels of zzso and the disease has remained stable for 9 zzso 

zzso 100 zzso stabilized multiple zzso better than zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso was insufficient to maintain disease zzso zzso at a dose of 10 zzso was tolerated really well but this dose was insufficient to maintain low zzso levels and normal zzso zzso The combination of zzso 10 zzso and zzso 50 zzso daily stabilized the disease for 9 zzso
