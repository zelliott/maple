This was a prospective zzso follow-up study of zzso matched zzso of 15-year-old school children with or without low back pain zzso 

In addition to low back pain and leisure time physical activity, spinal mobility, trunk muscle strength, and early degenerative findings of the zzso spine were zzso 

Reliable zzso studies on the prevalence of low back pain and development of early degenerative changes of the zzso spine in young persons have been zzso Along with several other zzso the relationship of these changes to frequent low back pain in young persons is not zzso 

After a zzso survey was zzso subjects with or without low back pain were examined initially and at follow-up with special reference to leisure time physical activity, zzso spinal mobility, trunk muscle strength, and magnetic resonance imaging findings of the zzso zzso 

At baseline and at zzso those subjects with initial low back pain were characterized by a low frequency of physical activity and decreased spinal zzso During zzso the occurrence of disc zzso increased significantly more in the original group with low back pain than among zzso zzso Furthermore, disc zzso at baseline significantly predicted future frequent low back zzso zzso disc zzso also predicted future frequent low back zzso 

After the rapid physical growth period, there seemed to be a zzso relationship between the early evolution of the degenerative processes of the lower zzso discs and frequent low back pain in several zzso
