zzso exists concerning the neural basis underlying visual zzso Some propose that visual images evoked from memory are zzso by primary visual zzso Others argue that these primary visual areas perform zzso on elementary visual features when constructing visual representations from retinal input but that they are not activated during recall of these zzso The visual imagery abilities of patients with cortical zzso may resolve this zzso The proposition that primary visual zzso is necessary for visual imagery predicts a zzso blind zzso inability to perceive visual stimuli would be accompanied by an inability to image zzso Our investigations of three patients with cortical zzso provide strong evidence that primary visual zzso are not essential for the mediation of visual images recalled from zzso
