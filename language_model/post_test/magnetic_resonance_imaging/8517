The aims of this study are to document the occurrence of a cavernous zzso of the zzso membrane zzso and external auditory canal zzso that invaded the middle ear spaces and to review the relevant zzso 

The clinical zzso imaging studies, operative report, and zzso findings of this new case of cavernous zzso are zzso 

A cavernous zzso of the TM and zzso involving the middle ear spaces was surgically excised without zzso The zzso zzso which affected our patient at the same ear where the zzso was situated, disappeared after zzso Our case represents the first documented cavernous zzso of the TM and zzso that invaded the middle ear spaces and the eighth case of cavernous zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is the method of choice in evaluating this zzso 

zzso of the zzso and/or TM are extremely rare entities amenable to surgical zzso With magnetic resonance imaging, there is difficulty in defining the exact location of the tumor and degree of soft tissue zzso
