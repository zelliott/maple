This paper presents the results of a study of the effects of left zzso strokes on zzso comprehension in zzso zzso We studied 42 patients with zzso secondary to left zzso strokes and 25 control subjects for the ability to assign and interpret three zzso structures zzso object extracted relative zzso and reflexive zzso in zzso zzso matching and zzso judgment zzso We measured zzso zzso and zzso listening times in zzso and zzso We obtained magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data on 31 patients and 12 zzso The percent of selected regions of interest zzso that was zzso on MR and the mean zzso PET counts per zzso in zzso were zzso In zzso zzso zzso measures in both zzso and zzso zzso predicted zzso Patients who performed at similar levels zzso had zzso of very different sizes, and patients with equivalent zzso sizes varied greatly in their level of zzso The data are consistent with a model in which the neural tissue that is responsible for the operations underlying sentence comprehension and zzso processing is localized in different neural regions in different zzso
