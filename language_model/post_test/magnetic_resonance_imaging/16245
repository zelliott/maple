This study was undertaken to evaluate the value of cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso in the assessment of patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Sixteen patients with zzso and 2 populations zzso 110 normal volunteers were zzso zzso All patients with zzso underwent a zzso protocol including measurement of carotid artery wall volume, assessment of left zzso zzso volumes and function, and late zzso enhancement for the detection of zzso zzso 

zzso artery wall volume, total vessel volume, and the zzso wall ratio were elevated in zzso patients compared with controls zzso volume zzso zzso in zzso patients versus 640 zzso in controls, P zzso zzso total vessel volume zzso zzso in zzso patients versus zzso zzso in controls, P zzso zzso zzso wall ratio zzso in zzso patients versus zzso in controls, P zzso zzso The zzso volume was reduced in zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso in controls, P zzso zzso In zzso zzso function was more zzso with reduced zzso volume zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso ejection fraction 74 zzso zzso versus 67 zzso zzso in controls, P zzso zzso zzso zzso volume 19 zzso 4 zzso versus 25 zzso 1 zzso in controls, P zzso zzso zzso late zzso enhancement was present in 4 zzso of 15 patients, indicating previously zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that an integrated method of cardiovascular assessment by zzso in zzso not only provides good zzso of vessel wall zzso but has also demonstrated dynamic zzso function, zzso zzso and silent zzso zzso zzso has benefits compared with other approaches for the assessment and followup of patients with zzso and has potential to identify patients most at risk of zzso allowing early preventative zzso
