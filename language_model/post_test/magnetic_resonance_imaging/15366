The purpose of this study was to describe the structure and function of the heart in the presence of marked zzso zzso of the right zzso wall in 13 patients referred for second opinions about fatty zzso of the right zzso wall and suspected zzso right zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with right zzso thickness zzso or zzso 6 zzso on zzso but without regional or global functional abnormalities of the right zzso appears to be distinct from fatty right zzso associated with zzso right zzso zzso The finding of right zzso fat must be interpreted cautiously to avoid the zzso and zzso intervention associated with management of zzso right zzso zzso
