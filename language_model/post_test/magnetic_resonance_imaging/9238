In zzso the zzso zzso is a key zzso for complex emotional and social zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso near the promoter of zzso zzso the zzso zzso most heavily implicated in zzso regulation, have been linked to zzso and zzso zzso However, the impact of these zzso on human brain function is zzso Here we show that human zzso function is strongly associated with genetic variation in zzso Using an imaging zzso approach in a sample of 121 volunteers studied with an emotional zzso zzso we found that differential zzso of zzso is observed in carriers of risk zzso for zzso and zzso zzso in zzso previously reported to be significantly zzso and zzso to zzso zzso showed opposing effects on zzso zzso Furthermore, we show functional difference in human brain between short and long repeat lengths that mirror findings recently obtained in a corresponding zzso in zzso Our results indicate a neural mechanism zzso genetic risk for zzso through an impact on zzso zzso and provide a rationale for exploring therapeutic strategies aimed at abnormal zzso function in this zzso
