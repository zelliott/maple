To assess the extent of zzso cervical spinal zzso zzso in patients with primary progressive zzso multiple sclerosis zzso and to investigate the relationship between spinal zzso functional zzso and the severity of cervical spinal zzso and brain structural damage by using magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

The study was conducted with institutional review board zzso Written informed consent was obtained from each zzso zzso spinal zzso functional MR images were obtained in 23 patients with zzso zzso and 18 healthy control subjects during tactile stimulation of the right zzso Conventional and zzso MR images of the brain and spinal zzso were also zzso Mean zzso signal intensity change for all activated zzso and the distribution of functional MR activity at each spinal zzso level were zzso zzso analysis was used to compare MR findings between zzso zzso differences in zzso distribution of functional MR activity were evaluated by using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso had higher mean spinal zzso activity on functional MR images than did zzso A higher occurrence of functional MR zzso in the right versus left side of the spinal zzso and in the zzso versus anterior section of the spinal zzso was found in both control subjects and patients with zzso zzso Patients who were mildly disabled had a pattern of functional MR activity distribution similar to that of controls, but patients who were more severely disabled did not show differential zzso between the right and left sides of the spinal zzso A higher occurrence of functional MR activity in the anterior section of the right side of the spinal zzso at the level of the zzso zzso disk zzso zzso zzso and the left side of the spinal zzso at the level of the zzso zzso disk zzso zzso zzso was found in patients with zzso zzso than in control zzso Mean spinal zzso functional MR imaging signal intensity change correlated with spinal zzso fractional zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso showed zzso cervical spinal zzso zzso Spinal zzso functional changes, possibly zzso to injured zzso likely contribute to the complex process that leads to the zzso of irreversible disability in patients with zzso zzso
