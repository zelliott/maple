We investigated the accuracy and feasibility of a system that provides zzso needle access to the prostate concurrent with zzso zzso zzso which previously has not been zzso 

In 5 patients with previously diagnosed prostate cancer, zzso guided zzso placement of gold zzso markers (4 zzso and/or prostate biopsy (3 zzso was performed using local zzso 

Mean procedure duration was 76 minutes and all patients tolerated the intervention zzso zzso related adverse events included zzso zzso and zzso following 3 of 8 procedures (all resolved in less than 1 zzso Mean needle placement accuracy was zzso zzso for the zzso marker placement studies and zzso zzso for the biopsy zzso Mean zzso marker placement accuracy was zzso zzso and the mean zzso marker placement accuracy zzso to the needle direction was zzso zzso All patients who underwent the procedure were able to complete their course of zzso without delay or zzso 

While studies of clinical usefulness are warranted, zzso zzso T zzso guided prostate biopsy and zzso marker placement is feasible using this system, providing new opportunities for image guided diagnostic and therapeutic prostate zzso
