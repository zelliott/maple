Patients with traumatic brain injury show clear zzso in zzso flexibility and zzso that often persist beyond the time of injury, affecting independent living and zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that patients with traumatic brain injury typically show increased and more broadly dispersed frontal and zzso activity during performance of cognitive control zzso We constructed zzso and weighted functional networks and calculated their zzso properties using a graph theoretical zzso zzso adults with traumatic brain injury and 26 zzso controls were instructed to switch between coordination modes while making zzso and temporally coupled circular motions with zzso during zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso demonstrated that switching performance was significantly lower in patients with traumatic brain injury compared with control zzso Furthermore, although brain networks of both groups exhibited economical zzso zzso altered functional connectivity was demonstrated in patients with traumatic brain zzso In particular, compared with controls, patients with traumatic brain injury showed increased connectivity degree and strength, and higher values of local efficiency, suggesting zzso mechanisms in this zzso Finally, the degree of increased connectivity was significantly correlated with poorer switching task performance and more severe brain zzso We conclude that zzso the functional brain network connectivity provides new insights into understanding cognitive control changes following brain zzso
