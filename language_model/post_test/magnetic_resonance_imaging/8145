zzso paralysis is characterized by a loss of voluntary motor functioning without an organic zzso Despite its prevalence among neurological zzso little is known about the zzso basis of this motor zzso We have examined whether the motor dysfunction in conversion paralysis can be linked to zzso of the motor system, or rather to enhanced zzso during motor zzso We measured behavioral and cerebral responses (with zzso in eight conversion paralysis patients with a zzso zzso of the arm as they were engaged in imagined actions of the affected and unaffected zzso We used a zzso design to compare cerebral activity during imagined movements of the affected and the unaffected zzso Motor imagery of the affected hand and the unaffected hand recruited comparable cerebral resources in the motor system, and generated equal behavioral zzso However, motor imagery of the affected limb recruited additional cerebral resources in the zzso prefrontal zzso and superior zzso zzso These zzso differences were caused by a failure to zzso these regions during movement imagery of the affected zzso These findings lend support to the hypothesis that conversion paralysis is associated with heightened zzso during actions with the affected zzso
