Blood oxygen zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a zzso method to assess tissue oxygen zzso using zzso as an zzso contrast zzso We hypothesized that zzso could accurately discriminate different types of rejection early after kidney zzso 

zzso patients underwent imaging in the first four months zzso Five had normal functioning transplants and 18 had zzso acute zzso dysfunction zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso and acute rejection zzso including borderline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Mean zzso zzso zzso levels (a measure directly zzso to tissue zzso zzso were significantly higher in normal functioning zzso zzso versus acute rejection zzso and zzso zzso zzso The lowest zzso levels were observed in acute rejection episodes with vascular injury zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, the lowest zzso to cortical zzso ratios zzso were present in zzso with zzso zzso and zzso rejection zzso zzso curve analyses suggested that zzso and zzso values could accurately discriminate acute rejection in the early zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrated significant changes in zzso oxygen zzso in zzso with zzso zzso and acute zzso suggesting that there may be a role for this zzso tool to evaluate kidney function early after zzso
