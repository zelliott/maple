To investigate the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso enhanced MR imaging for the detection of liver zzso in patients with primary zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty-one patients with zzso proven primary zzso of the liver were evaluated before and after administration of zzso at dose zzso or zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso and zzso echo zzso images were evaluated for zzso number, location, size and confidence by three off-site independent zzso and the findings were compared to reference standard imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for significance using a zzso zzso zzso 

More zzso were identified on zzso enhanced images than on zzso images and there was no significant difference in zzso detection between either zzso The largest benefit was in detection of zzso under 1 zzso in size (7 to 21, 9 to 15, 16 to 18 for zzso A, B, C zzso In zzso of the patients with more than one zzso zzso increased the number of zzso zzso 

Liver MR imaging after zzso increases the detection of liver zzso in patients with primary zzso zzso zzso
