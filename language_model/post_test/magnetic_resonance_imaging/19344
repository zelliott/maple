The neural mechanisms underlying the zzso of pain perception by hypnosis remain zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso zzso in 11 healthy volunteers to identify the brain areas in which hypnosis zzso cerebral responses to a noxious zzso 

The protocol used a zzso design with two factors: state zzso state, resting state, mental zzso and stimulation zzso zzso zzso hot noxious stimuli applied to right zzso zzso Two cerebral blood flow scans were obtained with the zzso technique during each zzso After each zzso the subject was asked to rate pain sensation and zzso zzso zzso mapping was used to determine the main effects of noxious stimulation and hypnotic state as well as zzso interactions zzso brain areas that would be more or less activated in hypnosis than in control conditions, under noxious zzso 

Hypnosis decreased both pain sensation and the zzso of noxious zzso zzso stimulation caused an increase in regional cerebral blood flow in the zzso zzso and anterior zzso and insular zzso The hypnotic state induced a significant zzso of a zzso zzso area and the anterior zzso zzso The interaction analysis showed that the activity in the anterior zzso zzso was related to pain perception and zzso differently in the hypnotic state than in control zzso 

Both intensity and zzso of the noxious stimuli are reduced during the hypnotic zzso In addition, hypnotic zzso of pain is zzso by the anterior zzso zzso
