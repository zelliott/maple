The zzso zzso is remarkably stable across language tasks but changes in response to injury to specific components or in response to zzso of input to one zzso We investigated network changes during language recovery, zzso that language recovery takes place through distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso recovery from zzso zzso recovery from structural zzso and zzso zzso of language, zzso various components assume function of a damaged zzso We also tested the hypothesis that zzso depends on: the language task, level of performance, size and site of stroke, and time post zzso We tested these hypotheses in five participants who had zzso zzso and functional imaging utilizing zzso reading, word generation, and picture naming tasks at acute and subsequent stages after zzso zzso These cases illustrate different mechanisms of zzso recovery or illustrate that reorganization of language acutely depends on individual variables in addition to size and site of zzso
