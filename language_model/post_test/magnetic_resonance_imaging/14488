By the year zzso zzso million older zzso adults are projected to undergo total knee zzso zzso Following this surgery, considerable muscle zzso occurs, resulting in decreased strength and impaired functional zzso Essential zzso acids zzso have been shown to zzso muscle loss during periods of reduced activity and may be beneficial for zzso zzso 

We used a zzso zzso zzso clinical trial with 28 older adults undergoing zzso Patients were zzso to zzso either 20 g of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso twice daily between meals for 1 week before and 2 weeks after zzso At zzso 2 weeks, and 6 weeks after zzso an zzso was performed to determine zzso muscle and zzso tissue zzso Muscle strength and functional mobility were also measured at these zzso 

zzso patients receiving zzso exhibited greater zzso muscle zzso with a zzso zzso zzso change from baseline to 2 weeks after surgery compared with zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso change from baseline to 6 weeks after surgery for zzso versus zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso also attenuated zzso in the zzso zzso and in the hamstring and zzso muscles of both zzso The zzso group performed better at 2 and 6 weeks after surgery on functional mobility tests (all P zzso zzso Change in zzso muscle zzso was significantly associated with change in functional mobility zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso treatment attenuated muscle zzso and accelerated the return of functional mobility in older adults following zzso
