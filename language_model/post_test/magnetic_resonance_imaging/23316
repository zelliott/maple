Evaluating zzso or global gray matter volume decline rate is important in distinguishing neurodegenerative diseases from normal aging and in anticipating cognitive decline over a given period in zzso zzso Whether a significant negative correlation exists between baseline regional gray matter volume of several regions and global gray matter volume decline in the subsequent time period in healthy subjects has not yet been zzso zzso we analyzed the correlation between baseline regional gray matter volumes and the rate of global gray matter volume decline in the period following baseline using magnetic resonance images of the brains of zzso healthy subjects by applying a zzso design over 6 years using zzso zzso As a result, the annual percentage change in gray matter ratio zzso zzso in which zzso represents the percentage of gray matter volume in the zzso volume, showed a significant negative correlation with the baseline regional gray matter volumes of the right zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso Additionally, baseline regional gray matter volume of both the right zzso and the left zzso significantly distinguished whether the zzso was above or below the mean of zzso Our results suggest that baseline regional gray matter volume predicts the rate of global gray matter volume decline in the subsequent period in healthy zzso Our study may contribute to distinguishing neurodegenerative diseases from normal aging and to predicting cognitive zzso
