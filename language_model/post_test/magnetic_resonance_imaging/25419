A case report of zzso acute complete zzso resulting from cervical disc zzso 

To describe a rare case of zzso zzso resulting from enlargement of a zzso disc in the cervical spine and to outline appropriate management of a patient with severe spinal zzso zzso secondary to disc zzso with zzso spinal canal zzso 

Acute progression of zzso into complete zzso resulting from disc zzso is zzso There are only four reported cases of zzso acute zzso secondary to cervical disc zzso No other report has described magnetic resonance imaging findings noted before and after the onset of acute zzso 

A cervical disc zzso at zzso is reported in a zzso man who had zzso acute complete zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging findings are evaluated and zzso 

zzso zzso at zzso enlarged zzso resulting in complete zzso zzso anterior zzso followed by secondary zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso resonance imaging studies revealed localized high signal intensity change in the spinal zzso No zzso recovery was achieved 3 years zzso 

We emphasize that there is a possibility of zzso irreversible progression of paralysis secondary to zzso enlargement of cervical disc zzso with canal zzso In these cases, immediate early zzso surgery is crucial to the prevention of severe zzso
