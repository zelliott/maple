While successful magnetic tumor targeting of iron oxide zzso has been achieved in a number of models, the rapid blood clearance of zzso suitable particles by the zzso system zzso limits their availability for zzso This work aimed to develop a zzso magnetic iron oxide zzso zzso platform capable of sustained tumor exposure via the circulation and, thus, potentially enhanced magnetic tumor zzso zzso zzso starch zzso and zzso zzso coated zzso were successfully modified with 5 zzso zzso zzso or 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chains using simple zzso zzso chemistry and zzso zzso zzso zzso between platforms zzso & zzso zzso & zzso were similar in size zzso zzso and relative zzso labeling zzso of surface zzso - zzso zzso - zzso with all zzso possessing zzso properties suitable for magnetic zzso zzso zzso were studied in zzso simulations in zzso to predict zzso zzso zzso and zzso performed best showing sustained size stability in cell culture medium at 37 zzso and 7 zzso to 10 zzso fold less zzso in zzso zzso when compared to previously targeted, unmodified starch zzso zzso Observations in zzso were validated in zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showing much longer zzso than D zzso zzso zzso plasma stability enhanced tumor zzso exposure 100 zzso to 150 zzso fold as measured by plasma zzso zzso tumor exposure over 24 h was visually confirmed in a zzso rat model (12 zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso indicate that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising platform for enhanced magnetic tumor zzso zzso further study in tumor zzso
