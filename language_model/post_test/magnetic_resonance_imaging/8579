We performed zzso zzso to explore the neural mechanisms that contribute to the ability to manipulate an object with complex zzso zzso zzso a weighted flexible ruler and balanced it in an unstable equilibrium position as an archetype of grasping an object with complex zzso This was contrasted with squeezing a soft foam ball as an archetype of grasping an object with simple zzso We hypothesized that changes in activity in primary motor zzso zzso would be similar under the two conditions, since muscle zzso was zzso which was zzso We hypothesized further that the zzso would be selectively activated when manipulating the flexible ruler because the ability to make the adjustments necessary to balance the ruler would require an internal dynamics model, represented in the zzso As predicted, the zzso zzso was strongly activated when balancing the weighted ruler whereas only moderate zzso was found when squeezing the foam zzso We also found evidence for selective zzso of areas, previously implicated in tactile object recognition, when holding the flexible zzso We speculate that these areas, which include secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso area 40 and zzso integrate tactile and zzso information in the context of controlling the orientation of the flexible ruler and provide appropriate feedback to zzso We speculate that the failure to find zzso of these areas when squeezing the ball was due to the fact that tactile stimulation was entirely zzso resulting in the zzso of cortical sensory activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Central cancellation of self-produced zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is involved in predicting the sensory consequences of zzso zzso 12, zzso
