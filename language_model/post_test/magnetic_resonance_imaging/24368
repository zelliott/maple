To compare biopsy performance of two approaches for zzso magnetic resonance zzso biopsy zzso with that of extended systematic biopsy zzso in prostate cancer zzso zzso 

This institutional review zzso zzso prospective study zzso 2009 to January zzso included 95 patients with informed consent who were suspected of having zzso with a suspicious zzso zzso at zzso zzso Patients underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso guidance, with two zzso aimed visually zzso zzso zzso and two zzso aimed using zzso zzso fusion software zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for cancer and sampling quality zzso longest core cancer zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso significant zzso was any 3 zzso or greater core cancer length or any greater than 3 zzso pattern for zzso or any cancer length for zzso zzso analysis included zzso test, paired zzso test, and zzso zzso zzso end point zzso cancer zzso was calculated zzso zzso zzso 

Among 95 patients zzso age, 65 years; mean zzso zzso level, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate for zzso was 59% zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso rate for clinically significant zzso was zzso zzso zzso 49) for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Cancer was diagnosed through zzso in 16 patients zzso with negative zzso zzso Mean longest core cancer lengths were zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso In 12 of 51 zzso MR imaging targets with positive zzso and zzso results, zzso led to zzso score zzso In 79 MR imaging targets, zzso for cancer was zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither technique was superior for zzso score zzso 

zzso MR imaging combined with zzso zzso zzso increases biopsy performance in detecting zzso especially clinically significant zzso No significant difference was observed between zzso and zzso for zzso zzso
