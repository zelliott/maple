An zzso technique with high selectivity and sensitivity to the signal components in the chemical shift range of zzso and zzso zzso of fatty acids has been developed for zzso assessment of muscular fat in zzso A zzso zzso sequence with zzso zzso by six zzso zzso with 2 degrees zzso degrees zzso degrees zzso degrees zzso degrees zzso degrees ) and a zzso train zzso zzso 16, 36, 56, 76, 96, and 116 zzso allowed a series of images to be recorded with a receiver bandwidth of 78 zzso per zzso zzso from zzso with zzso contents between zzso and zzso were compared to those from pure zzso Thirty healthy volunteers underwent zzso imaging of their lower leg, and parallel localized zzso zzso of the zzso anterior and the zzso muscle by a zzso zzso echo acquisition mode zzso technique zzso zzso 2 zzso TE zzso 10 zzso TM zzso 15 zzso zzso show a high correlation zzso zzso zzso between fat imaging and the zzso approach in the zzso muscle, considering the percentage total fat content of zzso The correlation zzso was clearly lower zzso zzso zzso in the zzso anterior muscle due to signal zzso from adjacent subcutaneous fat in the images, zzso fat distribution, and generally lower zzso content in this zzso zzso of the new imaging technique showed marked zzso and zzso zzso in the spatial distribution of lipids in the zzso of the lower zzso No significant correlation of the muscular fat with the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer was zzso In addition, the body mass index does not appear to determine muscular fat content, except in very obese zzso
