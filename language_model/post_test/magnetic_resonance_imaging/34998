The study of corpus zzso zzso is important to unravel the underlying connectivity zzso in zzso We studied the corpus zzso area in schizophrenia subjects compared to healthy subjects, while controlling for several zzso that could affect zzso measures of the corpus zzso zzso Areas of the whole zzso and its zzso obtained by two geometric zzso schemes were studied in 23 right-handed zzso zzso schizophrenia patients and compared with 23 right-handed zzso zzso and zzso healthy zzso The patients did not differ from controls in whole zzso zzso On zzso division of the zzso the area of the anterior zzso was significantly higher in patients compared to zzso On zzso division into 5 zzso the anterior zzso area was significantly higher in patients compared to zzso There was a significant effect of gender zzso on the area zzso however there was no significant zzso zzso Age, age of zzso duration of illness and zzso ratings did not show any significant correlations with whole zzso area and area of zzso zzso The finding of increased area of the anterior zzso that possibly comprises white zzso connecting the zzso association zzso could be indicative of an zzso functional zzso involving these regions in positive symptom zzso Additionally, the finding of females having larger areas of the whole zzso and of the anterior and middle zzso could reflect a zzso zzso underlying increased zzso in zzso
