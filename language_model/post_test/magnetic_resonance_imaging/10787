We used zzso to investigate the effects of tactile zzso on the zzso organization of the human primary zzso zzso zzso zzso consequences of zzso were studied in a zzso task assessing the zzso of tactile zzso zzso was applied to the index, middle and ring fingers of the right hand either zzso or zzso zzso representations for zzso zzso fingers moved closer together, whereas cortical representations for zzso zzso fingers became zzso zzso this pattern coincided with an increased and reduced number of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso fingers, zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso zzso of passive tactile stimulation is able to induce short-term cortical reorganization associated with functionally relevant zzso
