The purposes of the study was to assess zzso brain tumors by a blinded comparison of zzso and zzso 27 patients with known cerebral zzso or zzso were included into an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protocol included zzso SE, zzso zzso and after contrast a series of five zzso zzso sequences followed by zzso zzso with zzso zzso SE, and zzso zzso zzso Imaging data acquired at two centers were assessed on-site by the investigators and off-site by two experienced readers using quantitative and qualitative zzso For a quantitative analysis tumor contrast and zzso ratios were determined out of zzso in zzso unaffected white matter, a region outside the head, and an external reference zzso For the qualitative assessment zzso and off-site readers were asked to compare both MR scans for zzso contrast, zzso zzso and information upon the internal zzso and zzso In the quantitative analysis zzso examined with zzso present a zzso zzso increase of the zzso zzso In both, the zzso as well as the off-site assessment the intensity of enhancement and the zzso contrast were found to be significantly better with zzso enhanced zzso There was a trend towards zzso for the zzso of the zzso from the surrounding tissue and the internal zzso zzso Based on our observations zzso proved to be a safe and valuable contrast media for the assessment of zzso zzso Compared with zzso it provides a more intense contrast enhancement and a better tumor contrast which might be of importance for the further management of these zzso
