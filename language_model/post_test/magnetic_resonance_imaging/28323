zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse sequences have been used to study zzso transport processes including zzso zzso and drainage of water in soil zzso Those images provide a means for monitoring and zzso spatial and zzso changes of zzso zzso and the movement of zzso zzso In addition, zzso changes of unstable zzso fronts during water zzso were estimated from zzso images and the zzso development of the longest length of finger was described by a zzso relation zzso approximately zzso Bulk zzso displacement and zzso zzso as well as zzso maps of flow zzso and zzso zzso in soil zzso during saturated zzso flow, were reconstructed from data obtained using the zzso zzso pulse zzso
