To evaluate the ability of conventional and zzso or zero echo time zzso for imaging of soft and solid dental components in and ex zzso 

zzso spin echo zzso zzso echo time zzso and zero echo time zzso zzso were performed on extracted zzso and zzso teeth and in zzso using zzso and zzso MR systems at 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

At an zzso resolution of zzso zzso , strong signal of zzso zzso zzso and nerves with excellent contrast was achieved using zzso at zzso in zzso No zzso though, was obtained from solid zzso zzso teeth zzso to short zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso as well as zzso of extracted teeth were readily depicted using zzso and zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso In particular, zzso provided higher signal in zzso 

As an alternative to X-ray based methods like zzso zzso zzso zzso or conventional CT, the presented results demonstrate the potential of zzso and zzso zzso as a radiation-free imaging zzso delivering contrast of soft and solid components at the same zzso
