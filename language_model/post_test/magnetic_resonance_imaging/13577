zzso may be an ideal zzso intervention in zzso zzso after zzso zzso The present study describes the long-term effects of prolonged zzso zzso zzso initiated 2 h after zzso injury on brain zzso and zzso behavior in zzso zzso After right common carotid artery zzso and exposure to zzso of zzso zzso for 105 zzso 10 animals were kept zzso at 37 degrees C and 10 animals were cooled to 30 degrees C zzso temperature for 26 zzso starting 2 h after the zzso zzso All zzso animals were zzso fed to guarantee long-term zzso zzso was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral zzso zzso significantly reduced the final size of cerebral zzso by zzso at 6 zzso after the zzso The most extended tissue rescue was found in the zzso zzso p zzso zzso followed by the zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso salvaged spatial memory deficits verified at 5 zzso of recovery with Morris Water zzso zzso whereas circling abnormalities after zzso injection and sensory motor zzso on rotating treadmill improved, yet did not reach statistical zzso When compared with controls, zzso animals performed worse in all behavioral zzso zzso did not influence functional outcome in zzso zzso correlations between behavioral performance and corresponding regional brain volumes were zzso We conclude that 26 h of mild to moderate zzso zzso leads not only to brain tissue rescue, but most important to long-lasting behavioral improvement throughout brain maturation despite severity of injury and delayed onset of zzso
