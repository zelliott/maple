A growing body of evidence suggests that, independent of localized brain zzso mood disorders can be associated with dysfunction of brain networks involved in the zzso of emotional and cognitive zzso We used diffusion zzso zzso zzso to zzso the presence and extent of structural injury to the connections between the zzso and other brain regions, which included the zzso the zzso and zzso cingulate, the zzso the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso as well as the zzso 

Using a zzso zzso zzso conventional and zzso magnetic resonance imaging sequences of the brain were acquired from 15 adult patients with major depressive disorder zzso 15 with bipolar disorder zzso and 21 zzso healthy zzso Using zzso software, zzso changes of the white matter zzso fiber zzso belonging to the emotional network were zzso 

Compared to controls and zzso patients, BD patients had significantly decreased average fractional zzso increased average mean zzso and increased average zzso and zzso zzso values in the majority of the zzso fiber zzso connecting structures of the anterior zzso network zzso ranging from zzso to zzso Medication load did not influence the results with the exception of lithium, which was associated with normal zzso values in tracts connecting the zzso with the zzso zzso zzso 

We detected specific zzso zzso suggestive of disrupted integrity of fiber zzso in the brains of patients with zzso These abnormalities might contribute to understanding both mood zzso and cognitive disturbances in zzso and might provide an objective marker to monitor treatment efficacy in this zzso
