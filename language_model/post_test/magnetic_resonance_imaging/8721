zzso between zzso zzso and heavy metals such as iron, zzso or zzso are largely zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is a zzso method that allows in zzso studies of metal transport within zzso zzso The present study investigates zzso the penetration of iron zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso A spatial resolution of zzso zzso and a zzso resolution of 11 zzso are achieved with zzso zzso Spin Echo zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the slope the dependence of the relaxation rate zzso on the concentration of zzso metal zzso was used to measure zzso changes in iron concentration in the zzso zzso It took up to 300 zzso for the zzso complex zzso to penetrate into the zzso zzso zzso in zzso The diffusion was equally fast in all directions with irregularities such as zzso channels and zzso zzso Despite these zzso the overall process could be modeled using zzso equations for diffusion in a sphere, because zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso (or the presence of a zzso zzso was not zzso The effective diffusion zzso zzso of zzso was found to be zzso zzso approximately zzso of zzso of zzso in zzso The zzso model did not zzso to the processes taking place in the core of the zzso zzso of the total volume of the zzso where up to zzso zzso by iron zzso to the concentration in the bulk zzso zzso
