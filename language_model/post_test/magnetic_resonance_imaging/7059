To determine if persons with zzso zzso exhibit elevated zzso joint stress compared to pain-free controls during normal and fast walking zzso 

zzso subjects (13 zzso zzso 11 pain-free zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso magnetic resonance images of the knee were obtained to zzso subject specific knee zzso mechanics and zzso joint contact zzso zzso gait analysis was used to zzso knee joint zzso and zzso zzso and gait data were used as input variables into a model of zzso joint zzso Analysis of zzso with repeated measures was used to compare group differences and group zzso gait speed interactions for each dependent variable during zzso 

During normal speed gait there were no group differences in peak knee zzso angle, knee zzso moment, joint reaction force, or zzso However, the zzso zzso group had significantly less contact zzso During fast speed gait there were no group differences in peak knee zzso angle, knee zzso moment, or joint reaction zzso However, the zzso zzso group demonstrated significantly less contact area and significantly greater stress compared to zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated greater calculated zzso stress during fast zzso This was the result of reductions in contact area as joint reaction forces were similar between zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso may be predisposed to zzso dysfunction through zzso in joint zzso zzso treatments aimed at increasing the zzso surface area between the zzso and zzso such as zzso may be beneficial in this patient zzso
