In a number of clinical studies magnetic resonance zzso zzso has been used to examine patients with peripheral nerve damage, but little is understood about the sequence of imaging changes following nerve injuries, and how they correlate with functional zzso The goal of this study was to further understanding of these changes and their zzso 

Using the rat zzso nerve crush model, the zzso nerve was zzso at intervals over 70 days in 12 zzso zzso zzso nerves served as zzso A zzso MR zzso with a custom-made surface zzso was zzso The zzso maps were calculated from images obtained at four echo times and from regions of interest designated on the nerve at three zzso zzso analysis was performed at the same intervals as zzso zzso resonance zzso revealed a mean zzso of normal zzso nerve of 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nerves demonstrated a sequence of changes in signal intensity that were zzso at 14 days, with a mean zzso of 64 zzso zzso zzso zzso then falling to a zzso of 53 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nerves had a short and zzso rise in signal at 7 zzso zzso analysis revealed maximum deficit immediately zzso with an improvement in function approaching that of control nerves at 30 zzso 

In this study the authors demonstrate that quantitative assessment of nerve signals with MR zzso allows the sequence of events following nerve crush injury to be followed in zzso and that a return toward a normal signal zzso with functional zzso Assessment of peripheral nerve injury in patients by using MR zzso has the potential to confirm acute nerve injury as well as to monitor the recovery zzso
