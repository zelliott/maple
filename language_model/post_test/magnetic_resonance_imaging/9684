The corpus zzso zzso can be affected by childhood traumatic brain injury zzso through focal zzso reductions in size and arrested zzso Little is known, however, about what constitutes normal zzso shape and appearance and how it may be affected in the long-term after early zzso 

In this study, the appearance of the zzso was investigated in individuals with zzso assessed 10 years zzso zzso mean zzso years, zzso years, 24 zzso and compared to zzso healthy controls zzso mean zzso years, zzso years, 18 zzso A simple visual analysis technique was used to code the appearance of the zzso according to location of focal thinning and severity of thinning and results between groups were compared using zzso zzso 

A significantly higher proportion of patients with childhood zzso had focal zzso thinning of the zzso than zzso controls zzso 

The findings call into question previous conclusions that focal zzso thinning is a normal zzso of zzso Instead, zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso in the long-term may reflect altered cortical and zzso development as a result of early brain injury, although the functional significance of this remains to be zzso
