The supplementary motor zzso zzso is located anterior to the primary motor cortex, and is considered to play an important role in planning, initiating and maintaining sequential motor zzso Disturbance of this area sometimes causes severe zzso zzso If the zzso doesn't affect the primary motor cortex, motor function will recover in relatively early zzso zzso We encountered two cases in which the patients developed zzso severe zzso after zzso of a zzso frontal lobe zzso although there was no apparent change shown in the monitoring of zzso motor evoked potential zzso Both cases recovered from zzso in the early zzso zzso In our cases, the disturbances of zzso were considered to be the causes of the development of transient zzso zzso zzso monitoring is useful to distinguish the damage of the primary motor area from that of the zzso
