We studied the effect of the cortical projection from the zzso zzso on the cerebral cortical metabolism using zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso damage of the nucleus zzso zzso zzso did not cause a permanent reduction of cortical zzso recovery was observed 4 weeks after the zzso zzso of the zzso side after recovery from unilateral damage produced persistent bilateral suppression of zzso zzso with partial zzso We speculate that recovery from the unilateral zzso zzso is partly zzso to the zzso projection from the zzso zzso and partly due to zzso systems, and conclude that bilateral damage might be responsible for persistent cortical zzso metabolism zzso
