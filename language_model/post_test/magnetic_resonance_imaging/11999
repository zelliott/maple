zzso of the head is routinely performed with zzso sequences whereas zzso sequences are still zzso Certain features of fast imaging sequences make them a promising tool for clinical zzso The relative high zzso zzso time demonstrates the usefulness of GE imaging as zzso zzso The extremely high zzso is sometimes superior to zzso imaging and may help to zzso structures and zzso zzso dynamics are more clearly depicted than with zzso sequences and lead to the dynamic evaluation of zzso motion zzso flow, blood zzso This information may be used in a special mode to achieve MR zzso Due to the very short repetition times, GE sequences are zzso suited to zzso zzso This enables to reduce slice thickness to less than 1 zzso with optional reconstructions in any virtual zzso In view of present developments in zzso GE imaging will be accepted in clinical diagnostic imaging in the near zzso
