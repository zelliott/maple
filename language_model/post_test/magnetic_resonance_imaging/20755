zzso zzso of the zzso zone zzso is the most important predictor of poor outcome after zzso surgery for intractable zzso We analyzed the contribution of zzso and zzso variables including zzso and zzso data as zzso of zzso zzso outcome after incomplete zzso 

We zzso reviewed patients zzso years of age with incomplete zzso for zzso with 2 years of zzso Fourteen zzso and zzso variables were compared in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We compared zzso patients, zzso by reason for zzso to zzso patients with complete zzso We analyzed for effect of complete zzso zzso on zzso outcome in patients with incompletely zzso zzso zzso and vice zzso 

zzso patients with incomplete zzso were included with zzso becoming zzso Forty-eight zzso patients with complete zzso were zzso zzso percent zzso of patients with incomplete zzso and zzso zzso with complete zzso were excluded secondary to lack of follow-up or incomplete zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso of seizure freedom after incomplete zzso zzso percent of patients incomplete by zzso alone, zzso incomplete by zzso alone, and zzso incomplete by both became zzso compared to zzso of patients with complete zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Complete zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso is the best predictor of seizure freedom, though patients incomplete by zzso or zzso alone have better outcome compared to patients incomplete by zzso More than one-third of patients with incomplete zzso become zzso with zzso zzso zzso a predictor of zzso zzso
