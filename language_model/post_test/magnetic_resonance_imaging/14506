zzso zzso zzso rods haves some preferred zzso properties over titanium rods for spinal zzso The use of zzso rods in spinal fusion is relatively new, and there is no study in the existing world literature assessing the artifact caused by these rods in patients undergoing zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to compare the amount of imaging artifact caused by these implants and to assess its impact on the zzso of neighboring neural zzso 

This study investigated MR images in patients who underwent zzso of zzso zzso using zzso zzso rods between November 2009 and March 2011 and images obtained in a comparison group of patients who had zzso titanium rods implanted during the same time zzso zzso zzso of the artifact created by the rods between the screw heads were compared between the zzso Two blinded zzso zzso performed the zzso zzso They scored the zzso of the spinal canal using a zzso scoring system of zzso with 1 representing very good zzso and 2 and 3 representing reduced zzso or zzso zzso zzso as a result of zzso zzso All zzso and scores were independently provided for zzso and zzso fast spin echo sequences zzso zzso zzso slice zzso 

A total of 40 levels from the zzso group (6 zzso and 30 levels from the titanium group (9 zzso were included in the zzso zzso of the canal at all levels was rated a score of 1 zzso zzso by both zzso for both the zzso and titanium zzso The average artifact on zzso images measured zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the titanium group zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso on zzso images were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In a mixed zzso model, the mean artifact measurement for the zzso group was, on average, zzso zzso larger than for the control zzso There was no significant difference between the zzso of the 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The artifact caused by zzso rods is approximately zzso zzso larger than that caused by titanium rods on zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, artifact from either zzso or titanium was not found to interfere with the evaluation of the spinal canal and surrounding neural zzso
