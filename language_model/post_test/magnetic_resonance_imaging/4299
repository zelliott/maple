In the companion to this paper zzso zzso zzso zzso Aguirre, and zzso zzso 1997, zzso zzso we describe an zzso of a general linear model for zzso observations in which the zzso zzso rates in zzso zzso zzso were stabilized and brought close to theoretical zzso Here, zzso of the model are tested for use with statistical zzso mapping analysis of zzso smoothed zzso zzso zzso using varying models of intrinsic zzso zzso and either including or excluding a global signal zzso were conducted upon human subject data collected under zzso hypothesis as well as under experimental zzso We found that smoothing with an zzso derived impulse response function zzso combined with a model of the intrinsic zzso zzso in zzso smoothed zzso data, resulted in a zzso zzso rate which did not exceed a zzso level when a nominal alpha zzso zzso tabular threshold was zzso Use of other models of intrinsic zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso rates that significantly exceeded this zzso zzso data collected while subjects performed a behavioral task were used to examine zzso zzso global signal changes and zzso the dependence of sensitivity on the zzso smoothing kernel and zzso of a global signal zzso The global signal changes within an zzso zzso were shown to be influenced by the performance of a behavioral zzso However, the inclusion of this measure as a zzso did not have an adverse affect upon our measure of zzso Finally, use of an zzso derived estimate of the zzso of the system was shown to result in greater zzso sensitivity for signal changes than the use of a broader (in zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso
