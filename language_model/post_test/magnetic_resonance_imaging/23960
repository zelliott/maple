zzso fracture of the zzso has been recognized as a major cause of lower back pain, especially in elderly zzso patients with or without underlying zzso and/or prior pelvic zzso Its diagnosis cannot be readily made from its zzso clinical zzso zzso some cases may be mistaken for bone zzso causing patients to receive inappropriate diagnostic measures and zzso zzso of the spectrum of imaging features is the basis of correct diagnosis and zzso 

The imaging studies of 14 cases (12 women and 2 zzso age range, zzso years; mean age, 70 zzso of zzso zzso fracture were reviewed zzso These included 14 zzso six bone zzso eight computerized zzso zzso scans and 12 magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso Six patients had a history of zzso Diagnosis was made by characteristic imaging findings, and clinical and zzso follow-up for one to zzso zzso 

Five cases of zzso zzso fracture were suspected based on zzso findings of fracture lines (2 zzso and focal sclerosis (3 zzso Seven cases were diagnosed by CT findings of linear fractures (7 zzso and focal sclerosis (2 zzso Nine MR examinations demonstrated characteristic vertical bands of zzso zzso A zzso fracture line was identified in eight zzso The remaining two MR imaging studies disclosed zzso focal zzso zzso An early case, which appeared normal on CT zzso showed zzso zzso on MR zzso The positive and diagnostic rates were both zzso for plain zzso zzso for CT scans, and zzso and zzso respectively, for MR zzso 

Plain zzso are often zzso Although MR imaging is the most sensitive zzso fracture lines are best demonstrated and diagnosed using zzso Due to the better diagnostic rate, popularity and cost effectiveness, CT is recommended as the definitive zzso for confirming diagnosis of zzso fracture of the zzso
