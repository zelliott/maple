Several functional imaging studies have shown that the extent of zzso and percentage change in cerebral blood flow in the supplementary motor area zzso during a zzso mirror performance of a simple repetitive movement are almost identical to those during a zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether this finding was also zzso to a more complex zzso Eight zzso healthy volunteers performed zzso (with their right and left zzso and zzso (in a mirror zzso zzso opposition in a zzso order zzso zzso zzso The zzso proper was more activated during the zzso movement than the zzso movement with either zzso This is in accordance with the hypothesis that zzso movement, even in a mirror fashion, is more difficult than zzso movement when the task is complex but not when the task is zzso zzso was zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso proper plays an active role in executive processing during zzso mirror performance of complex zzso
