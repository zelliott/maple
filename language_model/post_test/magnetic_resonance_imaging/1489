To investigate the use of a three-dimensional rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement zzso pulse sequence for direct acquisition of zzso zzso images of the human zzso 

A short elliptical zzso zzso zzso body zzso was constructed to produce a uniform flip angle throughout the chest zzso In zzso images using a zzso zzso sequence with a spatial resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (4 zzso were acquired in nine minutes and 40 zzso 

zzso of zzso demonstrated excellent spectral zzso The zzso ratio in the zzso ranged from zzso in the anterior wall to zzso in the mid zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso data can be acquired using a three-dimensional zzso sequence with greater spatial and zzso resolution than zzso zzso
