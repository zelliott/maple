zzso is a complex zzso though it consistently includes characteristics of zzso A number of brain regions are suggested to be involved in cocaine addiction, including the zzso which serves diverse functions including zzso awareness and integration of neural signals from zzso zzso and frontal zzso Malfunction of this integration links impulsive behavior to the zzso 

This study examines intrinsic connectivity of the zzso in chronic cocaine users to investigate abnormal insular circuitry, its role in cocaine addiction, and relationships to measure of zzso 

zzso individuals zzso zzso zzso and healthy controls zzso zzso zzso completed a zzso zzso zzso An intrinsic connectivity network zzso approach generated metrics of mean network connectivity and zzso connectivity from zzso zzso zzso pertaining to zzso involving zzso and other structures repeatedly involved in addiction zzso zzso were selected for analysis, which included the capacity to discriminate zzso zzso between group discriminating connectivity metrics and behavioral zzso were zzso 

Models demonstrated group prediction accuracy up to zzso zzso of zzso was obtained by a zzso model of six zzso connectivity zzso The zzso connectivity between an zzso involving the anterior zzso and zzso and an zzso involving the zzso was significantly weaker in cocaine users relative to zzso The degree of reduced zzso connectivity was significantly related to greater zzso zzso in cocaine zzso 

zzso zzso intrinsic connectivity patterns are observed in cocaine users and include zzso in zzso to zzso zzso which is zzso linked to increased zzso pertaining to zzso
