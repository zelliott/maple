zzso coupled implanted coils have been shown to provide up to a zzso increase in zzso ratio when compared to zzso imaging of small zzso The current study was designed to extend the implanted zzso imaging technique to a zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coils were implanted around the left kidney of four rats and zzso coupled from within a zzso body zzso All images were acquired at 2 T using a zzso zzso sequence with zzso zzso 500 zzso and TE zzso 20 zzso In zzso MR zzso with zzso of 117 zzso 117 zzso 2000 zzso demonstrated cortex, inner and outer zzso and major vascular structures on baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso acute zzso necrosis zzso diminished zzso contrast at 24 h after dosing with zzso evaluation demonstrating zzso changes in the inner zzso The kidney regained a baseline MR appearance 360 h after dosing and resolution of the damage was confirmed with zzso zzso data were gathered on excised zzso as an adjunct to the images to help correlate the loss and return of zzso contrast with the pathology and zzso of zzso zzso With implanted zzso coils we were able to demonstrate zzso pathology and follow its subsequent zzso Specifically, loss and return of zzso contrast as a result of zzso zzso were serially documented in four zzso Such serial in zzso studies performed on single animals should further the use of MR zzso by minimizing the number of animals required for adequate zzso
