The goal of the present set of studies was to characterize the in zzso binding properties and in zzso tissue zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso binding studies were conducted in order to determine the affinity of the zzso and zzso of zzso for the zzso as well as zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2) zzso zzso was found to have a high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and lower affinities for zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso had similar affinities for the zzso and zzso 1 receptors zzso 20 zzso and a lower affinity for zzso 2 (110 zzso zzso PET imaging studies were conducted in zzso monkeys zzso zzso 3) with zzso zzso was found to have a high zzso and slow rate of zzso from the zzso zzso which is consistent with the labeling of zzso zzso in this brain zzso zzso also displayed zzso binding zzso during the 3 h time course of PET and produced zzso zzso that did not cross the zzso zzso The results from the current in zzso and in zzso studies indicate that zzso is a promising zzso for studying zzso terminal density, with zzso via the zzso
