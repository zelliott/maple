We performed zzso zzso in normal children to clarify which cortical areas are commonly involved in the mirror system zzso and zzso which areas are specific for zzso and whether children have the same neural networks for zzso and zzso as zzso zzso children had the same neural networks for the zzso and zzso as zzso Common zzso were found in the superior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso whereas zzso specific zzso was found in the zzso zzso zzso pole and the inferior zzso zzso We suggest that zzso might evolve from a capacity to detect the motion of agents and to zzso zzso Further, zzso might require zzso
