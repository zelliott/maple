More effective imaging methods are needed to overcome the limitations of CT in the investigation of treatments for acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is sensitive in detecting zzso brain zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso can detect brain zzso in the same imaging zzso Combining these methods may help in identifying the zzso zzso which is an important concept in the zzso of acute zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined zzso and zzso in acute zzso zzso zzso stroke can predict zzso growth and final zzso 

zzso patients with acute zzso stroke underwent zzso and zzso on days 1, 2, and zzso No patient received zzso zzso patients underwent zzso zzso CT in the acute zzso zzso volumes were measured from zzso zzso and maps of relative cerebral blood flow calculated from zzso 

The mean volume of zzso tissue detected by zzso increased from zzso to zzso zzso between days 1 and 2 zzso zzso and to zzso zzso after 1 week zzso zzso The zzso mismatch correlated with zzso growth zzso zzso zzso The volume of zzso on the initial zzso correlated with final zzso size zzso zzso The zzso volumes detected by zzso and zzso correlated significantly zzso zzso 

Combined zzso and zzso can predict zzso enlargement in acute zzso zzso can detect zzso brain tissue in good agreement with zzso in acute zzso
