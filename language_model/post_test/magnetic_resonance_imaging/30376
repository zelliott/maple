To evaluate accuracy of manual, semiautomatic and automatic zzso methods to zzso cardiac function zzso volumes, and left zzso zzso 

Ten zzso miniature pigs zzso male, three zzso mean weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated using a zzso zzso MR scanner and zzso zzso zzso Short axis images were employed to zzso cardiac zzso In all animals volumes zzso volume, zzso volume, stroke zzso ejection fraction and left zzso mass was zzso To zzso these parameters three different zzso methods zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The correlation of different zzso methods for each variable was zzso 

No statistically significant differences in left zzso volume or mass zzso using different zzso methods was found zzso zzso zzso zzso to estimate ejection fraction and zzso volume was good zzso zzso zzso and turned to be excellent for the rest of the variables zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso time was less for semiautomatic and automatic methods than for the manual zzso 

zzso sequences allow to accurately evaluate cardiac function parameters and left zzso mass in a large animal model with any of the zzso method described in this zzso zzso zzso methods allow rapid zzso of cardiac zzso
