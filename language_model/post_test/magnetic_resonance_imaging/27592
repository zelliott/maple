zzso the zzso role in the cortical expression of the Sleep Slow zzso zzso in humans by comparing zzso features in a case of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a group of zzso 

We characterize zzso in a 51-year-old male with zzso carrying the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso at the zzso 129 zzso of the zzso gene and in eight gender and zzso healthy zzso zzso (21 zzso electrodes, two consecutive zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso evaluations were carried out for the patient in the middle course of the disease (five months after the onset of zzso disease zzso 10 zzso We measured a set of features describing each zzso zzso the wave shape, the zzso location, the number and the location of all waves belonging to the event, and the grouping of zzso activity as a function of the zzso zzso 

We found that the zzso individual showed a marked reduction of zzso event rate and wave zzso zzso as well as a significant reduction in grouping zzso activity, especially in frontal zzso These zzso paralleled zzso changes in the zzso and the zzso zzso 

This work gives a quantitative picture of spontaneous zzso activity during the zzso sleep of a zzso zzso The results suggest that a zzso zzso specifically alters the cortical expression of the zzso This characterization also provides indications about zzso zzso in zzso activity in zzso
