To compare zzso zzso computerized zzso zzso findings with acute injury severity zzso disability at acute hospital admission and discharge from zzso rehabilitation, injury severity zzso and degree of zzso cerebral zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso chart review of 240 consecutive traumatic brain injury zzso admissions zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso initial brain zzso All zzso CT abnormalities were zzso zzso zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In a representative zzso cerebral zzso was determined by the zzso ratio zzso method and zzso from zzso scans 25 or more days zzso 

CT zzso resulted in zzso differences in zzso and zzso ratings at the time of discharge from the rehabilitation unit, except in zzso injury subjects who had significantly higher zzso and lower zzso scores at rehabilitation zzso At 25 or more days zzso presence of any zzso CT zzso was associated with larger zzso Increased zzso as an index of cerebral zzso was associated with worse rehabilitation discharge zzso and zzso zzso 

Other than zzso injury, zzso CT findings relate poorly to rehabilitation zzso zzso of zzso CT abnormalities were associated with the development of cerebral zzso which was associated with poorer rehabilitation discharge zzso and zzso zzso
