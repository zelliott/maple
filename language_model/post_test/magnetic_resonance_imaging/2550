To evaluate the effect of the hybrid zzso zzso acquisition with relaxation zzso zzso commonly coupled to zzso pulse zzso on the zzso zzso time zzso of fluid and fat using both zzso and human zzso 

Two zzso simulating fat zzso zzso and zzso fluid zzso B), respectively, were zzso using a fast zzso sequence that coupled an zzso preparation pulse to a hybrid zzso zzso At repetition times zzso ranging from 700 to zzso the zzso necessary to zzso the signal from each phantom zzso zzso was determined for an echo train length of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20, zzso zzso of zzso zzso versus echo train length at different zzso were generated for both zzso Fast zzso MR imaging of the cervical spine and brain was performed in healthy zzso At a fixed zzso and zzso the zzso of signal suppression from bone zzso and zzso fluid was assessed as a function of echo train zzso 

There was a gradual decrease of zzso zzso for both zzso with echo train zzso This decrease persisted at longer zzso for phantom B zzso zzso zzso zzso 70 zzso than for phantom A zzso zzso 218 zzso 5 zzso In the human volunteers, there was a gradual loss of suppression of signal from bone zzso and zzso fluid, with changes in the hybrid zzso zzso 

To zzso specific tissue suppression, zzso implementing fast zzso MR imaging should be aware of the effects of the hybrid zzso zzso on zzso zzso
