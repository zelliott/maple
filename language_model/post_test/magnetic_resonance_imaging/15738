In this work, we propose a symmetrical zzso zzso information fusion approach dedicated to the identification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unlike existing, zzso zzso data fusion zzso we build a joint zzso zzso model that explicitly accounts for local zzso of zzso and zzso activities, which are supposed to share a common zzso Under a dedicated assumption of zzso zzso the spatial profile of the common zzso sources is introduced as an unknown zzso prior on both markers of cerebral zzso zzso a devoted zzso zzso zzso learning scheme is derived to zzso common zzso sources from a joint zzso zzso This yields an estimate of the common spatial profile, which is built as a zzso between information extracted from zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the spatial structure of the zzso zzso is learned exclusively from the zzso The proposed data zzso model and devoted zzso learning scheme thus provide an zzso well-balanced approach for the fusion of zzso zzso We first demonstrate our approach on synthetic zzso zzso show that, in contrast to classical zzso fusion approach, the method proved efficient and robust regardless of the zzso zzso zzso We apply the method on zzso recordings from a patient with zzso in order to identify brain areas involved during the generation of zzso zzso The results are validated using zzso zzso zzso
