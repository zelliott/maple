Earlier zzso studies of motor function in schizophrenia have demonstrated reduced functional zzso in the motor network during motor zzso Here, we used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging during a visually guided motor task in 18 clinically unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia and 24 matched controls to investigate if abnormal functional zzso is related to genetic risk for this brain zzso Whereas activity associated with motor task performance was mainly zzso with only a marginal zzso component in healthy participants, unaffected siblings had strong bilateral activity with significantly greater response in zzso and zzso zzso areas as well as in zzso zzso motor regions relative to zzso zzso zzso in siblings was also identified with a measure of zzso zzso These findings suggest that abnormal functional zzso of motor zzso is related to genetic risk of zzso
