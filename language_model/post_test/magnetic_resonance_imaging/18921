The zzso white zzso zzso is a brain zzso detected on magnetic resonance imaging zzso in some people with human zzso virus zzso zzso This finding has previously been associated with clinical findings of cognitive zzso particularly regarding zzso The current study provides preliminary zzso of the previously reported clinical finding of zzso memory zzso through formal zzso evaluation over zzso Specifically, despite comparable baseline performances, 8-10 months later subjects without the zzso improved performance on zzso verbal memory testing, while subjects with the zzso zzso the magnitude of this zzso on follow-up was zzso to zzso standard zzso In contrast, general cognitive status, as assessed through performance on the zzso State zzso remained comparable between groups and stable over zzso Further, the comparable zzso count and zzso scores at baseline counters the argument that the zzso is simply a marker of zzso disease zzso These preliminary findings suggest the need for future research of the hypotheses raised zzso particularly salient is the hypothesis that the zzso may serve as an earlier marker indicating zzso treatment before memory impairment is clinically zzso
