zzso remains an exclusion criterion in diagnosing multiple system zzso zzso This study aimed to determine the cognitive changes and brain zzso patterns in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso tests were applied to 10 zzso and 13 zzso patients, and compared to 37 zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed between cognitive test results and zzso data extracted from the zzso zzso 

In zzso testing, the 23 zzso patients scored lower in the zzso interference test and took longer in the zzso test as compared with the controls, whereas zzso performed worse than zzso in the memory scores, zzso test, and time to complete the zzso zzso zzso as a group, showed zzso in the zzso insular cortex, zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso Memory scores correlated well with zzso lobe zzso but not in the insular zzso 

In conclusion, although zzso is not a typical presenting feature of zzso and is regarded as a zzso movement disorder, frontal zzso cognitive changes, and zzso are identifiable as zzso zzso
