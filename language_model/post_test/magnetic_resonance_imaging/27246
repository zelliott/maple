In natural zzso a sound can be heard as stable despite the presence of other occasionally louder zzso For example, when a portion in a voice is replaced by masking noise, the interrupted voice may still appear zzso zzso Previous research found that continuity illusions of simple interrupted sounds, such as tones, are accompanied by weaker activity in the primary auditory zzso zzso during the interruption than zzso zzso zzso of these zzso Here, we studied whether continuity illusions of more natural and more complex sounds also emerge from this zzso We used zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans to measure simultaneously continuity ratings and blood zzso zzso activity to zzso that were partially replaced by masking zzso zzso with previous results on tone continuity zzso we found zzso reports of more salient vowel continuity illusions associated with weaker activity in auditory zzso zzso with reports of zzso zzso zzso of physically identical zzso In contrast to the reduced activity to tone continuity illusions in zzso this reduction was localized in the right zzso zzso zzso a region that zzso more to the zzso Our findings suggest that the ability to hear differently complex sounds as stable during other louder sounds may be attributable to a common zzso mechanism that operates at different levels of sound representation in auditory zzso
