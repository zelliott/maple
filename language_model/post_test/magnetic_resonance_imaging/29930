zzso zzso with similar properties are grouped in zzso structures and supplied by matching vascular zzso The zzso response to zzso zzso however, is not well described on a fine spatial zzso We investigated the zzso characteristics of zzso responses to zzso zzso in rat barrel zzso using optical intrinsic signal imaging and zzso Imaging was performed at zzso zzso to provide functional maps of cerebral blood volume zzso changes and at 610 zzso to estimate zzso zzso To emphasize zzso rather than large vessel contributions to the functional zzso responses, we developed an zzso statistical analysis zzso zzso maps were compared with underlying zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso determined zzso responses localized accurately to individually zzso barrel columns and could resolve neighboring columns with a resolution better than 400 zzso Both zzso and early zzso responses extended beyond anatomical boundaries of single zzso but this vascular point spread did not zzso spatial zzso These results indicate that zzso flow control structures providing targeted flow increases to metabolically active zzso columns also produce finely localized changes in zzso This spatial zzso along with the high zzso ratio, makes the zzso response an attractive mapping zzso We also found that functional zzso changes can achieve zzso specificity not only during the transient zzso zzso zzso but also during the early part of the zzso zzso therefore, suggest that to zzso zzso spatial zzso appropriate response timing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso is more important than zzso zzso or zzso
