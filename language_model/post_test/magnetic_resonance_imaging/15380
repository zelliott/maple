The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnostic efficacy of zzso zzso and the zzso State zzso zzso in zzso zzso mild cognitive impairment from the normal changes of zzso 

The conditions of healthy older persons zzso zzso 17) and persons with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso were classified on the basis of results of comprehensive zzso zzso All subjects underwent zzso at 4 zzso including high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso volume was calculated by tracing right and left zzso zzso on zzso slices and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis and zzso zzso analysis were performed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of zzso volume and the zzso in zzso subjects with zzso mild cognitive impairment from subjects with normal cognitive zzso 

The mean zzso zzso area under the receiver operating characteristics curve zzso for left zzso volume zzso zzso zzso was greater than that for right zzso volume zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso score zzso zzso zzso was intermediate and not statistically different from that of zzso volume zzso zzso The zzso for the combination of left zzso volume and zzso score zzso was significantly greater than that of zzso score alone zzso zzso zzso 

In the diagnosis of zzso mild cognitive zzso use of left zzso volume may be more zzso than use of right zzso volume and may add to the value of routine screening zzso zzso zzso zzso may become a useful diagnostic adjunct in settings in which sophisticated zzso testing is not readily zzso
