The aim of our study was to compare volume change in zzso matter zzso and white matter zzso in a group of subjects with zzso and a healthy control zzso We tried to find a regular pattern of zzso within and between zzso and zzso and to determine whether any particular areas are more sensitive to zzso zzso 

There were 19 zzso patients and 20 zzso and zzso control zzso We acquired MR images on a zzso scanner and performed zzso zzso using the zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso showed a significant decrease in zzso volume, mainly in the anterior zzso cortex, middle zzso zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso superior frontal zzso middle frontal zzso middle zzso zzso anterior insular zzso and zzso In addition, we observed volume decreases in smaller areas such as the zzso cortex, the inferior zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso All zzso areas with zzso were near those zzso areas that experienced volume zzso There was more volume zzso in zzso areas corresponding to zzso areas with more volume zzso zzso increased with disease zzso 

There is simultaneous zzso in zzso and zzso and the degree of zzso is greater with longer disease zzso Different zzso and zzso areas have different sensitivities to zzso zzso 

This study examines the zzso pattern in and between zzso and zzso subject that has not been widely researched zzso
