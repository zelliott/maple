To date, despite possible zzso importance, no magnetic resonance zzso zzso study on zzso has been performed in obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso The purpose of the present study was therefore to compare zzso chemicals in patients with zzso with those in healthy subjects with no zzso 

zzso patients meeting zzso criteria for zzso and 18 healthy controls were zzso The patients and controls underwent zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and measures of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso regions were zzso 

Both zzso and zzso ratios in the zzso in patients with zzso were reduced relative to healthy zzso The zzso showed a zzso effect of diagnosis for zzso and a significant effect for zzso but the zzso did not show any significant effect even at a trend level for zzso No main effect of zzso was found for any zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso zzso is suggested in zzso Future zzso zzso and zzso studies with larger patient samples are warranted in order to confirm these preliminary findings to better characterize the relevance of zzso abnormalities in zzso in the zzso of zzso
