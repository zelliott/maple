To determine whether zzso symptoms in zzso with zzso bodies zzso are associated with greater zzso of the zzso nucleus in comparison with patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso and vascular zzso zzso 

zzso MR scans were acquired in elderly patients with zzso zzso zzso and healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso nucleus were obtained and zzso symptoms rated using zzso and zzso zzso 

There were no significant differences in the volume of the zzso nucleus between patients with zzso However, the left zzso volume was significantly reduced in zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso symptoms did not correlate with zzso nucleus zzso 

zzso symptoms in zzso may be more closely coupled to zzso rather than structural changes in the zzso nucleus, and zzso zzso analysis of zzso nucleus does not discriminate between patients with zzso zzso and zzso
