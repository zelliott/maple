We present two cases with acute onset of vertical gaze zzso mainly consisting of impaired zzso and zzso of downward head movements, together with zzso deficits zzso impaired attention and disorders of memory and affective zzso CT and zzso revealed bilateral zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to the red nucleus, thus being restricted to the territory of the zzso zzso zzso artery, which includes the region of the zzso zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso as the main zzso nucleus for the generation of vertical zzso In our patients, zzso examination with zzso and magnetic search zzso recording showed severe impairment of downward more than upward zzso and only minor deficits of vertical pursuit and the zzso zzso Visual functions were normal, with one zzso a zzso test of motion perception revealed a significant deficit in the detection of vertical zzso This could be due to a central zzso mechanism which, in order to minimize zzso might elevate thresholds for vertical motion perception in cases of vertical gaze zzso As an alternative explanation, zzso within the zzso zzso could have damaged zzso visual pathways involved in motion zzso
