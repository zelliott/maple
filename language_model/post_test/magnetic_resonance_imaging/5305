Human zzso stem cells zzso offer significant therapeutic potential in the field of zzso medicine and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso is useful zzso to zzso in zzso zzso of transplanted stem zzso For successful MR imaging, there is a great need for effective contrast agents for stem cell labeling with high zzso yield and low zzso Here, we present zzso iron oxide zzso zzso coated with zzso zzso zzso as a new negative contrast agent for in zzso MR imaging of zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was effective without the aid of zzso agents, which was dependent on the concentration and exposure zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso was greater than that of zzso zzso coated with zzso by approximately 3 folds when treated for 1 zzso zzso and zzso blue zzso confirmed that zzso zzso were zzso into the zzso of zzso which existed during in zzso subculture for 28 zzso Low temperature zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the incorporation of zzso into zzso was likely to be zzso by zzso When the phantom of zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso signals of zzso zzso were zzso correlated with the concentration of the zzso The cellular labeling using zzso did not reduce the zzso proliferation or differentiation potential to zzso and zzso lineages of zzso When the zzso zzso were transplanted into the left zzso zzso zzso of nude mice, they were successfully zzso and detected by zzso and zzso zzso for a zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso are promising as a new zzso contrast agent for in zzso long-term tracking of zzso
