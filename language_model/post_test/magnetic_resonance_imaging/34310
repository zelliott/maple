The aim of this study was to describe six variations of the zzso zzso approach, their application, and treatment zzso 

During a zzso period 69 patients underwent surgery in which six variations of the zzso zzso approach were zzso The variations zzso the zzso approach zzso performed to treat four zzso in the upper cervical spine anterior or zzso to the spinal zzso the zzso approach, to treat five zzso zzso located zzso to the zzso zzso and six vascular zzso to expose the zzso segment of the zzso artery zzso the partial zzso approach zzso to treat 18 zzso zzso located anterior to the zzso zzso the complete zzso approach zzso to treat 13 zzso zzso that involved the lower zzso and anterior upper cervical zzso the zzso zzso approach, to treat 14 jugular zzso zzso and the zzso approach with or without division of the zzso zzso to treat complex VA and zzso junction zzso An anatomical zzso was performed to study the surgical exposure of each of the six variations of the zzso zzso zzso Total removal was achieved in 35 zzso of the patients with zzso zzso zzso was achieved in 16 zzso of those zzso In the 12 patients with VA zzso seven underwent zzso three underwent zzso and a vein graft bypass zzso and two underwent zzso without the use of a bypass zzso In five other patients, different zzso zzso and other vascular zzso were successfully zzso Fifty percent of the patients who underwent surgery via the zzso zzso via the of the zzso and zzso via the zzso required an zzso fusion zzso The mean zzso Performance zzso score was zzso preoperatively and zzso zzso Major complications were zzso zzso zzso zzso fluid leakage zzso zzso worsened zzso nerve function zzso zzso zzso zzso (one zzso and zzso zzso zzso (one zzso 

To treat zzso in the region of the zzso zzso and surrounding areas, the approach should be tailored to each specific zzso to provide the needed exposure without unnecessary operative zzso
