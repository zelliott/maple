For many years, it has been assumed that medications affect brain chemistry and physiology but not zzso Recent reports suggest that zzso medication changes zzso zzso zzso To explore this possibility, the authors assessed for zzso zzso volume change in individuals who had their zzso zzso structures delineated and measured on magnetic resonance scans at the beginning and end of a zzso period and who received zzso medication during this zzso 

The zzso zzso volumes of 23 male patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were measured from manual traces zzso the zzso and zzso nucleus on magnetic resonance images at admission and 2 years zzso zzso zzso exposure was calculated over the 2 years by using a zzso zzso 

During the zzso period, mean zzso zzso volume of patients receiving predominantly typical zzso increased, while the opposite was observed for patients receiving mostly zzso zzso zzso analysis for the entire group showed a positive relationship between the zzso exposure to typical zzso medication and change in zzso zzso volume and the reverse for exposure to zzso zzso 

In this group, zzso zzso volume increased following exposure to typical zzso and decreased following exposure to zzso zzso
