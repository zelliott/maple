The appearance and evolution of zzso abnormalities following abusive head trauma zzso is important for establishing the time frame over which these injuries might have zzso From a legal perspective this frames the timing of the abuse and therefore identifies and excludes potential zzso A previous pilot study involving 33 infants with zzso helped to refine the timing of these injuries but was limited by its small sample zzso In the present study, the authors analyzed a larger group of 210 cases involving infants with zzso to chronicle the first appearance and evolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

All children younger than 24 months admitted to the Penn State Hershey Medical Center with zzso over a 10-year period were identified from a medical record zzso the time of injury was determined through an evaluation of the clinical zzso All imaging studies were zzso and the appearance and evolution of abnormalities were chronicled on serial zzso studies obtained in the days and weeks after zzso 

One hundred five infants with specific injury dates and available imaging studies were zzso a subset of 43 children additionally had documented times of zzso In infants with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on initial CT scans, the first zzso component appeared within the zzso between zzso and 16 days after injury, and the last zzso zzso component disappeared between 2 and 40 days after zzso In infants with zzso zzso on initial scans, the last zzso component disappeared between 1 and 181 zzso zzso zzso appeared on CT scans performed as early as zzso hours, and all were visible within 27 hours after the zzso zzso into zzso was documented in 17 cases zzso and was always zzso zzso resonance imaging of the brain was performed in 49 zzso Among those with zzso 5 patterns were zzso zzso I and II reflected homogeneous zzso zzso I zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso more commonly appeared on scans performed earlier after injury compared with zzso II zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso although there was considerable zzso zzso III and IV reflected zzso zzso zzso III contained relatively equal zzso having different zzso whereas zzso IV had fluid that was predominantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso Again, zzso III more commonly appeared on scans performed earlier after injury compared with zzso IV, although there was significant zzso 

These data extend the preliminary data reported by zzso and colleagues and provide a framework upon which injuries in zzso can be timed as well as the limitations on such timing zzso
