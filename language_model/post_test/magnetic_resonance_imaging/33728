zzso sclerosis is the most common zzso associated with zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso is effective for the control of medically zzso zzso in these zzso Before the advent of MR imaging, zzso sclerosis was rarely diagnosed zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of zzso sclerosis in children with intractable zzso lobe zzso and the accuracy and reliability with which zzso sclerosis can be diagnosed on the basis of MR findings in zzso 

We reviewed the MR images of 53 children zzso age, 10 zzso with medically zzso zzso lobe zzso The MR images were reviewed blindly and independently by two zzso on two occasions, and were classified as showing zzso zzso other zzso or no zzso zzso sclerosis was diagnosed when evidence of zzso zzso was present or zzso signal intensity was abnormal without evidence of a mass zzso 

MR images showed zzso sclerosis in 30 children zzso other zzso in 10 zzso zzso in eight, cavernous zzso in one, and zzso gray matter in one), and no zzso in 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso was zzso with zzso zzso in 36 zzso of 39 zzso zzso sclerosis was bilateral in one child and associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso sclerosis was detected on MR images of 11 zzso of 13 children with zzso confirmation of zzso zzso zzso results were seen in 26 zzso of 29 children who had zzso zzso 

zzso sclerosis is the most common zzso in children with intractable zzso lobe zzso and it can be detected reliably and accurately on MR zzso We suspect that zzso sclerosis is zzso in children, possibly leading to postponement of surgery in children with zzso zzso
