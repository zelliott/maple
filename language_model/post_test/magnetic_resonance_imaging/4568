A possible correlation between regions of high zzso wall stress and the development of zzso zzso in the carotid artery zzso is zzso The zzso geometry is determined through in zzso studies, as well as the analysis of zzso zzso Having compiled accurate geometric data, two representative finite element models were created in order to determine the areas of localized stress zzso that occur in the zzso The artery is assumed zzso and is mechanically loaded with an incremental pressure of 40 zzso A highly localized stress concentration of approximately 9 to 14 times the zzso zzso wall stress occurs at the point of zzso A lower stress concentration of approximately 3 to 4 times the zzso zzso stress occurs over a large area of the zzso zzso zzso that these two regions of the carotid zzso are highly susceptible to zzso zzso it appears possible that a correlation between wall stress and zzso may zzso
