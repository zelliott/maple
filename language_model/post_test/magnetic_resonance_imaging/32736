The severity of white matter zzso or zzso is a marker of cerebrovascular zzso In stroke, zzso burden is strongly linked to zzso zzso however, impaired cerebral zzso due to zzso or zzso zzso may also contribute to zzso zzso We sought to determine whether zzso burden is associated with zzso or zzso zzso in patients with zzso 

Patients with zzso with admission zzso zzso and brain MR imaging were included in this zzso zzso zzso was defined as zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso in either the middle, zzso or zzso cerebral arteries on zzso on either zzso zzso was determined by using a validated zzso zzso Multiple zzso was used to assess the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso 

Of 201 subjects, 51 zzso had zzso and 63 zzso had zzso zzso Mean age was 62 zzso 15 years; zzso were zzso Mean zzso was zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, age zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso zzso zzso was associated with greater zzso after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis including zzso zzso only age zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated independent effects on zzso 

In our cohort of patients with zzso age and zzso were the strongest zzso of the zzso zzso Future studies are warranted to unravel further association between zzso and cerebral vessel zzso
