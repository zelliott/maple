zzso head shaking at 2 to 3 zzso can induce zzso in patients with central as well as in patients with peripheral zzso However, the characteristics and diagnostic value of this zzso zzso zzso have not been studied systematically in central zzso and little is known of the mechanisms zzso 

We analyzed spontaneous and HSN and the effects of zzso a zzso zzso in 16 patients with acute lateral zzso zzso 

These patients showed several characteristics of HSN unlike those observed in peripheral zzso HSN was observed in 14 of 16 patients zzso and in all cases, the horizontal component beats toward the zzso side, zzso was zzso Even in the eight patients with zzso spontaneous horizontal zzso the HSN was opposite to the spontaneous zzso Three patients showed unusually strong HSN with a maximum zzso zzso greater than 60 zzso Visual fixation markedly suppressed HSN and zzso reduced zzso In most of the patients, zzso showed zzso in the zzso or middle portion of the zzso and spared the zzso zzso 

We propose that zzso zzso in lateral zzso zzso is due to unilaterally impaired zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This proposal is consistent with the results of zzso studies that demonstrate that zzso cells controlling zzso storage in the zzso and zzso zzso project to the zzso or middle portion of the zzso zzso whereas those zzso zzso interactions in the zzso project to the more zzso zzso
