The stimulation of zzso under zzso magnetic fields is analyzed solving the cable equation along the zzso in the presence of magnetic field zzso zzso zzso are represented using a one-dimensional zzso cable model including the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Computer simulations of the model were performed for zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso and field parameters were tested to determine the threshold values for zzso stimulation of the magnetic field, induced electric field and time zzso of the magnetic zzso The results indicate that 1) threshold for stimulation is lowest for the largest diameter zzso terminating in the region where the magnetic field is zzso 2) zzso zzso can be zzso to allow better zzso resolution than zzso zzso and 3) the induced electric field is better than the magnetic field and time zzso of the magnetic field as indicators of stimulation zzso
