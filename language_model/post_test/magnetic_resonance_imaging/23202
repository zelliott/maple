Sometimes object detection as opposed to identification is sufficient to initiate the appropriate zzso To explore the neural origin of zzso differences between the two tasks, we combine zzso zzso and zzso specifically contrasting shape detection versus identification of a zzso This figure consisted of zzso elements being oriented differently from those in the zzso We zzso performance levels for detection and identification by adjusting orientation differences accordingly for each zzso zzso stimulus zzso was constant for both tasks allowing a differentiation between the zzso specific for detection versus identification zzso Identification yielded higher zzso zzso slower reaction times and increased zzso zzso in the zzso complex zzso and an adjacent area in the collateral zzso zzso Additional analysis using zzso alignment revealed four zzso zzso activated by the tasks, situated in the inferior zzso zzso the zzso the anterior zzso and the zzso frontal zzso Our results indicate partly separated cortical mechanisms for object detection and zzso
