This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of zzso and tears of zzso zzso and zzso muscles in patients presenting with zzso lateral hip, or groin zzso describe the MR imaging zzso and discuss their probable relationship to the greater zzso pain zzso 

Two hundred fifty MR imaging examinations of the hip were performed for the evaluation of zzso lateral hip, or groin zzso The findings were reviewed for changes in the zzso or signal intensity of zzso zzso and zzso muscles and zzso and for any zzso zzso including zzso of regional zzso 

Thirty-five studies met our criterion of showing either zzso or tears of zzso zzso and zzso muscles as the primary positive zzso Eight patients had complete zzso tears of the zzso zzso and 14 patients had partial zzso in 13 patients, MR findings were consistent with zzso The zzso zzso muscle was also involved in 10 zzso MR imaging findings were the same as those described for tears and zzso of other regions of the zzso zzso proof of a zzso tear was obtained in six zzso 

zzso of the hip abductors and zzso zzso and zzso muscles was a common finding on MR imaging in our patients with zzso lateral hip, or groin zzso zzso is probably a frequent cause of the greater zzso pain syndrome, a common regional pain syndrome that can mimic other important conditions causing hip pain including avascular necrosis and stress zzso Moreover, it is likely that zzso zzso is associated with zzso
