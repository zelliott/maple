Adult patients with zzso disease zzso are reported to suffer from vascular cognitive impairment zzso including considerable impairment of executive zzso The spatial pattern of functional brain activity in adult zzso patients with VCI has not been studied before and can be measured by examining the zzso of zzso fluctuations zzso of blood oxygen zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso during zzso zzso adult patients with zzso were recruited to participate in this study, including 11 with VCI and 12 without VCI zzso as well as 22 healthy young adults zzso control, zzso zzso differences in zzso were observed between the zzso and NC groups in such regions as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with parts of the frontal zzso such as the anterior zzso zzso zzso and the right supplemental motor area zzso showing significant differences in zzso It is worth to note that regions such as the zzso zzso the right superior frontal zzso zzso the right superior zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso nucleus zzso exhibited significant changes in zzso during the progressive cognitive decline of zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso exhibits a specific intrinsic pattern of zzso and that this pattern changes with the progression of cognitive decline, providing insight into the zzso nature of this zzso
