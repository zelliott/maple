Our objective was to determine the association between size and zzso of zzso zzso zzso tears with zzso zzso abnormalities on zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso examinations with zzso zzso zzso tears were zzso on the basis of the zzso muscle zzso normal muscle zzso suggesting a recent or small zzso reduced muscle bulk without fatty zzso zzso zzso and those with fatty zzso suggesting a large or chronic tear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso bone zzso zzso in the lesser zzso and zzso process were zzso 

The mean size of zzso zzso tears in the zzso zzso zzso zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 29 zzso in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso of zzso patients, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso There was moderate correlation between zzso of zzso zzso tears and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso with no correlation between the zzso zzso and abnormalities of the zzso zzso There was moderate correlation between zzso of zzso zzso tears and bone zzso changes in the lesser zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is related to zzso of zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso zzso in the lesser zzso with a zzso zzso zzso suggests increased stress at the zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Lack of correlation with the zzso zzso indicates that anterior instability may be a more important contributing factor to zzso zzso abnormalities than zzso zzso zzso in the setting of a zzso zzso zzso zzso
