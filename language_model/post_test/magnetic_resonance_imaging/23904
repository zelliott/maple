zzso resonance zzso of skin from zzso rats under the influence of electrical fields was conducted for two zzso 1) low zzso constant electrical fields and 2) zzso short pulse, electrical zzso Under conditions of the low zzso and low current zzso zzso 0 to 20 zzso and 0 to zzso zzso it was found that the skin structure, as observed by magnetic resonance zzso did not significantly change until 20 zzso were applied across the zzso zzso thick zzso Under these conditions, the viable zzso appeared to swell, and this result corresponded to observations from scanning electron zzso and other research from the zzso High zzso electrical fields, zzso 220 V 1 zzso zzso repeated once per second, appeared to zzso the stratum zzso as is consistent with published literature on zzso In the case of zzso water zzso zzso in the zzso and hair zzso regions at all zzso were affected by the electrical zzso zzso analysis at the zzso confidence level for the comparison of the average differences between diffusion zzso with the electrical field on and with the electrical field off for pair matched zzso for the viable zzso show that for 5 V zzso zzso zzso 10 V zzso zzso zzso 20 V zzso zzso zzso regimes there are statistically significant zzso zzso or zzso zzso changes due to the applied electric zzso The same analysis for the hair zzso region at 5 V zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 V zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 V zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also show statistically significant changes zzso zzso or zzso zzso When the zzso pulse was applied, the water diffusion zzso increased by about zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and hair zzso regions, zzso zzso differences were noted between diffusion zzso in the viable zzso and the hair zzso for all zzso
