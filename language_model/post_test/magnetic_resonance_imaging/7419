To evaluate the heating and magnetic field interactions of fixed zzso appliances with different wires and ligaments in a zzso zzso environment and to estimate the safety of these zzso zzso 

40 zzso extracted human zzso teeth were embedded in zzso zzso boxes, and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and stainless steel arch zzso and elastic and stainless steel ligaments were used to obtain four experimental groups in zzso zzso were evaluated at zzso for zzso heating and magnetic field zzso zzso heating was evaluated by placing specimens in a zzso plastic container filled with zzso solution and measuring changes in temperature after zzso weighted zzso sequencing and after completion of all zzso zzso attraction and zzso values of specimens were also zzso zzso zzso test was used to compare continuous variables of temperature zzso zzso was set at zzso 

None of the groups exhibited excessive heating zzso temperature change: zzso with the maximum increase in temperature observed at the end of the zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso field interactions changed depending on the material zzso Although the zzso presented minor interactions that would not cause movement in zzso zzso and stainless steel wires presented great interactions that may pose a risk for the zzso 

The temperature changes of the specimens were considered to be within acceptable zzso With regard to magnetic field zzso zzso can be considered zzso zzso however, it would be safe to replace the wires before zzso
