zzso scalp potential zzso recorded in humans are affected by low spatial resolution and by the dependence on the electrical reference zzso High resolution zzso technologies are available to drastically increase the spatial resolution of the raw zzso Such technologies include the zzso of surface zzso zzso of the recorded zzso as well as the use of realistic head models to estimate the cortical sources via linear inverse procedure zzso resolution brain electromagnetic zzso zzso However, these zzso procedures are generally used in conjunction with zzso recordings with zzso scalp zzso and with realistic head models obtained via sequential magnetic resonance images zzso of the zzso Such recording setup it is not often available in the clinical context, due to both the unavailability of these technologies and the scarce compliance of the patients with zzso In this study we addressed the use of zzso and zzso zzso techniques to analyze data from a standard zzso system (19 zzso in a group of zzso disease zzso zzso 

zzso data related to unilateral finger movements were gathered from 10 patients affected by zzso zzso and zzso techniques were applied for source zzso of zzso zzso The use of zzso for the construction of head models was avoided by using the zzso head model of the Brain Imaging zzso Institute of zzso 

A similar cortical activity estimated by the zzso and zzso techniques was observed during an identical time period of the acquired zzso data in the examined zzso 

The results of the present study suggest that both zzso and zzso approaches can be zzso applied in the clinical context, by using zzso head modeling and a standard zzso system as zzso montage (19 zzso These results represent a zzso zzso of the two zzso independent techniques in a clinical zzso
