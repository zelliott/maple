To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of fetal cerebral magnetic resonance imaging zzso on a large cohort and to compare zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

This prospective study included all cases referred to our unit for fetal cerebral zzso examination between June 2006 and December 2009 and which underwent at least one zzso zzso zzso Cases in which there was termination of pregnancy, fetal death or zzso were zzso The zzso and zzso diagnoses established by zzso were compared and divided into five zzso same diagnosis on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso same diagnosis but different appearance related to the natural course of the disease zzso zzso different diagnosis zzso to limitations of fetal zzso zzso zzso same diagnosis but with additional findings discovered on zzso zzso examination zzso zzso or same diagnosis but different appearance related to the natural course of the disease (as in Group 2) and associated with additional findings discovered on zzso zzso examination zzso zzso The zzso impact of a possible disagreement between zzso and zzso findings was zzso 

One hundred fetuses were zzso Fetal zzso was performed at a mean zzso age of 33 zzso zzso weeks and zzso zzso at a mean age of zzso zzso There were 53 cases classified as Group 1, 32 in Group 2, four in Group 3, 10 in Group 4 and one in Group zzso Thus, in 15 cases zzso zzso there were discrepancies between zzso and zzso findings zzso related to corpus zzso zzso cortical and migration zzso The zzso was judged to have a zzso impact in zzso zzso Two zzso zzso examinations were performed in eight cases, in one of which the second examination showed zzso zzso which were not zzso on the first zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso data showed good agreement in zzso of zzso There was disagreement with a zzso impact in zzso of zzso
