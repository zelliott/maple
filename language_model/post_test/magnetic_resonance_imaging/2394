The objective of this study was to compare the zzso of four management strategies for a patient with an zzso discovered zzso zzso zzso A decision zzso zzso model was used to determine the incremental zzso of four clinical management zzso 1) expectant management, 2) zzso zzso 3) an zzso screening panel zzso zzso growth factor I, and zzso zzso suppression zzso and 4) magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The model incorporated the natural history of incidental zzso test zzso pharmacological and surgical treatment zzso patient's quality of life, discounting, and the costs of hormone testing, zzso zzso hospitalization for surgery, and physician zzso zzso zzso zzso screening panel, and zzso follow-up all provided slightly greater zzso survival than expectant management, but the costs increased disproportionately more than the zzso The incremental cost per zzso life year for zzso screening is zzso and that for the zzso screening panel is zzso These results are most sensitive to patient anxiety about the zzso increased anxiety shifts the recommended strategy to the zzso screening zzso We conclude that in patients with an incidental zzso zzso zzso a single zzso test may be the most cost-effective management zzso
