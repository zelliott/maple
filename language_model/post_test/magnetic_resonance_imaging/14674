In zzso species, maternal stimuli have powerful effects on zzso development and zzso zzso In humans, maternal deprivation has been associated with both zzso zzso toward zzso adults and altered zzso zzso We hypothesized that maternal deprivation would be associated with reduced zzso discrimination between mothers and strangers and increased parent report of indiscriminate friendliness zzso 

zzso youths zzso previously zzso 34 zzso zzso zzso zzso participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment designed to examine zzso response to mother versus stranger zzso zzso behavior was zzso zzso friendliness was assessed with parental zzso 

zzso youth showed an zzso response that clearly zzso mother versus stranger zzso Previously institutionalized youths, by contrast, exhibited reduced zzso discrimination between mothers and zzso zzso zzso differentiation correlated with greater reports of indiscriminate zzso These effects correlated with zzso with later zzso being associated with reduced zzso discrimination and more indiscriminate zzso 

Our results suggest that early maternal deprivation is associated with reduced zzso discrimination between mothers and zzso and reduced zzso discrimination was associated with greater reports of indiscriminate zzso Moreover, these effects increased with zzso These data suggest that the amygdala, in part, is associated with indiscriminate friendliness and that there might be a zzso relationship between institutional rearing and indiscriminate zzso
