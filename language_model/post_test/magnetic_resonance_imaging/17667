To study the CT and MR features of zzso zzso zzso 

49 patients had zzso confirmed zzso All patients underwent contrast enhanced CT, and 10 patients had additional plain zzso The CT and zzso results were zzso zzso 

On CT, all patients had zzso of gallbladder wall, with zzso cases showed diffuse zzso zzso cases had zzso zzso zzso in the thickened zzso Continuous zzso line and zzso surface enhancement were noted in zzso and zzso cases, zzso zzso stones were seen in zzso zzso The coexistence of the above 5 CT features was seen in zzso cases, and zzso cases had the coexistence of zzso 4 zzso zzso gallbladder wall zzso in zzso is more likely to have disrupted zzso line, and zzso with disrupted zzso line is more likely to be associated with liver zzso In zzso patients the inflammatory process extended beyond zzso with the interface between gallbladder and liver and/or the surrounding fat zzso zzso cases had an early enhancement of liver zzso zzso to other surrounding zzso included zzso zzso stomach zzso and abdominal wall zzso On MR images, 7 of 9 zzso zzso in 7 subjects with zzso dual echo MR images showed higher signal intensity on zzso images than zzso zzso 

zzso of diffuse gallbladder wall zzso zzso zzso zzso continuous zzso line, zzso surface enhancement, and gallbladder stone highly suggest zzso zzso frequently zzso liver and surrounding zzso zzso zzso helps zzso zzso zzso in the gallbladder zzso
