We assessed the zzso and spatial correlation between zzso deficits and tissue damage in the first hours of focal cerebral zzso in the zzso zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso performed from zzso zzso up to 6 h after zzso middle cerebral artery zzso zzso allowed the determination of the time course of various zzso parameters and zzso tissue damage in specific brain zzso In addition, blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso combined with a respiratory challenge provided complementary information on brain zzso Within the territory of reduced blood flow, the degree of the zzso disturbances was zzso Interestingly, the spatial pattern of zzso deficiencies remained essentially the same from zzso zzso to 6 h zzso However, the area and the extent of zzso tissue damage, as expressed by reductions in the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of tissue water, tended to progress with increasing zzso zzso Different zzso profiles correlated with different degrees of zzso zzso In the zzso core, which showed severely zzso zzso the zzso dropped significantly within 1 zzso In zzso areas, zzso reductions were delayed and less zzso Data from the zzso track and zzso zzso experiments revealed the existence of residual flow, particularly in zzso zzso Our data point to a zzso change in the relationship between zzso reductions and zzso zzso and, therefore, agree with the concept of a progressively increasing zzso threshold for zzso tissue damage as a function of time of zzso
