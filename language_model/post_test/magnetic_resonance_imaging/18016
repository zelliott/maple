Adult zzso cartilage zzso has a well described zzso collagen zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and development may provide a zzso for cartilage repair strategies, and improve understanding of structural changes in zzso diseases such as zzso zzso The objective of this study was to describe normal development of the spatial architecture of the collagen network of zzso zzso using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso light zzso zzso at sites employed for cartilage repair studies or susceptible to zzso zzso zzso echo zzso sequences and zzso assessment were performed on zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso revealed an early progressive collagen network zzso zzso of the zzso zzso beginning at 4 months of zzso zzso revealed that the collagen network of zzso zzso zzso prior to birth was already zzso into an evident zzso layered structure that included the appearance of a dense zzso zone in the superficial zzso in the youngest zzso with the progressive development of an underlying transitional zzso A third, increasingly zzso zzso layer developed in the zzso from 6 months of zzso Four zzso were observed on the MR images in the last third of zzso These included not only the zzso but also the superficial growth plate of the zzso These findings provide novel data on normal zzso zzso cartilage collagen development, and may serve as a template for cartilage repair studies in this species or a model for zzso studies of zzso
