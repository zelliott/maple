The purpose of this study is to zzso evaluate the airway size of children with Down syndrome zzso Previous studies have observed an increase in zzso zzso in children with zzso zzso literature suggests using a smaller zzso tube in children with zzso but more specific recommendations are not zzso With this study, recommendations are presented for the appropriate zzso tube size to use in children with zzso undergoing zzso 

A zzso zzso study was performed on a cohort of 42 children with zzso and 32 control zzso zzso of the airway was assessed through measurement of an air leak around the zzso tube at zzso The size of the airway was also evaluated through zzso of the zzso diameter at the zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imagine zzso studies of the head and neck which were performed on a group of children with zzso These were compared with zzso values of the zzso diameter in zzso 

The proper size of zzso tube in a population of children with zzso and in a group of normal controls was zzso The zzso zzso of an zzso tube was defined as that size of tube which allowed an audible air leak around the tube between 10 and 30 zzso of zzso zzso zzso technique was controlled and identical for all study zzso Participants had no previous history of airway compromise, zzso or previous zzso Weight and age were recorded and evaluated for their influence on the zzso A retrospective evaluation was made of zzso studies of the neck that were performed on children with zzso Using measurement techniques described by Reed et zzso the zzso diameters at the zzso zzso were compared with zzso values for zzso zzso were both obtained by the author and confirmed by a pediatric zzso 

Using this prescribed method to determine the proper size of zzso tube, the control group used zzso tubes that were predicted from established zzso charts and zzso However, children with zzso required zzso tubes at least two sizes zzso Age was found to be a more reliable factor in predicting the zzso tube zzso A table of zzso tube sizes for zzso in children with zzso is zzso zzso of the zzso diameter at the zzso point revealed that children with zzso have a smaller trachea when compared with control zzso It is not only the zzso that is smaller; the zzso diameter as well must be assumed to be of a smaller diameter in children with zzso 

Children with zzso have smaller airways than other zzso This is because of an overall decrease in the diameter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of a child with zzso should be performed with an zzso tube at least two sizes smaller than would be used in a child of the same age without zzso to avert potential trauma to the zzso
