zzso imaging has been used to examine zzso function in zzso The evidence from PET and zzso studies suggests that there is excess zzso release zzso in the zzso and that zzso transmission may be abnormal in the zzso also, because of an zzso in D1 zzso We have found that patients with schizophrenia have higher zzso levels of zzso zzso (and have a greater proportion of zzso receptors occupied by zzso at baseline than zzso Those patients who had the highest levels of zzso were the ones whose positive symptoms responded best to six weeks of treatment with an zzso Recent studies have also produced new evidence of zzso zzso in the zzso When controls were compared with patients with zzso we found a significant increase in D1 receptors in patients, but only in the zzso prefrontal zzso Patients were also studied while they undertook a test of working zzso While there was no relationship between test performance and D1 binding potential for controls, those patients with the highest zzso (most pathological zzso of D1 receptors performed the worst on the zzso Both the D1 zzso and the poor working memory may be secondary to a zzso possibly zzso deficit in zzso zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso in zzso The D1 binding potential may prove to be a good zzso with which to identify those patients suffering from schizophrenia who are most likely to benefit from treatment with a D1 zzso A D1 zzso zzso that is sensitive to zzso zzso competition would be very valuable in the further exploration of this zzso
