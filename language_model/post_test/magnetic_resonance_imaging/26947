According to theories of emotional complexity, individuals low in emotional complexity zzso and represent emotions in visceral or action-oriented terms, whereas individuals high in emotional complexity zzso and represent emotions in a differentiated way, using multiple emotion zzso During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants viewed zzso animated scenarios of simple zzso figures attending either to social or spatial aspects of the zzso zzso emotional complexity was assessed using the zzso of zzso Awareness zzso We found a distributed set of brain regions previously implicated in processing emotion from zzso vocal and bodily cues, in processing social intentions, and in emotional response, were sensitive to emotion conveyed by motion zzso Attention to social meaning amplified the influence of emotion in a subset of these zzso zzso increased emotional complexity correlated with enhanced processing in a left zzso polar region implicated in detailed semantic knowledge; with a diminished effect of social zzso and with increased differentiation of brain activity between films of differing zzso zzso emotional complexity was associated with increased activity in regions of zzso zzso Thus, neural coding of emotion in semantic vs action systems varies as a function of emotional complexity, helping reconcile puzzling inconsistencies in zzso investigations of emotion zzso
