Several studies have shown that women express higher pain sensitivity during periods of low zzso than during periods of high zzso The aim of this study was to show whether the difference in pain sensitivity could be zzso as a function of brain activity by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Nine healthy, pain-free women zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso with a natural, regular zzso cycle participated in the zzso zzso zzso data were acquired during a period of high and during a period of low zzso at zzso T using zzso imaging with zzso spatial resolution and a zzso resolution of 4 zzso Heat pain thresholds were obtained before the scans, and pain ratings were obtained before and after each zzso Blood samples were taken after each scan to verify the appropriate level of zzso 

The heat pain thresholds during the low zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso and high zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso conditions were not significantly zzso The pain ratings before zzso zzso zzso low versus zzso zzso zzso zzso and during the scans zzso zzso zzso low versus zzso zzso zzso zzso also did not differ between the 2 zzso Generally, similar patterns of zzso were observed for both zzso zzso However, significant differences were found in the magnitude of zzso of the anterior part of the anterior zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso Furthermore, zzso in the anterior part of the anterior cingulate, left zzso and zzso were unique to the zzso zzso These regions have been linked with attention to or anticipation of zzso 

The results of this study suggest that the affective component of pain may be enhanced during the zzso phase of the zzso cycle in healthy zzso
