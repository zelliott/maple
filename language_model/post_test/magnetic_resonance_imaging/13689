The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and limitations of two MR sequences for imaging of the lung using a zzso rating zzso Ten healthy volunteers were assessed with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 173 zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence with respiratory triggering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protocol included a zzso pulse over the zzso zzso zzso and resolution of zzso structures in each lung segment were evaluated by two observers (10 volunteers, 180 zzso zzso and vessel zzso zzso predominated on zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso of the zzso reduced zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso images were improved by bright flow signal of vessels, whereas image quality of zzso zzso was reduced by zzso effects in central parts of the zzso zzso of lung periphery and the zzso was superior with zzso zzso zzso vessels (up to zzso zzso and zzso (up to third zzso were zzso All 180 lung segments were zzso in diagnostic quality with at least one of the two sequences zzso zzso not diagnostic in 9 of 180, zzso zzso in 4 of zzso Both sequences were found to be zzso superior identification of gross lung anatomy with zzso zzso and higher detail resolution in the periphery and the zzso with zzso zzso
