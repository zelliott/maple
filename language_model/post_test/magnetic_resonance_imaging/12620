Previous studies have reported that the spontaneous, zzso time course of the zzso network is zzso correlated with that of the zzso zzso a collection of regions commonly recruited in demanding cognitive zzso However, all studies of negative correlations between the zzso and zzso networks have employed some form of zzso or zzso of the zzso average signal zzso zzso these processing steps alter the time series of zzso in an zzso manner as well as introduce zzso negative zzso Thus, the extent of negative correlations with the default mode network without global signal removal has not been well zzso and it is has recently been hypothesized that the apparent negative correlations in many of the zzso regions could be zzso induced by global signal zzso The present study aimed to examine negative and positive correlations with the zzso network when zzso corrections for respiratory and cardiac noise are applied in lieu of global signal zzso zzso noise correction consisted of zzso removal of zzso cardiac and respiratory artifacts using zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method for retrospective correction of zzso motion effects in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 44, zzso and zzso removal of zzso respiratory and heart rate variations by zzso these zzso with zzso transfer functions zzso et zzso 2008; Chang et zzso zzso and projecting the resulting two signals out of the zzso It is demonstrated that negative correlations between the zzso network and regions of the zzso network are present in the majority of individual subjects both with and without zzso noise zzso zzso noise correction increased the spatial extent and magnitude of negative zzso yielding negative correlations within zzso regions at the zzso zzso zzso no regions at the group level were significant at zzso Furthermore, zzso noise correction caused zzso decreases in positive correlations within the zzso network, reducing apparent false zzso It was observed that the zzso respiratory volume and cardiac rate zzso used within the zzso noise correction zzso displayed significant (but not total) shared zzso with the global zzso and constitute a zzso alternative to correcting for zzso global zzso
