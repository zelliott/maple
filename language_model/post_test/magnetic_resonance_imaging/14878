Treatment of zzso zzso cancer with chemotherapy results in zzso zzso mimicking residual zzso on conventional MR images and making interpretation zzso The aim of this study was to use dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to estimate descriptive and zzso kinetic parameters zzso chemotherapy and to investigate whether parameters differed in areas of residual zzso and zzso zzso inflammation zzso effect, zzso 

zzso patients underwent zzso scans with zzso zzso resolution before and following zzso zzso zzso zzso were defined in areas suspicious of residual zzso on zzso zzso zzso Data were zzso zzso and with a zzso exchange model to obtain parameters including relative signal intensity zzso and plasma zzso zzso zzso The zzso was subsequently examined zzso after zzso for evidence of residual zzso and/or zzso zzso in parameters measured in areas of residual zzso and zzso were examined using zzso zzso 

zzso abnormal sites were defined after zzso zzso On pathology, 10 and 14 areas were identified as residual zzso and zzso zzso Median zzso and zzso were significantly higher in areas of residual zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso p zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity for zzso residual zzso from zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso when zzso 

zzso parameters obtained zzso are capable of distinguishing between residual zzso and treatment effect in patients treated for zzso cancer with zzso zzso
