zzso independent scans were performed in two volunteers covering one zzso region in each (the brain and zzso with the purpose of zzso the agreement between predicted and measured zzso ratios zzso zzso varied parameters were number of zzso zzso field of view zzso section thickness zzso and the number of zzso steps zzso zzso zzso of measured versus predicted zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso zzso improved correlations were found for data zzso in which zzso was held zzso To assess the criteria guiding reader zzso a blinded study was performed in which zzso were asked to rate images from least to most zzso In order to zzso determine the criteria for reader zzso plots of mean rating versus zzso zzso volume, and an image quality index zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The latter was found to be a better predictor of reader preference than either zzso or spatial resolution zzso The data suggests zzso scan protocols yielding zzso of approximately 20 are preferable with any excess zzso being traded for smaller zzso size or shorter scan zzso
