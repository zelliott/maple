Trust lies at the heart of person perception and interpersonal decision zzso In two studies, we investigated physical temperature as one factor that can influence human trust behavior, and the zzso as a possible neural zzso Participants briefly touched either a cold or warm pack, and then played an economic trust zzso Those primed with cold invested less with an anonymous partner, revealing lesser interpersonal trust, as compared to those who touched a warm zzso In Study 2, we examined neural activity during zzso processes after a temperature manipulation using functional magnetic resonance zzso The zzso insular region activated more strongly than baseline only when the trust decision was preceded by touching a cold pack, and not a warm zzso In addition, greater zzso within bilateral zzso was identified during the decision phase followed by a cold zzso contrasted to zzso These results suggest that the zzso may be a key shared neural zzso that mediates the influence of temperature on trust zzso
