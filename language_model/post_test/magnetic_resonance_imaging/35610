zzso zzso surface area zzso has been proposed as a quantitative method to assess the severity of zzso zzso zzso Yet the accuracy of this method in patients with eccentric zzso jets is zzso The aims of this study were to compare the accuracy of the zzso method for the zzso of zzso severity in patients with central versus eccentric zzso jets and to verify whether imaging from the left zzso instead of the zzso window improves the accuracy of the zzso method in patients with eccentric zzso Fifty patients with zzso (21 with central jets and 29 with eccentric zzso underwent zzso and zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso zzso In patients with eccentric zzso jets, zzso zzso obtained from the left zzso and zzso windows were zzso In patients with central zzso jets, zzso and zzso zzso volumes were similar zzso zzso 19 vs 30 zzso 20 zzso p zzso zzso were strongly correlated zzso zzso zzso p zzso and differed minimally from each other (by 2 zzso 8 zzso In patients with eccentric zzso jets, zzso zzso volumes underestimated those measured by zzso zzso zzso 22 vs 51 zzso 27 zzso bias zzso zzso 20 zzso and were correlated only fairly zzso zzso zzso p zzso Imaging from the left zzso window eliminated the differences between zzso and zzso zzso volumes zzso zzso 27 vs 53 zzso 26 zzso p zzso zzso and improved the correlation between the 2 measures zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, in patients with eccentric zzso jets zzso from the zzso window, the zzso method significantly underestimated zzso zzso This was no longer the case when imaging was performed from the left zzso instead of the zzso zzso
