To zzso characterize different heart zzso from functional and viability images provided by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a new zzso technique for simultaneously acquiring cardiac functional and viability zzso In this work, an zzso zzso fuzzy zzso method is proposed to identify different heart zzso in the zzso zzso The method is based on sequential application of the fuzzy zzso zzso and zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso The proposed method is tested on simulated heart images and on images from nine patients with and without zzso zzso zzso The resulting clustered images are compared with zzso zzso zzso viability images for determining zzso Also, zzso analysis is conducted between the two zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood are correctly identified using the proposed zzso The clustered images correctly identified 90 zzso zzso of the zzso defined as zzso in the DE zzso In addition, 89 zzso zzso of the zzso defined as zzso in the clustered images were also defined as zzso in DE zzso The zzso results show no bias between the two methods in identifying zzso 

The proposed technique allows for zzso identifying divergent heart zzso which would be potentially important for clinical decision-making in patients with zzso
