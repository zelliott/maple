For the analysis of the brain shift phenomenon different strategies were zzso In 32 zzso cases zzso and zzso MR zzso were acquired in order to evaluate the maximum displacement of the brain surface and the deep tumor zzso After rigid registration using the software of the zzso system, a direct comparison was made with zzso and zzso zzso As a result, a great zzso of the brain shift was observed ranging up to 24 zzso for cortical displacement and exceeding 3 zzso for the deep tumor margin in zzso of all zzso Following zzso imaging the zzso system was updated in eight cases providing reliable zzso For a more comprehensive analysis a zzso zzso registration was zzso zzso at improved speed of alignment we performed all zzso operations with zzso texture mapping based on zzso functions supported in graphics zzso Further acceleration was achieved with an zzso refinement of the underlying control point grid focusing on the main deformation zzso For a quick overview the registered zzso were evaluated with different zzso zzso zzso Finally, the results were compared to the initial zzso contributing to a better understanding of the brain shift zzso Overall, the experiments clearly demonstrate that zzso of the brain surface and deeper brain structures are zzso
