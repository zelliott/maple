To compare prostate volume obtained by zzso ultrasound zzso and zzso zzso zzso to assess the reliability of zzso in determining zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Data for zzso patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer zzso and treated with radical zzso zzso zzso at the University of Pennsylvania Health System between 1991 and 2005 was zzso Of these patients, zzso had both a zzso zzso and zzso of the prostate zzso zzso size was estimated using the zzso zzso formula zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso zzso height or zzso zzso diameter was determined using a zzso view for zzso and an zzso view for zzso zzso zzso linear regression, and paired zzso were performed to compare prostate volumes estimated via both imaging zzso 

Average prostate size measured with zzso and zzso correlated significantly with one another (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso demonstrating a strong linear relationship zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso density also demonstrated a strong linear relationship zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso Average prostate volume differed by zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso which was statistically significant based on a paired zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso of patients into three groups based on average zzso volume zzso 30, zzso and zzso zzso significant correlation zzso zzso zzso and difference between volumes zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso was zzso 

zzso volume zzso with zzso and zzso are highly zzso It is therefore, reasonable to conclude that in the hands of an experienced zzso zzso is not only an efficient and economical examination, but also an accurate and zzso zzso to estimate prostate zzso
