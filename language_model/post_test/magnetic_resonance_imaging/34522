To evaluate the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in patients with clinical suspicion of zzso fractures and normal initial plain zzso 

MR imaging was performed within 7 days after trauma in 42 patients with clinical suspicion of zzso fractures and normal plain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and short inversion time zzso zzso sequences were zzso MR images were evaluated independently by two zzso zzso follow-up zzso were used as a standard to diagnose zzso 

MR imaging depicted zzso fractures of the zzso bone in 14 patients zzso the zzso bone in four zzso the zzso in one zzso and the zzso radius in two zzso All wrist fractures were detected with a combination of STIR and zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity for detection of zzso zzso fractures of the wrist were zzso each for the first and zzso and zzso respectively, for the second zzso with an almost perfect zzso agreement (K zzso zzso 

MR imaging has a high sensitivity for detection of fractures of the zzso bone and wrist not evident on plain zzso and may enable early diagnosis and zzso
