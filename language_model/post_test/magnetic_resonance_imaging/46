The purpose of this research was to develop a novel zzso procedure to zzso the zzso input function zzso from contrast concentration zzso time zzso and to obtain the impulse response functions zzso from dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations were performed to study variations of contrast concentration zzso time zzso and the corresponding zzso The simulated contrast media concentration zzso were generated by varying the parameters of an empirical mathematical model zzso within reasonable ranges based on a previous experimental zzso The zzso was calculated from plots of contrast media concentration zzso time in muscle under assumption that they are well zzso by the zzso zzso zzso A general simple mathematical model of the zzso was developed, and the zzso meaning of the model parameters was determined by comparing them with the widely accepted zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso procedure developed in this research is a simple, zzso and useful zzso In addition, zzso response zzso leads to the derivation of novel parameters relating to tumor vascular architecture, and these new parameters may have clinical zzso
