A prospective study was designed to evaluate the possible changes in abdominal wall strength following free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surgery for breast zzso Twenty-two patients were examined 1 day before surgery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months zzso zzso muscle strength was measured by the same zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso Joint II, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The peak zzso and average zzso for both zzso and extension at 60 degrees per second angular zzso were recorded from the zzso zzso There was a significant reduction in trunk zzso strength at 3 months zzso zzso zzso mean, zzso of the zzso value; p zzso zzso but this was corrected by 6 months zzso zzso and improved to zzso by 12 zzso The patient's ability to do curled trunk zzso was evaluated by the same zzso and graded on a scale from 1 to zzso In 9 of 19 patients the operation had no effect on zzso performance during zzso In 10 of 19 patients there was a reduction of one or two grades at 3 months that did not improve by 12 zzso zzso resonance imaging of the abdominal wall was performed on 9 zzso The mean area of the upper third of both zzso muscles was measured on the zzso zzso At 3 months zzso the mean area of the upper third of the donor muscle was significantly larger than the zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no difference in size at 6 months, and by 12 months the donor side was zzso This prospective study shows that harvesting of a free zzso zzso can cause a zzso reduction in abdominal strength, although this was not noticed by the patients zzso
