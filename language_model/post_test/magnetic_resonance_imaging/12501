A study was undertaken to identify the gene underlying zzso zzso a zzso inherited form of zzso zzso combined with other focal or generalized zzso and a characteristic zzso and body zzso in an Australian zzso 

zzso linkage analysis was carried out in 14 family members followed by zzso sequencing in 2 zzso The index patient underwent a detailed neurological follow-up examination, including zzso studies and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of the skin and zzso zzso were zzso and expression levels of zzso zzso were determined by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction in 3 different cell zzso All zzso of zzso were screened for zzso in zzso unrelated zzso zzso 

The zzso gene was mapped to a zzso region on zzso zzso with a maximum zzso zzso score of zzso at markers zzso and zzso Genome sequencing revealed a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene as the likely cause of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso unrelated zzso patients revealed another zzso zzso zzso in a familial case of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression studies demonstrated significantly reduced levels of zzso zzso zzso in different cell types from a zzso zzso zzso carrier compared to zzso 

A zzso in zzso causes zzso zzso in this Australian family with so-called whispering zzso and other zzso in zzso may contribute to zzso zzso Given that zzso is a zzso expressed zzso our results imply abnormal zzso function as a novel mechanism in the zzso of zzso
