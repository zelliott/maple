zzso therapy was not available for treatment of acute stroke until 1995, when tissue zzso zzso zzso was shown to improve neurological and functional outcome in stroke patients who were treated within 3 hours of symptom zzso 

Currently, many patients do not qualify for zzso therapy because they present for evaluation beyond 3 hours after stroke zzso Attempts to expand the treatment window to 6 hours, using CT to select patients, have zzso Use of early MR imaging may provide significant advantages over CT for identification of patients who are likely to benefit from zzso therapy because zzso the early zzso imaging zzso zzso estimates the region of acute dysfunctional brain zzso whereas the acute zzso imaging zzso zzso appears to zzso to the core of the early zzso zzso the mismatch between the acute zzso zzso and the smaller zzso zzso represents potentially zzso brain tissue (an estimate of the zzso zzso and zzso in patients with a zzso zzso early zzso is often associated with substantial clinical improvement and reversal or reduction of zzso zzso zzso 

Clinical trials that use new zzso techniques to screen patients may be able to identify a subset of acute stroke patients who are ideal candidates for zzso therapy even beyond 3 hours after stroke zzso
