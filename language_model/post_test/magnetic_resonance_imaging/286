zzso evidence suggests that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene might be implicated in major depressive disorder zzso 

We evaluated 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso to test for associations with regional gray matter zzso volume differences in patients with zzso zzso We then used the defined regions of interest based on significant associations to test for zzso zzso zzso interactions by including a matched control group without any psychiatric disorder, including zzso 

General linear model with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso healthy controls zzso zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso zzso and regional zzso volume zzso 

Variation in zzso volume was associated with zzso zzso the most significant associations were found for zzso a putative functional zzso zzso that showed 3 significant zzso clusters in the right and left superior zzso zzso and the right zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively, corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso an zzso in high linkage zzso A significant zzso zzso zzso status interaction was observed for the effect on zzso volumes in the right zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso corrected, zzso 

The zzso gene may have a role in determining regional zzso volume differences of the right zzso and bilateral superior zzso zzso The association between zzso and brain structure was specific to the patients with zzso suggesting that zzso zzso might interact with zzso zzso We speculate that this is a consequence of regional zzso zzso or zzso growth or zzso In considering core cognitive features of zzso the association of zzso zzso with structural variation in the zzso lobe and zzso is of particular interest in the context of other evidence for structural and functional abnormalities in the zzso of patients with zzso
