In this paper, a novel approach to the problem of elasticity reconstruction is zzso In this approach, the solution of the wave equation is expanded as a sum of waves travelling in different directions sharing a common wave zzso In particular, the solutions for the zzso and zzso zzso which are related to the zzso and zzso components of the displacement respectively are expanded as sums of travelling zzso This solution is then used as a model and fitted to the measured zzso The value of the zzso wave number which yields the best fit is then used to find the elasticity at each spatial zzso The main advantage of this method over direct inversion methods is that, instead of taking the derivatives of noisy measurement data, the derivatives are taken on the zzso zzso This improves the results of the zzso The zzso and zzso components of the displacement can also be zzso as a byproduct of the method, without taking any zzso Experimental results show the effectiveness of this technique in magnetic resonance zzso Comparisons are made with other state-of-the-art zzso
