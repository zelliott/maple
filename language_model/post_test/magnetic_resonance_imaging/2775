A method of reducing the amount of data required to reconstruct an image is zzso In this zzso fully sampled low spatial frequency data are acquired up to a given zzso frequency and above this point, only alternate lines are zzso Two images are produced, one of low definition and one of high definition but zzso The proposed zzso unwraps the zzso data, which are then used to enhance the low pass image, yielding a best estimate of the true zzso The reduced sampling technique is shown to afford biological images that are almost indistinguishable from those obtained from a complete data zzso
