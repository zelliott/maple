The structural zzso of mild cognitive impairment zzso were examined in 105 elderly subjects whose cognitive function ranged from intact to zzso including 38 subjects with zzso zzso volumes zzso and right zzso brain volume zzso and zzso matter volume zzso and white matter volume zzso were segmented from high resolution magnetic resonance data sets and zzso to zzso volume zzso zzso volume zzso but not global brain, white or zzso matter zzso were associated with zzso White matter zzso severity did not differ over cognitive zzso In multiple zzso zzso models, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso brain zzso were significant zzso of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly predicted zzso versus zzso Absolute zzso measures of zzso and zzso yielded comparable zzso zzso zzso zzso may be the crucial step for the transition from zzso to zzso zzso brain zzso may be the step to determine the transition from zzso to zzso Brain volume reserve effects appear to be involved in both of these zzso
