To monitor ankle cartilage zzso volume changes after in zzso exercise and during zzso 

Based on zzso zzso zzso volumes of zzso and zzso cartilage were calculated before and after 30 bilateral knee zzso in 12 healthy zzso zzso volumes were calculated at five time points (one zzso and four zzso determining deformation and recovery for both cartilage plates of zzso zzso ran immediately after the exercise and were repeated according to a 15 zzso zzso zzso volumes were subjected to repeated measures zzso Additionally, relative surface area use during deformation was compared between plates using a zzso Signed zzso test and its correlation with deformation was investigated using zzso zzso 

Mean zzso volume change percentages for zzso cartilage after the exercise were: zzso zzso zzso and zzso For zzso cartilage mean changes were: zzso zzso zzso and zzso For zzso cartilage changes were zzso except following 30 zzso zzso For zzso cartilage no changes were zzso At all time points, no significant differences in relative volume changes between both cartilage plates zzso Although no significant differences in relative surface area use between plates were revealed, a moderate to strong correlation with deformation zzso 

zzso cartilage endures substantial deformation after in zzso loading that was restored within 30 zzso for the zzso zzso cartilage contact area involvement might be associated with cartilage quality maintenance in the upper zzso zzso cartilage is suggested to play a critical role in zzso shock zzso when compared to zzso zzso
