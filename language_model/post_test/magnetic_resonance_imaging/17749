A challenge in the diagnosis of prostate cancer zzso is the accurate assessment of zzso 

To validate the performance of dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the prostate at 3 zzso zzso for the assessment of zzso zzso with zzso specimens as the reference zzso 

A total of 45 patients with zzso scheduled for zzso were zzso This study was approved by the institutional review board; the need for informed consent was zzso 

zzso underwent a clinical zzso protocol including zzso zzso to zzso zzso was indicated on zzso images based on zzso results from zzso specimens with the use of anatomical landmarks for the precise zzso of the zzso zzso was classified as zzso zzso or zzso according to zzso zzso zzso were used as an overlay on zzso zzso mean and zzso values from zzso and zzso model parameters were extracted per tumor zzso zzso analysis included zzso zzso the zzso test, and a receiver operating characteristics zzso zzso 

zzso differences were seen for the mean and 75th zzso zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso respectively), mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of transfer constant zzso zzso zzso zzso all between zzso and high-grade zzso in the peripheral zzso zzso analysis revealed the best discriminating performance between zzso versus zzso plus high-grade zzso in the peripheral zone for zzso of zzso zzso and rate constant zzso zzso under the zzso zzso Due to a limited number of tumors in the transition zone, a definitive conclusion for this region of the prostate could not be zzso 

zzso parameters zzso and zzso and zzso parameters zzso and zzso derived from zzso at 3 T have the potential to assess the aggressiveness of zzso in the peripheral zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso offer the best possibility to discriminate zzso from zzso plus high-grade zzso
