Centers that perform zzso zzso evaluations disagree on whether depth or zzso zzso represent the optimal technique for invasive recording, especially in zzso originating outside the zzso zzso A 13-year-old girl with a normal magnetic resonance imaging scan had zzso partial onset seizures, despite scalp and zzso grid zzso zzso zzso Repeat zzso with depth zzso showed a discrete site of continuous zzso zzso and seizure onset that was located zzso zzso beneath the surface of the sensory zzso The zzso region showed focal cortical zzso and the patient had greater than zzso seizure frequency reduction at zzso zzso We conclude that although zzso zzso have many advantages when recording zzso outside the zzso zzso depth zzso may provide superior recordings when the zzso region is beneath the cortical zzso
