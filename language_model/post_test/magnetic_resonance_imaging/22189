To clarify the value of plain and zzso zzso for the diagnosis and follow-up of muscle injuries, by means of experimental and clinical zzso 

24 zzso rats were studied following standardized division of the calf muscles by means of zzso carried out on the first day, and also after one, two, three and four zzso In addition, 16 patients with muscle injuries were examined (32 zzso first between the first and fifth day of zzso and subsequently over a period of two to seven weeks zzso four zzso 

In the animal experiments, there was signal reduction of zzso and an increase of the zzso signal during the acute inflammatory zzso During the zzso zzso phase, there was an increase of both the zzso and zzso zzso These became reduced during the chronic healing zzso Early differentiation between intramuscular zzso and zzso surrounding zzso and recognition of the divided muscle zzso was possible only after the intravenous injection of an MR contrast medium zzso zzso of the divided muscles resulted in more rapid healing without major zzso 

It is possible to follow up the healing process after muscle injuries by means of plain zzso zzso MR allows early evaluation of muscle zzso and is particularly valuable for zzso the margins of the injured zzso
