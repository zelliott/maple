With the significant improvement in the survival of patients with zzso zzso zzso undergoing zzso and the growing availability of the sophisticated imaging zzso the number of radiation zzso zzso cases relating to zzso zzso is zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso and density changes of the compromised brain zzso during delayed zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso to provide clinical zzso for the diagnosis of delayed zzso following zzso for zzso 

The zzso manifestations and the clinical data of 53 zzso confirmed zzso patients with delayed zzso following radical zzso and 15 healthy volunteers were zzso The standardized zzso values zzso of the bilateral zzso zzso the zzso lobe and the brain stem were measured zzso and then the zzso reduction rate of 88 zzso zzso and 13 brain stems were calculated for a statistical comparison between the two zzso 

The earliest case of delayed zzso in the investigated patients occurred zzso years after zzso Delayed zzso frequently involved the inferior zzso zzso For patients with delayed zzso confirmed by clinical symptoms and imaging findings, PET maintained a zzso coincidence rate with CT; however, in the 25 zzso zzso of the 35 delayed zzso patients, PET revealed obvious zzso changes whereas CT displayed normal zzso The zzso of brain stem zzso reductions was zzso zzso in the investigated patients, including 4 patients with zzso changes shown by PET and negative finding shown by zzso The zzso of zzso adjacent to the zzso region in the zzso lobe was zzso zzso 

Delayed zzso patients exhibit significant zzso changes in the inferior zzso zzso captured by PET much earlier than by zzso zzso offers a valuable means for the diagnosis of delayed zzso in zzso stages and zzso zzso
