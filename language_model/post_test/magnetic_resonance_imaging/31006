zzso therapy diminishes the risk of recurrence of incompletely removed zzso zzso zzso zzso The authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of gamma knife surgery zzso in patients with residual zzso following surgical zzso of the zzso 

zzso patients, 26 men and 28 women, ranging in age from 29 to 72 years underwent gamma knife zzso zzso and follow-up studies involved magnetic resonance imaging, hormone zzso and zzso examination 6 and 12 months after zzso and at yearly intervals zzso The mean follow up after zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Two of 52 patients undergoing follow up had a recurrence 40 and 49 months after zzso In both of these patients the treated zzso had reduced in size, but a new zzso appeared in the zzso side of the zzso zzso The recurrence-free zzso at 5 years was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso volume decreased from a baseline value of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso at the last follow up zzso zzso zzso Twenty-two patients zzso had a zzso or greater reduction in tumor zzso The administered radiation dose had been significantly higher in patients who experienced tumor zzso Visual function and zzso did not deteriorate in any zzso New cases of zzso hypothyroidism, and zzso occurred in zzso zzso and zzso respectively, of zzso patients at zzso 

zzso knife surgery was effective in controlling the growth of residual zzso after previously performed zzso surgical zzso The major advantage of zzso compared with zzso zzso seems to be a lower risk of side effects, especially a lower risk of zzso
