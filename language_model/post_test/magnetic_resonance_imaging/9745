To evaluate zzso zzso zzso treatment planning based on simultaneous zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso 

A zzso patient was examined prior to zzso with dedicated planning zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and simultaneous zzso The first gross target volume zzso was defined based on a combination of separate MR and zzso imaging zzso Then, the simultaneous zzso images were used to delineate a second zzso zzso by following exactly the same zzso zzso After an zzso expansion of those volumes by a zzso safety margin, the resulting planning target volumes zzso were compared by calculating the intersection volume and the relative zzso A zzso of zzso plans was performed, where the treatment plan created for the zzso was applied to the zzso zzso 

Generally, target volumes for zzso treatment planning did not differ between zzso plus zzso and simultaneous zzso zzso Only in certain regions of the zzso were differences zzso The overall volume of the zzso zzso was approximately the same as that obtained from zzso zzso A small region of zzso tumor growth next to the main tumor mass was better zzso with combined zzso due to smaller PET zzso sizes and improved zzso An zzso treatment plan was zzso for the zzso The evaluation of this plan with respect to the zzso showed parts of the target volume that would not have received the full radiation dose after zzso of the zzso based on simultaneous zzso 

This case showed that differences in target volumes delineated on the basis of separate MR and zzso and simultaneous zzso may be observed that can have significant consequences for an effectively applied zzso treatment zzso
