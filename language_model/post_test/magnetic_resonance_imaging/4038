zzso are known to play a role in the regulation of peripheral zzso zzso and zzso Although several animal studies have shown that zzso zzso metabolism is reduced acutely and chronically by the action of zzso and that excess zzso are harmful to zzso zzso little is known about the central effects of zzso in the zzso In this study we examined the brain zzso zzso zzso response to zzso zzso in seven normal elderly and eight Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso On 2 separate days, immediately after the administration of a zzso of either 35 zzso zzso or zzso we administered zzso After a zzso zzso zzso period, zzso zzso zzso zzso images were zzso PET zzso images were analyzed using two zzso an image transformation that allowed analyses across cases on a zzso by zzso basis, and an zzso based region of interest method that used zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso Both image analysis methods yielded similar results, identifying relative to zzso a specific zzso zzso reduction in response to the zzso challenge that was restricted to the normal zzso The region of interest technique showed zzso reductions of zzso and zzso in the right and left zzso zzso Blood collected during the PET scans zzso for the normal group, a rise in plasma zzso levels, starting approximately 25 zzso after zzso zzso The zzso group did not show this zzso zzso cortisol was elevated in the zzso group, but the clearance of zzso was not different between the zzso In conclusion, these data show that among normal individuals in the presence of a pharmacological dose of zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso is specifically reduced, and serum zzso levels zzso Based in part on other studies, we offer the interpretation that zzso regulation of zzso transport is altered in zzso and this may zzso both the zzso zzso to cortisol and the failure in these patients to mount a peripheral zzso zzso As our findings could reflect an altered state of the zzso patients, we interpret our results as preliminary with respect to evidence for zzso abnormalities in zzso The results suggest the continued study of the zzso challenge as a test of zzso zzso
