zzso zzso zzso zzso loss in the zzso zzso zzso structures and preferential zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso are three early characteristics of Alzheimer's zzso Based on studies of the effects of zzso zzso in zzso we previously concluded that damage to the zzso structures plays, at best, a marginal role in the association zzso zzso of Alzheimer's zzso In the present study, we have assessed the remote zzso effects of bilateral zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso PET zzso with zzso the cerebral zzso rate for zzso zzso was measured before surgery and zzso for 2-3 months afterward zzso days 30, 45 and zzso Compared with zzso zzso the zzso animals showed a significant and long-lasting zzso decline in a small set of brain regions, especially in the inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as in the zzso zzso region, all of which also exhibit zzso zzso in Alzheimer's zzso zzso the degree of zzso decline in four of these regions significantly correlated with the severity of zzso determined damage in the zzso cortex, strongly supporting the specificity of the observed zzso zzso There were also differences between the zzso pattern observed in the zzso animals and that classically reported in Alzheimer's zzso for instance, the zzso we found in the stratum has not been reported in early Alzheimer's disease, although this structure can be affected in late stages of the disease and has direct anatomical connections with the zzso zzso Nevertheless, this study shows for the first time that the zzso and zzso zzso found in Alzheimer's disease may partly result from zzso zzso with the zzso zzso This, in turn, further strengthens the hypothesis that zzso damage and dysfunction in the zzso zzso play a major role in the expression of Alzheimer's zzso
