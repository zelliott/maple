Our purpose in this study was to examine heating of zzso and zzso zzso zzso during zzso MR imaging in an artificial vascular model an zzso zzso The first zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso both zzso were immersed in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of a fiber-optic thermometer were positioned at the tips of both zzso Balanced zzso free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flip angle zzso zzso field of view zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso rate zzso zzso Watt zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse sequences were acquired in a zzso MR scanner with use of an zzso array zzso Temperatures were recorded while the phantom was placed centrally in the bore of a MR scanner and in an off-center position zzso zzso zzso The temperature of the zzso zzso increased by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with use of the zzso and by zzso and zzso zzso zzso with use of the zzso zzso Only minor temperature changes up to a maximum of zzso were observed with the zzso zzso zzso when any position or sequence was zzso The zzso zzso showed substantially lower heating as compared to the zzso zzso in zzso imaging sequences in a zzso
