This study was undertaken to document the clinical results and technical aspects of zzso partial zzso in conjunction with peripheral tear repair for the treatment of symptomatic zzso lateral zzso in zzso 

From June 1998 to May 2005, the senior author zzso performed zzso surgery on 77 children zzso knees) with symptomatic zzso lateral zzso Of these patients, we zzso studied 23 patients zzso knees) with a peripheral tear that was treated by partial central zzso in conjunction with peripheral zzso zzso Mean age at operation was zzso years zzso 4 to 15 zzso and the mean follow-up period was zzso months zzso 24 to 94 zzso zzso findings were zzso into 3 types in terms of peripheral rim stability and tear zzso zzso zzso junction zzso anterior horn type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso horn type zzso zzso and zzso zzso corner zzso loss zzso These 3 types needed different zzso techniques for zzso with zzso Clinical results were evaluated using zzso knee scores and Hospital for Special Surgery zzso scores preoperatively and at final zzso 

All patients were able to return to their previous life activities with little or no zzso and no zzso was required after an average follow-up of 51 zzso Mean zzso knee scores improved from zzso zzso 69 to zzso preoperatively to zzso zzso 85 to zzso at the final follow-up zzso zzso zzso and the mean zzso score improved from zzso zzso 69 to zzso preoperatively to zzso zzso 90 to zzso at the final follow-up zzso zzso zzso 

We believe that the described zzso partial zzso in conjunction with the zzso repair of the peripheral tear are effective for treating children with a symptomatic zzso lateral zzso 

Level IV, therapeutic case zzso
