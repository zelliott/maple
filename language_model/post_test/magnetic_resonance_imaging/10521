We investigated the symptoms, course and prognosis of zzso zzso zzso in a large group of patients with idiopathic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to gain more insight into the broad clinical spectrum of the zzso Several findings from earlier smaller-scale studies were tested, and for the first time the potential differences between the zzso and idiopathic zzso and between males and females were zzso Generally, the course of the pain zzso itself in three consecutive zzso with an initial zzso continuous pain lasting for approximately 4 weeks on zzso zzso involvement was quite common and found in zzso of patients but was clinically less zzso than the initial pain and subsequent zzso As a typically zzso disorder zzso can affect almost any nerve in the zzso zzso although damage in the upper and middle trunk distribution with involvement of the long zzso and/or zzso nerve occurred most frequently zzso We found no correlation between the distribution of motor and sensory zzso In zzso zzso attacks were found in zzso of the patients during an average 6 year zzso zzso patients had an earlier onset zzso versus zzso zzso more attacks zzso zzso versus zzso and more frequent involvement of nerves outside the zzso zzso zzso versus zzso than zzso patients, and a more severe maximum zzso with a subsequent poorer functional zzso In males the initial pain tended to last longer than it did in females zzso versus 23 zzso In females the middle or lower parts of the zzso zzso were involved more frequently zzso versus zzso in zzso and their functional outcome was zzso zzso recovery was less zzso than usually zzso with zzso pain and zzso in approximately two-thirds of the patients who were followed for 3 years or zzso
