The efficacy of a zzso zzso resistance exercise zzso system to induce strength gains and muscle zzso was zzso Designed for space crew in orbit, this technique offers resistance during coupled concentric and eccentric actions by utilizing the inertia of a rotating zzso set in motion by the zzso 

Ten middle-aged zzso zzso men and women performed four sets of seven zzso unilateral zzso zzso knee extensions two or three times weekly for 5 zzso zzso zzso force and zzso zzso activity of the three superficial zzso muscles were measured before and after this zzso In addition, with the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso volume of individual knee zzso and ankle zzso zzso muscles was zzso 

Over the 12 training sessions, the average concentric zzso and eccentric zzso force generated during exercise increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso strength zzso voluntary contraction, zzso at 90 and 120 degrees knee angle increased by zzso zzso zzso 11 and zzso respectively, after zzso Neither individual zzso muscle showed a change zzso zzso zzso in zzso integrated zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle volume increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the magnitude of response zzso all individual zzso muscles showed increased zzso zzso zzso volume after zzso As expected, ankle zzso zzso volume of the trained limb was unchanged zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso and zzso force, zzso and knee zzso and zzso zzso muscle volume were zzso zzso zzso zzso in the right, zzso zzso 

The results of this study show that the present zzso regimen produces marked muscle zzso and important increases in zzso voluntary strength and appears equally effective as zzso zzso using zzso zzso in this zzso
