Our aim was to determine whether the contrast between white matter zzso and zzso white matter in fast zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso images can be improved by lengthening the effective TE and the echo train zzso 

Thirty patients with various white matter zzso were zzso using fast zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso inversion time zzso zzso on a zzso MR imaging zzso For 14 patients, fast zzso zzso sequences with a TE of 165 zzso and echo train length of 32 zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with fast zzso zzso sequences with a TE of 125 zzso and echo train length of 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso For 16 other patients, fast zzso zzso zzso sequences were compared with fast zzso zzso sequences with a TE of 145 zzso and echo train length of 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso ratios were calculated between the zzso and zzso white matter for a typical zzso in each zzso 

In both groups, a small but statistically significant increase in the signal zzso ratio was found on the fast zzso zzso sequences using the longer TE and echo train zzso In the first group, signal zzso ratio increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for fast zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso for fast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the second group, the signal zzso ratio increased from zzso zzso zzso for fast zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso for fast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, fast zzso zzso sequences with a longer TE and echo train length were obtained more rapidly (6 zzso for fast zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso 20 zzso for fast zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso 41 zzso for fast zzso zzso zzso 

zzso the TE to 165 zzso and echo train length to 32 in fast zzso zzso imaging allows both a mild improvement in the contrast between white matter zzso and zzso white matter and shorter imaging zzso
