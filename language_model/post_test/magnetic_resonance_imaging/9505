The zzso tissue becomes zzso after initiation of zzso zzso which may result in impaired tissue metabolism and, ultimately, in severe tissue zzso Although changes in the major cerebral zzso can be studied using magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso techniques, their zzso resolution is often not sufficient for routine examination of zzso and zzso acute stroke zzso Recently, zzso MR imaging zzso has been proposed as a means to assess tissue zzso by probing the zzso chemical exchange of zzso zzso from zzso proteins and zzso In this study, we characterized acute zzso tissue damage using localized zzso MRS and zzso imaging techniques that included zzso zzso zzso and relaxation zzso Our study showed that zzso zzso can detect zzso zzso and strongly zzso with tissue zzso content measured by zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso Our results also confirmed the correlation between apparent diffusion zzso and zzso however, no significant relationship was found for zzso zzso and zzso In zzso our study showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso to local tissue zzso remains a promising tool for providing a surrogate imaging marker of zzso zzso and altered tissue zzso and zzso conventional techniques for stroke zzso
