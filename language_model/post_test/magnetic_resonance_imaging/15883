This study was designed to zzso the effectiveness of the zzso ratio in patients with cervical zzso 

We studied 107 patients who underwent open door zzso for the treatment of cervical zzso between the zzso to zzso zzso We determined the zzso ratio on zzso and zzso cervical spine lateral zzso the zzso zzso ratio on zzso reconstruction CT scans, and the zzso zzso fluid zzso column ratio on zzso zzso MR images from zzso to zzso The severity of zzso was determined using the zzso score on both zzso and zzso zzso The recovery rate was also zzso The zzso ratio in plain zzso from patients with zzso was compared with the ratio of the zzso body to the spinal canal on CT and zzso 

The average zzso ratio between zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to zzso On CT zzso the average zzso zzso ratio between zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to zzso On zzso the zzso zzso column ratio between zzso and zzso ranged between zzso and zzso A positive correlation was noted between the zzso ratio and the zzso zzso ratio on zzso CT zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and between the zzso ratio and the zzso zzso column ratio on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

We demonstrated a good correlation between the zzso ratio and both the zzso zzso ratio on CT and the zzso zzso column ratio on zzso zzso the zzso ratio can be relied upon to predict narrowing of the cervical spinal canal in the zzso zzso
