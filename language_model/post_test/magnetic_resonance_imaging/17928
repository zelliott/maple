To investigate the ability of zzso zzso MR images to discriminate between normal and abnormal zzso zzso 

Three different measurement techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso alignment zzso were applied in 49 patients zzso zzso range zzso Three groups of subjects were zzso zzso normal zzso alignment zzso zzso zzso abnormal zzso zzso zzso any degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso alignment was then measured on zzso MR images using four different measurement techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to find the MR measurement with the greatest sensitivity and specificity for discrimination between normal and abnormal zzso zzso 

The most accurate measurement on MR images to detect abnormal zzso zzso was the one using the zzso zzso zzso reaching a zzso of zzso using a zzso value of zzso zzso The most accurate measurement on MR images to detect abnormal zzso zzso was the zzso zzso reaching a zzso of zzso using a zzso value of zzso zzso 

It is possible to suspect abnormal zzso alignment on zzso zzso MR zzso 

zzso zzso zzso alignment can be identified on zzso zzso MR zzso zzso The zzso zzso was the best predictor of an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was the best predictor of a zzso zzso
