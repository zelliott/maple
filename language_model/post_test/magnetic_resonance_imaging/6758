zzso events are a major cause for zzso strokes after carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can reveal zzso events as zzso signals zzso during zzso zzso during zzso and zzso are frequently zzso zzso during zzso are rare and known to be correlated with the neurological outcome of the zzso In the present study, we analyzed the occurrence of zzso within different stages of zzso and whether zzso within those stages were correlated with cerebral zzso as detected by zzso imaging zzso and brain zzso as detected by zzso zzso 

zzso patients were monitored zzso for zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed within 24 hours before and after zzso Positive zzso zzso led to zzso with zzso zzso 7 to 10 days after zzso for detection of cerebral zzso 

zzso were detected in 32 of 33 zzso The highest number of zzso was found during zzso and zzso A significant correlation was found between zzso and zzso during zzso A significant correlation was found between zzso during dissection and zzso and zzso correlation was found between zzso and the occurrence of cerebral zzso 

zzso could be regularly detected during zzso zzso and zzso seem to be the most vulnerable stages of the zzso
