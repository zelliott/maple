We describe the spectrum of findings and the diagnostic value of MR zzso in patients referred with suspicion of zzso zzso 

48 patients zzso zzso 14 zzso mean age 48 zzso with zzso and clinically suspected zzso zzso underwent MR zzso Patients were divided into patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso ability, time to initiate zzso time of zzso changes in the zzso angle zzso presence of paradoxical zzso contraction and presence of additional pelvic floor zzso zzso zzso positive and negative zzso values and accuracy for the diagnosis of zzso zzso were zzso 

The most frequent finding was impaired zzso which was seen in zzso of patients with zzso zzso and in zzso of the control group, yielding a sensitivity for MR zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso but a specificity of only zzso zzso zzso zzso A lower sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso and a high specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso were seen with abnormal zzso The sensitivity of paradoxical zzso contraction was relatively high zzso zzso zzso zzso A combined analysis of abnormal zzso and paradoxical zzso contraction allowed for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the patients with zzso zzso 

MR zzso detects functional and structural abnormal findings in patients with clinically suspected zzso zzso zzso zzso is seen in patients with functional zzso zzso to other pelvic floor abnormalities than zzso zzso
