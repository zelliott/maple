zzso zzso hypertension zzso is a clinical disorder of unknown zzso zzso with increased zzso pressure in the absence of zzso an underlying mass zzso and demonstrating normal zzso fluid zzso zzso may exhibit several zzso imaging findings zzso an empty zzso zzso globe zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso nerve sheath zzso 

To introduce widening of the zzso zzso as a new imaging marker for zzso 

zzso is a syndrome which may exhibit several previously described zzso imaging findings zzso an empty zzso zzso globe zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso nerve sheath zzso We zzso that chronically elevated zzso fluid pressure can lead to zzso zzso and we propose widening of the zzso zzso as a new imaging marker for zzso 

Average zzso zzso sizes were increased in patients with zzso compared to controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso For a zzso value of 30 zzso the sensitivity of zzso area to detect zzso was zzso with zzso zzso Classic findings were significantly more common in patients with zzso compared to controls zzso empty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso globe zzso zzso zzso zzso vertical zzso of the zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso and zzso nerve sheath zzso zzso zzso zzso all P values zzso zzso 

Our study confirms the association of several classic imaging findings with zzso and supports widening of the zzso zzso as an additional imaging marker which may be incorporated into the evaluation of patients suspected to have this zzso
