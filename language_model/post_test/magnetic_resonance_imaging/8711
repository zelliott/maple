When interpreting a message, a listener takes into account several sources of linguistic and zzso zzso Here we focused on one particular form of zzso information, certain speaker characteristics as conveyed by the zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the neural structures involved in the unification of sentence meaning and zzso zzso about the speaker's age, sex, or social zzso We found enhanced zzso in the inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso during listening to sentences whose meaning was zzso with zzso speaker zzso Furthermore, our results showed an overlap in brain regions involved in unification of zzso information and those used for the unification of semantic and world knowledge information zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso and left middle zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings provide evidence for a shared neural unification system for linguistic and zzso sources of information and extend the existing knowledge about the role of inferior frontal zzso as a crucial component for unification during language zzso
