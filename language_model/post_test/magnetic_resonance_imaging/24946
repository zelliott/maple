zzso neurodegenerative and zzso changes are thought to zzso decline in motor and cognitive functions, but zzso processes in cortical and zzso function may allow maintenance of performance level in some zzso Our objective was to investigate age-related changes in the motor system of the human brain using functional zzso Twenty six right handed volunteers were scanned whilst performing an zzso zzso visually paced hand grip task, using dominant (right) and zzso (left) hands in separate zzso Hand grip with visual feedback activated a network of cortical and zzso regions known to be involved in the generation of simple motor zzso In addition, zzso was seen in a putative human zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso and zzso zzso Within this network, a number of regions were more likely to be activated the older the zzso In particular, age-related changes in zzso specific zzso were demonstrated in left deep anterior central zzso when using the dominant or zzso zzso Additional age-related increases were seen in zzso zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso and zzso zzso We have demonstrated a clear age-related effect in the neural zzso of motor performance, and zzso suggest that these changes are zzso These results support the notion that an adaptable and plastic motor network is able to respond to age-related degenerative changes in order to maintain performance zzso
