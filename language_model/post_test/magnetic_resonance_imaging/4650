We studied a 13-year-old girl with unilateral extensive cortical zzso who had mild zzso with mirror movement and no sensory zzso zzso focal magnetic stimulation zzso to the unaffected zzso zzso bilateral motor evoked zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso with similar zzso and zzso The scalp positions where the zzso zzso were highest were at the same site in the unaffected zzso for both zzso zzso to the affected zzso showed no zzso for either zzso These data indicated that the zzso response of the zzso side originated from the same motor zzso as for the zzso zzso probably due to zzso zzso In the study of zzso zzso evoked zzso the cortical representation point of the zzso hand sensation was in the zzso unaffected zzso this point was located anterior to the cortical representation point of the zzso hand zzso We conclude that reorganization of primary motor and sensory zzso occurs when there is unilateral extensive brain damage in early zzso
