zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease belong to the spectrum of disorders ascribed to dominant zzso in the gene zzso for type IV collagen zzso zzso Mice zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso suffer from zzso zzso cerebral and zzso bleeding and zzso zzso We observed zzso and white matter zzso in members from two families that lack zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso genetic predisposition to zzso therefore we zzso zzso in the family members and characterized clinical, zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso identified the zzso zzso zzso in zzso 44 in one family and the zzso change in zzso 34 leading to frame shift and premature stop, in the second zzso zzso and zzso of zzso basement zzso were observed by electron zzso in a zzso patient skin zzso consistent with abnormal collagen IV zzso zzso chain zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress have been proposed as cellular mechanism in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso we detected increased rates of zzso and no signs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso white matter zzso zzso and zzso nerve zzso and zzso carotid zzso In the second family however, we found evidence for additional factors contributing to the zzso We conclude that dominant zzso zzso are a novel major risk factor for familial cerebrovascular disease, including zzso and zzso disease with reduced zzso and variable zzso which might also be modified by other contributing zzso
