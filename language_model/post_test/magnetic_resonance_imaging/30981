The modern human zzso labyrinth is zzso distinct from that of all other zzso showing derived features linked with zzso function and the overall shape of the zzso zzso However, little is known of how this unique zzso emerges zzso This study examines in detail the developing fetal human zzso both to document this basic aspect of zzso biology, and more specifically, to gain insight into the zzso basis of its zzso derived zzso zzso zzso human zzso ranging from 9 to 29 weeks zzso were investigated with high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso zzso analyses of the labyrinthine zzso revealed a number of interesting age-related zzso In addition, our findings show that: zzso the prenatal labyrinth attains an adult equivalent size between 17 and 19 weeks zzso zzso within the period investigated, shape changes to all or most of the labyrinth cease after the zzso size maturation point or after the zzso capsule zzso zzso fetal zzso development zzso with the surrounding zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso zzso zzso age-related zzso of the zzso and zzso relative to the lateral canal, and zzso canal zzso are similar to documented zzso trends whereas other trends remain zzso zzso are discussed in terms of the zzso processes and mechanisms that most likely led, in part, to the emergence of the zzso derived adult modern human zzso
