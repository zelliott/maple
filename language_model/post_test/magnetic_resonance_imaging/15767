This zzso study examined the neural zzso of the observed improvement in advantageous risk-taking behavior, as measured by the number of adjusted pumps in the zzso zzso zzso Task zzso following a zzso course of a Traditional Chinese Medicine zzso recipe, specifically designed to regulate zzso in order to zzso risk-taking zzso The 14 participants recruited for this study were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups and the zzso recipe zzso 520 zzso zzso zzso Bunge, 520 zzso zzso 840 zzso zzso zzso zzso 470 zzso zzso zzso Root zzso zzso 450 zzso and zzso zzso 470 zzso was zzso as a diet supplement, to the seven participants in the experimental zzso The neural activity of the two groups was monitored by a zzso zzso zzso before and after the zzso zzso Associated with the improved advantageous risk-taking behavior seen in the experimental group, significantly stronger blood zzso level dependent zzso responses were observed in the bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso zzso left zzso left thalamus, right zzso and right anterior zzso zzso zzso regions which have previously been reported as being involved in risk-taking decision zzso The effect of the zzso in improving advantageous risk-taking decision making appears to have been related to the enhanced efficiency of the cognitive affective system, the zzso network, which functions to inhibit zzso to sensitize zzso information, and to allow the opportunity, during risk zzso to evaluate potential gains and zzso The findings of this study suggest that interventions acting on factors modulating risk-taking decision making could have a beneficial effect in terms of zzso risk-taking zzso
