zzso measurement of cerebral zzso zzso can serve as a tool for better understanding zzso signals and for clinical evaluation of brain oxygen zzso In this study a novel technique, zzso zzso zzso is developed to estimate zzso in zzso zzso This method uses the spin labeling principle to automatically isolate pure blood signals from which zzso relaxation times are determined using zzso zzso zzso The blood zzso is then converted to blood zzso using a zzso zzso In zzso experiments gave a baseline zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the standard zzso across trials was zzso zzso zzso The effects of repetition time and inversion time selections were zzso The zzso technique was further tested using various zzso zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, caffeine zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso agent infusion zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso blood zzso by zzso zzso The results of this study show that zzso zzso is a useful technique for quantitative assessment of blood zzso in the zzso
