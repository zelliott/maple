Recent studies have identified zzso as a probable zzso gene for schizophrenia and bipolar zzso However, little is known about how this gene may affect brain function to increase vulnerability to these zzso The present investigation examined the impact of zzso zzso on brain function in patients with zzso patients with bipolar I disorder and healthy zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain responses during a verbal zzso task in a total of 115 subjects zzso 41 patients with zzso 29 patients with bipolar disorder and 45 healthy zzso We then used statistical zzso mapping to estimate the main effects of diagnostic group, the main effect of zzso and their zzso We tested the hypothesis that the high-risk zzso of zzso would be associated with altered prefrontal zzso In all three diagnostic groups, the high-risk zzso of zzso was associated with greater zzso in the left zzso In addition, there was an interaction between diagnosis and zzso in two regions of the prefrontal zzso The right inferior frontal zzso expressed increased zzso in individuals with the high-risk zzso but only in patients with zzso zzso the right zzso zzso zzso expressed increased zzso in individuals with the high-risk zzso but only in patients with bipolar zzso Our results suggest that genetic variation in zzso has a measurable impact on brain function and provide preliminary evidence for a zzso pattern of gene action in different regions of the prefrontal zzso
