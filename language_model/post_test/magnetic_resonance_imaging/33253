Aging and hypertension are well-known risk factors for cerebral white matter zzso zzso status has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular zzso In this study, we investigated the relationships among zzso status, ambulatory blood pressure zzso and white matter zzso zzso in elderly zzso 

zzso of zzso fragments zzso zzso von zzso Factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso monitoring zzso and brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso were performed in zzso Japanese elderly zzso zzso years old, male zzso zzso cases were further divided into deep zzso white matter zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

Deep zzso zzso had significant positive correlations with age, use of zzso agents, log zzso log zzso log zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had significant positive correlations with age, male zzso smoking, use of zzso agents, white coat hypertension zzso log zzso and zzso zzso Severe zzso had significant positive correlations with age, use of zzso agents, zzso and zzso zzso and that was marginally correlated with log zzso In the zzso linear zzso analysis, log zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted for age and zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted for age and zzso zzso 

In the present study, zzso and zzso were positively associated with zzso after adjustment for zzso zzso in elderly zzso In addition to the conventional risk factors, zzso status might serve as a significant zzso for zzso
