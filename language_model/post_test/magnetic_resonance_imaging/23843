zzso transfer zzso techniques may be applied to magnetic resonance imaging zzso to evaluate the inherent relaxation properties of zzso zzso In addition to providing a unique contrast mechanism for the purpose of qualitative imaging, the zzso effect may be zzso by various means to provide useful data that relate either to the pathological or associated clinical features of multiple sclerosis zzso and other neurological zzso The variable and relatively unpredictable course of neurological disorders such as zzso often zzso the study of large patient zzso in multiple zzso centers to define either the natural history of the disease or its modification by potential zzso For zzso studies, precision zzso or lack of random zzso and accuracy zzso to the truth, or lack of systematic zzso are important requirements for the acquisition of standardized and comparable zzso For serial studies, quality assurance is important to determine pathological change from fluctuation in scanner zzso This review addresses how zzso imaging techniques may be zzso to provide standardized and clinically relevant zzso
