White matter zzso zzso on zzso MR images occurring in the zzso zzso of normal individuals are a subject of great clinical zzso We therefore investigated regional cerebral blood flow zzso of the zzso zzso among zzso normal zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso normal subjects were divided into four grades of zzso on the basis of their MR zzso zzso values in the zzso zzso were measured by xenon contrast CT zzso 

Advanced age and associated hypertension were significant risk factors for higher grade zzso zzso zzso zzso values on the left side were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in grade 0, zzso zzso zzso in grade I, zzso zzso zzso in grade II, zzso zzso zzso in grade III, and zzso zzso zzso in grade zzso zzso were significant between grades zzso zzso zzso between grade 0 and grades II, III, and zzso between grade II and grades III and zzso and between grades III and zzso Patients with hypertension had lower zzso values than those without in grades 0, I, II, and III, with significant difference in grade I zzso zzso zzso zzso studies between patients 61 to 70 years old confirmed a significant difference between zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso are associated with greater age, hypertension, and reduced zzso zzso
