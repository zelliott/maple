When participants are asked to decide which of a pair of zzso Arabic numbers is larger, they compare units and decades, even when units are zzso Typically, behavioral responses are slower when units are zzso with the decade comparison zzso zzso because 8 zzso 2 but 1 zzso 6; zzso zzso effect, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breaks in the mental number line? Putting the tens and units back in different zzso zzso 82, zzso We defined zzso zzso to examine the effect of decade zzso distance and unit zzso zzso processing on the zzso signal to investigate the neural zzso of zzso magnitude zzso Fourteen male right-handed volunteers zzso age zzso 27, range zzso zzso took part in the zzso In a rapid zzso design, participants had to decide which of two zzso Arabic numbers was zzso Data were zzso and analyzed statistically in zzso zzso in the anterior portion of the right zzso was significantly modulated by zzso unit distance zzso Furthermore, decade distance predicted an increase in the zzso signal from zzso around the left zzso right anterior and right zzso zzso These results indicate that magnitude representations of zzso zzso and decade distance are zzso by the zzso zzso and that the symbolic structure of the Arabic number system is an important zzso of zzso number magnitude zzso zzso of the present results in terms of general symbolic information processing are zzso
