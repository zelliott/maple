zzso is associated with zzso zzso matter volume reductions in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso refers to a set of zzso traits and zzso thought to represent the zzso manifestation of schizophrenia in the general zzso While there is evidence of a zzso between schizophrenia and zzso at zzso genetic and cognitive levels, no previous study has observed zzso matter volume reductions associated with increased zzso zzso levels in healthy zzso Such evidence would provide further support for a relationship between zzso zzso traits in the general population and the full-blown clinical condition of zzso 

We used magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the relationship between zzso zzso and brain structure in 55 clinically unaffected and zzso zzso We performed a zzso zzso analysis of zzso matter volume data obtained at zzso zzso 

zzso for age and zzso higher scores of self-report positive zzso were significantly associated with reduced zzso matter volume in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cortical zzso 

These findings show that zzso zzso in healthy individuals is associated with volume reductions in cortical areas known to be altered in zzso thereby providing zzso evidence of a zzso between zzso and zzso
