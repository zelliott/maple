The purpose of this study was to identify independent factors associated with impaired clinical status in late survivors of zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso often results in chronic pulmonary zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso which have been linked to late morbidity and zzso However, zzso of clinical status late after zzso repair have not been fully zzso 

The clinical and laboratory data of 100 consecutive patients with repaired zzso zzso 21 years after zzso who completed a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging protocol were zzso zzso clinical status was defined as New York Heart Association zzso functional class zzso or zzso 

Of the patients, 88 were in zzso functional class I or II and 12 were in zzso functional class zzso The degree of zzso and zzso RV zzso volume were not associated with impaired clinical zzso By zzso analysis, a lower left zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso for zzso decrease, p zzso zzso and older age at zzso repair zzso zzso zzso for zzso increase, p zzso zzso were the strongest independent factors associated with impaired clinical zzso Among RV zzso a lower RV zzso was the strongest independent factors associated with poor clinical status zzso zzso zzso for zzso decrease, p zzso zzso The zzso zzso correlated with RV zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso or severe zzso or RV zzso dysfunction, but not zzso fraction or RV zzso dimensions, is independently associated with impaired clinical status in long-term survivors of zzso zzso The close relationship between zzso zzso and RV zzso suggests zzso zzso zzso
