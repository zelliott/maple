In visually guided grasping, possible hand shapes are zzso from the geometrical features of the object, while prior knowledge about the object and the goal of the action influence both the zzso and the selection of the hand zzso We investigated the system dynamics of the human brain for the zzso of grasping with two aspects zzso One is object recognition, with the use of objects for daily zzso The subjects zzso grasping movements appropriate for an object presented in a photograph either by precision or power zzso The other is the selection of grip hand zzso We manipulated the selection demands for the grip hand shape by having the subjects use the same or different grip type in the second presentation of the identical zzso zzso connectivity analysis revealed that the increased selection demands enhance the interaction between the anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso and drive the zzso zzso influences from the zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso to the zzso zzso area zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso visual areas interact in the zzso of grasping, while the zzso zzso the neural information of different regions to select the hand zzso The present study proposes system dynamics in visually guided movement toward meaningful objects, but further research is needed to examine if the same dynamics is found also in real zzso
