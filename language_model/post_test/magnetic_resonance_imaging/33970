zzso particles of iron oxide zzso constitute a contrast agent that accumulates in cells from the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso they may accumulate in zzso cells such as zzso The goal of this study was to compare zzso MR images with conventional zzso images and zzso zzso images in a model of experimental zzso zzso zzso 

Nine rats with zzso and four control rats were zzso at zzso T and zzso T with conventional zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences obtained 24 hours after intravenous injection of a zzso contrast agent, zzso zzso examination was performed with zzso zzso zzso stain for iron, and zzso zzso for zzso 

zzso images showed a high sensitivity zzso for detecting zzso zzso whereas poor sensitivity was obtained with zzso images zzso and zzso zzso images zzso All the MR findings in the control rats were zzso zzso examination revealed the presence of zzso at the site where abnormalities were seen on zzso zzso 

The high sensitivity of zzso for zzso activity relative to other imaging techniques is explained by the zzso findings of numerous zzso cell zzso including zzso in zzso This work supports the possibility of zzso zzso transport to the zzso by zzso which may have future implications for imaging of human inflammatory zzso
