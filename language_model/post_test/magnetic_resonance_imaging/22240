A new rapid zzso imaging technique with improved sensitivity and zzso suppression, referred to as zzso Echo zzso zzso Imaging zzso has been developed to measure the zzso distribution of brain zzso increases during hyperventilation on a conventional clinical scanner equipped with a head surface zzso phased zzso zzso images zzso zzso size: zzso zzso in five healthy subjects from an zzso section approximately 20 zzso inferior to the zzso line were obtained during an zzso baseline period of zzso and during the final zzso zzso of a zzso period of zzso hyperventilation zzso zzso of 20 zzso The zzso zzso signal increased significantly from baseline during hyperventilation for the insular cortex, zzso cortex, and zzso regions of both the right and left hemisphere, but not in the zzso zzso Regional or zzso zzso differences were not zzso The study extends previous work using zzso MR zzso to zzso study hyperventilation effects on brain zzso
