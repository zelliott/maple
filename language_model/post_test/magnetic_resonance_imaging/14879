To evaluate criteria to differentiate zzso zzso zzso zzso giant cell tumor zzso and giant zzso zzso zzso with CT and zzso 

CT and MR images of 22 zzso 19 zzso and 8 zzso were zzso The clinical and imaging features of each tumor were zzso 

The mean ages of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso were predominantly located in the zzso of lower zzso while most zzso zzso and zzso zzso were eccentrically located in upper zzso There were significant differences in age, location, zzso zzso of bone zzso zzso bleeding and zzso Multiple small zzso were mainly observed in zzso zzso with large central zzso in zzso zzso zzso expanded mainly inside zzso while zzso and zzso often extended into pelvic cavity zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and muscles were also zzso zzso extension within zzso canal was only displayed in zzso The preservation of zzso discs showed difference between large and small tumors zzso zzso zzso regardless of tumor type zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was displayed in gender zzso zzso zzso or tumor size zzso zzso zzso among three zzso 

Age, epicenter of the zzso zzso zzso eccentric and upper zzso lower zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso expanding pattern, muscles and zzso joint involvement can be criteria for zzso zzso level is specific for zzso and ascending extension within the zzso canal for zzso The preservation of zzso discs is related to tumor size rather than tumor zzso
