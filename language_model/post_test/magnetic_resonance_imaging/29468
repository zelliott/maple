We examined the effects of two doses of alcohol zzso on functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso during a visual perception zzso The zzso Visual zzso zzso zzso provides measures of overall visual zzso processing zzso It incorporates different cognitive elements including visual discrimination, spatial zzso and mental zzso We used the zzso to study brain zzso patterns in healthy controls zzso zzso and zzso at two doses of alcohol intoxication with zzso zzso The zzso data were analyzed using a general linear model approach based upon a model of the time course and a zzso response zzso Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed to examine zzso zzso zzso With regard to alcohol-free zzso brain zzso we replicate our previous finding in which zzso group analysis revealed robust zzso in visual and visual association areas, frontal eye field zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and the supplemental motor area zzso zzso with a previous study of zzso and visual zzso zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso zzso over much of the visual perception network and in a decrease in the maximum zzso ratio (in the zzso zzso Despite only modest behavior changes (in the expected zzso significant zzso zzso increases were observed in zzso zzso and zzso regions, whereas zzso zzso decreases were observed in anterior and zzso cingulate, zzso and middle frontal zzso Some areas zzso became more zzso activated zzso increased in spatial zzso at the higher zzso zzso thus, appears to have both global and local effects upon the neural zzso of the zzso task, some of which are dose zzso
