The use of zzso with zzso magnetic zzso for imaging cells is a rapidly growing field of zzso We have recently reported that single zzso cells could be zzso as signal zzso in zzso in mouse brains using a balanced zzso free zzso imaging sequence zzso and a customized zzso system at zzso zzso 

In the current study we assess the benefits, and challenges, of using a higher magnetic field strength for imaging zzso cells with zzso using ex zzso mouse brain specimens zzso with near identical systems at zzso and zzso zzso 

The substantial zzso artifact that appears in 3 T zzso images was readily minimized with zzso phase zzso allowing for zzso zzso images to be compared between the two field zzso This study revealed that with an optimal 3 T zzso imaging zzso more than twice as many signal voids were detected as with zzso zzso 

There are several factors that contributed to this important zzso First, a zzso zzso gain was achieved in mouse brain images at 3 zzso Second, a reduction in the zzso and the associated increase in repetition time and zzso produced a dramatic increase in the contrast generated by zzso zzso
