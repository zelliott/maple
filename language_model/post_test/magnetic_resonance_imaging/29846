Previous research has suggested that a zzso category learning task zzso weather prediction zzso can be used to zzso brain zzso of zzso We tested zzso subjects with bilateral zzso damage due to zzso and matched controls on the weather prediction task and a zzso the zzso zzso task, which maintains a similar category zzso The hypoxic subjects were impaired relative to controls on both zzso in the ice cream task, this difference was evident even early in training zzso 50 zzso This finding is similar to functional zzso zzso studies in healthy subjects, which show zzso zzso involvement even in early learning on this zzso Additionally, strategy analysis of response patterns during learning suggest that the hypoxic group relied more heavily on simple, zzso learning strategies than did the control zzso These results may suggest a zzso of the generally held conclusion that zzso patients are not impaired at zzso category zzso at least under some circumstances, zzso patients show an early and lasting zzso
