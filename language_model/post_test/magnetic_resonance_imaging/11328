In this study, zzso images of the human prostate were successfully zzso enabling zzso of apparent diffusion zzso zzso in normal and zzso zzso A dual acquisition fast zzso sequence was used for accurate zzso zzso zzso values were significantly higher in the peripheral zone than the central zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant correlations were found in either normal or zzso tissue between zzso values and relaxation rates for all three zzso directions and the zzso averaged water diffusion zzso Evidence suggesting that zzso zzso is present in normal zzso tissue is also detailed, with significant differences noted between the zzso and both the zzso and zzso of the zzso for peripheral zone zzso zzso zzso and central zzso zzso zzso zzso
