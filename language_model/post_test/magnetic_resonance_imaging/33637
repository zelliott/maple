The goal of this study was to examine zzso differences between zzso and zzso zzso in normal rat brain and to determine zzso changes using in zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging at 300 zzso The zzso observed were: zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three small zzso in the zzso acid region which included zzso from zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso and zzso + zzso zzso A previously zzso resonance was observed at zzso zzso in brain of rats zzso with zzso zzso images in normal brain demonstrated increased zzso and zzso and decreased zzso in zzso compared to zzso zzso The major zzso changes were an increase of zzso zzso and zzso and a decrease of zzso and zzso The rise in zzso was significantly higher in zzso than in zzso zzso
