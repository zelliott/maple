To describe the detection of cortical areas and zzso pathways involved in language observed in zzso zzso studies and zzso in a zzso zzso scanner and to correlate the findings of these functional studies with direct zzso cortical and zzso zzso 

We present a series of 14 patients with focal brain tumors adjacent to eloquent brain zzso All patients underwent zzso evaluation before and after zzso All patients underwent zzso examination including structural zzso zzso imaging, zzso functional imaging to determine zzso of motor and language areas, and zzso zzso All patients underwent cortical mapping through cortical and zzso stimulation during the operation to zzso the zzso zzso follow-up studies were done 24 hours after zzso 

The correlation of motor function and of the zzso tract determined by functional zzso and zzso with zzso mapping of cortical and zzso motor areas was zzso The eloquent brain areas of language expression and reception were strongly correlated with zzso cortical mapping in all but two cases (a high grade zzso zzso and a low grade zzso located in the frontal zzso zzso zzso identified the zzso zzso the lateral part of the superior zzso zzso the zzso zzso the inferior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which made it possible to mark the limits of the zzso The correlation with the zzso mapping of the zzso arrangement of the zzso with respect to the zzso was zzso 

The best treatment for brain tumors is maximum zzso without associated deficits, so high quality functional studies are necessary for zzso zzso
