On zzso imaging zzso zzso tumors of the brain may exhibit different signal zzso zzso depending on their zzso and zzso The purpose of our study was to verify the hypotheses zzso that zzso on zzso predict the zzso of zzso and zzso that apparent diffusion zzso zzso values reflect tumor zzso 

We assessed conventional MR images, zzso and zzso maps of 26 zzso brain zzso from 26 patients, 13 of whom underwent surgery after the MR zzso Two zzso performed qualitative assessment by consensus of the zzso on zzso in areas corresponding to their enhancing zzso We measured the zzso ratio zzso on zzso images and zzso zzso zzso values, and compared them with tumor zzso 

The mean zzso on zzso and the zzso on zzso images were significantly lower in well differentiated than in poorly differentiated zzso and zzso other than zzso The mean zzso value was significantly higher in well differentiated than poorly differentiated zzso and zzso other than zzso All 3 zzso zzso and 1 zzso neuroendocrine zzso exhibited high zzso on zzso The zzso value showed a significant inverse correlation with tumor zzso There was no significant correlation between the zzso and tumor zzso 

The zzso on zzso may predict the zzso of zzso well differentiated zzso tended to be zzso and small- and zzso neuroendocrine zzso showed zzso Their zzso values reflect tumor zzso
