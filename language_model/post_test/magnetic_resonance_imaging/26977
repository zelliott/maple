The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of zzso enhanced delivery zzso of zzso in combination with zzso for treatment of the zzso rat zzso zzso cells were implanted zzso into the brains of zzso Fischer rats, and 13 or 17 zzso later zzso (20 zzso zzso was administered by either zzso over 30 zzso or by zzso zzso pumps zzso zzso for zzso zzso beginning at 7 d after tumor zzso zzso were zzso with a 15 zzso zzso dose (5 zzso zzso 3) of 6 zzso photons to the whole brain beginning on the day after drug zzso Other groups of rats received either zzso or zzso zzso The tumor zzso concentration following zzso of 20 zzso in 10 zzso was zzso zzso which was equal to that observed following zzso administration of 100 zzso zzso zzso bearing small tumors, treated with zzso and zzso had a mean survival time zzso of zzso d following zzso and zzso d following pump delivery with zzso of the latter surviving zzso d zzso zzso compared to zzso d for zzso and zzso zzso for pump delivery of zzso alone and zzso d and zzso zzso respectively, for zzso and zzso zzso There was no microscopic evidence of residual tumor in the brains of all long-term zzso Not surprisingly, rats with large tumors had much shorter zzso Only modest increases in zzso were observed in animals that received either oral administration or zzso of zzso plus zzso zzso d and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso The present survival data, and those previously reported by us, are among the best ever obtained with the zzso zzso zzso Initially, they could provide a platform for a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of zzso of zzso in patients with zzso zzso and ultimately a Phase II trial of zzso in combination with radiation zzso
