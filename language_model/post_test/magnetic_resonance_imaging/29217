To zzso using functional zzso zzso the neural network that is activated by the pain component of zzso secondary mechanical zzso 

Mechanical zzso zzso pain to innocuous tactile zzso is a zzso symptom of zzso pain zzso Animal experiments suggest that zzso in central pain processing occur that render tactile stimuli capable of zzso central zzso zzso A similar central zzso can be produced zzso with zzso 

In nine healthy individuals the cerebral zzso pattern resulting from zzso zzso mechanical stimulation at the dominant zzso was zzso using zzso zzso was injected adjacent to the stimulation site to induce secondary mechanical zzso The identical mechanical stimulation was then perceived as painful without changing the stimulus intensity and zzso Both zzso patterns were compared to isolate the specific zzso component of mechanical zzso from the tactile zzso 

The pattern during zzso mechanical stimulation included zzso primary sensory zzso zzso and bilateral secondary sensory zzso zzso zzso During zzso significantly higher zzso was found in the zzso prefrontal zzso the middle zzso areas zzso 6, 8, and 9) and inferior frontal zzso zzso 44 and zzso No change was present within zzso zzso and the anterior zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is interpreted as a consequence of attention, cognitive zzso and planning of motor behavior in response to zzso The lack of zzso of the anterior zzso contrasts with zzso pain after zzso zzso It might indicate differences in the processing of zzso and zzso pain or it might be due to zzso of affective sensations during zzso compared with acute zzso zzso
