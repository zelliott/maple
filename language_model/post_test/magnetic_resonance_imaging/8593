The zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for the integration of zzso information during visually guided zzso Studies in zzso monkeys have demonstrated a functional zzso around the zzso zzso zzso with a more zzso representation of hand movements zzso reach zzso and a more lateral representation of zzso eye movements zzso zzso area, zzso Here we present evidence for the zzso of this concept with respect to the human zzso zzso We recorded isolated and combined zzso zzso movements in normal control subjects and in a patient with bilateral zzso zzso and incomplete zzso syndrome including severe zzso zzso zzso to visual zzso Brain zzso in the patient were caused by acute zzso zzso in association with zzso surgery because of zzso zzso zzso scans showed bilateral zzso zzso zzso restricted to the zzso at the zzso banks of the zzso zzso but leaving its lateral banks largely zzso In the patient visually guided reaching was significantly zzso whereas the metrics of visually guided zzso were within normal zzso zzso was more pronounced for the right visual field, with a gross zzso zzso of the movement improved when a delay of 5 or 10 s was introduced between target presentation and movement zzso zzso data support the concept of a functional zzso around the human zzso The zzso zzso to the zzso predominantly controls rapid zzso reaching movements, comparable to the zzso reach region in zzso whereas zzso eye movements appear to be controlled rather by the zzso lateral to the zzso
