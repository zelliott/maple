The optimal magnetic resonance image zzso slice thickness required to assess cartilage volume accurately and efficiently in zzso and zzso studies is zzso We compared cartilage volume measured from zzso of the knees using different slice thicknesses zzso to zzso zzso and assessed zzso zzso 

A total of 123 subjects with zzso had baseline and followup zzso on their symptomatic knee at 2 zzso zzso and lateral zzso cartilage volumes were calculated using increasing slice thickness by zzso each second, third, fourth, or fifth slice area to calculate total volume, which was compared to the zzso zzso volume calculated from the original zzso zzso zzso 

There was little difference in the average zzso and lateral zzso cartilage volume observed as the slice thickness increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso cartilage volume ranged from 1750 zzso to zzso zzso and lateral zzso cartilage volume ranged from 1949 zzso to 2007 zzso There was also little absolute difference in the average change in zzso and lateral zzso cartilage volume measured over 2 zzso However, with increasing slice zzso there was a decreased correlation between the zzso cartilage volume change calculated from the increased slice zzso with the lowest correlation being zzso zzso zzso zzso when the lateral cartilage volume calculated from the zzso zzso slice was compared to the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso slice thickness may provide sufficiently accurate measurement of zzso cartilage volume and change over time in some zzso This would result in reduction in zzso scanning and zzso processing time, which has the potential of increasing the feasibility of this zzso
