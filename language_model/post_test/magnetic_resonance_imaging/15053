Early brain injury occurs in newborns with zzso heart disease zzso placing them at risk for impaired zzso zzso zzso for zzso brain injury have not been well described in zzso zzso This study aimed to analyze, zzso brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso in a zzso group of newborns who had zzso surgery during the first month of life using a detailed qualitative zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative imaging assessments zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso values and brain zzso and clinical zzso zzso newborns who had zzso surgery at 8 zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso days of life and zzso brain zzso were zzso 38 also had zzso zzso Thirty-four zzso of 73, 47 zzso had at least one type of zzso brain injury, and 28 of 38 zzso zzso had zzso brain zzso The zzso zzso score was zzso associated with zzso injury, but there was no difference between zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso deep gray matter injury, and/or watershed zzso had the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values and brain volumes were not different in infants with different zzso types or in those with and without brain zzso In a mixed group of zzso zzso brain injury was found preoperatively on zzso in almost 50 zzso and there were no significant baseline characteristic differences to predict this early brain injury except zzso zzso zzso We conclude that all zzso regardless of zzso type, who require early surgery should be evaluated with zzso because they are all at high risk for brain zzso
