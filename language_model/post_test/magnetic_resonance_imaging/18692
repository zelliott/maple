zzso zzso zzso zzso are a clinically and genetically zzso group of neurodegenerative disorders for which zzso different genetic zzso have been zzso In some zzso types, expanded zzso or zzso repeats have been identified, and the length of these expansions zzso with the age at onset and with the severity of the clinical zzso In several other zzso types, no genetic zzso has yet been zzso We describe a large, zzso family with zzso zzso zzso and slowly progressive zzso zzso not associated with any of the known zzso zzso and a zzso in the zzso growth factor 14 zzso gene on zzso zzso Our observations are in accordance with the occurrence of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso As indicated by protein zzso the zzso acid change from zzso to zzso at position 145 is predicted to reduce the stability of the zzso The present zzso zzso represents a novel gene zzso involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
