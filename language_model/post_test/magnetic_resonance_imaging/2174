zzso zzso is a novel zzso diagnostic tool used to determine preoperatively the location of the zzso zone in patients with zzso The presence of focal slowing of activity recorded by zzso zzso is an additional indicator of an underlying pathological condition in cases of intractable zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso In the present study the authors examined the significance of zzso zzso and zzso spike activity detected using zzso in 29 patients who suffered from zzso that was not associated with structural brain zzso 

All patients underwent zzso surgery after zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling was applied to focal zzso magnetic activity zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as trains of rhythmic activity over the zzso area, with zzso lower than 7 zzso which were easily distinguished from background zzso zzso zzso was found in 17 patients zzso it always occurred on the side zzso to the side of zzso and displayed a maximum zzso over the zzso zzso zzso sources of magnetic flux zzso during zzso trains were found in the majority of cases in the zzso superior zzso region and, occasionally, in zzso zzso structures that were subsequently zzso With respect to zzso there was never disagreement between zzso and zzso zzso spike zzso Thus, in patients with zzso that is not associated with a mass zzso zzso is zzso related to the zzso area and, therefore, has value for reliable determination of the side and, zzso the location of this zzso 

Although focal slowing of zzso background activity is generally considered to be a zzso sign of functional zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso should be zzso as a distinct zzso phenomenon that is directly related to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso distribution of zzso and sharp activity improves the diagnostic utility of zzso in patients with suspected zzso who are undergoing surgical zzso
