In zzso zzso the zzso is often inflamed and inflammatory zzso contribute to cartilage zzso zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso have zzso effects whereas zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso have, on balance, zzso zzso The goal of our study was to assess the association of zzso plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso as measured by zzso zzso on contrast enhanced zzso knee zzso and cartilage damage among subjects in the zzso zzso Study zzso MOST is a cohort study of individuals who have or are at high risk of knee zzso An zzso subset of participants who volunteered obtained zzso zzso zzso of one zzso zzso was scored in six compartments and a summary score was zzso This subset also had zzso zzso analyzed by gas zzso for zzso fatty acid content, and zzso zzso read for cartilage zzso according to the zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso zzso The association between zzso and cartilage zzso and plasma zzso was assessed using zzso zzso after controlling for the effects of age, sex, and zzso zzso out of zzso subjects with zzso zzso had complete data on zzso cartilage zzso and plasma zzso Mean age was 60 years, mean zzso 30, and 50% were zzso We found an inverse relation between total zzso zzso and the specific zzso zzso acid with zzso cartilage loss, but not zzso cartilage loss or zzso A positive association was observed between the zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso In conclusion, systemic levels of zzso and zzso zzso which are influenced by diet, may be related to selected structural findings in knees with or at risk of zzso Future studies manipulating the systemic levels of these fatty acids may be warranted to determine the effects on structural damage in knee zzso
