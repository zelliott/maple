An zzso method based on the zzso zzso shift phenomenon was recently proposed as a fast and precise way to map a radio frequency zzso transmit field zzso zzso For zzso at high field, the mapping sensitivity of this approach was limited by tissue heating associated with a zzso zzso zzso To mitigate this, we investigated the possibility of lowering the zzso frequency of this pulse since theoretical analysis indicated that the sensitivity of zzso based zzso mapping could be substantially improved when irradiating closer to zzso Using zzso zzso pulse shape and zzso zzso to minimize direct zzso effects, in zzso experiments on human brains at 7 T confirmed improved sensitivity with this zzso zzso sensitivity translated into an zzso reduction in zzso zzso errors without increasing tissue zzso Published zzso This article is a zzso Government work and is in the public domain in the zzso
