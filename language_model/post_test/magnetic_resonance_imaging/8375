The purpose of the present study was to zzso the imaging structural abnormalities of zzso adult patients referred for magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of the brain at zzso Hospital and to correlate with the clinical data and zzso 

MR imaging of 91 adult zzso patients (age ranging from zzso years old with an average of zzso years old) were zzso reviewed and classified into eight groups according to zzso Then clinical data and zzso correlations were analyzed using the Kappa zzso All of the MR imaging of the brain were performed at zzso Hospital from January 2001 to December zzso 

Secondary generalized zzso zzso seizure was the most common clinical presenting seizure zzso Extra zzso lobe zzso was the most common clinical zzso Of the zzso patients who underwent zzso before performing MR imaging, 17 had normal zzso From MR imaging, zzso lobe zzso was the main affected location and zzso zzso sclerosis zzso was the most common cause of the zzso in zzso For age group zzso young adult zzso years old) and adult zzso years old) age groups, zzso was the most common zzso of zzso with cortical zzso being the second most common cause for the first group and vascular disease for the latter zzso For the older age group zzso 64 years zzso vascular disease and idiopathic cause were equally common zzso zzso zzso findings, and clinical data were all zzso with statistical zzso 

zzso is the zzso zzso of choice for evaluation of the zzso zzso The result is zzso with the clinical and zzso zzso It can detect and zzso the structural zzso accurately and is useful in the treatment zzso
