zzso processing has been associated with the zzso attention, default mode, and zzso control zzso The zzso attention network is involved in zzso focused attention whereas the default mode network is involved in internally directed zzso The zzso control network has been proposed to mediate the transition between external and internal attention by zzso its activity to either the zzso attention network or the default mode network, depending on the zzso zzso zzso is hypothesized to zzso attention and has been linked to the integrity of these three zzso zzso We used PET with zzso to zzso zzso synthesis capacity in zzso and zzso to acquire zzso brain activity in cognitively healthy human zzso We found that in the resting state where internal zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso between the zzso control network and the default mode network while reducing the zzso between the zzso control network and the zzso attention zzso These results add a zzso perspective to the role of network interaction in modulating zzso
