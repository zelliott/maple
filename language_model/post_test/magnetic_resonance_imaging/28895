The goal of this study was to document the hazards associated with zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso zzso after tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare and potentially serious complication of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso may occur when zzso hypertension develops secondary to zzso zzso Previous research indicates that zzso of a single zzso zzso is well tolerated when the zzso zzso remains zzso 

The authors report the results in five of a total of 107 patients who underwent zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso of a zzso zzso these patients developed headache, visual zzso and florid zzso as a result of increased zzso pressure zzso In each patient, the zzso zzso on the treated side was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was confirmed on magnetic resonance zzso zzso Four patients required zzso or zzso zzso and one required medical treatment for increased zzso All five patients regained their baseline neurological function after zzso zzso used to avoid zzso during surgery are zzso 

First, the status of the zzso and zzso zzso should be documented using MR zzso before patients undergo zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso of a zzso or zzso zzso may not be tolerated even if the zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso may zzso Third, MR zzso is a reliable, zzso means of evaluating the zzso zzso Fourth, if the diagnosis is made shortly after zzso then direct zzso zzso with zzso may be a therapeutic zzso If the presentation is delayed, then zzso complications of zzso zzso can be avoided by administration of a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and possibly zzso shunt zzso
