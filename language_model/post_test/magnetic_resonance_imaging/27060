zzso zzso results from the negative balance between the oxygen demands of the tissue and the capacity of the zzso to deliver sufficient zzso The resulting oxygen deficit has important consequences with regard to the aggressiveness and zzso of tumors, as well as their resistance to therapy, zzso the imaging of zzso with vital repercussions in tumor prognosis and therapy zzso The molecular and cellular events underlying zzso are zzso mainly through zzso factor, a zzso factor with zzso effects over a variety of cellular zzso including zzso zzso invasion and zzso However, few zzso have been able to monitor zzso the oxygen tensions in zzso zzso and MRS are often used for this zzso Most zzso approaches are based on the effects of the local oxygen tension on: zzso the relaxation times of zzso or zzso zzso such as zzso or their zzso zzso zzso the zzso and magnetic zzso effects of zzso and zzso and zzso the effects of zzso oxygen on the relaxation times of tissue zzso zzso MRS approaches monitor tumor zzso through the selective zzso of reduced zzso derivatives in hypoxic zones, whereas electron spin resonance methods determine the oxygen level through its influence on the zzso of appropriate zzso zzso in zzso Finally, zzso zzso combines the sensitivity of zzso methodology with the resolution of zzso providing a window into the future use of zzso oxygen zzso
