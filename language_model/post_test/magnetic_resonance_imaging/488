zzso resonance imaging zzso is today the imaging zzso of choice to investigate the zzso zzso However, the acoustic noise during scanning is very loud, often exceeding 100 zzso 

To reduce the acoustic noise during zzso for zzso zzso If effective, this would create a safer environment and also result in fewer aborted examinations due to poor image quality from patient zzso 

A passive acoustic noise zzso the acoustic hood, was built out of zzso zzso Sound pressure zzso with and without the acoustic hood were performed using our clinical zzso scan zzso consisting of eight imaging zzso The acoustic hood is placed over the newborn inside the MR scanner tunnel during the examination to absorb acoustic zzso 

The acoustic noise level was substantially reduced using the acoustic zzso Peak sound pressure was reduced zzso zzso depending on the pulse zzso For the entire frequency zzso reduction were between zzso zzso again varying with the pulse zzso 

zzso noise can be reduced further than before by using the zzso acoustic hood in addition to other noise zzso We recommend the use of three passive hearing protections during zzso zzso zzso dental zzso zzso zzso ear zzso and zzso the acoustic zzso
