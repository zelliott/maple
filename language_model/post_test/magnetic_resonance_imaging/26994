Although patients with zzso zzso usually have underlying zzso tears, we noted that this association was less common with anterior lateral zzso We wished to determine whether the frequency of a zzso tear underlying a zzso zzso varied with zzso zzso 

We reviewed a database of zzso knee MR examinations and identified zzso patients with an MR diagnosis of 138 zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 78 zzso We reviewed their medical records and MR studies to determine the location of the zzso and presence of an underlying zzso tear as determined by zzso or zzso 

There were 50 lateral and 88 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tears were found underlying a zzso in zzso of zzso patients and zzso of patients who had only MR examinations without a location difference in tears zzso zzso zzso zzso tears were found on zzso or zzso in all 28 patients with a lateral zzso zzso the body or zzso horn of the lateral zzso whereas a tear was found on zzso or zzso in only 14 zzso of 22 patients with zzso adjacent to or extending to the lateral zzso anterior horn zzso zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso extended zzso either into the root or into zzso zzso but the type of extension did not correlate with the presence of an underlying zzso zzso 

In contrast to zzso zzso zzso or zzso at other locations adjacent to the lateral zzso zzso located lateral zzso zzso are less likely to have underlying zzso zzso
