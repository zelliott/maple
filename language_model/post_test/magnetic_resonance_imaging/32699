The pulse wave zzso zzso of zzso blood flow is considered a surrogate for zzso zzso A new method using zzso zzso is presented zzso the spatial and zzso profiles of zzso zzso along the descending zzso can be zzso zzso young healthy volunteers (the zzso group), six older healthy volunteers (the OH group), and six patients with coronary artery disease (the zzso zzso were zzso zzso covering the whole descending zzso was acquired, with zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso From the corrected zzso flow zzso profiles, zzso was determined from the slope of an zzso line between the zzso and early zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso elastic zzso zzso was derived from the ratio of the zzso pulse pressure to the strain of the zzso zzso The zzso increased from zzso to OH to zzso zzso zzso 94, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 218 zzso zzso P zzso zzso between zzso and zzso P zzso zzso between OH and zzso There was a high correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that age and zzso were independent risk factors for an increase in the zzso Compared to existing methods, our method requires fewer assumptions and provides a more intuitive and objective way to estimate the zzso
