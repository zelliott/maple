We have developed a new operational method for zzso functional neurosurgery using zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso shows us the individual variations of zzso zzso The tentative target points were determined using the zzso zzso assisted software system which revised the distortion of zzso zzso zzso the accuracy and safety of the zzso recording were zzso This, in turn, increased the accuracy of zzso zzso while producing encouraging operational zzso The effectiveness of zzso zzso for Parkinson's disease was confirmed by these excellent operative zzso The symptoms improved and the dosage of medications, including zzso zzso Furthermore, our results indicate that the distributing area of deep sensory zzso in the zzso extended more zzso and upward than previously zzso zzso the functional and anatomical similarity between the human and monkey zzso was zzso In this report, based on the above data, we reevaluated the neural mechanism of zzso and the role of zzso functional neurosurgery for Parkinson's zzso
