zzso between recurrence and radiation necrosis in patients with zzso is zzso as the two entities have completely different management and zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the zzso of zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the detection of zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso proven zzso with a clinical suspicion of recurrence were evaluated using zzso zzso zzso and zzso A combination of clinical zzso repeat imaging and/or biopsy (when zzso was taken as a gold zzso 

On the basis of the gold standard, 56 patients were positive and 29 were negative for zzso zzso The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, whereas those of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso On zzso analysis zzso zzso had similar sensitivities with a much higher specificity than zzso across all zzso Thirty patients had zzso zzso with zzso zzso being correct in 23 of zzso 

zzso zzso seems to be a highly sensitive and specific imaging zzso for the detection of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso
