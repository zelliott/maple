Small studies suggest that zzso zzso interrupted by brief repetitive cycles of zzso may protect the zzso in the clinical zzso 

To test the hypothesis that zzso limits zzso size in relation to the area at risk in patients with ST zzso zzso zzso zzso 

76 patients zzso zzso eligible for primary zzso coronary intervention due to zzso were zzso to standard zzso coronary intervention zzso zzso zzso or zzso consisting of four cycles of 60 s zzso and 60 s of zzso before permanent zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The area at risk was determined from zzso zzso contracting zzso zzso size was zzso from delayed enhancement zzso on days zzso zzso size, expressed in relation to the area at risk, did not differ between the control group zzso 30, zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso group zzso 23, zzso The slope of the zzso lines relating zzso size to the area at risk differed between the two zzso zzso size was significantly zzso zzso zzso reduced by zzso in patients with large areas at zzso The area under the curve and peak zzso T release and zzso during zzso did not differ between patients in the control and zzso zzso 

This zzso zzso trial suggests that zzso does not reduce zzso size in patients with zzso in the overall study zzso The data indicate that zzso may be of value in patients with large areas at zzso Clinical trial registration information zzso Clinical Trial Registration zzso zzso zzso zzso
