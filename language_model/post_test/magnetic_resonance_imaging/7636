It remains uncertain if the zzso primary zzso zzso zzso contributes to motor recovery after zzso Here we investigated zzso changes in the zzso functional connectivity zzso of the zzso and their association with motor zzso Thirteen patients who had experienced zzso stroke underwent a series of zzso zzso and clinical assessments over a period of 1 year at 5 time points, zzso within the first week, at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after stroke zzso Thirteen zzso and zzso healthy subjects were recruited as zzso The zzso was defined as a region centered at the zzso that had greatest zzso during hand motion zzso The dynamic changes in the zzso of the zzso within the whole brain were evaluated and correlated with the zzso Index zzso zzso Compared with healthy controls, the zzso of the zzso with the bilateral zzso were initially zzso then gradually increased, and finally restored to the normal level 1 year zzso Moreover, the dynamic change in the zzso zzso between the bilateral zzso in these patients was positively correlated with the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso of the zzso was not correlated with the zzso zzso This study shows dynamic changes in the zzso of the zzso after stroke and suggests that the increased zzso zzso between the bilateral zzso may facilitate motor recovery in stroke zzso However, zzso of our findings is limited by the small sample size of our study and needs to be zzso
