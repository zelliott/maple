The aim of this study is to investigate whether virtual MR zzso could be used to zzso the internal architecture of the zzso compartment of the wrist joint in comparison to surgical zzso 

zzso zzso contrast material was injected into the zzso compartment prior to MR examination in all zzso A zzso zzso three-dimensional fast zzso zzso echo sequence was acquired in addition to our standard MR imaging protocol in each zzso zzso data sets were then transferred to an independent zzso and were zzso using zzso software to generate surface rendered virtual MR zzso zzso 

zzso patients referred for chronic zzso wrist pain were evaluated with conventional MR zzso zzso 

zzso MR zzso images demonstrating the triangular zzso complex zzso in an zzso perspective were achieved in 12 out of 19 zzso Our preliminary investigation suggests that although it has several limitations, virtual MR zzso shows promise in visualizing the zzso from an zzso zzso
