zzso how the brain processes stimuli in a rich natural environment is a fundamental goal of zzso Here, we showed a feature film to 10 healthy volunteers during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso brain zzso We then zzso auditory and visual features of the motion picture to inform analysis of the zzso zzso The zzso were fitted to both zzso data and brain network time courses extracted by independent component analysis zzso zzso zzso correlated with two independent components zzso disclosing two functional networks, one responding to variety of auditory stimulation and another responding zzso to speech but parts of the network also responding to zzso zzso Visual feature zzso correlated with four zzso zzso visual areas according to their sensitivity to different visual stimulus zzso In comparison, a separate zzso general linear model based analysis disclosed brain areas zzso responding to sound energy, speech, music, visual contrast edges, body motion and hand motion which largely overlapped the results revealed by zzso zzso between the results of zzso and zzso analyses demonstrate that thorough analysis of zzso time courses is important for understanding the activity of specific zzso of the functional networks, while zzso is a valuable tool for revealing novel information about functional connectivity which need not be explained by the zzso zzso Our results encourage the use of zzso stimuli and tasks in cognitive zzso to study how the brain processes stimuli in rich natural zzso
