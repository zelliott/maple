Institutional review board approval was zzso zzso patients (30 female, 13 zzso mean age, 42 zzso with zzso underwent MR imaging with a zzso MR zzso between November 2005 and June zzso zzso were classified into clinical zzso according to recently published consensus zzso Images were evaluated for zzso changes and signal abnormalities of subcutaneous fat zzso muscle zzso intramuscular zzso joint and/or zzso sheath zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso suspicious features of musculoskeletal zzso as zzso or zzso pain, joint zzso zzso and increased warmth of the zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso involvement was detected with MR imaging in 32 zzso of 43 zzso It was detected with MR imaging in 26 zzso of 27 patients in whom it was clinically suspected and in six zzso of 16 patients in whom it was not clinically zzso We found zzso zzso zzso zzso of 43 zzso increased zzso enhancement zzso zzso of 43 zzso zzso zzso (17 zzso of 43 zzso zzso zzso zzso of 43 zzso zzso enhancement zzso zzso of 43 zzso zzso (six zzso of 43 zzso zzso (three zzso of 43 zzso bone zzso involvement zzso zzso of 43 zzso and subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso of 43 zzso The highest prevalence of musculoskeletal involvement was seen in patients with zzso zzso
