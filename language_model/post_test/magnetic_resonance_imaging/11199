In zzso applications where short acquisition time is necessary, the increase of acquisition speed is often at the expense of image resolution and zzso In such cases, the newly developed parallel acquisition techniques could provide images without mentioned limitations and in reasonably shortened measurement zzso A newly designed zzso head zzso array zzso zzso allowing for parallel acquisition of independently reconstructed images zzso zzso has been tested for its zzso in zzso Image zzso was tested in standard phantom and healthy zzso zzso signal changes were studied in a group of six volunteers using finger tapping zzso Phantom studies revealed an important drop of signal even after the use of a zzso filter in the center of the image and an important increase of artifact power with reduction of measurement time strongly depending on the combination of acceleration zzso The additional application of a parallel acquisition technique such as zzso decreases measurement time in the range of about zzso but further reduction is often possible only at the expense of zzso This technique performs best in conditions in which imaging speed is important, such as zzso zzso but time resolution still does not allow the acquisition of zzso separating the zzso and zzso zzso zzso larger areas of zzso zzso were found using the zzso zzso compared to the standard head zzso Being an zzso surface zzso zzso peripheral cortical structures profit from high zzso as high-resolution imaging of small cortical zzso and functional zzso of cortical areas zzso by zzso zzso In zzso contrast imaging, zzso artifacts are reduced, but only if an appropriate combination of acceleration parameters is zzso
