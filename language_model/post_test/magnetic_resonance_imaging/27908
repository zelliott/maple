Based upon previous observations of zzso zzso diffusion waves within highly scattering zzso this paper explores the zzso phenomena of such waves of approximately zzso wavelength with zzso phase zzso zzso zzso source zzso consist of laser zzso sources modulated at 180 degrees out of phase with respect to the other zzso The zzso waves originating from the zzso sources zzso in the zzso an zzso zzso and a sharp phase zzso These may be observed in a highly scattering zzso medium simulating the breast or brain zzso zzso 3-5 zzso from the zzso laser zzso In the plane containing the zzso there is a high sensitivity for a small volume of a hidden zzso zzso zzso deep within a highly scattering zzso 20 zzso in a volume of 70 zzso can be zzso zzso zzso consisting of four or more elements in two zzso planes give sensitivity on both axes similar to the one-dimensional zzso zzso show that in the presence of a zzso object, the zzso zzso and the interference plane becomes a curved surface which is deflected toward the zzso The degree of zzso is related to the volume and the zzso characteristics of the zzso and provides detection of the zzso and thereby may provide zzso information for the detection of small tumors within the human breast, or stroke volumes, zzso and tumors in the human zzso
