A report in the zzso literature states that MR imaging for internal zzso of the knee has a lower accuracy in adolescents than in adults and may even provide zzso information that alters clinical zzso This assertion has not been specifically addressed in the zzso zzso The purpose of our study was to determine the accuracy of MR imaging in adolescents with regard to injury of the cruciate ligaments and zzso 

A database search of our institution's records from January 1998 to July 2000 yielded zzso MR examinations of the knee, all of which had been performed with a standard knee protocol on a zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso 156 included patients younger than 18 zzso zzso of these patients underwent surgery, and the orthopedic zzso operative reports were used as the gold standard with which the MR imaging results were zzso Thirty-four boys and 25 girls who ranged in age from 11 to 17 years zzso age, 15 zzso were zzso The clinical notes for the remaining 97 patients were evaluated for information about management and clinical zzso 

The sensitivity and specificity values for MR imaging of the zzso and cruciate ligaments in adolescents were as zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso lateral zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso anterior cruciate zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso and zzso cruciate zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that MR imaging of the knee in adolescents is sensitive, specific, and zzso
