Analysis of form and function relationships with zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso of magnetic resonance zzso and two forms of zzso computerized zzso were contrasted in 31 patients with zzso zzso zzso on the zzso prior to zzso 

zzso abnormalities ranged from none to zzso zzso Resolution zzso zzso produced abnormal results in 10 cases and zzso zzso zzso in 15 zzso Overall, field defects and qualitative stages of deformation and dislocation of the zzso were well zzso Among quantitative zzso the best correlations were obtained by a measure of the zzso position of the zzso 

On average, an zzso of the zzso by 6 zzso will be associated with abnormal visual fields in 50% of the zzso An additional zzso of 5 zzso will raise the zzso of field defects to zzso
