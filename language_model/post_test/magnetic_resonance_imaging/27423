The zzso irreversible zzso zzso is a novel potential zzso zzso for zzso zzso The aim of this study was the first evaluation of zzso effects on the zzso zzso system using intravenous zzso zzso and urinary zzso in addition to zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Eight zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso including the zzso or zzso were performed in three male zzso zzso zzso zzso and urinary zzso zzso were performed within the first 28 days after zzso 

zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated a localized necrosis 7 days and a localized zzso of the zzso zzso with complete destruction 28 days after zzso The zzso system was preserved and showed zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed an zzso normal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso A new urinary zzso phenomenon featured a temporary zzso by individual zzso of detached transitional zzso cells within the first 3 days after zzso 

This first zzso zzso and zzso evaluation after zzso kidney zzso shows zzso zzso destruction while protecting the involved zzso system with zzso zzso zzso zzso could be used as a targeted zzso method of centrally located zzso zzso
