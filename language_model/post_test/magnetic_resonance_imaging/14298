The potential of dynamic zzso zzso acid zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for the examination of zzso zzso was analyzed in 27 subjects (five healthy subjects, seven patients with zzso zzso zzso six patients with acute zzso and nine patients with chronic zzso with use of a zzso zzso zzso findings were compared with quantitative analysis of zzso changes in signal zzso Dynamic zzso images of the normal kidney demonstrated four zzso of zzso cortical enhancement phase, early zzso phase, zzso phase, and zzso zzso The pattern of enhancement in zzso zzso zzso was similar to that in normal zzso In acutely zzso zzso cortical enhancement was similar to that in normal zzso zzso zzso but zzso enhancement was higher than normal, resulting in diminished zzso zzso The early zzso phase was prolonged (until zzso minutes after zzso with delayed appearance of the zzso and zzso zzso In chronically zzso zzso the increase in cortical intensity was less than that in normal zzso zzso zzso The early zzso phase was zzso and the zzso phase was diminished or zzso
