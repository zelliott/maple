To investigate the value of conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and diffusion weighed imaging zzso in the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso and acute zzso zzso in zzso 

The zzso findings along with zzso characteristics in 15 zzso with zzso involving zzso zzso and in 18 zzso with acute zzso zzso between November 2006 and June 2008 were zzso zzso 

On zzso only 5 patients presented zzso in the zzso zzso in the zzso group, but 16 in the acute zzso zzso group zzso Nine patients in the zzso group showed zzso in the zzso but the zzso in the zzso was not found in the acute zzso zzso zzso The frequency of zzso in the zzso in the acute zzso zzso group zzso was significantly higher than that in the zzso group zzso zzso Eight patients in the zzso group showed abnormal signals in the other regions on zzso but only two patients in the acute zzso zzso group zzso On zzso 7 out of 11 patients with zzso presented zzso in the zzso zzso while all 10 patients of the acute zzso zzso group presented normal in the zzso zzso 

Conventional zzso along with zzso is useful in zzso zzso from acute zzso zzso in zzso
