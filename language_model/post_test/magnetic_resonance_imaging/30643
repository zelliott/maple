To analyze zzso and zzso translation patterns in healthy and zzso knees in different knee zzso angles under muscle zzso 

The zzso and zzso healthy knees of 10 patients were examined with an open zzso system at 30 degrees and 90 degrees of knee zzso under zzso contraction of the zzso or zzso muscle zzso zzso between the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso were analyzed by three-dimensional image zzso 

zzso translation of the zzso and zzso relative to the zzso occurred during knee zzso zzso zzso in all zzso In zzso knees, zzso translation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly larger than in healthy knee zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the translation pattern of the zzso was similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Under zzso contraction of the zzso zzso to the zzso muscle group), an increased zzso position of the zzso and zzso was observed at 30 degrees knee zzso but not at 90 zzso This applied to zzso and healthy zzso 

This study shows a significant increase of translation of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso knees, whereas zzso translation remains almost zzso This difference in translation patterns indicates that the zzso horn of the zzso zzso might encounter zzso potentially explaining the high rate of secondary zzso zzso tears in patients with zzso
