The ability to biopsy indeterminate pulmonary zzso in children has evolved with advances in minimal access zzso Recent advances in zzso zzso including zzso dye injection or wire zzso have expanded the types of zzso that are accessible via minimal access zzso We present a case of a 13-year-old boy who underwent zzso zzso using both zzso blue dye and zzso zzso and a subsequent zzso pulmonary wedge zzso under the same zzso The combined use of both dye and zzso zzso provides the advantage of superior zzso zzso of the zzso and the ability to use zzso to confirm the presence of the zzso in the surgical zzso We recommend this technique for the biopsy of indeterminate pulmonary zzso that would not otherwise be accessible via a minimally invasive zzso
