Restoration of anterior zzso stability while avoiding knee extension deficit are a common goal of anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso However, achieving this goal can be zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso differences in anterior zzso neutral position and zzso are correlated with knee extension deficit in subjects 2 years after zzso zzso 

In the reconstructed and zzso knees of 29 subjects with zzso zzso anterior zzso neutral position was measured with zzso and three-dimensional modeling zzso terminal knee extension at heel strike of walking and during a seated knee extension were measured via gait zzso and anterior zzso was measured using the zzso 

zzso that approached normal anterior stability and anterior zzso position had increased extension deficit relative to the zzso zzso On average the reconstructed knee had significantly less zzso extension during active extension and during heel strike of walking zzso with increased anterior neutral zzso position zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between zzso difference in anterior neutral zzso position with both measures of knee extension zzso zzso zzso active knee extension, zzso zzso 

The results indicate a relationship between the loss of active knee extension and a change in anterior neutral zzso position following zzso zzso zzso zzso Given the increasing evidence of a link between altered zzso and premature zzso these findings provide important information to improve our understanding of in zzso knee function after zzso zzso
