zzso connectivity network zzso technique provides a feasible way for evaluating cognitive zzso in zzso This zzso study aims to zzso assess the zzso of zzso affected by generalized zzso discharge zzso during absence seizure zzso Twelve zzso sessions with zzso and individually paired zzso sessions were acquired from 16 patients with zzso Ten zzso corresponding to seizure zzso and cognitive processes were extracted using independent component zzso zzso and zzso connectivity zzso of the zzso were observed through comparisons between zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlation analysis between zzso and the zzso time courses addressed the immediate effects of zzso on zzso during zzso zzso increase of zzso connectivity was found only in the thalamus, and extensive decreases were found in the zzso corresponding to zzso cognitive processes including the zzso network, zzso attention network, central executive network and zzso zzso The perceptive networks and motor network were less affected by zzso zzso correlation analysis further demonstrated different responses of the zzso to zzso In addition to zzso functional zzso in the zzso and functional suspension in the zzso network, this study revealed extensive inhibitions in the other zzso corresponding to zzso cognitive zzso and spared perceptive and motor processes in zzso zzso elevated synchronization of brain network activity and zzso affected the zzso
