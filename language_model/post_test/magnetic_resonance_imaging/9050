The diagnostic principle of stress zzso and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease is based on the zzso of zzso wall motion zzso From a zzso point of view, stress zzso is the easiest test given that it can be performed at zzso Both stress zzso and stress zzso also permit direct zzso of zzso zzso at rest and during pharmacological stress (typically zzso using contrast administration zzso for stress zzso zzso for stress zzso These novel methods for the zzso of zzso zzso seem to provide information similar to that obtained using zzso zzso imaging but these techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso are not broadly established in daily practice zzso Similar to other zzso tests stress zzso and stress zzso have the highest diagnostic yield in patients with intermediate probability of significant coronary artery zzso
