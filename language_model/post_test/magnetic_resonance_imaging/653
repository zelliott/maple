To assess the zzso enlargement of zzso zzso and zzso large and small airway disease using zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso and lung function tests zzso 

Seven patients were examined after single lung transplantation zzso and 1 before double zzso for various forms of zzso Five patients after double zzso served as zzso Patients were assessed by zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso lung density zzso zzso index zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Good correlations were found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gas volume zzso zzso zzso forced zzso volume in 1 second zzso zzso zzso and forced zzso flows zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso only provided moderate correlations with zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso 

In this initial study, zzso yield good correlations with zzso and agrees better than zzso with the functional characterization of zzso regarding zzso large and small airway disease as provided by zzso
