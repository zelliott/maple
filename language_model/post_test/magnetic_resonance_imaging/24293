zzso target zzso has significant impact on brain zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment success, and potential complications of zzso zzso 

We compare the zzso zzso of zzso using fused images of contrasted zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso with matched images of zzso zzso cerebral zzso for zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso 

Between May 2009 and April 2012, 3-D cerebral zzso was integrated into zzso target planning for 30 consecutive zzso The zzso zzso target volumes were delineated using fused CT and zzso scans vs fused CT, zzso and 3-D cerebral zzso for each zzso 

The mean volume of the zzso zzso contoured with the addition of 3-D cerebral zzso to the zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso was statistically smaller than the mean volume contoured with zzso fused scans alone zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso with a mean volume difference of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with larger mean volume differences compared with a compact zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso The mean volume difference was not statistically associated with the patient's sex zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso previous zzso status zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or previous zzso status zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

For brain zzso treated with zzso the addition of 3-D cerebral zzso to zzso zzso for diagnostic accuracy results in a statistically significant reduction in contoured zzso volume compared with standard zzso zzso zzso
