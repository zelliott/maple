The latest advances in cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso have established this technique as the gold standard imaging zzso for many cardiac zzso However, zzso seem to be reluctant to use zzso in their everyday clinical zzso 

In an attempt to identify some of the reasons for this zzso we conducted a survey employing a written questionnaire completed by 60 trained zzso in the third most populated region of zzso 

zzso would refer patients for zzso rarely zzso or never zzso The most frequent indications for zzso were zzso heart disease zzso and zzso zzso Only zzso were familiar with cardiac zzso zzso and zzso with zzso Participants would like zzso to be able to clarify coronary artery anatomy zzso Only zzso answered correctly all the questions regarding zzso of zzso The main reasons for not referring a patient for zzso were zzso zzso lack of familiarity zzso and high cost zzso The most appropriate physician for zzso a zzso examination is a zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso or not important zzso The method is going to expand a lot zzso moderately zzso or not at all zzso in the zzso 

A complex interplay between the lack of trained physicians and zzso zzso of scanners for zzso high costs, and lack of adequate education of zzso leads to a vicious circle with the final odds against zzso zzso to bypass these issues are required on behalf of all scientists involved in zzso zzso Training of more physicians and zzso establishment of dedicated zzso programs, and in-depth education of zzso regarding the indications and advantages of zzso over other imaging zzso will be required if zzso is to become established in everyday clinical zzso
