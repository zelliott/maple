zzso has been implicated in the development of brain zzso However, support for this association comes from zzso zzso 

Within the Second zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso study, a prospective cohort study among patients with symptomatic zzso disease zzso age zzso standard zzso 58 zzso 10 years; zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed in zzso patients at baseline zzso and in zzso patients at follow-up zzso Brain zzso was used to zzso total brain volume, cortical gray matter volume, and zzso volume as indicators of zzso zzso and zzso zzso At zzso zzso of carotid zzso thickness zzso and carotid zzso were zzso zzso zzso was classified into groups 0 of zzso 50 of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and into unilateral or bilateral zzso 

zzso zzso analyses showed that both increased zzso and carotid zzso were associated with decreased relative total brain and cortical gray matter zzso Our prospective findings showed that after a mean follow-up of zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso and moderate zzso were not related to progression of brain zzso Only severe or bilateral carotid zzso was related to progression of global zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

In a study of patients with zzso disease with 4 years of zzso only severe or bilateral carotid zzso and not moderate carotid zzso and increased zzso were associated with progression of brain zzso
