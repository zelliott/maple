We present a rare case of a jugular zzso zzso in a 48-year-old female, with zzso type 1, presenting with zzso zzso We also zzso possible underlying zzso zzso 

We describe the imaging findings of this rare entity and review the literature on skull base zzso particularly in the context of zzso type zzso 

A zzso zzso scan revealed smooth expansion of the jugular zzso zzso resonance imaging showed a fluid filled zzso expanding the jugular zzso and zzso with zzso fluid of the zzso zzso zzso 

Skull base zzso are a rare entity and we believe that this is the first reported case of a zzso causing enlargement of the jugular zzso in a patient with zzso type zzso The zzso may have resulted from a severe form of zzso zzso or from zzso weakened bone at the skull zzso
