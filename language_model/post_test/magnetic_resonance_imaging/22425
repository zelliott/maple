To study the frequency of zzso abnormalities on brain imaging in children with headache, compare it with the frequency of imaging findings that dictate a change in patient management, and determine the association of benign findings with zzso 

A database of zzso headache patients from the pediatric zzso neurology department over 2 years was zzso Patients with benign imaging abnormalities were compared to those with zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were defined as those that did not result in a change in patient zzso Using literature review, we discuss the benign findings and their possible association with zzso 

zzso and zzso patients zzso had imaging at our zzso zzso and zzso had brain magnetic resonance imaging and 23 had brain zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty-two patients had CT of the zzso in addition to brain zzso zzso zzso were found to have 50 benign abnormalities including 13 zzso disease, 11 zzso I zzso 7 zzso white matter zzso 5 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso 4 enlarged zzso spaces, 2 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso of the zzso zzso artery, and 1 zzso zzso zzso patients zzso had findings requiring a change in zzso These included 5 zzso disease, 4 tumors, 4 old zzso 3 zzso I, 2 zzso 1 zzso vascular zzso 1 internal jugular vein zzso 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso disease, and 1 zzso zzso When excluding zzso which was evident clinically prior to imaging, 3 patients had absence of abnormal zzso symptoms and signs and imaging findings that resulted in a change in zzso 

zzso zzso of pediatric headache patients with brain imaging have benign abnormalities that do not result in a change in headache zzso Imaging findings that require a change in management are rare in patients with an absence of abnormal zzso symptoms and signs, occurring in zzso of patients zzso in this zzso
