A recent zzso study has shown a zzso relationship between zzso zzso volume zzso and disability in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso In this analysis, which also included zzso zzso we investigated whether such a relationship is a consequence of the decreased frequency of zzso events occurring in more disabled patients, rather than reflecting their disability zzso 

The zzso arms of 2 clinical trials were zzso One cohort consisted of zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso enrolled in a zzso randomized, zzso zzso trial of oral zzso zzso The second cohort consisted of zzso patients with secondary progressive zzso zzso still experiencing relapses enrolled in a zzso randomized, zzso zzso trial of zzso zzso 

At zzso zzso was associated with disease duration zzso zzso zzso age at zzso onset zzso zzso zzso and disability zzso zzso zzso The relationship between baseline zzso and Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different between patients with zzso and zzso At a zzso analysis, zzso change was associated with the number of zzso relapses zzso zzso zzso and age at zzso onset zzso zzso zzso The correlations of zzso change with baseline zzso and zzso changes were not zzso 

We showed that the zzso relationship between zzso zzso volume and disability in multiple sclerosis is not always present and is likely due to the reduced frequency of zzso events in the most common form of secondary progressive multiple zzso
