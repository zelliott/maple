Area at risk, zzso area, the size of zzso phenomenon and finally left zzso function determine immediate and long-term outcome in patients with acute zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging is a gold standard technique for evaluation of left zzso volumes and function and therefore has evolved into an important diagnostic tool in the assessment of patients with zzso Increased free water content in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso time are clinically useful for detection of area of risk whereas zzso technique is useful for the assessment of areas with zzso deficit at zzso zzso necrosis appears zzso in comparison to the normal zzso after contrast injection with delayed enhancement zzso zzso Experimental and clinical studies indicate that extent of DE closely zzso with zzso size and predicts functional recovery of zzso zzso The zzso zone usually located in the core of zzso region indicates zzso obstruction zzso and zzso with the area of zzso as defined by zzso The presence of zzso is associated with impaired functional recovery after zzso
