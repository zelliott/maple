The zzso zzso significant volume loss and zzso change with increasing zzso zzso in zzso connectivity may contribute to the decline in cognitive ability associated with zzso The aim of this study was to assess changes in zzso shape and in the volume and zzso of zzso regions zzso by their connectivity to specific cortical regions in order to test the hypothesis age related zzso change primarily affects zzso zzso connecting to the frontal zzso Using structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso we assessed zzso volume and zzso in 86 healthy volunteers, median zzso age 44 zzso zzso Regional zzso zzso and zzso structural changes were assessed by zzso the zzso based on connectivity to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and determining the volumes and mean zzso of the zzso zzso Linear zzso analysis was performed to test the relationship between increasing age and zzso zzso zzso volume, zzso whole zzso diffusion measures, zzso mean zzso zzso of the zzso projections, and zzso volumes of the zzso zzso We also assessed zzso shape change using zzso zzso We observed a significant reduction in the volume and a significant increase in MD of the whole zzso with increasing zzso The volume of the zzso projections decreased significantly with increasing age, however there was no significant relationship between the volumes of the zzso projections to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso shape analysis showed that the greatest shape change was in the anterior thalamus, incorporating regions containing the anterior nucleus, the zzso nucleus and the zzso zzso To explore these results further we studied two additional groups of subjects (a younger and an older aged group, zzso which showed that the volume of the zzso projections was correlated to executive functions scores, as assessed by the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso of the frontal zzso unit may explain, at least in part, disorders of attention, working memory and executive function associated with increasing zzso
