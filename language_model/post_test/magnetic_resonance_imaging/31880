The dynamics of the neural network that zzso learning zzso structures of an ordered sequence remains poorly zzso To address this, in the present study we used zzso to track the time course of zzso zzso zzso The zzso and the angular zzso were each shown to be closely related to the learning zzso but zzso zzso zzso activity was shown to consistently increase with learning but no correlation was found between performance and zzso zzso suggesting a general role for the zzso Left angular zzso activity was also found to consistently increase with training, but, in addition, correlated significantly with behavioral zzso This suggests an involvement of the angular zzso in learning the zzso associations between the zzso
