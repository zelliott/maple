zzso produce less muscle force zzso as they zzso However, the relationship between decreased force and muscle zzso area zzso in older humans is not well zzso We examined changes in F and zzso to determine the relative contributions of muscle zzso and specific force zzso to declining force production in aging zzso The proportions of zzso heavy chain zzso zzso were characterized to assess whether this was related to changes in specific force with zzso We measured the peak force of zzso knee extension in 57 males and females aged zzso years, and used magnetic resonance imaging to determine the zzso area of the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso taken from zzso of the zzso zzso muscle showed no relation to specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased with zzso Smaller zzso accounted for only about half of the zzso drop in force that occurred between ages zzso zzso zzso force dropped about zzso per year in this age range, for a total decrease of zzso Thus, quantitative changes in muscle zzso are not sufficient to explain the strength loss associated with zzso
