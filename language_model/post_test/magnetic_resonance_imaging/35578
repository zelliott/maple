In this zzso study, we explore the connectivity among brain regions in a zzso task using the zzso mapping analysis of structural equation modeling zzso An important distinction of our approach is that we have adapted zzso from its traditional role in zzso analysis to provide utility as an exploratory mapping zzso Our current approaches include zzso detecting brain regions that fit well in a hypothesized neural network model, and zzso identifying the best connectivity model at each brain zzso We demonstrate that zzso effectively detects the zzso and zzso visual pathways from the zzso structure in zzso data, confirming previous zzso zzso Further, our zzso mapping methodology found that the two pathways interact through specific cortical areas such as the superior lateral zzso zzso in the perception of shape from zzso
