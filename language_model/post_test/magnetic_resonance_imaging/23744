The aim of the study was to use magnetic resonance zzso imaging to determine the cause of zzso nerve zzso and the sites of injury in patients with zzso zzso before radiation therapy and during zzso therapy zzso 

The clinical records and MR studies of 21 patients with zzso nerve zzso were zzso zzso These 21 patients belonged to a cohort of zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso with newly diagnosed disease and 234 on zzso zzso who underwent MR imaging in a zzso zzso 

Four patients had zzso nerve zzso at initial diagnosis and all of them had extensive skull base invasion from tumor extending zzso to the level of the zzso zzso The nerve was invaded in the carotid sheath zzso zzso nerve canal zzso and zzso zzso zzso In 17 patients developing zzso nerve zzso after zzso only two zzso had evidence of tumor zzso zzso zzso was the probable cause in 14 patients and 1 case was judged zzso MR evidence of zzso was zzso along the course the nerve in four patients zzso involving the carotid sheath zzso zzso nerve canal zzso and zzso zzso zzso No patient had MR evidence of radiation change in the brain zzso Seven patients had a history of a boost dose of radiation to the zzso region on one or both sides, and nerve zzso occurred on the zzso side in six of zzso 

zzso nerve zzso on presentation was caused by locally advanced zzso tumor whereas a zzso arising after radiation therapy was more frequently caused by zzso damage rather than zzso
