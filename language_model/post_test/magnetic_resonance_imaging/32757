zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare type of cerebrovascular disease with various zzso previously reported in small case zzso In this study, we propose to analyze clinical presentations, imaging patterns and zzso in a large case series of such patients in order to propose a diagnostic zzso 

We zzso analyzed clinical and zzso data of consecutive patients with a diagnosis of zzso and zzso zzso admitted to our institution between 2008 and zzso All patients had both zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a part of their initial zzso 

30 patients (18 women and 12 men, mean age: 60 zzso were zzso The main clinical symptoms at presentation were focal and transient neurological deficit zzso zzso zzso and zzso headache zzso zzso zzso Four patients had progressive headache and 4 other had partial or generalized zzso zzso zzso abnormalities associated with zzso were prior zzso zzso severe zzso and zzso suggesting cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso areas compatible with a zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) and zzso acute cortical stroke zzso zzso zzso Other underlying causes of zzso not diagnosed on zzso were zzso cerebral zzso syndrome zzso based on clinical criteria and conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnosed by skin biopsy zzso zzso 1), vascular zzso diagnosed on CT and digital zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Four cases remained zzso 

This study confirmed that zzso is a rare condition related to a wide spectrum of zzso Combination of brain zzso and magnetic resonance zzso and eventually digital zzso zzso allowed the identification of an underlying zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso represented more than 50% of the zzso zzso Among older patients, zzso was mainly related to zzso while in younger patients, zzso represented the most frequent zzso
