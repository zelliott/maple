We observed bone zzso signal changes zzso in patients with zzso zzso after treatment with zzso zzso zzso 

To evaluate the pattern and natural history of zzso 

The data were obtained from a pilot study of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso All patients underwent baseline and sequential zzso STIR zzso zzso after zzso The bone zzso signal on zzso was evaluated for zzso location and pattern, and any change on follow-up zzso 

The study group included 16 patients (8 zzso with a median age of 14 years zzso 4 to 25 zzso The mean zzso zzso follow-up duration was zzso zzso Of the 16 patients, 14 zzso developed zzso The signal change was zzso in 9 of the 14 patients zzso The zzso skeleton was involved in all 14 patients and the zzso skeleton in 3 patients zzso zzso was followed in 13 patients and decreased signal was seen in 9 patients zzso after a mean duration of zzso years of treatment zzso zzso to zzso zzso no complications were zzso 

zzso appeared in most patients with zzso type 1 following treatment with zzso zzso zzso was unusually zzso and involved the lower zzso On zzso zzso often showed a decrease without zzso
