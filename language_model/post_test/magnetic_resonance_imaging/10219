To zzso assess the zzso location, and possible zzso mechanisms of new zzso zzso fractures zzso in 66 symptomatic patients with zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso and to study the relation between new zzso and back pain zzso 

zzso patients with 102 painful symptomatic zzso were treated with zzso All patients had baseline total spinal magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months to locate new zzso Visual analog scales for pain and pain medication consumption were used to assess clinical zzso The following characteristics were compared in patients with new zzso after zzso versus patients without new zzso patient age, sex, presence of secondary zzso bone mineral density, number of zzso zzso shape and grade of zzso type of bone cement used for zzso volume of injected zzso and cement leakage in zzso disc zzso 

Sixteen of 66 patients had 26 new zzso during 1 year of follow-up after zzso Most new zzso occurred within 3 months of zzso half of new zzso appeared in levels adjacent to treated levels, and half of the new zzso were zzso The presence of more than two zzso zzso was the only independent risk factor for the development of a new zzso 

New zzso occurred after zzso in zzso of zzso Half of new zzso occurred in levels adjacent to treated levels and half were zzso The presence of more than two zzso zzso was the only independent risk factor for the development of a new zzso
