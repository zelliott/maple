Social cues have subtle effects on a person, often without them being zzso One explanation for this influence involves implicit zzso of trait zzso To study this effect, we activated implicit associations in participants of zzso zzso or zzso zzso that were task relevant, and studied its zzso impact on an independent cognitive task (the zzso zzso zzso a representation of zzso caused participants to slow their reaction times after errors on the working memory task, while the reverse pattern was seen for associations to zzso zzso these zzso effects were absent in control zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that the neural basis of this effect involves the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso where activity tracked the observed zzso pattern, increasing its activity during error monitoring in the zzso condition and decreasing in the zzso zzso The data provide a quantitative demonstration of how implicit cues, which specifically target a person's zzso influences the way we react to our own zzso and point to the anterior zzso zzso as a critical cortical locus for zzso these zzso related zzso zzso
