Recent zzso and zzso studies have led to competing hypotheses for potential roles of the left lateral zzso lobe in episodic memory zzso These hypotheses may be zzso by whether they imply a role in zzso or zzso zzso For example, one hypothesis is the left zzso zzso zzso in more zzso zzso forms part of an zzso zzso that supports the online representation of the retrieved target, a role that is, by definition, zzso An alternate view maintains zzso activity zzso in more zzso zzso contributes to zzso orientation of attention to retrieval search, a zzso zzso The present investigation seeks to reveal the earliest onset of lateral zzso activity in three zzso zzso of the left lateral zzso zzso to identify any zzso zzso zzso performed a zzso recall task while neural activity was recorded with zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso data were then mapped to each zzso cortical surface using dynamic statistical zzso mapping zzso Both zzso and zzso regions showed zzso zzso beginning within zzso zzso of the cue to retrieve and lasting up to 400 zzso We conclude that this early and transient pattern of activity in lateral zzso zzso is most consistent with a zzso role, possibly in directing attention to episodic memory zzso
