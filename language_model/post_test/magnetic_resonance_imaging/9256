During radiation delivery, target volumes change their position and shape due to zzso zzso The extent of these changes and the capability to correct for them will contribute to the benefit of an zzso in terms of zzso margin zzso zzso we investigated the primary zzso motion within a typical zzso delivery time for cervical cancer patients for various correction zzso no zzso rigid zzso anatomy zzso and rigid soft tissue zzso 

Twenty-two patients underwent 2-3 zzso zzso exams before and during their radiation zzso Each zzso exam included four zzso and four zzso zzso scans alternately within zzso We addressed the zzso motion by comparing subsequent zzso zzso zzso and investigated the correlation with zzso zzso zzso 

The maximum zzso motions within zzso for all points on the zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso exams without zzso with rigid zzso anatomy zzso and with rigid soft tissue registration were zzso zzso and zzso A significant but weak correlation was found between zzso zzso filling and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso motion is observed in cervical cancer zzso zzso zzso soft tissue registration using an zzso will correct for this zzso
