To evaluate the zzso canal using volume zzso zzso examination zzso sequencing in patients with zzso and tumors of the zzso 

Twenty-five patients with zzso zzso and tumors were recruited for a study in the zzso institution to compare the role of zzso row zzso zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso in jaw zzso Of these 25 patients, zzso was performed in 12 patients (age range, 16 to 52 zzso 11 male and 1 female zzso and formed the study zzso The status zzso and position of the inferior zzso canal zzso on panoramic reconstructed zzso zzso zzso images and curved zzso zzso zzso images reconstructed from zzso images were zzso The zzso normal zzso canal was used as the control in these zzso 

In all 12 patients, the inferior zzso canal on the normal side was zzso as a zzso structure in relation to the zzso bone on the curved zzso zzso zzso In 9 patients, the inferior zzso canal was equally well zzso on panoramic CT and curved zzso zzso zzso In 2 patients, the inferior zzso canal was better zzso on curved zzso zzso zzso in 1 patient, the course of the zzso canal was better seen on panoramic CT zzso 

MR reconstructions with zzso sequencing as source images provide images comparable to CT reconstructed images for evaluation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing can be added to the MR protocol to zzso the inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing increases the diagnostic capabilities of zzso when used to image zzso zzso and zzso
