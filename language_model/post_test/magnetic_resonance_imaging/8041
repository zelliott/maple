zzso muscle is the most abundant tissue in the body and serves various zzso functions including the generation of movement and zzso Whole body motor function requires adequate zzso zzso and distribution of zzso This raises the question: how do muscles scale with subject size in order to achieve similar function across zzso While much of the current knowledge of human muscle architecture is based on zzso zzso modern medical imaging avoids limitations of old age, poor health, and limited subject pool, allowing for muscle architecture data to be obtained in zzso from healthy subjects ranging in zzso The purpose of this study was to use novel zzso zzso to zzso volumes and lengths of 35 major lower limb muscles in 24 young, healthy subjects and to determine if muscle size zzso with bone geometry and subject parameters of mass and zzso It was found that total lower limb muscle volume scales with mass zzso and with the zzso product zzso Furthermore, individual muscle volumes scale with total muscle volume zzso zzso with the zzso product zzso zzso and with mass zzso zzso Muscle volume scales with bone volume zzso and muscle length relative to bone length is zzso zzso zzso of limb zzso These relationships allow for an arbitrary zzso individual muscle volumes to be estimated from mass or mass and height while muscle lengths may be estimated from limb zzso The zzso presented here can further be used as a zzso standard to compare populations with musculoskeletal zzso
