The mechanism zzso watershed zzso zzso develop remains controversial, although a zzso cause is usually zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the site of zzso zzso and the zzso status of the cerebral zzso 

From among 96 consecutive patients with zzso confirmed unilateral major cerebral artery obstruction zzso or zzso zzso zzso we investigated 29 patients with zzso zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso The regional cerebral blood flow and zzso reserve were zzso using the zzso zzso zzso method, coupled with intravenous injection of 1 g of zzso Seven patients had a cortical zzso zzso between the superficial branches of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries zzso or between the middle and zzso cerebral arteries zzso zzso and 22 had a deep zzso zzso between the superficial branches and deep penetrating arteries of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the patients in Group D were classified into two subgroups, zzso Type A zzso zzso zzso with zzso lying in the zzso zzso above the level of the lateral zzso and Type B zzso zzso 10), with zzso lying in the zzso zzso adjacent to the lateral zzso 

zzso of the Type of zzso zzso with the clinical course of onset showed that sudden onset was more frequent in Group C than in Group D zzso zzso zzso The zzso reserve in the affected zzso territory in Group D zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than that in Group C zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and that in 20 zzso (10 control subjects) without a major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Among the Group D patients, the patients with Type A zzso showed a significantly lower zzso reserve compared with those with Type B zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with deep zzso zzso especially Type A zzso showed severe zzso zzso whereas patients with cortical zzso zzso showed preserved zzso reserve which appeared to be secondary to the zzso The mechanism of development of zzso zzso is zzso and distinguishing among these zzso zzso and from other types of zzso is important, because different zzso mechanisms require different therapeutic zzso
