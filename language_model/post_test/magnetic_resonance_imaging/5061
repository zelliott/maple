Lack of zzso results in skeletal muscle zzso and zzso zzso in humans and animal zzso To achieve a basic understanding of the natural development of zzso in different zzso mouse models, left and right zzso heart function was assessed at different ages in three zzso mouse models zzso zzso model and zzso using magnetic resonance zzso Left zzso function was significantly zzso already at zzso in the most severely affected zzso zzso Furthermore, whereas heart function was stable in zzso mice over time, both zzso and zzso showed a clear decrease at zzso of age, most prominently in the right zzso Therefore magnetic resonance imaging is an adequate technique to determine heart function in zzso mouse models and can be used to assess the effect of potential zzso
