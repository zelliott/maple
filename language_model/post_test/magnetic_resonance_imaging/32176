With aging, structural and functional changes occur in the zzso without obvious impairment of zzso left zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso vulnerability for these changes may result in increase of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and impairment of zzso zzso due to hypertension might change the zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso The ratio of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso reflects the zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso We investigated whether the zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso function changes with zzso zzso resonance tissue tagging was performed to derive zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso young zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and aged volunteers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its standard zzso were significantly elevated in the aged group zzso zzso zzso aged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the aged group, blood pressure and the ratio of zzso wall mass to zzso volume were mildly elevated but could not be correlated to the increase in zzso There were no significant differences in other indexes of zzso zzso function such as zzso volume and ejection zzso The elevated zzso zzso in the zzso aged subjects suggests that aging is associated with local loss of zzso zzso function in the zzso relative to the zzso potentially caused by zzso pathological zzso
