zzso materials of zzso oxide can provide zzso enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging zzso The objective of the present study was to investigate zzso relaxation enhancement by zzso (5 to 10 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso by a zzso method and capped with zzso zzso zzso The zzso state of zzso was confirmed by X-ray zzso zzso zzso relaxation times were measured with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso were performed in zzso solutions and cell culture medium zzso 

zzso showed a considerable zzso increase for the zzso particles compared to zzso Both T zzso and T zzso zzso in the presence of zzso particles were approximately twice the corresponding values for zzso in zzso solution and even larger in zzso Higher signal intensity at low zzso was predicted for the zzso solutions, using experimental data to simulate a zzso spin echo zzso 

The study indicates the possibility of obtaining at least doubled zzso compared to zzso using zzso zzso as contrast zzso The high T zzso relaxation rate at low zzso of zzso zzso is very promising for future studies of contrast agents based on zzso zzso
