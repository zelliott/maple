zzso of central zzso activity may form a potential treatment strategy for cognitive impairment in zzso In a randomized, zzso zzso zzso design, we investigated the neural zzso of cognitive effects of zzso an zzso zzso given as an zzso therapy to zzso schizophrenia zzso zzso chronic schizophrenia patients with mild cognitive impairment took zzso After 1 week on zzso zzso all patients entered a zzso zzso 18 were allocated to receive zzso and 18 zzso for the next 12 weeks zzso sample with usable imaging zzso 11 patients on zzso 10 on zzso All patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a zzso zzso task, involving monitoring of dots in particular locations on a screen at a given delay from the original zzso twice: at baseline and 12 weeks zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso produced only a small and zzso improvement in task accuracy across all conditions with no change in response zzso and increased activity in the zzso visual zzso in areas associated with visual and spatial attention but not in any region within the working memory zzso Our observations suggest that zzso enhancement with zzso at doses known to be effective in Alzheimer's disease does not produce strong and clinically meaningful cognitive and neural changes in schizophrenia patients treated with zzso zzso although the neural effects in terms of enhanced zzso activity in regions associated with visual and spatial attention are consistent with those reported previously with zzso enhancement in healthy zzso
