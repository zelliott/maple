zzso zzso of the mouse brain are important in zzso research for targeting of specific internal brain structures during surgical zzso The effectiveness of zzso surgery depends on accurate mapping of the brain structures relative to landmarks on the zzso During zzso development in the zzso rapid zzso changes in the brain occur zzso with growth of zzso plates at the zzso zzso therefore adult mouse brain zzso cannot be used to precisely guide zzso in developing zzso In this study, three-dimensional zzso zzso of zzso mouse brains at six zzso zzso zzso zzso day zzso 7, zzso zzso zzso zzso and in adults zzso were developed, using diffusion zzso imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso At present, most zzso zzso zzso of the mouse brain are based on zzso but the anatomical zzso of ex zzso zzso to in zzso mouse brains has not been evaluated zzso To account for ex zzso tissue distortion due to fixation as well as individual zzso in the brain, we developed a zzso in zzso magnetic resonance imaging adult mouse brain zzso atlas, and a zzso zzso zzso was generated by zzso zzso ex zzso data to the zzso in zzso zzso These zzso resources were developed and made available through a new software zzso with the objective of improving the accuracy of targeting brain structures during zzso surgery in developing and adult zzso mouse zzso
