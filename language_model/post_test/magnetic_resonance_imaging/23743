The nitrogen monoxide radical zzso forms zzso zzso and zzso complexes in zzso zzso To establish a zzso technique for in zzso zzso imaging, we evaluated the suitability of these complexes as magnetic resonance zzso contrast agents, making use of the ability of the zzso electrons of the complexes to enter into dynamic nuclear polarization with water zzso and hence produce enhancement on images generated by the technique of zzso imaging zzso Phantom solutions of synthetic zzso complexes zzso altered the signal intensity of zzso zzso The zzso complex zzso with serum zzso induced a significantly larger signal zzso than the zzso complex zzso with zzso Exposure of rat liver to sodium zzso zzso by ex zzso and in zzso zzso induced a composite zzso electron spin resonance zzso spectrum of the isolated liver characteristic of a zzso and zzso On storage of the zzso the zzso signal disappeared and the zzso signal intensity zzso zzso in zzso zzso images taken at room temperature, the zzso zzso initially exhibited a weak signal that strongly increased with zzso In conclusion, zzso can be detected using zzso and could be exploited for in zzso zzso zzso
