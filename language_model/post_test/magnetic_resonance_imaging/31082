Rapid presentation zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to zzso monkeys performing a zzso rewarded zzso task, to investigate neural correlate of response zzso zzso zzso related to the task performance was observed predominantly in the zzso zzso to the response zzso Furthermore, zzso dominant zzso possibly related to response zzso was observed in the zzso prefrontal cortex, in accordance with previous zzso zzso These results show the feasibility of rapid presentation zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging in behaving zzso
