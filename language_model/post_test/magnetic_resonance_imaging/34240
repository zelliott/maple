We have performed zzso examinations to determine the water diffusion zzso in the brain of six patients who were admitted to the hospital within 12 h after the onset of cerebral zzso zzso The examinations have been carried out immediately after admission, and thereafter at varying intervals up to 90 days post zzso zzso of the trace of the diffusion zzso the fractional zzso and the lattice index, as well as maps of cerebral blood zzso zzso were generated to zzso assess the character of the water diffusion zzso in the zzso zzso In patients with significant zzso deficits and substantial zzso volume changes, four of six cases, our zzso show a zzso and significant decrease in the diffusion zzso within the zzso zzso as a function of zzso We propose that retrospective analysis of this zzso in combination with brain tissue zzso and cerebral zzso zzso may be used in future studies to assess the severity of the zzso zzso
