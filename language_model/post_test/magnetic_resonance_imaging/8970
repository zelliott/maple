The purpose of this study was to provide the first evidence for image zzso of idiopathic spinal zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso 

Twelve patients who underwent surgery for zzso were identified, and zzso symptoms, severity of paralysis and zzso disease zzso plain zzso MR imaging and CT zzso findings, surgical zzso zzso findings, data from spinal zzso monitoring, and zzso recovery were investigated in these zzso zzso on zzso MR imaging and CT zzso were classified into 3 zzso a zzso type zzso zzso a zzso type zzso zzso and a zzso type zzso zzso Using zzso images, the location of the hiatus was classified as either central zzso zzso or lateral zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso spinal zzso was classified based on correspondence zzso Type zzso or zzso zzso Type zzso with the hiatus zzso A bone zzso at the zzso site and the zzso of the zzso were also zzso 

Patients with Type P zzso had a good zzso recovery, and those with a Type C location had significant severe zzso zzso paralysis and a significantly poor zzso zzso Patients with a bone zzso had a significantly severe zzso zzso but showed no difference in zzso zzso 

The zzso results showed that a Type C zzso and a bone zzso have strong relationships with severity of symptoms and surgical outcome and are important imaging and clinical features for zzso These findings may allow surgeons to determine the severity of zzso symptoms and the probable surgical outcome from zzso
