zzso disorder zzso has been associated with structural zzso in brain networks influencing cognitive and motor zzso zzso studies in children identify abnormalities in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In a prior zzso study, we found that zzso adults had significantly smaller overall cortical gray matter, zzso and anterior zzso volumes than matched zzso zzso and surface area are additional indicators of integrity of zzso in the zzso To expand upon our earlier results and further refine the regions of structural zzso we carried out a structural magnetic resonance imaging study of cortical thickness in the same sample of adults with zzso zzso zzso 24) and controls zzso zzso zzso zzso that the cortical networks underlying attention and executive function zzso would be most zzso Compared with healthy adults, adults with zzso showed selective thinning of cerebral zzso in the networks that zzso attention and zzso In the present study, we found significant cortical thinning in zzso in a distinct cortical network supporting attention especially in the right zzso involving the inferior zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the anterior zzso zzso This is the first documentation that zzso in adults is associated with thinner zzso in the cortical networks that zzso attention and zzso
