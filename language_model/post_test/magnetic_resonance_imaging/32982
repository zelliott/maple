To report a novel case of a collision tumor involving an zzso zzso and a zzso segment facial nerve zzso 

Clinical capsule zzso 

zzso academic referral zzso 

A zzso woman with a zzso history of an zzso enlarging left zzso mass and normal zzso function presented to a zzso care referral zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a zzso zzso in the deep portion of the zzso zzso extending into the zzso zzso 

The patient underwent superficial zzso and a zzso zzso mass was found to be intrinsic to the zzso facial zzso A portion of the mass was zzso and zzso frozen section pathology was consistent with a zzso A zzso with zzso zzso was then performed until a zzso segment was identified just zzso to the second zzso After zzso zzso facial nerve stimulation failed to elicit evoked motor zzso and en bloc zzso was zzso 

Final pathology demonstrated a zzso involving the zzso segment and a zzso involving the zzso zzso facial zzso 

We report the first case of a facial nerve collision tumor involving an zzso zzso and a zzso segment facial nerve zzso zzso zzso sheath tumors of the zzso zzso are rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a zzso zzso
