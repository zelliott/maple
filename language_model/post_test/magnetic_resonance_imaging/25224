To test the capability of an indirect MR zzso zzso using a conventional zzso zzso zzso contrast agent for zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 1 and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were injected zzso into the two zzso areas zzso each zzso zzso zzso in 10 female zzso zzso zzso fast zzso echo MR images were acquired through the upper breast and zzso before and for 60 zzso after gentle massage at the injection sites, yielding zzso zzso The localized zzso was zzso from the living animals, followed by post zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso contrast agent zzso was also attempted in 5 female zzso 

Even with zzso contrast agent, the zzso clearly zzso the connection of zzso and zzso vessels directly draining from the injection sites, and the remaining distant zzso with the zzso enhancement zzso within 10 zzso after zzso The zzso images provided comprehensive anatomy of these zzso pathways in each zzso Of the 20 zzso and 128 distant zzso zzso on the zzso all the zzso zzso and 107 zzso distant zzso could be zzso zzso and post zzso in good correlation with the locations and sizes on the MR zzso zzso also effectively localized zzso in the volunteers, without significant adverse zzso 

An indirect zzso using small volumes of conventional zzso contrast agent may have potential for accurate identification and surgical biopsy of breast zzso
