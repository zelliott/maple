The zzso of zzso bone tumor increases every zzso Because the application of high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso for the treatment of bone tumors is still at a nascent stage, it is essential to study the effectiveness of this technique in ideal animal models in order to obtain a beneficial reference for imaging zzso In this study, we established a zzso zzso bone tumor model and evaluated this model by zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso The results show that all tumors were enhanced after injection of zzso A zzso zzso scan revealed obvious enhancement within the zzso zzso examination revealed the presence of a large number of tumor zzso The model can serve as an ideal experimental model for the study of zzso therapy in the treatment of zzso bone tumors and as a reference for imaging studies during zzso
