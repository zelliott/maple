zzso zzso has been zzso related to zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our objective was to investigate the association between primary zzso and signs of zzso at the zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to explore a new zzso based on image zzso zzso with zzso and without zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso with zzso intervals in between, were performed on zzso images in zzso and zzso zzso Attention was focused on the relationship between the upper zzso and the surrounding zzso The findings were divided into three zzso 1) zzso absence of signs of zzso 2) zzso type I: an artery in contact with the zzso zzso but not zzso it, and 3) zzso type II: evident zzso of the zzso zzso by an zzso Signs of zzso were observed in zzso zzso of the zzso group zzso I: zzso zzso zzso type II: zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso subjects, zzso zzso had signs of zzso only one zzso of these had zzso type II zzso zzso and the rest were zzso type zzso We conclude that the presence of zzso at the zzso zzso on zzso is related to zzso More importantly, the finding of frank zzso zzso type zzso is present almost exclusively in zzso zzso only one individual zzso of our zzso zzso had zzso type zzso
