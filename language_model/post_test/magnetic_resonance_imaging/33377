zzso C zzso leads to reduced zzso of zzso and an increased likelihood of zzso It is widely accepted that the most common syndromes associated with protein C zzso are zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso whereas zzso zzso is zzso Here we describe two patients with hypertension and zzso zzso protein C zzso who developed multiple zzso zzso 

Patient 1 was a 46-year-old man with a history of hypertension who developed a right upper zzso and gradually progressive intellectual and behavioral zzso Patient 2 was a zzso man with history of hypertension and two episodes of zzso motor weakness who developed left sixth and seventh zzso zzso and reduced zzso sensation in the right zzso In both patients, magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple small zzso in the zzso as well as the bilateral zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso and other zzso structures, which are consistent with zzso zzso zzso C activity and zzso levels were reduced to approximately one half of normal in these two patients, as well as in some of their family members who had no other zzso or zzso zzso A diagnosis of zzso protein C zzso type 1 was thus zzso 

Although it remains uncertain whether protein C zzso itself increases the risk of cerebral artery zzso it may zzso a patient to develop multiple brain zzso in association with zzso
