A technique is described that provides improved zzso of zzso for MR image acquisition by monitoring the zzso zzso position of the zzso The method incorporates detection of the level of inspiration using an MR zzso rapid display to the patient of zzso position to enable zzso adjustment, and triggering of image data acquisition once appropriate position is zzso The response time of the system is short, approximately 10 zzso Studies in six volunteers using this method demonstrate a considerable decrease in the zzso range of zzso position over 10 consecutive periods of suspended zzso The mean range is zzso zzso with the system, while it is zzso zzso without using zzso It is expected that this method will be of assistance in many abdominal and zzso studies that use zzso zzso
