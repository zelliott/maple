A series of linear zzso of zzso zzso zzso linked by zzso zzso with a varying number zzso of zzso separating the zzso function, were zzso Surprisingly, their zzso at all fields increased with increasing zzso At zzso fields and 35 degrees C, the zzso of the zzso zzso 10 and zzso zzso 12 zzso were unexpectedly high, similar to those of rigid zzso zzso zzso The magnetic field dependence of zzso zzso zzso was measured for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results for zzso solutions imply an increase of rigidity zzso for high zzso with increasing zzso arising from zzso interactions of the zzso groups with zzso This hypothesis is supported by a large decrease in the zzso upon addition of zzso which is known to weaken zzso zzso The zzso are also independent of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso interactions are zzso
