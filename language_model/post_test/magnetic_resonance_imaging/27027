Patients with schizophrenia exhibit deficient response monitoring as zzso by blunted zzso of the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and functionally related regions during error zzso This pattern may reflect zzso zzso of zzso zzso We examined whether the zzso zzso zzso in zzso a candidate schizophrenia risk zzso contributed to our previous findings of blunted zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso integrity of zzso white zzso zzso zzso zzso with schizophrenia underwent diffusion zzso imaging and performed an zzso paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso T zzso carriers exhibited significantly less zzso zzso than zzso patients in bilateral zzso and zzso zzso regions that are thought to mediate zzso zzso reinforcement zzso T carrier patients also showed significantly lower fractional zzso in bilateral zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso response monitoring in zzso presumably via effects on zzso signaling and zzso white matter zzso zzso
