To evaluate the accuracy of segmented zzso magnetic resonance phase zzso mapping zzso in zzso zzso blood flow from zzso zzso zzso 

Two segmented zzso schemes were zzso one with seven lines per segment zzso and one with nine lines per segment zzso in zzso patients with cardiovascular zzso A zzso zzso zzso acquisition was also performed to provide the reference zzso 

There was agreement between the zzso flow zzso acquired with segmented and zzso zzso The calculated zzso and total flow volume per cycle from the zzso and the zzso scans correlated and agreed with the flow volumes from the zzso scans zzso zzso zzso Sign tests showed that there were no statistically significant differences zzso zzso zzso between the segmented and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was the fastest among the three zzso provided adequate spatial and zzso resolution zzso 10 zzso per zzso 

zzso zzso zzso shows great clinical potential in blood flow zzso
