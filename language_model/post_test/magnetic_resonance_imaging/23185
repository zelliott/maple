zzso is a useful approach for both diagnosis and treatment of back zzso However clinicians have underestimated its zzso From the zzso zzso has been used only as a diagnostic zzso without any improvement of the zzso zzso method is nowadays still used for the zzso of adherence by applying medical solutions without a direct vision inside the spinal zzso In 1998 we showed the limitations of zzso approach, and in 1999 we developed a new technique, introducing a zzso balloon to remove the zzso of the spinal canal and the zzso for the zzso of adherence at low temperature zzso zzso In this paper we report a general review of our experience with zzso for the treatment of failed back surgery syndrome zzso and spinal zzso 

A zzso balloon was used to remove fat and/or mild zzso zzso the spinal canal, reducing by 50% the volume of the saline solution used in zzso The zzso was subsequently used to lyse adherence and to allow reaching the site of pain origin, using a low temperature zzso zzso 

the zzso zzso of zzso space zzso were grouped on the basis of common zzso and organizational zzso which were revealed during zzso A year after zzso 59% of zzso patients, and zzso of patients with zzso reported a general improvement of their painful pathology, with a pain reduction above 50 in zzso of zzso Forty-eight percent of patients used minor analgesics and zzso of patients went back to zzso Only few complications were observed zzso 

zzso technique zzso zzso mechanisms otherwise zzso it has specific therapeutic value, whereas on the diagnostic side it has not revealed relevant zzso Its effectiveness in zzso patients is high, with the advantage of its relatively easy zzso limited zzso and zzso
