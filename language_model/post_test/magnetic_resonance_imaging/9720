zzso of conversion from mild cognitive impairment zzso to Alzheimer's disease zzso is of major interest in zzso zzso A large number of potential zzso have been proposed, with most investigations tending to examine one or a set of related zzso In this study, we simultaneously examined multiple features from different zzso of data, including structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso and zzso and functional measures zzso to explore an optimal set of zzso of conversion from zzso to zzso in an Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso zzso After zzso zzso feature zzso zzso and zzso feature collection, feature selection was employed to choose optimal zzso of features from each zzso Support zzso machine zzso zzso were then trained on normal control zzso and zzso zzso Testing was conducted on zzso zzso individuals who have converted to zzso within 24 zzso and zzso zzso individuals who have not converted to zzso within 24 zzso zzso zzso results demonstrated that zzso outperformed zzso and zzso zzso The combination of selected zzso zzso and zzso features attained an accuracy of zzso a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an zzso zzso under zzso of zzso Analysis of the zzso values of zzso who converted at different follow-up evaluations showed that the zzso values were significantly different between individuals who converted within 12 months and after 12 zzso This study establishes meaningful zzso zzso composed of selected zzso zzso and zzso measures which may be useful and practical for clinical zzso
