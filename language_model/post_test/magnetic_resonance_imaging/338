An zzso accurate human upper airway model was constructed from multiple magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso This model was used to conduct detailed zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations during zzso to investigate the fluid flow in the airway regions where obstruction could zzso An identical physical model of the same airway was built using stereo zzso zzso and zzso zzso were conducted in the physical zzso Both simulations and experiments were performed at a peak zzso flow rate of 200 zzso Several different zzso approaches within the zzso commercial software framework were used in the zzso unsteady Large Eddy zzso zzso steady zzso zzso zzso with zzso turbulence models zzso zzso standard zzso and zzso zzso Stress Transport zzso and with zzso zzso zzso The zzso predictions of the average wall zzso pressures at different locations along the airway wall were favorably compared with the experimental zzso Among all the approaches, standard zzso turbulence model resulted in the best agreement with the zzso pressure zzso with an average error of approximately zzso over all zzso The highest positive pressures were observed in the zzso regions below the zzso while the lowest negative pressures were recorded in the zzso zzso The latter is a result of the zzso acceleration in the narrow zzso zzso The largest pressure drop was observed at the tip of the soft zzso This location has the smallest cross section of the zzso The good agreement between the zzso and the experimental results suggest that zzso simulations can be used to accurately zzso aerodynamic flow characteristics of the upper zzso
