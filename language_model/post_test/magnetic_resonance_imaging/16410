White matter zzso zzso on zzso MR imaging are the most common imaging manifestation of zzso effects of therapy for central nervous system zzso prophylaxis in childhood acute zzso leukemia zzso This study uses zzso analyses zzso of zzso imaging of patients during treatment to identify which zzso regions are zzso zzso 

Two sets of conventional zzso zzso images were acquired on a zzso MR imaging scanner from 197 consecutive patients (85 female, 112 zzso aged zzso zzso enrolled on an institutional ALL treatment zzso Images were acquired after completion of induction therapy and after the final of the 4 courses of intravenous high-dose zzso in consolidation therapy zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso statistical testing of the incremental change between zzso zzso zzso images was performed with zzso reading zzso or zzso and treatment zzso as zzso 

Two highly significant bilateral clusters of zzso signal intensity change were identified in both zzso and zzso zzso The regions were zzso in size, shape, and average signal zzso Increased zzso signal intensity from these regions both within and between examinations were zzso functions of age at examination, and the difference between the examinations was greater for older subjects who received more intense zzso 

These analyses identified specific zzso tracts involving predominantly the zzso superior, and zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso which were at increased risk for the development of zzso zzso during therapy for childhood zzso These vulnerable regions may be the cause of subsequent cognitive difficulties consistently observed in zzso
