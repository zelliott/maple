RV changes may be generalized into zzso and zzso Increased zzso results in zzso zzso Increased zzso causes zzso Change in the shape of the RV resulting from increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso changes of chamber zzso onto those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso frequently zzso to RV zzso In these cases, RV zzso function decreases in association with zzso of RV and right zzso zzso zzso Changes in the wall thickness and shape of the RV are zzso and depend upon the severity of the volume or pressure load zzso as well as its duration and rate of zzso Because the RV is an anterior cardiac structure, it occupies little of any heart zzso zzso the sensitivity of plain film examination to RV disease is zzso zzso diagnosis of RV disease can often be made based upon identification of other zzso changes, notably the state of the pulmonary zzso and the position of the heart in the zzso Conventional contrast right zzso may be used to assess the size and position of the zzso as well as associated acquired and zzso zzso that result in RV zzso Due to the unusual shape of the RV zzso however, and the unpredictable manner in which it zzso accurate quantitative analysis by this technique is zzso Furthermore, the common association between RV disease and pulmonary hypertension limits the zzso of this imaging technique for evaluating patients with RV zzso zzso MR imaging allows direct demonstration of changes in RV size and wall zzso Furthermore, application of zzso rule to zzso slices acquired at zzso zzso and zzso allows zzso accurate, and zzso quantitative analysis of zzso volume and zzso mass, allowing zzso assessment in patients for diagnosis, as well as zzso during medical management or after surgical treatment for zzso and acquired diseases that result in RV zzso
