Total zzso zzso is the procedure of choice for growing and symptomatic zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that for patients with advanced age, complicating medical conditions, or residual or zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso would be a useful zzso zzso zzso 2) or alternative zzso zzso 3) zzso 

We report our experience in five elderly patients zzso zzso who underwent gamma knife zzso The median tumor volume was zzso zzso and the tumor margin dose varied from 10 to 16 zzso Because of the irregular tumor volumes along the inferior zzso multiple zzso of zzso were required zzso zzso mean zzso 

During the follow-up zzso of zzso years zzso 3 zzso one patient died of an zzso illness, and all remaining patients were stable without any further deterioration in their clinical zzso zzso imaging studies revealed a reduction in tumor volume in one patient and no further growth in the remaining zzso 

We believe that zzso zzso provides safe and effective management for patients who are poor candidates for zzso of their zzso zzso zzso
