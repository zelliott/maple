Whole brain zzso analyses rarely include the entire brain because of missing data that result from data acquisition limits and zzso artifact, in zzso This missing data problem is typically addressed by omitting zzso from analysis, which may exclude brain regions that are of theoretical interest and increase the potential for Type II error at cortical boundaries or Type I error when spatial thresholds are used to establish zzso zzso could significantly expand statistical map coverage, increase power, and enhance interpretations of zzso zzso We examined multiple zzso for group level analyses of missing zzso data using methods that leverage the spatial information in zzso zzso for both real and simulated zzso Available case analysis, neighbor replacement, and zzso based zzso approaches were compared in a general linear model framework to determine the extent to which these methods zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased the sensitivity of group zzso In both real and simulated data analysis, multiple zzso provided 1) zzso that was most similar to estimates for zzso with no missing data, 2) fewer false positive errors in comparison to mean replacement, and 3) fewer false negative errors in comparison to available case zzso Compared to the standard analysis approach of omitting zzso with missing data, zzso methods increased brain coverage in this study by zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso In addition, multiple zzso increased the size of significant clusters by zzso and number of significant clusters across statistical zzso compared to the standard zzso omission zzso While neighbor replacement produced similar results, we recommend multiple zzso because it uses an informed sampling distribution to deal with missing data across subjects that can include neighbor values and other zzso Multiple zzso is anticipated to be particularly useful for 1) large zzso data sets with inconsistent missing zzso across subjects and 2) addressing the problem of increased artifact at zzso field, which significantly limit the extent of whole brain coverage and interpretations of zzso
