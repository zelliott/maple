The auditory system continuously monitors the environment for irregularities in an zzso zzso zzso This is presumably accomplished by two zzso a sensory mechanism detects a zzso sound on the basis of differential zzso of neural populations sensitive to the standard and zzso sounds, whereas the cognitive mechanism reveals zzso by comparing incoming auditory information with a template derived from previous zzso Using fast zzso high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 zzso we show that both mechanisms can be mapped to different parts of the auditory zzso both at the group level and the zzso zzso The sensory mechanism is supported by primary auditory areas in zzso zzso whereas the cognitive mechanism is implemented in more anterior secondary auditory zzso Both mechanisms are equally engaged by simple zzso tones and zzso zzso indicating that zzso of speech and zzso stimuli are processed in a similar zzso
