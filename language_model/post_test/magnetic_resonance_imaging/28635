Our study was aimed at describing the diagnostic imaging patterns of zzso liver zzso Six patients with liver zzso secondary to zzso tumor were zzso The zzso were zzso proved in each zzso All patients were examined with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso and Digital zzso zzso zzso All patients were treated with zzso zzso of liver zzso zzso imaging methods showed ten to many dozen zzso in each zzso zzso size ranged zzso to 14 zzso US showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso liver zzso with a zzso zzso Large zzso had zzso central areas due to zzso zzso zzso patterns were the most frequent zzso zzso CT showed zzso zzso very small zzso were zzso relative to surrounding zzso CT during contrast agent injection showed that the zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso contrast enhancement was poorer in the portal zzso Large zzso showed a zzso central area due to necrosis which remained zzso in the late zzso The zzso were zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso MR zzso zzso echo dynamic imaging with zzso showed zzso zzso in the zzso phase and lower signal intensity in the portal zzso zzso an essential exam before zzso showed tortuous and zzso zzso and zzso arteries and tumor zzso with no zzso zzso In the zzso phase, tumor zzso and zzso zzso patterns were zzso zzso veins were only displaced and zzso but never infiltrated by the zzso All the techniques we used contributed to assess liver involvement by zzso zzso zzso must be used only before zzso both CT and zzso showed the zzso patterns of the zzso but no technique could predict their zzso
