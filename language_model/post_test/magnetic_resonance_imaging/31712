Every zzso has to evaluate incoming stimuli according to their current and future zzso The immediate value of stimuli is coded by the reward system, but the processing of their long-term relevance zzso a valuation system that implicates zzso The zzso relationship between reward and zzso remains unclear zzso Using zzso functional zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso neural activity in the reward zzso zzso induced signal changes in the same regions that were recruited during reward including the bilateral nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso The zzso signal time courses revealed no differences in early zzso signals between reward and zzso In contrast, both conditions differed in late zzso signals with zzso showing higher signal zzso In sum, our findings indicate sustained recruitment of the reward system during zzso These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the reward-based nature of our zzso
