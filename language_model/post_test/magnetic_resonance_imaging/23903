The purpose of this study was to investigate and to zzso the performance of two-dimensional zzso selective zzso zzso used for zzso applications on a clinical zzso The influence of zzso zzso zzso effects, and incomplete zzso covering on the pencil zzso spatial zzso profile of the zzso zzso pulse was zzso The studies involved experiments performed on zzso and in zzso In addition, simulations were carried out by zzso integration of the Bloch zzso The accuracy of positioning of the pencil beam was increased by a factor of three by employing a simple correction scheme for the compensation of zzso zzso The spatial selectivity of the zzso zzso pulse was improved by taking sampling density corrections into zzso The zzso zzso pulse performance was found to be sufficient to monitor the zzso motion even at moderate zzso zzso For applications, where a high spatial resolution is required or a less characteristic contrast is present a strong zzso system is zzso
