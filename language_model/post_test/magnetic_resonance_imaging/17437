To evaluate the role of emergency zzso in the diagnosis of acute spinal injuries, and to correlate the zzso pattern with the neurological zzso 

zzso patients with zzso spinal zzso injury were classified according to the Frankel zzso zzso was always performed within 8 hours from zzso Frankel zzso divides spinal zzso injuries into 5 classes of decreasing severity based on the presence of motor and/or sensory function zzso On the basis of the zzso findings the patients were classified in 3 groups: group 1 zzso zzso group 2 zzso zzso group 3 zzso zzso All patients underwent neurosurgery and were clinically evaluated until the stabilization of neurological zzso Mean follow-up time was 12 zzso The MR images were zzso evaluated and correlated to the neurological zzso 

zzso patients showed complete motor loss zzso classes A and zzso of these 28 patients 12 zzso had zzso evidence of zzso zzso 12 zzso had zzso zzso and 4 zzso had zzso zzso Of the 10 patients with incomplete motor loss, none had zzso evidence of zzso 4 zzso showed zzso zzso and 6 zzso showed zzso zzso zzso clinical assessment revealed that zzso patients zzso had clinical improvement and zzso cases zzso had a complete motor recovery, as demonstrated by the move to a higher Frankel zzso 

Our results, consistent with previous reports, confirm a strong correlation between the zzso appearance of traumatic spinal zzso injuries in acute phase and long-term recovery of motor and sensory zzso patients with initial zzso had a poor zzso whereas those with spinal zzso zzso had a good clinical outcome, as demonstrated by the passage to a higher Frankel zzso zzso is particularly important in the initial evaluation of unconscious patients who cannot undergo a motor and sensory neurological zzso and to define the zzso which will influence the correct therapeutic zzso
