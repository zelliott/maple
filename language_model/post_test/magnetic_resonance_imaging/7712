In depression, patients suffer from emotional and cognitive deficits, among others in semantic zzso If these semantic deficits are cognitive or interact with emotional zzso is still an open zzso The aim of the current study was to investigate the influence of emotional zzso on the neural zzso of semantic zzso in major zzso In a zzso decision task, positive, negative, and neutral word pairs were presented during zzso zzso zzso zzso and 19 demographically matched controls were zzso zzso positive and neutral zzso induced a zzso effect whereas negative zzso induced no effect zzso or even zzso zzso zzso for related zzso in zzso At the neural level, the semantic relation effect revealed similar neural zzso in right middle frontal regions for patients and zzso Group differences emerged in the right zzso zzso and the zzso zzso associated with positive zzso differed at the zzso and zzso and for negative zzso at zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso correlated zzso with the severity of zzso To zzso semantic processing deficits in depression are modulated by emotional zzso of the stimulus on the behavioral as well as on neural level in zzso prefrontal areas and the zzso The results highlighted an influence of depression severity on emotion information processing as the severity of symptoms correlated zzso with neural responses to positively and zzso zzso zzso zzso the dysfunctional emotion processing may further enhance the cognitive deficits in zzso
