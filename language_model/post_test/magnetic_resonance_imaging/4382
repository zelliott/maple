To review the anatomy of the zzso canal and present the normal zzso and zzso MR appearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty-one zzso MR examinations of the normal zzso zzso were zzso zzso 

The zzso canals are well seen on zzso zzso MR images of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of 31 zzso zzso intense zzso enhancement after intravenous administration of zzso zzso is routine, typically with minor anterior extension into the zzso region zzso zzso of zzso A linear filling zzso zzso the enhanced canal often is seen (21 zzso of zzso and may represent zzso nerve zzso zzso enhancement of the zzso at the level of the zzso zzso was a common finding (19 zzso of zzso 

Enhancement within the zzso canal with anterior extension beneath the skull base is a normal zzso This pattern is characteristic enough on MR imaging to aid interpretation of skull base zzso and to exclude the possibility of a mass within the zzso zzso
