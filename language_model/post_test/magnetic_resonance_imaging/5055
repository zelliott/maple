One major effect caused by the different chemical shift zzso of water and fat is the zzso between the two components in MR zzso zzso to correct zzso are required in clinical zzso for accurate zzso and artifact zzso One of the methods uses the images scanned at opposite zzso zzso to separate water and fat signal in the zzso Its zzso ratio zzso achieves maximum when zzso is around zzso zzso and zzso rapidly as the zzso gets zzso In this work, we proposed a method to correct the chemical shift zzso by using two data sets acquired at two different zzso It is more generalized and flexible than the former method of opposite zzso zzso and covers the former one as a special zzso In both simulation and experiment, the new method is proved to be capable of correcting large chemical shift zzso and maintain a good zzso
