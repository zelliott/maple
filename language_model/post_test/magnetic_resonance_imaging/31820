zzso zzso was studied for the detection of differences in zzso oxygen partial pressure zzso between patients with normal lung transplants and those with zzso zzso syndrome zzso Using software developed zzso zzso zzso zzso from patients with normal lung zzso zzso zzso 8) and with zzso zzso zzso 6) were evaluated zzso zzso were zzso on a zzso system using a zzso zzso echo pulse zzso zzso diseases were pulmonary zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso status was verified by pulmonary function zzso Additionally, zzso was assessed zzso for ventilation zzso Median zzso zzso in patients with normal lung zzso was 146 zzso compared with 108 zzso in patients with zzso zzso of zzso distribution was greater in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso 34 versus 43 zzso Median oxygen decrease rate during breath hold was higher in unaffected patients zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso showed fewer ventilation defects zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso appears capable of demonstrating differences of zzso zzso between normal lung zzso and zzso affected by zzso zzso zzso may add helpful regional information to other diagnostic techniques for the assessment and follow-up of lung transplant zzso
