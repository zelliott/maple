The purpose of this study was to analyze zzso properties of four main stages of zzso patterns of patients with operated zzso lobe zzso related to zzso zzso 

We included 48 patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso were classified according to their zzso properties and surgical outcomes as zzso and not zzso The zzso with artifacts at the beginning were analyzed zzso 

The most frequent type of zzso onset patterns was rhythmic zzso activity, which was correlated to zzso group, whereas zzso of zzso and zzso zzso correlated to not zzso zzso When bilateral independent zzso propagation patterns emerged, zzso tended to predict the side of zzso zone zzso As a later significant pattern, rhythmic zzso activity zzso the focus zzso zzso termination was significantly zzso with zzso sclerosis zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso onset pattern with rhythmic zzso activity zzso well with seizure zzso zzso of later significant patterns was more important in determining the zzso reliability than time of zzso The zzso with short artifacts at the beginning are seen to be valuable in zzso zzso zzso of zzso termination zzso to zzso indicates good prognosis after zzso zzso zzso monitoring helps predict zzso zones and zzso zzso
