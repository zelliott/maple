zzso provides a zzso zzso and objective assessment of middle ear zzso status and is widely used for the clinical diagnosis and follow-up of zzso media with zzso zzso ME pressure, acoustic zzso and zzso zzso are the main test parameters used in making assignments to diagnostic classes zzso presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso Of these, the zzso zzso was suggested to be more sensitive to the presence of zzso but this has not been demonstrated zzso and no standard definition of that zzso is zzso In this study, 10 zzso monkeys with experimental zzso were used to compare the diagnosis of zzso made using three different methods to estimate zzso zzso with that provided by simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso All three methods of zzso zzso measurement were highly correlated with the quantity of ME zzso measured by the zzso Although not zzso the zzso results were better correlated with those for the zzso method when compared to either the zzso or the zzso method of zzso zzso This study demonstrates the use of zzso as a gold standard for evaluating the accuracy of other methods to diagnose ME zzso
