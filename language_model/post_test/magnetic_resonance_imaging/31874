In this paper, we describe how two zzso statistical techniques can be used to investigate how different structures within the brain vary statistically relative to each zzso The first of these techniques is zzso correlation analysis which extracts and zzso correlated zzso between two sets of zzso zzso The second technique is partial least squares zzso which determines the best factors within a first set of zzso variables for predicting a zzso variable from a second zzso We applied these techniques to 178 sets of zzso MR images of the brain to zzso and predict correlated zzso between 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation analysis of the structures gave correlation zzso between zzso and zzso with adjacent structures possessing the strongest zzso zzso predictions of the structures using partial least squares zzso produced an overall sum squared error of zzso zzso compared with an error of zzso zzso produced when using the mean shape as the zzso We also indicate how the correlation strengths between structures can be used to inform a zzso scheme in which partial least squares zzso is combined with a model fitting zzso to further improve prediction zzso
