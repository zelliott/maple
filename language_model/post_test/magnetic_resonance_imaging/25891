The authors compared the two most common zzso tests now used for the zzso staging of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

One hundred consecutive radical zzso zzso patients were zzso at zzso zzso before surgery with routine zzso and zzso zzso zzso The images were analyzed by two experienced zzso for evidence of zzso zzso zzso rated each zzso on a scale of 0 to 100 for the percentage likelihood of zzso disease based on its zzso zzso zzso operator characteristic zzso zzso were zzso and areas were calculated for the two zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the areas of the zzso zzso generated from the two zzso and those from the zzso zzso values showed no statistical zzso 

In this series, zzso interpretation of body zzso zzso studies in those patients chosen for a radical zzso zzso was no better in staging zzso of the prostate than simply using the zzso zzso zzso
