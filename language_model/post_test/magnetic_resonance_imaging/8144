During tasks requiring response zzso zzso response time zzso a measure of motor response preparation, has been found to correlate with errors of commission, such that individuals with higher zzso show increased commission zzso This study used zzso to examine the neural zzso of response zzso in 30 typically developing children, ages zzso using a simplified zzso task with minimal cognitive zzso Lower zzso was associated with Go zzso in the anterior zzso zzso and with zzso zzso in the zzso supplementary motor area zzso the zzso zzso the anterior zzso zzso and the inferior zzso zzso For both Go and zzso events, higher zzso was associated with zzso in prefrontal zzso and the zzso The findings have implications for zzso disorders such as zzso and suggest that during response zzso children with more consistent performance are able to rely on zzso circuits involving the zzso important for response zzso those with less consistent performance instead recruit prefrontal circuits involved in more complex aspects of behavioral zzso
