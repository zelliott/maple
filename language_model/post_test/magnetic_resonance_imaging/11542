To compare conventional and zzso MR imaging in terms of their depiction of the abnormalities occurring in zzso zzso 

We zzso analyzed the findings of conventional zzso and zzso inversion zzso and zzso MR imaging in four patients with zzso zzso zzso The signal intensity of the zzso was classified by visual assessment as markedly high, slightly high, or zzso relative to normal brain zzso 

Both conventional and zzso MR images demonstrated bilateral high signal intensity in the zzso zzso in all four zzso zzso zzso were observed on zzso MR images in all four, and on zzso inversion recovery MR images in one, but in no patient on zzso zzso Conventional MR images showed slightly high signal intensity in all zzso while zzso images showed markedly high signal intensity in zzso 

zzso MR imaging is more sensitive than its conventional counterpart in the depiction of zzso disease, and permits better detection of the zzso in both the cerebral zzso and zzso zzso
