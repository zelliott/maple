The zzso of primary central nervous system zzso zzso is zzso zzso approaches remain zzso An animal model that mimics the clinical situation would be useful for evaluating zzso biology and zzso 

zzso rats received zzso zzso nucleus, zzso zzso 49) or zzso zzso zzso 4) zzso of human zzso cell line zzso Two to five weeks after tumor zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was done zzso zzso 24), and rat brains were assessed for zzso Five rats each received zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso or high-dose zzso zzso (3 zzso 

zzso tumors developed in zzso of zzso animals with no zzso zzso of rats zzso with 4 zzso total body zzso and zzso of rats zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed abnormal zzso signal and zzso enhancement on zzso images, consistent with tumor growth 19 to 24 days after zzso zzso cells zzso positively for zzso markers infiltrated within the zzso hemisphere, along fiber tracks to the zzso hemisphere, and along the zzso space and zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso tumor cell injection resulted in zzso zzso zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso were effective in zzso but only zzso was clearly effective after 1 week in the zzso zzso 

This model closely mimics human zzso in terms of imaging, zzso and treatment sensitivity and will be useful for the development of future therapeutic strategies for zzso
