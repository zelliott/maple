To zzso the feasibility and safety of a novel zzso ultrasound zzso device combined with real-time zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso temperature monitoring and temperature feedback control, to enable zzso precise regional zzso of simulated prostate zzso zzso in a zzso canine zzso To correlate zzso volumes measured with zzso cumulative zzso damage estimates, zzso zzso and zzso 

Three dogs were treated with three targeted zzso each, using a zzso zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provided images for treatment planning, guidance, real-time zzso zzso as well as zzso evaluation of zzso After treatment, specimens underwent zzso analysis to determine the extent of necrosis and cell zzso zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate the correlation between zzso volumes measured with zzso cumulative zzso damage estimates, zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso combined with a zzso zzso device enabled zzso temperature monitoring at the target as well as in surrounding zzso allowing for safe, targeted, and controlled zzso of prescribed zzso zzso volumes measured by cumulative zzso dose positively correlated with volumes determined by zzso analysis zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a positive correlation with zzso areas on zzso analysis zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso Additionally, there was a positive correlation between zzso volumes according to cumulative zzso dose and volumes identified on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no difference in mean zzso volumes assessed with the various analysis methods zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso US therapy enabled safe and targeted zzso of prescribed zzso in a zzso canine prostate zzso zzso volumes were reliably predicted by zzso and zzso zzso Clinical studies are needed to confirm the zzso safety, zzso control, and functional outcomes of this therapy in patients in whom focal therapy is zzso
