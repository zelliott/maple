To manipulate an object, we must simultaneously control the contact forces exerted on the object and the movements of our zzso Two alternative views for manipulation have been zzso one in which motions and contact forces are represented and controlled by separate neural zzso and one in which motions and forces are controlled zzso by a single zzso To evaluate these alternatives, we designed three tasks in which subjects maintained a specified contact force while their hand was moved by a robotic zzso The prescribed contact force and hand motions were selected in each task to induce the subject to attain one of three zzso zzso exerting a regulated contact force, zzso tracking the motion of the zzso and zzso attaining both force and motion goals zzso By comparing subjects' performances in these three tasks, we found that behavior was captured by the summed actions of two independent control zzso one applying the desired force, and the other guiding the hand along the predicted path of the zzso Furthermore, the application of zzso magnetic stimulation impulses to the zzso zzso zzso selectively disrupted the control of motion but did not affect the regulation of zzso contact zzso Together, these findings are consistent with the view that manipulation of objects is performed by independent brain control of hand motions and interaction zzso
