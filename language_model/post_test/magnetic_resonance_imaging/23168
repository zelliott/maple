zzso of skeletal zzso to the heart has been investigated as a means to zzso and protect the zzso from damage after zzso zzso While several animal studies utilizing skeletal zzso have reported positive findings, results from clinical studies have been zzso In this study we zzso a newly developed zzso zzso system to zzso skeletal zzso with a zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso prior to zzso into acutely zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to promote zzso of the zzso following zzso zzso We report that zzso zzso expressing skeletal zzso into acutely zzso zzso produces superior results compared to zzso of zzso skeletal zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso were able to restore cardiac function to zzso levels as measured by ejection zzso to limit zzso of the heart chamber as measured by end zzso and zzso volumes, and to prevent zzso wall zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso formation, retention of viable zzso and prevention of zzso was significantly improved by zzso expressing skeletal zzso compared to zzso zzso This work demonstrates the feasibility of using zzso zzso zzso to create engineered skeletal zzso to treat acutely zzso zzso
