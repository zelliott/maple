zzso MR imaging of the spine has been used to differentiate benign from zzso zzso body zzso zzso We sought to determine the utility of zzso MR imaging in the detection of zzso zzso and to compare it with conventional zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso 

Fifteen patients with zzso to the spine were studied using conventional MR imaging and zzso zzso zzso review of all images was zzso and patients were zzso according to whether they had focal or multiple zzso The signal intensity of the zzso was compared on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In five patients with focal disease, zzso were zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), or zzso zzso zzso 2) on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3) or zzso zzso zzso 2) on zzso images with respect to presumed normal bone zzso In 10 patients with disease in multiple sites, all zzso were zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or mixed zzso zzso 2) on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or mixed zzso zzso 2) on zzso images with respect to presumed normal bone zzso 

As used in this study, zzso MR imaging of the spine showed no advantage in the detection and characterization of zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso imaging, but was considered superior to zzso zzso
