zzso small vessel disease zzso causes focal zzso zzso and more diffuse zzso referred to as zzso zzso dysfunction has been proposed as a zzso mechanism in the zzso zzso is toxic to zzso We determined whether elevated homocysteine levels and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are risk factors for zzso as a whole, and for two different zzso zzso isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also determined whether any association was zzso by zzso dysfunction, as assessed by circulating zzso zzso One hundred and zzso Caucasian patients with zzso and zzso community controls of similar age and sex were zzso zzso homocysteine measurement and zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso were measured in a zzso Mean homocysteine levels were higher in zzso than controls zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was a stronger risk factor in those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso per zzso increase in log homocysteine concentration zzso zzso zzso in comparison with isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso after controlling for both conventional risk factors and zzso The zzso zzso zzso was a risk factor only in the zzso zzso group zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of the zzso markers zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso model resulted in the association between homocysteine and zzso no longer being zzso In conclusion, zzso is an independent risk factor for zzso particularly zzso zzso and this effect may be zzso via zzso zzso zzso therapy may be particularly effective in this zzso
