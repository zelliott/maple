To assess the impact of zzso zzso zzso on the management of zzso 

Between 1982 and 2002, 83 patients with zzso proven zzso or zzso were investigated using zzso zzso zzso of these patients, with a zzso form of the disease, presented with 23 zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso five von zzso disease zzso eight multiple zzso zzso type 2A zzso and one type zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was observed in zzso sporadic zzso zzso zzso zzso familial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No significant correlations were found between the degree of zzso zzso zzso size and urinary zzso zzso No patients undergoing surgery for sporadic zzso had a second zzso zzso Nine of 54 sporadic zzso had normal or mildly elevated urinary zzso levels zzso zzso greater than zzso In eight of these patients, zzso was positive and confirmed the diagnosis of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated additional zzso not detected with zzso zzso zzso and/or magnetic resonance imaging zzso in three zzso The zzso findings in the group with apparently sporadic zzso zzso zzso 6) were negative in four cases and failed to detect a cervical zzso in one zzso zzso 

zzso was useful in confirming the diagnosis in zzso with low levels of zzso zzso It contributed little to the management of patients when used as a means of screening for zzso in sporadic zzso or the management of patients with familial zzso However, zzso can be an zzso method of investigation when dealing with zzso forms, although the sensitivity of zzso is lower in this group of zzso
