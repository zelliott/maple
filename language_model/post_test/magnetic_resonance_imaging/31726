We present the design, construction, and performance of a novel zzso gas jet delivery capable of operating in a magnetic resonance imaging zzso This apparatus is computer controlled and built with two separate zzso circuits enabling gas jet applications at variable sites through four independently activated zzso Gas jet delivery is fully zzso in terms of pressure, flow rate, gas temperature, application time, and duration of zzso zzso We characterized these zzso considering effects such as pressure drop by flow zzso transient effects, and delays in zzso The system offers new possibilities for use in various biomedical contexts such as, zzso quantitative sensory testing or dental hypersensitivity zzso
