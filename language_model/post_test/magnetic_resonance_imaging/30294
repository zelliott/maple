Using a zzso procedure we have prepared magnetic zzso zzso of zzso stabilized zzso zzso These zzso are comprised of zzso zzso zzso of magnetic zzso which can be aligned in parallel zzso by an external magnetic zzso We have shown the potential use of these materials as contrast agents by measuring their MR response in live zzso The new magnetic zzso have demonstrated good zzso and potential for in zzso zzso zzso
