zzso individuals need effective mechanisms to prevent interference from one language while processing material in the zzso Here we show, using zzso brain zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso that words from the zzso language are rejected at an early stage before semantic analysis in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Spanish subjects were instructed to press a button when presented with words in one language, while ignoring words in the other language and zzso The brain zzso of zzso subjects in response to words of the zzso language were not sensitive to word frequency, indicating that the meaning of zzso words was not zzso in zzso The zzso zzso patterns of zzso included a number of areas previously implicated in zzso and zzso processing, suggesting that zzso use an indirect zzso access route to the lexicon of the target language to avoid zzso
