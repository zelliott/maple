The diagnostic process has become increasingly dependent on instrumental and laboratory zzso 

To evaluate the accuracy of symptoms and signs in identifying left zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso 

A group of 100 patients in stable clinical condition and scheduled for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was zzso examined by two zzso who were unaware of the individual patient's zzso Patients were interviewed and underwent physical zzso 

Several symptoms and signs were associated with zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction at zzso zzso Using multiple zzso regression, a zzso zzso zzso a zzso displaced zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction zzso fraction zzso zzso The combination of the above variables correctly identified zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso and zzso of patients with zzso dysfunction zzso zzso specificity zzso Considering zzso zzso and dysfunction, zzso of patients were correctly identified after history alone zzso zzso after zzso impulse examination zzso and zzso after cardiac zzso zzso 

zzso and signs predict zzso zzso and/or dysfunction with fair sensitivity and excellent zzso
