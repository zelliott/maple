zzso after a constant infusion zzso of zzso has been used to identify the extent of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso imaging is more commonly performed with a zzso (for zzso zzso zzso This study sought to determine how image delay time and time zzso influence the assessment of necrosis by zzso Both infusion and DE imaging was performed in dogs with zzso (N zzso 6) or zzso (N zzso 4) zzso Estimates of the zzso of zzso zzso with DE were compared with those calculated after 60 zzso of infusion, and the comparisons were repeated until 4 zzso or 8 zzso weeks zzso In zzso animals, the zzso zzso between DE and infusion estimates of zzso was zzso zzso for most image delays zzso 8 zzso zzso for day 0 through week 3, with zzso at day 0 greater than at week 4 zzso zzso zzso In zzso animals, there was an interaction between image delay time and time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponded to longer image delays at week 1 than at weeks zzso zzso when image delays are selected appropriately, DE images can strongly reflect zzso and identify zzso injured zzso
