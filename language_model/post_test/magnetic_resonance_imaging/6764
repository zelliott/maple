zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso has become a widely accepted zzso for the selection of patients amenable for acute therapy, if a mismatch between these procedures suggests viable zzso zzso However, zzso as well as zzso yields zzso measures limiting the definitions of irreversible damage and of potentially viable zzso zzso These limitations of zzso may be better understood if findings in individual patients are compared with the results from zzso of blood flow, oxygen zzso and zzso zzso binding obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative studies with PET and zzso were performed in 3 groups of zzso zzso In 12 acute stroke patients, results from zzso zzso zzso hours after symptom zzso and zzso zzso PET zzso 85 minutes between zzso and zzso were compared with zzso extension 24 to 48 hours later on zzso zzso zzso In 11 acute stroke patients, results from zzso zzso 8 hours after symptom zzso were compared with cerebral blood flow zzso obtained with zzso PET zzso 60 minutes between zzso and zzso zzso In 10 patients with acute zzso or chronic stroke zzso results from zzso were compared with PET of cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption to detect mismatch or increased oxygen extraction fraction as surrogate markers of zzso zzso were: zzso from regions with increased zzso intensity, decreased apparent diffusion zzso zzso and decreased zzso binding probability zzso were zzso for eventual zzso and zzso prediction limits were zzso These limits predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the final zzso zzso However, the zzso predictions were much higher for the zzso variables zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso versus a median of 0 for zzso zzso The comparison of volumes generated by different time to peak zzso thresholds zzso and zzso zzso zzso g per minute zzso indicates that a zzso delay of 4 to 6 seconds yields a fair estimate of zzso zzso The zzso mismatch with zzso zzso seconds did not reliably zzso to the zzso as assessed by PET zzso extraction fraction zzso Only 6 of 10 patients with a mismatch had areas of zzso In these cases, the zzso volume was overestimated by zzso zzso zzso with zzso results and, with a few exceptions, yields a good estimate of acute tissue damage and final zzso zzso zzso measures seem to be less zzso the zzso zzso of zzso seconds assessed only zzso of the volume of zzso zzso zzso g per zzso The mismatch volume imprecisely depicts increased oxygen extraction zzso and, despite its clinical role for selection of patients for eventual therapy, it does not to seem to be a reliable correlate of zzso
