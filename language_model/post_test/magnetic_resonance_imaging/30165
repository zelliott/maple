zzso zzso is a chronic widespread pain condition that is thought to arise from zzso of central neural zzso zzso zzso is an zzso neurotransmitter that functions in zzso zzso This study was carried out to investigate the relationship between changing levels of zzso within the zzso and changes in multiple pain zzso in patients with zzso 

Ten patients with zzso underwent 2 sessions of zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and 2 sessions of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso each conducted before and after a zzso intervention to reduce zzso During zzso the anterior and zzso insular regions were examined separately using zzso zzso The levels of zzso and other zzso were estimated relative to levels of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso During zzso painful pressures were applied to the zzso to elicit zzso zzso Experimental zzso pain thresholds and clinical pain ratings (on the Short Form of the McGill zzso zzso zzso were also assessed prior to each imaging session 

Both experimental pain zzso zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso clinical pain zzso zzso zzso versus zzso were reduced following zzso Changes from zzso to zzso in zzso were zzso correlated with changes in experimental pain thresholds zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and positively correlated with changes in clinical pain zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Changes in the zzso blood zzso zzso effect (a measure of neural zzso were positively correlated with changes in zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Changes in zzso levels within the zzso are associated with changes in multiple pain zzso in patients with zzso Thus, zzso data may serve as a useful zzso and surrogate end point for clinical trials of zzso
