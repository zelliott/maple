Since 1974, 27 patients with zzso zzso zzso have been treated at zzso University Hospital and ancillary zzso In the present study the clinical features and zzso patterns of these 27 cases are zzso and the clinical features of 402 cases reported in the literature are zzso Based on the analysis of the zzso patterns of the zzso the surgical strategy for a zzso removal of zzso involving multiple zzso is zzso 

zzso zzso are classified into six types according to tumor zzso zzso M, zzso and E are tumors involving a single zzso that is, the middle zzso zzso zzso or zzso space, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ME zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso are tumors involving multiple zzso Advances in zzso technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging, have revealed a high zzso of zzso extending into multiple zzso namely zzso in cases reported since 1983 and 59% in the zzso zzso All but one of the most recent 19 patients in this series underwent skull base surgery, whereas the remaining nine patients were surgically treated via the conventional zzso zzso The rate of total tumor removal and the clinical outcome were significantly better in those patients treated by skull base surgery than those treated by conventional zzso 

The zzso extending into multiple zzso can be totally removed using the following zzso surgical zzso Type zzso by the anterior zzso zzso Type ME by the zzso or zzso zzso zzso and Type zzso by the zzso zzso zzso In 12 of 13 cases involving multiple zzso in this series, total tumor removal was achieved using zzso skull base zzso
