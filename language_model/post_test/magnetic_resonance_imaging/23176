To define magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging findings of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the knee in order to describe implant zzso and to compare findings with validated clinical scores 30 and 60 months after zzso zzso 

Thirteen patients were recruited (10 male, 3 zzso with a total number of 15 zzso zzso Each patient underwent an zzso procedure and MR zzso 30 and 60 months after zzso MR zzso was performed using a dedicated zzso with a zzso zzso The status of the zzso implant was evaluated with the modified zzso scoring zzso The lining of the zzso the integration to the border zone, the surface and structure of the repaired tissue were zzso and the presence of bone zzso zzso and zzso was zzso For clinical assessment, the Cincinnati score was zzso 

At 60 months, the zzso showed worsening in 1 out of 15 zzso zzso showed improvement in 3 out of 15 cases, and worsening in 3 out of 15 zzso Two surfaces of the implant showed further deterioration at 60 months, and 1 afflicted implant fully recovered after the same time zzso zzso contrast enhancement at 30 months was seen in 2 out of 15 cases, 1 of which recovered at 60 zzso According to the zzso score, 4 cases were rated zzso out of 75 at 30 months and 65 out of 75 at 60 zzso The mean clinical score decreased from zzso out of 10 at 30 months to zzso out of 10 at 60 zzso 

zzso resonance zzso improved the evaluation of implants and facilitated the zzso of zzso integration with zzso zzso The follow-up showed significant changes in zzso even at 60 months, allowing for useful long-term MR zzso
