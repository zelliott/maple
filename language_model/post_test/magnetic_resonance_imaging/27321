Poor insight is a central characteristic of psychosis and zzso zzso evidence indicates that cortical zzso structures zzso and zzso zzso zzso both of which are associated with zzso processing in healthy subjects, are among the most affected brain structures in zzso However, the hypothesis that direct associations between function of these brain regions and poor insight in schizophrenia exist has not been tested zzso 

We studied 21 patients with schizophrenia and 17 healthy control subjects with structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging during a clinical insight task and a comparable control zzso We assessed the level of insight, depression, positive and negative symptoms, and zzso function, then adjusted correlation between insight and zzso brain zzso for potential zzso zzso zzso was used to compare brain volumes between zzso 

Insight correlated strongly with the zzso of the zzso and the zzso during the clinical insight tasks, independently of potential zzso The zzso zzso was stronger during the insight task than during the control task in zzso The functional zzso of insight matched the distribution of cortical volume reduction in the patient zzso 

These findings suggest a link between known regional brain abnormalities and the manifestation of poor insight in zzso The contribution of zzso to insight may be related to self-referential processing and that of zzso to the integration of multiple cognitive processes that are necessary for accurate evaluation of one's mental zzso
