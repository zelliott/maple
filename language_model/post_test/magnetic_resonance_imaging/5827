To explore relations between spatial distribution of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso and zzso In zzso the presence of zzso brain zzso challenges the prediction of disability based on conventional brain zzso zzso that zzso may partly be determined by zzso location, this retrospective study explored relations between zzso location and disability using zzso analyses in standard zzso 

Using zzso zzso statistics, zzso zzso probability on zzso zzso masks was related to expanded disability status scale zzso and zzso functional composite zzso zzso scores and demographic characteristics of 325 zzso zzso To identify statistically significant locations, a zzso threshold of zzso was zzso 

In clusters in the zzso region, zzso probability correlated significantly zzso zzso zzso with disability and disease zzso and was higher in progressive than in zzso zzso When controlled for zzso load zzso no significant clusters zzso zzso and number of spinal zzso zzso did not correlate with zzso probability in any location, and did not influence correlations with disability when included in its zzso 

zzso zzso were related to zzso zzso influenced relations between disability and zzso probability throughout the brain, suggesting interplay between zzso burden and its location in determining disability in zzso
