To determine the zzso value of zzso joint space narrowing zzso for zzso cartilage thickness loss in the narrowed and the zzso zzso zzso 

922 knees from 922 zzso Initiative zzso participants zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso 175 with lateral zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso were analyzed using 3 T zzso zzso cartilage thickness change was determined in the lateral zzso and zzso zzso compartment zzso and in zzso zzso The probability of subsequent cartilage loss was calculated using zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso for the probability and magnitude of cartilage loss was compared between zzso zzso and zzso knees using zzso exact and zzso zzso 

The probability of cartilage loss was greater in the narrowed compartment of zzso knees zzso than in zzso knees zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and so was the magnitude of cartilage thickness change zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were observed between the narrowed compartments of zzso zzso zzso knees zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or between the zzso compartment of zzso zzso zzso knees zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso These results were confirmed by the zzso ordered value zzso analyses of zzso zzso 

The zzso value of zzso for lateral compartment cartilage loss was comparable to that of zzso for zzso compartment cartilage loss, whereas cartilage loss in the zzso compartment was similar to that in zzso zzso These findings provide important clues to predicting progression of knee zzso and in tailoring inclusion criteria for clinical zzso
