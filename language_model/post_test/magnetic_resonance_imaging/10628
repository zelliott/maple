zzso are rare tumors of zzso cells for which the optimal management is surgical zzso zzso diagnosis and zzso may be zzso We evaluated whether zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning with the combination of zzso zzso and the zzso analogue zzso zzso would allow more exact diagnosis and zzso 

Fourteen patients with suspected zzso were evaluated by anatomical imaging zzso zzso or magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso PET imaging was performed by using zzso with dynamic adrenal imaging, followed by a torso survey and zzso with a torso zzso Images were evaluated zzso by an experienced zzso 

Eight patients had zzso zzso Of the other six, two patients had normal adrenal tissue at zzso and the other four had subsequent clinical courses inconsistent with a diagnosis of zzso In four of eight patients with zzso zzso failed to detect one or more sites of zzso zzso The zzso detected all sites of confirmed disease, whereas zzso detected all sites of adrenal and abdominal disease, but not bone zzso in one zzso zzso and zzso results were all negative in the six patients without zzso One patient with adrenal zzso zzso had a positive zzso zzso PET scanning aided the decision not to operate in three of six zzso The resolution of PET functional imaging was superior to that of zzso 

PET scanning for zzso offers improved quality and resolution over current diagnostic zzso PET may significantly influence the clinical management of patients with a suspicion of these tumors and warrants further zzso
