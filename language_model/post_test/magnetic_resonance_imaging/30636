New zzso molecules containing a zzso zzso or a claw zzso have been prepared in order to obtain mixed zzso as zzso contrast agents in magnetic resonance zzso The first zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The second zzso compound, zzso zzso or its zzso complex, zzso contains the same zzso zzso zzso bound, through a zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The mixed zzso as well as the pure zzso aggregate, in the presence and absence of zzso have been fully characterized by surface tension zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso scattering zzso The structural characterization of the mixed zzso zzso indicates a zzso arrangement of the zzso with an external shell of approximately 21 A and an inner core of approximately 20 zzso Both the zzso complexes and the zzso peptides point toward the external zzso The measured values for zzso in saline medium at 20 zzso zzso zzso frequency and 25 degrees C are zzso zzso zzso These values show a large enhancement in comparison with the isolated zzso zzso
