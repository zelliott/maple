zzso magnetic resonance zzso localized to the zzso nucleus, was carried out in nine patients with a clinical diagnosis of zzso syndrome zzso and in eight healthy zzso zzso Three of the nine zzso patients had a so-called zzso of the tiger zzso with high signal in the zzso zzso surrounded by a ring of low signal on zzso weighted magnetic resonance imaging previously only reported in zzso zzso One of these patients had zzso proven zzso at zzso The zzso group showed a significant reduction in the median concentration from zzso groups zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso p zzso zzso compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso The zzso concentration was significantly reduced in seven of the nine patients zzso The reduction of the zzso ratio from the zzso nucleus in the zzso group may reflect zzso loss, occurring predominantly in the zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso may be a useful, zzso technique to help differentiate the various zzso zzso
