To probe the potential and pitfalls of contrast medium zzso skeletal muscle zzso imaging under zzso stress zzso 

zzso resonance zzso signal dynamics in calf muscle and zzso arteries of 20 healthy volunteers were analyzed under zzso zzso zzso zzso and concurrent contrast medium first pass, using a zzso recovery zzso zzso type sequence without heartbeat zzso The signal zzso time zzso were analyzed descriptively and by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso significant changes in calf muscle signal dynamics in the zzso leg zzso those in the zzso leg at rest were found in zzso and zzso zzso Although a distortion of the zzso signal derived input function by inflow effects was found to cause large variations of the zzso results, the magnitude of the observed effects suggested a potential for immediate visual detection of areas with reduced tissue zzso 

The zzso approach appeared promising for visual zzso However, a zzso of inflow and contrast zzso effects on zzso signal intensity was deemed a prerequisite for input zzso zzso zzso
