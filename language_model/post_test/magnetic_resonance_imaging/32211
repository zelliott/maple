We sought to test the hypothesis that magnetic resonance imaging zzso vulnerable plaques correlate to accelerated zzso of cerebrovascular events and to evaluate the potential use of zzso in secondary prevention of zzso zzso 

zzso symptomatic participants were recruited from patients sustaining their second zzso cerebral zzso Nine participants were women and 44 were zzso the mean age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso Patients were zzso within 7 days after the zzso of cerebral zzso The zzso diagnostic signals defined a zzso of zzso zzso We compare the zzso between two cerebral zzso with plaque vulnerability defined by the zzso zzso zzso We used a Cox zzso hazards model to calculate the relationship between vulnerable zzso and the zzso of cerebral zzso and we followed these patients for 180 days and compared the zzso rate for the zzso cerebral zzso between patients with and without vulnerable zzso 

The mean zzso recurrence zzso for patients with vulnerable zzso was shorter than the mean zzso for patients without vulnerable zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso cerebral zzso within 1 year, vulnerable zzso were more frequently detected zzso versus zzso zzso zzso The patients with vulnerable zzso had an zzso higher hazard risk zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso than those without vulnerable zzso after adjustment for risk zzso For those with vulnerable zzso the morbidity of zzso cerebral zzso was higher than those without zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso vulnerable zzso in carotid arteries are related to accelerated zzso cerebral zzso and high zzso zzso zzso demonstrates clinical value in the secondary prevention of cerebral zzso
