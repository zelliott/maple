zzso zzso zzso is relatively rare and the exact mechanisms of this condition remain zzso In this report, we present a case of chronic zzso zzso in the lateral zzso and discuss the zzso of this zzso 

A zzso presented with progressive gait zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso showed a zzso mass arising from the wall of the right lateral zzso The mass connecting to the zzso wall zzso a zzso tumor and the other part zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso shunt in the right lateral zzso zzso The operative findings revealed that the part arising from the zzso wall contained zzso showing various stages of zzso and that the zzso mass visible on zzso was a zzso solid zzso zzso examination revealed that the capsules of both were compatible with chronic zzso zzso zzso 

In the present case, one part of the mass contained only zzso zzso indicating the possibility that the mass was undergoing spontaneous zzso This fact might indicate that the presence of zzso in the capsule is not the sole factor in the expansion of zzso
