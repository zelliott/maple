We report a functional application of magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the quantitative description of left zzso geometry through zzso and zzso in normal zzso zzso rats that might be zzso for the analysis of chronic changes resulting from pathological zzso Images of cardiac anatomy were acquired through planes both parallel and perpendicular to the principal cardiac axis at times that were synchronized to the R wave of the zzso The images of the zzso sections were assembled into three-dimensional representations of left zzso geometry at consecutive time points through the cardiac zzso This confirmed the geometrical zzso of the data sets, that each slice showed circular zzso and that the images were correctly aligned with the appropriate anatomical zzso Different models for the three-dimensional geometry of the left zzso were then tested against the zzso and zzso surfaces reconstructed from images of the zzso sections of the left zzso in both zzso and zzso using zzso zzso in three zzso In agreement with previous reports in the human heart, an elliptical figure of revolution offered an optimal fit to the zzso and zzso geometry for the rat heart in zzso This was in preference to models that used zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, in contrast to contraction in the human heart, all these geometrical representations broke down during zzso ejection in the rat zzso We therefore introduced a more general hybrid model which described left zzso geometry in terms of the variation of the zzso zzso independently determined for each zzso with its position zzso along the principal cardiac zzso The resulting function zzso could then be described by a simple zzso of revolution not only during zzso but also throughout zzso zzso The findings also ruled out alternative geometrical zzso It was then possible additionally to reconstruct the zzso and total left zzso volumes, wall thicknesses and ejection zzso through the cardiac cycle and to confirm that the predicted total zzso wall volume was zzso throughout the cardiac zzso Our hybrid model of cardiac geometry may thus be useful for zzso serial studies of chronic pathological changes that use the rat as a model experimental zzso
