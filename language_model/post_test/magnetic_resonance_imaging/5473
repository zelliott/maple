The objectives of this study were to zzso characterize cognitive and cerebral zzso of attention and response speed in patients with zzso sleep zzso zzso and zzso assess the association of performance and brain zzso with measures of zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso and controls were compared on performance and brain zzso during a sustained attention zzso The association of reaction time and brain zzso with zzso index, nocturnal zzso and zzso was zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging was conducted while participants performed a zzso zzso The zzso trials of the zzso task were used to index attention zzso 

Fourteen patients with zzso and 14 normal control subjects with equivalent age, body mass index, blood pressure, and zzso 

zzso 

Patients with zzso showed decreased brain zzso in cingulate, zzso and zzso regions typically involved in attention tasks, compared with control zzso Within the patients with zzso increasing zzso index, but not zzso index, was associated with slower mean reaction time and with decreased brain zzso in areas involved in zzso and attention, response selection, motor response, and decision zzso The zzso index, by itself, was not associated with changes in cerebral zzso 

Patients with zzso showed decreased brain zzso compared with control subjects during an attention zzso The association of zzso index (but not zzso with slow reaction times and brain zzso suggests that alertness and reaction times show greater correlations with measures of sleep disruption than with measures of zzso
