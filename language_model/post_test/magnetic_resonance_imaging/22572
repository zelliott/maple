The zzso E zzso zzso zzso is the main known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's zzso zzso assessments in combination with other diagnostic tools, such as zzso have the potential to facilitate early zzso In this large-scale functional zzso zzso study, we have contrasted 30 zzso zzso carriers (age zzso zzso years; 19 zzso of which 10 were zzso for the zzso zzso and 30 zzso with regard to brain activity during a semantic categorization zzso Test groups were closely matched for sex, age and zzso zzso both groups were cognitively intact and thus zzso of Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso carriers showed reduced zzso responses in the left inferior zzso cortex, and zzso in the anterior zzso zzso A zzso response was observed in the zzso area such that diminution was most pronounced in zzso compared with zzso zzso In addition, contrasts of processing novel versus familiar items revealed an abnormal response in the right zzso in the zzso zzso group, mainly expressed as diminished sensitivity to the relative novelty of zzso zzso these findings indicate that genetic risk translates into reduced functional brain activity, in regions pertinent to Alzheimer's disease, well before zzso can be detected at the zzso zzso
