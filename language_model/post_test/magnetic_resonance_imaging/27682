To evaluate the potential functional reorganization by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure the brain zzso in responses to stimulation to healthy ears in patients with long-term unilateral hearing loss zzso 

From June 1998 to December 2009, 23 patients with serious zzso (15 left, 8 right) were recruited along with 15 matched normal hearing zzso zzso index zzso for activated zzso in primary auditory zzso zzso was zzso And the zzso outside auditory zzso were also zzso 

The data were discarded in 3 patients with zzso zzso and 1 normal subject because of head zzso All control subjects showed zzso dominant zzso of zzso in group zzso However, the group data of zzso patients showed that the zzso was more symmetrical and the zzso dominance diminished versus the control zzso As compared with normal subjects outside zzso heightened zzso in left prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior zzso zzso and left zzso was found in zzso patients while reduced zzso in left superior zzso zzso was also zzso 

The diminished zzso dominance in zzso and heightened zzso in zzso region suggest the reduction of zzso zzso and general increase in brain zzso in long-term zzso patients potentially occur as a result of functional reorganization zzso to zzso However, the reduced zzso in superior zzso zzso may be correlated with the deterioration of speech perception in these zzso
