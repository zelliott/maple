During the last decades a lot of attention has been zzso on mechanisms of zzso zzso particularly in terms of investigating vascular growth factors and zzso Recently, these efforts resulted in various approaches for zzso treatment strategies using in zzso cell culture systems as well as experimental zzso and zzso brain zzso These basic science and zzso trials need an assortment of models, which should allow investigating a variety of zzso Several objectives concerning basic zzso cell zzso characteristics can adequately be studied in zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques respect the more complex zzso and zzso interplay within a zzso zzso Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques offer a wide access to the zzso of zzso Using these zzso array or chip methods differences between zzso and zzso zzso as well as variations within the gene pool of different organ specific zzso can be zzso To zzso the zzso of the crucial interaction of human zzso with host zzso cells, zzso cells and zzso zzso animal models are zzso An essential rule is to zzso an zzso model, since zzso is organ zzso To avoid zzso responses, it is desirable to use weak or zzso zzso zzso which is best accomplished in a zzso zzso However, since rat zzso poorly resemble human zzso growth patterns, human zzso zzso into zzso animals should be zzso In zzso techniques like zzso via a zzso window or magnetic resonance imaging zzso allow for functional studies and improve the zzso of the model zzso Finally, it is essentially to recognize the limitations of each model considered and to select that model which seems to be most appropriate for the objectives to be zzso
