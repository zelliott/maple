Patient management and treatment strategies for zzso melanoma depend largely on the stage of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to compare zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect distant zzso for zzso A total of 43 patients (41 with completed zzso and zzso zzso with known American Joint Committee on Cancer zzso stage zzso zzso melanoma were examined and zzso zzso were identified by both zzso zzso CT was able to detect 522 zzso whereas zzso found 730 zzso zzso CT identified 188 pulmonary zzso compared with 143 zzso detected by zzso In zzso adrenal zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso and zzso detected the same number of zzso zzso zzso detected more zzso than zzso in liver zzso rate zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous tissue zzso muscle zzso bone zzso zzso and brain zzso zzso was modified as a consequence of zzso findings in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso detected clearly more zzso melanoma zzso in most organ systems with the exception of lung zzso More accurate and complete staging by zzso has an impact on treatment strategy in about one-quarter of the zzso
