The authors report a case of unilateral zzso zzso associated with chronic zzso studied by standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging protocol and diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso of apparent diffusion zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso and zzso were reconstructed on both healthy and zzso zzso zzso and zzso values are in agreement with the zzso zzso reconstruction of zzso zzso architecture was confirmed by zzso This result suggests the potential ability of zzso to detect structural zzso in the architecture of the zzso as zzso zzso preceding the onset of zzso zzso
