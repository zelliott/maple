zzso of the clinical experience gained since 1986 in the treatment planning of patients with brain zzso through integration of magnetic resonance imaging zzso into computerized zzso zzso three-dimensional treatment planning are zzso Data from zzso can now be fully registered with CT data using appropriate three-dimensional coordinate transformations zzso zzso display of zzso defined structures on CT zzso zzso treatment planning of composite zzso zzso zzso dose display on either CT or zzso zzso Treatment planning with zzso beam arrangements is also facilitated by zzso because of direct acquisition of information in zzso zzso zzso The advantages of this integration of information are especially evident in certain situations, for example, low grade zzso with zzso CT margins, tumors with margins obscured by bone artifact on CT zzso Target definitions have repeatedly been altered based on zzso detected abnormalities not zzso on CT zzso zzso of zzso enhancement on zzso zzso scans can be compared to the zzso CT tumor volumes, while abnormalities detected on zzso zzso scans are the counterpart of zzso zzso Generally, zzso markedly increased the apparent zzso tumor volume from that seen on zzso zzso However, CT tumor information was also necessary as it defined abnormalities not always zzso with zzso (on average, zzso of composite zzso volume seen on CT zzso In all, the integration of zzso data with CT information has been found to be practical, and often necessary, for the three-dimensional treatment of brain zzso
