zzso is a rare cause of stroke in zzso We aim here to demonstrate the diagnostic value of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for demonstrating vessel wall zzso in a child with zzso zzso 

We report here the case of an 8-year-old boy with cerebral zzso and stroke due to zzso zzso Imaging studies revealed the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso with focal zzso of the zzso artery on magnetic resonance zzso and focal zzso enhancement of the zzso artery zzso Nine months after treatment, clinical outcome was zzso with no enhancement of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso provided additional information zzso the diagnosis of zzso in a child with zzso zzso and zzso The location of vessel wall enhancement was correlated with the topography of the acute zzso and the lack of vessel zzso obstruction supported the diagnosis of zzso rather than any other zzso
