Our aim was to establish an effective zzso focal brain radiation model for research on brain zzso 

Groups of up to six rats were exposed to a range of doses from zzso zzso at 10 intervals of a 6 zzso electron zzso zzso motor functions and water maze zzso tests were performed after the zzso at two-week zzso zzso changes were detected through repeated magnetic resonance imaging zzso monthly and were compared with the zzso findings to determine if they predicted late microscopic zzso 

The development of necrosis proved to be zzso 120 zzso resulted in serious deterioration within 4 weeks in all zzso zzso necrosis in one zzso was detected 2 months after the zzso with zzso 70 zzso and 3 months after zzso zzso consistent for all zzso The Morris water maze zzso tests proved to be the most sensitive tool for the early detection of a brain functional zzso zzso screening provided useful information on the development of radiation zzso which defined the time point for zzso zzso 

The described method permits accurate dose delivery to a zzso part in one zzso of the brain for six rats at a zzso Following complex zzso a dose of 40 zzso and a follow-up time of 4 months are proposed for investigations on zzso zzso
