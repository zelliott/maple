zzso aggressiveness and response to therapy are influenced by the zzso zzso space fraction zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso may, therefore, be an important zzso zzso for cancer zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be used to assess the zzso of zzso zzso human melanoma zzso zzso zzso were used as zzso models of human zzso Images of zzso zzso is the initial extraction fraction of zzso and F is zzso and zzso (the partition zzso of zzso were obtained by zzso analysis of zzso zzso Our study was based on the hypothesis that zzso is governed by the zzso and is not influenced significantly by zzso density zzso or blood zzso To test this hypothesis, we searched for correlations between zzso and zzso zzso or zzso by comparing zzso images with zzso images, zzso preparations from the zzso tissue and the zzso zzso in zzso obtained by invasive zzso Positive correlations were found between zzso and zzso Thus, median zzso was larger in zzso tumors than in zzso tumors by a factor of zzso zzso consistent with the zzso observation that zzso is approximately fourfold larger in zzso tumors than in zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso in zzso and zzso tumors was almost identical to the zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso was larger in tissue regions with high zzso than in tissue regions with low zzso in zzso tumors zzso On the other hand, significant correlations between zzso and zzso or zzso could not be zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso series of zzso tumors provides zzso images that primarily reflect the zzso of the zzso
