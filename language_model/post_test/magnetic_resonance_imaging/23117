We employed zzso functional zzso zzso to investigate zzso and zzso differences in the zzso organization of human brain functional zzso Brain networks were first constructed by measuring zzso zzso correlations of zzso data within each zzso in 86 young, healthy, right-handed adults zzso males and 48 zzso followed by a zzso zzso The zzso networks exhibit zzso attributes zzso zzso and short zzso that are compatible with previous results in the zzso functional zzso Furthermore, we found that compared with zzso males have a higher zzso zzso zzso in the right zzso network but a lower zzso zzso in the left zzso network, suggesting a zzso zzso Moreover, we observed significant zzso differences in the regional zzso characteristics in various brain regions, such as the frontal and zzso regions zzso zzso and the zzso regions zzso zzso findings that are consistent with previous studies of brain structural and functional zzso Together, our results suggest that the zzso organization of human brain functional networks is associated with gender and zzso and they provide insights into the understanding of functional zzso underlying individual differences in behaviors and zzso
