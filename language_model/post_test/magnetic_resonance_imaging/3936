Although ultrasound is the primary imaging zzso for prenatal zzso zzso some central nervous system zzso may be better defined with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso allows us to zzso the features of brain development that were previously only seen zzso by zzso and zzso Although there are several reports of the zzso development of the zzso as revealed on magnetic resonance zzso images, systematic MR studies of zzso development during the fetal period are zzso Our objective was to use high-resolution zzso to provide a template of zzso development during the late first and early second zzso a period when the diagnosis of zzso zzso is most zzso zzso The MR findings were then correlated with zzso zzso 

Twenty-six normal zzso fetal specimens with a zzso age of 9 to 24 weeks were examined with high-resolution zzso using a conventional clinical magnet and pulse zzso The MR findings were correlated with the zzso zzso specimens zzso in a well-known fetal zzso 

Resolution of the zzso features of zzso development in fetuses greater than 10 weeks zzso age was zzso Development of the zzso lips, zzso fourth zzso roof, zzso of zzso and the zzso fissures was zzso Development of the zzso as revealed on MR images lagged behind the known stages of development by as much as 5 zzso Features of zzso zzso were beyond the resolution of zzso However, differences in signal intensity between gray and white matter of the developing zzso were detected and are zzso to represent differences in zzso and water content of the constituent zzso 

zzso correlation of MR images of fetuses during the late first and early second trimesters with zzso zzso could result in a mistaken diagnosis of delayed or abnormal development of the zzso zzso contents because of a time lag in the detection of structures on MR zzso An MR template of normal zzso development would be useful to avoid confusion of normal development with abnormal development and to identify the expected zzso features when provided the estimated zzso age of a zzso
