zzso barrier opening using focused ultrasound and zzso has been zzso established as a zzso and localized brain drug delivery zzso In this study, the zzso of the opening is assessed in the zzso zzso after the application of focused ultrasound at three different acoustic pressures and zzso zzso Using dynamic zzso zzso the transfer rates were estimated, yielding zzso maps and quantitative zzso values for a zzso region of zzso The volume of zzso barrier opening according to the zzso maps was zzso to both the pressure and the zzso zzso A zzso plateau of zzso zzso was reached at higher pressures zzso and zzso zzso for the larger sized bubbles zzso and zzso zzso which was on the same order as the zzso of the zzso muscle (no zzso Smaller bubbles zzso zzso yielded significantly lower zzso zzso A small percentage zzso of mice showed signs of damage under zzso examination, but no correlation with zzso was zzso The assessment of the zzso barrier zzso properties and their dependence on both the pressure and the zzso diameter suggests that zzso maps may constitute an in zzso tool for the zzso of the efficacy of the focused zzso zzso barrier zzso
