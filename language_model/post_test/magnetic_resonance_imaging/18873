The authors conducted a study to assess the efficacy of surgery in patients who underwent magnetic resonance zzso imaging alone for zzso of zzso in zzso lobe zzso zzso 

One hundred patients zzso men, 57 zzso with a clinical diagnosis of zzso were zzso studied zzso age 28 zzso 9 years zzso standard zzso zzso All patients underwent high-resolution MR imaging, and in all unilateral zzso zzso sclerosis zzso was diagnosed by visual zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso and in 87 patients zzso and zzso zzso zzso testing was zzso Both zzso and zzso examinations were conducted in a blinded fashion, and these data were not taken into account during the zzso decision-making zzso All patients underwent a zzso at the side of the zzso zzso outcome was rated as Class I zzso free or simple partial zzso only) or Class II zzso or zzso zzso zzso The follow-up period ranged from 18 to 48 months zzso 24 zzso 5 months zzso No patient underwent prolonged zzso monitoring, Wada testing, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso computerized zzso In zzso patients Class I results were zzso and 11 Class II results were achieved zzso There was no mortality in this zzso Except for in two patients who underwent surgery in the dominant zzso zzso there was no zzso cognitive zzso In these two patients verbal memory decline occurred, which was associated with zzso zzso cortical damage, demonstrated zzso on MR zzso Twenty-five percent of the patients experienced improved memory function related to the zzso side, and zzso experienced a zzso gain in general intelligence zzso zzso 

In patients with clinically suspected zzso MR imaging alone is able to zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso Ruling out zzso remains the only indication for prolonged zzso recordings in this group of zzso
