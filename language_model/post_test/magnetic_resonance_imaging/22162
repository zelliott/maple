zzso resonance imaging is the best imaging technique for the detection of zzso changes in the central nervous system but there are few studies detailing the zzso appearances of radiation effects following enhancement with intravenous zzso In this paper, zzso enhanced MR imaging findings were reviewed in seven patients with evidence of late radiation injury following zzso for primary head and neck zzso On zzso enhanced zzso abnormal focal areas were present in the anterior zzso zzso and zzso aspects of the frontal zzso These zzso were well defined and enhanced intensely following intravenous zzso They were present in the white matter in five patients and involved both zzso and white matter in two zzso Cystic components were present in larger zzso in three patients and mass effect was present around the enhancing zzso in four zzso All abnormalities occurred within the radiation treatment portals and corresponded to the distribution of increased signal intensity changes in the brain on zzso zzso Late zzso injury should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any intensely enhancing zzso occurring within zzso brain zzso
