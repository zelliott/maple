This study investigated the relation between cerebral damage related to multiple sclerosis zzso and cognitive decline as determined by two classical mental tracking zzso zzso damage in 15 zzso zzso patients was measured by diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were defined in the cerebral zzso zzso performance of the zzso patients was assessed with the oral response format of the zzso zzso zzso Test zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Test zzso A significant correlation was found between performance on the zzso and the fractional zzso in the zzso This correlation was predominantly induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso refers to the diffusion across fibers rather than along the fibers and is believed to be a specific marker for zzso loss and zzso associated with zzso No significant association between zzso and zzso performance was found and this negative finding was mainly attributed to zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso along the zzso diffusion direction, a possible signature of zzso white matter pathology, contributes to information processing speed as measured with the zzso a task that requires close visual tracking and a widely used clinical marker for cognitive decline in zzso
