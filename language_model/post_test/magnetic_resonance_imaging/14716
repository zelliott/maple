We present the case of a zzso male with chronic zzso zzso An zzso zzso intensity zzso was detected on zzso images at zzso obtained by zzso acid zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso remained unchanged in size but showed a high-intensity signal on zzso phase zzso zzso the zzso increased in size, and dynamic zzso zzso revealed zzso changes, suggestive of zzso zzso zzso was performed, and zzso examination of the zzso zzso revealed a zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso Cell membrane expression of zzso was detected in the zzso area, which was more densely stained than the zzso zzso We followed the clinical course of the patient, who gradually developed a green zzso which presented as an zzso zzso intensity zzso that was zzso only on zzso images obtained by zzso zzso We observed a gradual increase in size, zzso changes, and a shift to a high-intensity signal on the zzso zzso
