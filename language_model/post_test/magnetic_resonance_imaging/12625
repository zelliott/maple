With regard to hearing perception, it remains unclear as to whether, or the extent to which, different conceptual categories of real-world sounds and related zzso knowledge are zzso represented in the zzso zzso knowledge representations are reported to include the major divisions of living versus zzso things, plus more specific categories including animals, tools, biological motion, faces, and zzso typically defined by their characteristic visual zzso Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to identify brain regions showing preferential activity to four categories of action sounds, which included zzso human and animal actions zzso plus mechanical and environmental zzso actions zzso The results showed a striking zzso division in cortical representations for sounds produced by living versus zzso zzso Additionally, there were several significant differences by category, depending on whether the task was zzso zzso human or zzso versus zzso zzso zzso In general, zzso zzso sounds yielded robust zzso in the bilateral zzso superior zzso zzso independent of zzso Task demands modulated zzso of left zzso zzso regions, bilateral insular zzso and zzso regions previously implicated in zzso matching, consistent with zzso and zzso network representations zzso zzso zzso Animal action sounds zzso activated the bilateral zzso zzso zzso Mechanical sounds activated the anterior superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Environmental sounds zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Overall, this zzso zzso of networks for zzso representing distinct zzso categories provides novel support for grounded zzso models that may zzso organizational principles for hearing zzso
