Prospective zzso 

To evaluate the results of zzso management of burst fractures with intact zzso zzso complex and to investigate the effect of trauma and/or residual zzso zzso on adjacent and next adjacent zzso zzso 

Conservative treatment based on integrity of zzso zzso complex is controversial, probably because of poor evaluation by clinical and indirect zzso zzso zzso changes in the adjacent discs due to trauma and/or residual zzso zzso is a common zzso 

Fifteen consecutive patients who were intact zzso with burst fractures zzso were treated zzso with the indication based solely on the integrity of zzso zzso complex determined by zzso Correction of zzso and stabilization with a total body cast under sedation were the mainstays of zzso Patients were mobilized the next day, and casts were removed at the end of the third month follow-up period with no further external zzso Local zzso angle, zzso index, and percent of zzso of anterior body height were measured on zzso zzso third month, and latest follow-up zzso All of the zzso and latest follow-up zzso studies of the patients were obtained to examine the discs adjacent and next adjacent to the fractured zzso The zzso perceptions of the patients of function, pain and appearance were analyzed using the zzso zzso 

There were eight female and seven male patients with an average age of 28 zzso zzso zzso Average follow-up period was 31 zzso zzso zzso Average local zzso angle was found to be zzso degrees zzso degrees ) after zzso It was corrected to 5 degrees zzso zzso degrees ) and deteriorated to zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees ) at the third month and to 17 degrees zzso zzso degrees ) at the final follow-up zzso There was a similar tendency for both zzso index and percent anterior body zzso The zzso zzso analysis revealed changes in the shape of the discs zzso or zzso into the zzso with no change in the signal intensity of nucleus zzso in eight of the zzso and four of the zzso adjacent zzso On follow-up zzso there was only one intact disc with a normal shape zzso All others had height loss, but only one had complete loss of signal zzso zzso two additional discs had changes in shape without any gross changes in signal intensity of nucleus zzso whereas two had changes in signal intensity without change in zzso Only two of the next adjacent discs had changes in shape or signal intensity at the time of injury or at latest follow-up zzso Average score of function, pain, and appearance were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, at the latest follow-up zzso All patients were back at work in zzso zzso zzso months on average and all were satisfied with their zzso 

The present study revealed that an intact zzso zzso complex might not prevent loss of correction gained by zzso management of burst zzso zzso loss occurs in the first 3 months despite external zzso However, the magnitude of residual zzso usually remains close to the initial zzso Although changes in the shape of adjacent discs occur due to trauma and/or natural course, significant loss in signal intensity of nucleus zzso is zzso Patient outcome seems to be highly satisfactory despite residual zzso
