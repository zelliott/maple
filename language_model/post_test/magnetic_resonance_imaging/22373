A zzso modeling approach for examining dynamic relationship between multiple brain regions was proposed in Ho, zzso and Shumway zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso to zzso Brain zzso to zzso in zzso zzso Their approach assumed that the quantity representing the influence of one zzso system over another, or effective zzso is zzso However, more and more empirical evidence suggests that the connectivity between brain areas may be dynamic which calls for zzso modeling of effective zzso A zzso approach is proposed to solve this problem in this zzso Our approach first zzso the observed time series into measurement error and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To capture the complexities of the dynamic processes in the brain, zzso zzso are subsequently zzso as a linear function of the zzso signals history at other brain zzso The zzso in these linear functions represent effective connectivity between the regions under zzso They are further assumed to follow a random walk process so to characterize the dynamic nature of brain zzso We also consider the zzso dependence that may be present in the measurement zzso zzso method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis zzso zzso Springer, New York) was employed to estimate the zzso in the model and zzso factor was used to compare among competing zzso zzso zzso of the effective connectivity zzso was based on their zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso credible regions zzso zzso Louis, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for Data Analysis zzso zzso Chapman and Hall, Boca zzso The proposed method was applied to a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set and results support the theory of zzso control network and demonstrate that this network is dynamic in zzso
