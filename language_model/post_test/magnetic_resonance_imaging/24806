zzso volume of gray matter zzso was observed in zzso loss in patients with neurodegenerative zzso However, zzso volume has not yet been investigated in isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso investigated the volume change of gray matter of an zzso boy by zzso analysis of magnetic resonance images zzso zzso and compared with that of 20 zzso healthy zzso zzso boy presented a significant decrease in zzso volume in the zzso cortex, anterior zzso cortex, middle zzso cortex, thalamus, insular cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso middle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No significant zzso volume increase was detected in other brain zzso The pattern of zzso zzso was similar as previous literature zzso Our results identified similar zzso volume zzso regardless of the causes of zzso zzso zzso zzso volume was not only shown in zzso bulbs, zzso tracts and zzso zzso also in primary zzso zzso and the secondary cerebral zzso areas in zzso zzso This is the first study to evaluate zzso volume zzso in zzso zzso
