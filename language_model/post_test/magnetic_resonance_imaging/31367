To investigate any correlation between zzso and brain gray matter volume, we analyzed zzso healthy Japanese subjects by applying zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso using brain magnetic resonance zzso imaging, which enables a global analysis of brain structure without a zzso identification of a region of zzso 

We collected brain MR images from zzso men and zzso women, and their zzso weight, and other clinical zzso The collected images were automatically zzso into a common standard space for an objective assessment of zzso correlations in zzso analysis and zzso with zzso 

zzso analysis revealed a significant negative correlation in men zzso zzso zzso adjusting for age, lifetime alcohol zzso history of hypertension, and diabetes zzso although not in women, between zzso and the gray matter ratio, which represents the percentage of gray matter volume in the zzso zzso zzso revealed that, in men, the regional gray matter volume of the bilateral zzso zzso zzso anterior lobe of the zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso and zzso showed significant negative correlations with zzso while those of the bilateral inferior frontal zzso zzso lobe of the zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso heads showed significant positive correlations with zzso 

Global loss and regional zzso in gray matter volume occur in obese male subjects, suggesting that male subjects with a high zzso are at greater risk for future declines in zzso or other brain zzso
