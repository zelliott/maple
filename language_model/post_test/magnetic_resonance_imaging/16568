zzso nerve fiber layer zzso loss occurs with zzso or after zzso zzso Acute zzso zzso at presentation and changes over time have not been well zzso We analyzed regional zzso changes using 2 methods, zzso zzso zzso zzso and scanning laser zzso zzso to study initial zzso and early zzso zzso 

40 subjects with unilateral acute zzso zzso had prospective zzso and zzso zzso thickness values organized into 4 zzso We compared affected with normal fellow and control eyes to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso of 95th zzso of zzso and thinning zzso zzso less than fellow zzso at zzso 1 and 3 zzso 

zzso zzso occurred in zzso eyes zzso by zzso and in zzso eyes zzso by zzso at zzso At 1 month, zzso zzso was common even as thinning developed in zzso zzso of eyes by zzso and in zzso eyes zzso by zzso At 3 months, zzso was zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and by zzso in zzso zzso affected eyes zzso Neither zzso zzso nerve zzso nor vision at baseline correlated with optical image findings or vision zzso 

zzso zzso most likely due to zzso stasis from blockade at the zzso site in zzso zzso is seen with zzso better than zzso zzso swelling in some zzso and loss in others occur at 1 month and is well seen with zzso comparison by both zzso zzso imaging provides zzso as well as quantitative information regarding zzso zzso
