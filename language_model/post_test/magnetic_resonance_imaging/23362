The functional network zzso of the adult human brain has recently begun to be zzso mapped using zzso functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and described using mathematical tools originating from graph zzso Previous studies have revealed the existence of zzso connected brain regions, so called cortical zzso which act as information convergence zones and supposedly capture key aspects of how the zzso architecture supports human behavior and how it is affected by zzso In this study, we present results showing that cortical hubs and their associated cortical networks are largely confined to primary sensory and motor brain regions in the infant zzso Our findings in infants stand in stark contrast to the situation found in adults where the majority of cortical hubs and zzso networks are located in zzso association zzso Our findings suggest that the functional network architecture in infants is linked to support tasks that are of a zzso zzso
