The objective was to zzso study zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

Twelve patients (six women and six zzso mean age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso who presented with zzso as documented by zzso examination underwent CT zzso or both CT and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso evaluated the images and determined the location, size, margin, internal zzso or signal intensity, contrast enhancement, and pattern for each zzso Additionally, the presence of poorly enhanced areas, upstream main pancreatic duct zzso zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso tissue zzso were zzso Images were zzso to surgical and zzso zzso 

zzso were distributed throughout the zzso zzso zzso body, zzso and tail, zzso The tumor size ranged from zzso to zzso zzso with an average size of zzso zzso Eight zzso masses were ill zzso and seven zzso were partially zzso Twelve zzso masses showed zzso and poorly enhanced zzso The zzso showed weak zzso moderate zzso or intense zzso progressive zzso The diameter of zzso in six patients ranged from zzso to zzso zzso with an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso In 10 patients zzso masses invaded the zzso zzso Two patients had zzso liver disease at zzso 

zzso typically presented as an zzso zzso mass with a poorly enhanced area, zzso zzso and zzso tissue zzso Lack of pancreatic zzso and mild zzso zzso were also distinct from common duct pancreatic zzso
