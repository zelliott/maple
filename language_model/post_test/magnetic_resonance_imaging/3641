In this study the zzso of plasma protein zzso onto zzso zzso iron oxide zzso particles have been analyzed and compared to previously published kinetic studies on polystyrene particles zzso zzso zzso zzso and solid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are commonly used as magnetic resonance imaging zzso enhancers for tumor imaging as well as in drug delivery zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso has been used to determine the plasma protein zzso onto the zzso zzso iron oxide zzso The results indicate that the existence of a zzso effect, a displacement of previously zzso abundant zzso such as zzso or zzso respectively, on zzso particles has to be zzso Previously, identical findings have been reported for zzso zzso Furthermore, the protein zzso zzso differs dramatically from that of other solid drug delivery systems zzso zzso More relevant for the in zzso fate of long circulating particles is the protein zzso after several minutes or even zzso Interestingly, the patterns received after an incubation time of zzso zzso to 240 zzso are found to be zzso and zzso zzso This leads to the assumption of a zzso zzso protein zzso around the iron oxide zzso
