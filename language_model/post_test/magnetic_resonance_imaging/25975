The zzso zzso zzso is an accessory bone of the foot localized zzso to the lateral zzso of zzso It is usually an zzso zzso However, particular activities such as ballet, soccer, or football may cause repeated stress and chronic zzso to the zzso resulting in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is typically localized anterior to the Achilles zzso zzso diagnosis may be very difficult because other conditions may show the same zzso zzso can only demonstrate the zzso zzso and its zzso changes, while MR imaging can also depict associated soft tissue zzso We report on 9 cases of zzso zzso zzso syndrome studied with MR zzso 

Nine patients with the zzso zzso zzso syndrome were submitted to zzso All the examinations were performed with the patients in zzso zzso with the injured foot in neutral position and then in forced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso SE, zzso GE and zzso images were zzso We evaluated zzso zzso location and shape, signal intensity of bone, zzso and adjacent soft zzso and possible associated zzso zzso 

No changes were found in the zzso zzso location and zzso Signal intensity changes were seen in zzso zzso zzso a small area of very high signal intensity, due to zzso was depicted on the zzso aspect in 1 zzso a zzso spot of slightly increased signal intensity, with a zzso zzso was seen on the zzso aspect in another zzso zzso of the zzso zzso between the accessory zzso bone and the zzso zzso aspect was observed in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was associated in zzso zzso zzso with irregular bone margins and zzso spots within the cartilage was found in 3 zzso Finally, fluid zzso surrounding the zzso zzso and adjacent soft zzso was always zzso 

The zzso zzso syndrome may result from chronic zzso Indeed, forced zzso zzso may cause zzso zzso zzso between the zzso aspect of the zzso zzso and the zzso with disruption of the zzso with the lateral zzso of zzso Joint inflammation may be associated with possible development of zzso Other possible complications are related to vascular changes which may lead to bone zzso Furthermore, the particular anatomical site of the zzso zzso may sometimes cause zzso to the zzso zzso zzso tendon, resulting in severe zzso MR imaging allows complete zzso assessment because it depicts the margins and the signal intensity of bone and ligaments on the 3 spatial zzso zzso zzso zzso images best demonstrate the cartilage changes indicating zzso zzso This condition may cause abnormal mobility of the accessory bone with possible zzso with the zzso aspect of the zzso or zzso due to zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisitions are particularly useful in this condition because they can demonstrate the mechanism of zzso
