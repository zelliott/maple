If chemotherapy is to be effective against bone zzso the zzso agents must reach all tumor cells in effective zzso Although many clinical trials include studies of the zzso of these agents in blood or zzso fluid, there have been no accurate or widely zzso methods of determining whether zzso agents reach all regions of a solid zzso This review discusses the use of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess the zzso and zzso of bone zzso zzso studies provide a means of exploring leakage of contrast agent into tumor zzso zzso zzso spaces zzso In clinical observations of numerous series of patients with bone zzso measures of contrast zzso zzso have convincingly demonstrated a relationship with measures and predictions of the zzso response to zzso zzso The results of these studies have indicated that greater access at the time of zzso greater decrease in access during therapy, and low access at the completion of zzso therapy zzso to better response and longer zzso zzso Although questions remain about how these novel dynamic imaging methods can best be used to measure drug access zzso we are optimistic that such measures can be developed to reflect the range of biological variation within and between naturally occurring solid zzso
