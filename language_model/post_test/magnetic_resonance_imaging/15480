To date, functional zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to report the time courses of few zzso primarily zzso zzso from the sensitivity offered by zzso magnetic field (7 zzso the zzso of 17 zzso were measured in the human visual zzso during two zzso of visual stimulation lasting zzso and zzso zzso zzso concentration changes of approximately zzso zzso were observed for several zzso zzso increased by zzso zzso zzso increased by zzso zzso whereas zzso decreased by zzso zzso zzso concentration also zzso a tendency to decrease during zzso zzso The zzso concentration reached the new zzso level within the first minute of zzso and came back to baseline only after the stimulus zzso The changes of the concentration of zzso implied a rise in zzso metabolism to a new zzso level during zzso and indicated that zzso zzso is affected by zzso zzso likely because of an increased flux through the zzso zzso
