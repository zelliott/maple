To evaluate the mechanisms of failure of blood zzso zzso zzso imaging in stroke, we compared the evoked cerebral blood zzso zzso responses and zzso volumes zzso of zzso functional zzso zzso in chronic stroke patients with moderate and severe cerebral zzso 

We measured the evoked zzso responses in the primary zzso zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso during zzso motor zzso We compared the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso status as moderate zzso reduction of regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reserve capacity zzso or severe (marked reduction of regional cerebral blood flow and zzso zzso misery zzso 

In zzso controls, zzso concentration decreased with zzso increases in zzso and total zzso zzso during zzso The zzso on the zzso side exhibited a normal zzso response zzso On the zzso side, moderate cerebral zzso did not affect the zzso response pattern, but severe cerebral zzso caused an increase of zzso during the task, associated with increases of zzso and total zzso zzso cerebral zzso induced only a slight reduction of the zzso on the zzso side; however, severe cerebral zzso markedly reduced the zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso signal did not change in some areas of the zzso on the zzso side in severe cerebral zzso whereas it tended to decrease in other areas during the zzso 

zzso zzso caused a marked reduction of the zzso on zzso imaging, associated with an increase of zzso concentration during zzso zzso investigations of stroke patients should be performed while giving consideration to baseline circulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso could be an alternative means to assess the zzso
