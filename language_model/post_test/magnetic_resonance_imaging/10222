Joint instability was believed to be the main cause of zzso following zzso zzso zzso However, sudden high impact load through zzso cartilage onto zzso bone may also cause zzso zzso 

We asked whether early zzso changes following zzso impact may be depicted using zzso on zzso zzso to contribute to a more detailed understanding of degenerative processes of joint zzso 

zzso impacts were applied to zzso zzso of 12 zzso mature beagle dogs zzso zzso zzso using a drop zzso zzso of impact areas were sampled after 6 months and processed for standard light zzso on zzso sections and for zzso for collagen type I zzso zzso type II zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso Gross zzso and zzso on zzso were documented using a zzso zzso system, compared to healthy controls and to standard light zzso 

Four zzso showed almost entirely zzso zzso four appeared to be of preserved zzso zzso with only minor signs of zzso zzso and four showed preserved zzso zzso We found decrease in zzso II and zzso expression in highly degenerative specimens as well as increase of zzso I zzso Increased zzso I expression in the zzso zzso could even be depicted in specimens with intact zzso zzso 

Observations suggest that joint zzso causes early zzso changes after 6 zzso zzso network disruption seems to lead to zzso loss, although other researchers found isolated zzso loss without zzso of zzso II using zzso in zzso zzso This is the first study on effects of zzso impact using zzso on zzso zzso
