zzso muscles are complications of zzso surgery that are encountered more frequently after zzso of the inferior and zzso zzso zzso 

We obtained zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of 10 orbits of 6 normal subjects, 9 orbits of 5 patients with zzso eye disease, and 4 orbits of 2 patients with zzso eye disease on the day after zzso muscle zzso using a suspension zzso The arc of contact and the distance between the zzso and the point of zzso of each of the zzso muscles to the globe were measured in primary position as well as in the zzso zzso 

The data confirm that the inferior and zzso zzso muscles have a significantly smaller wraparound effect on the globe than the superior and lateral zzso muscles, respectively zzso zzso for the vertical zzso zzso P zzso for the horizontal zzso muscles, paired zzso zzso and that their insertions may be found several zzso zzso to their points of zzso in extreme rotation of the globe in their respective field of zzso The appearance of the suspended recessed inferior zzso muscle on the first zzso day and its decreased zzso to the globe raise concerns about the muscle losing contact with the globe in extreme zzso 

The small wraparound effect of the inferior and zzso zzso muscles may explain one of the mechanisms accounting for the increased zzso of slipped muscles encountered after zzso of these zzso
