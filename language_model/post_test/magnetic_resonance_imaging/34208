To observe the evolution of zzso zzso tissue zzso in obese zzso children, who did not change their degree of obesity during adolescence and to evaluate its relationship with zzso risk indexes zzso 

zzso study of 16 obese adolescents zzso male and eight zzso in whom relative body weight zzso did not change significantly and zzso development was completed during the study zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso scan at zzso level zzso three times during a 4 y zzso At zzso and at four years zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso did not differ significantly over the three measurement times and showed significant correlations between first and second zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso first and third zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and second and third values zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso increased significantly from zzso to third evaluation zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso correlated significantly with lipids zzso and LDL cholesterol r zzso zzso P zzso zzso while at the end of the study, zzso correlated positively with insulin zzso insulin r zzso zzso P zzso zzso insulin area after oral zzso tolerance test zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso with high density zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso achieved before zzso and stable during adolescence, showed a relatively stable amount of zzso In post zzso children the relationship of zzso to clinically significant risk factors resemble the pattern in obese zzso
