The purpose of this prospective study was to review, using expanded clinical assessment tools, the initial use of a zzso interference screw zzso zzso D, L zzso in anterior cruciate ligament zzso reconstruction at the zzso Hospital, zzso The study enlisted 32 patients of whom 28 were available for follow-up at minimum of zzso zzso Since the implant material was new and the screw would not show on plain film zzso the clinical assessment was expanded beyond the usual historical and physical zzso The evaluation included opportunistic knee joint aspiration and repeat magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies to investigate the longevity of the implant and potential adverse effects of this new zzso zzso The knee joint aspirations showed no zzso zzso zzso showed the physical presence of the screw to remain intact for 4 months and disappear in 6 zzso The zzso showed minimal collection of zzso around the bone tunnels that resolved by 12 zzso There were no symptoms or adverse clinical result correlated with the zzso evidence of zzso There was temporary bone tunnel zzso The clinical results were zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso excellent and good results, zzso fair results and zzso poor zzso The average score was zzso points zzso 63 to 100 zzso The knee joint stability measured with the zzso zzso showed zzso to have a zzso or less difference compared with the zzso zzso This zzso interference screw appeared safe and effective for fixation of bone blocks during zzso reconstruction while producing no zzso infection or adverse clinical response during the degradation zzso
