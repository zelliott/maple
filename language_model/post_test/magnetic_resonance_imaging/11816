zzso weighted magnetic resonance imaging zzso represents a recent development that extends imaging from the depiction of the zzso into the field of functional and zzso zzso zzso measures a fundamentally different zzso zzso than conventional zzso Image contrast is related to differences in the microscopic motion zzso of water molecules within brain tissue rather than a change in total tissue zzso zzso zzso can reveal pathology where conventional zzso and zzso MR images are zzso zzso has clinically proven its value in the assessment of acute cerebral stroke and trauma by showing cerebral injury early due to ist ability to discriminate between zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Full zzso zzso allows to calculate a variety of functional zzso the most widely used maps include maps of apparent diffusion zzso and zzso zzso In addition maps of zzso diffusion can be calculated which are believed to give information about the integrity and location of fiber zzso This zzso information will most probably play an increasingly important role in the early detection of primary and secondary tissue injury from various reasons and could guide and validate current and future zzso zzso
