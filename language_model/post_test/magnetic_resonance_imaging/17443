zzso zzso especially memory performance, is known to be impaired in patients with zzso growth hormone zzso zzso and growth hormone substitution has been found to counteract this memory zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imagining zzso data acquired during a working memory task in 13 zzso zzso patients were compared with 13 age, sex and education level matched healthy zzso zzso demonstrated that there is no difference in the quality of the performance in the working memory task between zzso patients and control zzso However, memory speed was found to be zzso in zzso zzso mood, patients reported more complaints of fatigue, and less zzso Imaging data showed that patients had increased activity in zzso prefrontal cortex, anterior zzso cortex, zzso cortex, supplementary motor and motor cortex, as well as in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso task load was also associated with an increase in brain activity in similar areas in patients compared to control zzso In conclusion, this zzso study shows that zzso patients have a zzso memory speed, but no impaired quality of memory performance, which may be due to zzso recruitment of zzso prefrontal brain zzso These findings indicate that the zzso axis contributes to prefrontal functioning in patients with zzso
