To increase zzso stimulation from zzso to a fixed zzso level and to assess patient acceptance of the degree of peripheral nerve stimulation zzso at magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

Two hundred ten patients underwent MR imaging of various body regions according to clinical zzso An additional three-dimensional fast zzso shot sequence with the zzso stimulation level was zzso A patient questionnaire was distributed after MR imaging to document the presence, degree, and location of zzso Degree was measured with an zzso scale zzso range, zzso Age was analyzed between the sexes for significant statistical zzso Furthermore, correlation between location of examination and location and degree of stimulation was zzso To determine stimulation discomfort relative to other factors typically present at MR imaging, the degree of discomfort due to room temperature, size of magnet zzso acoustic noise, examination time, and heating sensation was determined for comparison, as zzso 

Thirty-five zzso patients reported a stimulation sensation during imaging in one or more locations, while six zzso felt very uncomfortable local stimulation zzso of zzso No significant difference between male and female patients regarding age, sex, and appearance or degree of stimulation sensation could be zzso No significant correlation between location of examination and location and degree of stimulation was zzso Compared with other side effects, zzso was considered relatively zzso 

The zzso zzso stimulation level seems acceptable for routine clinical imaging with this zzso system, since only zzso of patients experienced very uncomfortable local zzso
