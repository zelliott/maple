To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso total zzso compounds zzso in zzso zzso from benign zzso and zzso to zzso the relationship of zzso levels in zzso breast zzso with their zzso zzso 

A prospective study of zzso zzso MRS was performed following dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 61 women using a 3 T MR zzso All zzso zzso were zzso for characteristics of zzso zzso zzso and zzso peak heights at zzso zzso MRS that were zzso above zzso zzso the zzso in selected zzso zzso was zzso by calculating the area under the curve, and a zzso concentration equal to or greater than the zzso value was considered to represent zzso The relationship between zzso in invasive zzso zzso zzso and their Bloom & Richardson grading of zzso was zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso 42 zzso and 15 zzso were zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso of predicting zzso were 100, zzso zzso and zzso respectively, using zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, using zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso for receiver operating characteristic zzso curve was zzso The relationship between zzso levels in zzso breast zzso with their zzso zzso was not statistically significant zzso 

Good correlation between zzso zzso and zzso enables zzso zzso MRS to be used as a clinically zzso simple, yet zzso tool for improved specificity and diagnostic accuracy in detecting breast zzso
