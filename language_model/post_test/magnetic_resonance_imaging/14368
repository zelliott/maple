Many MR flow imaging techniques that have been successfully applied in the carotid arteries and zzso circulation have been tested in the peripheral and abdominal zzso The results have been zzso The lack of success can be attributed to different imaging requirements as well as different patterns of blood zzso These requirements include a large field of view, sensitivity to a wide range of blood flow zzso and complex flow directions, and suppression of overlapping vascular structures and stationary zzso We have designed strategies using phase contrast MR zzso zzso for imaging the arteries and veins of the lower zzso and the abdominal zzso in normal zzso This strategy takes advantage of the zzso flow pattern present in normal zzso Overlapping blood flow and stationary tissue were suppressed by a combination of spatial zzso zzso of the zzso and duration of the zzso sensitive zzso and zzso zzso
