This study aimed at developing a new automatic zzso zzso for human knee cartilage volume zzso from magnetic resonance images zzso Imaging was performed using a zzso scanner and a knee zzso and the exam consisted of a zzso sequence which contrasts cartilage and soft zzso including the zzso zzso The zzso was developed on zzso zzso images in which the zzso interface for the zzso and zzso was segmented by an independent zzso process, giving a zzso surface of the zzso zzso the MR images are zzso in the neighborhood of the bone zzso zzso by using texture analysis techniques zzso by zzso the cartilage is zzso as a bright and homogeneous zzso This process of excluding soft zzso enables the detection of the external boundary of the zzso zzso a technology based on a zzso decision criterion enables the automatic separation of the cartilage and zzso zzso Finally, the cartilage volume and changes in volume for an individual between visits was assessed using the developed zzso zzso included first, for nine knee zzso patients, a comparison of the cartilage volume and changes over time between the developed automatic system and a validated zzso cartilage volume system, and second, for five knee zzso patients, a zzso zzso Data revealed excellent zzso correlations and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the global knee zzso zzso median zzso for the zzso zzso zzso median zzso and the zzso zzso zzso median zzso Very good similarity between the automatic and zzso methods in regard to cartilage loss was also found for the global knee zzso zzso as well as for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso revealed an excellent measurement error of zzso for the global knee and zzso for the zzso In conclusion, the newly developed fully automatic method described zzso provides accurate and precise zzso of knee cartilage volume and will be a valuable tool for clinical follow-up zzso
