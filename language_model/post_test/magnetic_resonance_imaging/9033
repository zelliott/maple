While the role of left prefrontal zzso in reasoning tasks has long been zzso the role of right prefrontal zzso remains zzso One patient study zzso zzso Tierney, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso specialization in human prefrontal zzso for resolving certain and uncertain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has suggested that right prefrontal zzso plays an essential role in resolving indeterminate zzso To test this hypothesis, and to identify the involvement of specific regions within right prefrontal zzso we scanned 17 normal volunteers with zzso while they engaged in a zzso zzso task involving zzso and indeterminate zzso The results show a nice crossover interaction such that, right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso is selectively activated by the processing of indeterminate trials with no zzso cues, while left lateral prefrontal zzso zzso zzso is selectively activated by the processing of indeterminate trials containing zzso zzso These results are not only consistent with, but also amplify, the zzso data by identifying specific regions within right and left prefrontal zzso
