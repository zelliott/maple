The aim of this study was to compare structure measures obtained from high-resolution MR images of the zzso and the zzso radius with bone mineral density zzso of the spine and hip in the prediction of zzso spine fracture zzso zzso MR images of the zzso and radius were obtained in 24 zzso women with spine fractures and 22 zzso zzso Imaging was performed at zzso T using a zzso zzso sequence zzso thickness 1 zzso zzso spatial resolution 195 zzso 195 zzso zzso analysis was performed using parameters analogous to standard zzso Bone mineral density of the spine was obtained using quantitative CT and of the hip with zzso X-ray zzso zzso differences between both patient groups were obtained with zzso and all structure parameters ( zzso Using receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the diagnostic performance in zzso both groups, the best results were found for zzso of the spine, one of the zzso structure measures and a combination of the zzso structure zzso In this study zzso of the spine and structure measures of the zzso radius were best suited to predict the zzso fracture status of the zzso A combination of zzso and structure measures did not yield any additional information on fracture zzso
