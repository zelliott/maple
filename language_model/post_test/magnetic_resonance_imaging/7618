zzso zzso tissue damage in zzso multiple sclerosis zzso both acutely and zzso but its severity is difficult to evaluate with conventional zzso zzso In mice with experimental allergic zzso zzso a model of zzso we administered ultra small particles of iron oxide to track zzso inflammation during the onset zzso and recovery zzso of disease activity using high field zzso We performed zzso texture analysis, a sensitive measure of tissue zzso and zzso assessment both in zzso zzso and the control zzso and measured spinal zzso zzso We found that inflammation was 3 times more remarkable at onset than at recovery of zzso in zzso yet zzso appeared similar across animals and disease zzso In zzso zzso texture was more zzso zzso was zzso and spinal zzso volume was greater in zzso than in controls, but only zzso texture was worse at zzso than at zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso texture correlated with spinal zzso volume and tended to correlate with the extent of disability in zzso While subject to further confirmation, our findings may suggest the sensitivity of zzso texture analysis for zzso zzso
