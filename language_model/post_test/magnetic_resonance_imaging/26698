zzso zzso zzso zzso is a lifelong disorder that prevents typically developing individuals from acquiring basic musical zzso zzso evidence indicates that zzso zzso is related to a musical pitch deficit that does not seem to arise from a dysfunction of the auditory zzso but rather from an anomaly along a zzso auditory zzso In order to better zzso the neural basis of this pitch disorder, here we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso adults and zzso zzso controls were scanned while passively listening to zzso zzso sequences in which the pitch distance between consecutive tones was varied zzso In both zzso and controls, brain activity increased as a function of increasing pitch distance, even for fine pitch changes, in both the left and right auditory zzso These results support prior zzso work showing that the auditory zzso of zzso individuals responds normally to zzso In contrast, the right inferior frontal zzso showed an abnormal zzso in the zzso group, as well as reduced connectivity with the auditory zzso as compared with zzso These zzso data are highly consistent with previous gray and white matter anomalies found in zzso in the auditory and inferior frontal zzso as well as reduced white matter connections between these 2 zzso
