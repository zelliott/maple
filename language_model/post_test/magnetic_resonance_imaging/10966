In a series of in zzso and in zzso experiments, we evaluated the feasibility of zzso three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso mapping zzso data to guide real-time left zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso of the scarred zzso typically using an zzso zzso zzso zzso might facilitate this procedure by zzso this zzso zzso 

A custom program was employed to integrate zzso zzso zzso with real-time zzso Initially, a plastic model of the zzso was used to determine the optimal zzso zzso To determine the in zzso accuracy of the registration process, zzso zzso were directed at zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso within normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, this image integration strategy was assessed in a zzso zzso model zzso zzso 6) by targeting zzso zzso to the zzso zzso 

The in zzso experiments revealed that registration of the zzso alone results in inaccurate alignment due primarily to rotation along the zzso long zzso zzso of the zzso in the registration process zzso this zzso In the iron oxide injection experiments, the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso In the zzso zzso model, the zzso could be reliably zzso to the zzso valve zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso situated at the zzso zzso 

These data suggest that registration of zzso magnetic resonance images with real-time mapping is sufficiently accurate to guide zzso zzso manipulation in a reliable and clinically relevant zzso
