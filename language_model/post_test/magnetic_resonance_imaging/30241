To determine the prevalence of sleep zzso zzso and zzso syndrome zzso in patients with zzso and correlate zzso with clinical, laboratory, and zzso zzso 

Prospective and zzso study of 24 patients with active zzso evaluated by clinical and laboratory zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso 

Out of 24 patients, 21 had zzso zzso of which 20 zzso had the zzso zzso zzso Median age of these 21 patients was 54 years zzso zzso and median estimated disease duration was 60 months zzso zzso The frequency in zzso patients of impaired zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso and hypertension was 19, zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found in 10 patients zzso and obesity in 18 zzso Median zzso level was 14 zzso zzso and median zzso zzso above the upper limit of normal range of zzso was zzso zzso to zzso The prevalence of zzso was zzso zzso index zzso correlated significantly with age, waist zzso body mass index, and zzso zzso The zzso was significantly higher in patients with hypertension and zzso 

The prevalence of zzso and zzso in zzso was similar to the one previously described in other zzso Age was a significant risk factor, and hypertension and zzso were significantly associated complications of zzso zzso was also significantly related to zzso as a risk factor, a complication or zzso Overall, zzso parameters by zzso did not correlate with zzso
