The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of zzso MR imaging for diagnosing partial anterior cruciate ligament zzso tears and to determine if patients could be zzso as having stable or unstable partial zzso tears on the basis of criteria of zzso MR zzso 

We reviewed zzso patients who, over a zzso period, underwent both MR imaging of the knee and zzso evaluation of the zzso According to zzso examination, these patients had 143 normal zzso 67 complete zzso tears, and 28 partial zzso The 28 partial tears included 20 stable tears (no zzso zzso and eight unstable partial tears having zzso zzso or requiring zzso zzso zzso The zzso MR images were zzso reviewed by two interpreters who were unaware of the zzso findings, and decisions were reached by zzso The zzso was classified according to its zzso zzso and zzso 

By zzso MR imaging criteria, we found 109 elliptical zzso 45 attenuated zzso three zzso with increased zzso signal intensity, six isolated zzso bundle signs, 19 zzso that could not be zzso and 56 zzso mass zzso zzso normal zzso and stable partial tears were difficult to distinguish reliably on zzso MR zzso zzso partial zzso tears could not be distinguished from complete zzso zzso However, using zzso MR imaging, our observers were able to segregate stable zzso zzso ligaments and stable partial zzso from unstable zzso zzso partial tears and complete zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging of the zzso may provide important diagnostic information for patients who have zzso zzso On zzso MR images, stable zzso were zzso zzso or showed as areas of increased zzso signal zzso At zzso attenuated zzso represented normal zzso zzso and stable partial tears zzso On zzso MR images, the zzso that indicated unstable ligaments were isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
