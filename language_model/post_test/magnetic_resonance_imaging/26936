the aim of this study was to assess muscle torque, total volume, and zzso area, and lower limb function of the zzso muscle in women with unilateral zzso pain syndrome zzso 

zzso women with unilateral zzso pain participated in the study, with each subject acting as their own internal control by using the unaffected zzso zzso muscle zzso was measured with the zzso zzso The total volume and zzso area zzso of the zzso muscle were measured by using magnetic resonance zzso Lower limb function was assessed by hop and zzso zzso 

there was a significant difference in the total volume zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso area zzso zzso zzso of the zzso muscle between affected and unaffected zzso There was a significant difference in the peak zzso of the zzso muscle at zzso between affected and unaffected sides zzso zzso zzso There were significant correlations between zzso largest zzso and volume on the affected side zzso zzso zzso and on the unaffected side zzso zzso zzso There were significant negative correlations between the smallest zzso and the peak zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso zzso on the affected zzso 

decreased torque, total volume, and zzso of the zzso muscle are presented in unilateral with zzso although cause or effect cannot be zzso Large prospective zzso studies are needed to detect the changes in the muscle structure and to establish whether these features are a cause of zzso
