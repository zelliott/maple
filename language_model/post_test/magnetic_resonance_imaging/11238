The prefrontal zzso supports many cognitive abilities, which humans share to some degree with zzso The specialized functions of the prefrontal zzso depend both on the nature of its zzso from other brain regions and on distinctive aspects of local zzso We used functional zzso to compare prefrontal activity between monkey and human subjects when they viewed identical images of objects, either intact or zzso Visual zzso zzso of the lateral prefrontal zzso was observed in both species, but was stronger in monkeys than in humans, both in magnitude zzso zzso and in spatial extent zzso or more as a percentage of prefrontal zzso This difference was observed for two different stimulus sets, at two field strengths, and over a range of zzso These results suggest that there may be more zzso control over visual processing in humans than in zzso
