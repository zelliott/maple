With anatomical magnetic resonance imaging, the signal intensity of the zzso tract zzso at the level of the internal capsule is often paradoxically similar to that of zzso zzso As shown previously in zzso studies, this is likely due to the presence of very large zzso We measured the apparent zzso density zzso of the putative zzso zzso in a large cohort of adolescents zzso zzso zzso aged zzso zzso We tested the following zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso shows a zzso asymmetry that is, in turn, related to hand zzso zzso the maturation of the zzso during adolescence differs between both zzso due to the influence of zzso zzso variations in zzso in the zzso reflect zzso differences in manual zzso We confirmed the first two zzso Thus, we found a strong left zzso right zzso asymmetry in zzso that was, on average, less marked in the 40 left-handed zzso zzso zzso in the zzso increased with age in adolescent males but not zzso and this was particularly related to rising plasma levels of testosterone in male zzso This finding is compatible with the idea that testosterone influences zzso zzso rather than zzso The third zzso namely that of a relationship between age-related changes in manual skills and maturation of the zzso was not zzso We conclude that the zzso asymmetry of the zzso may reflect an early established asymmetry in the number of large zzso zzso in the zzso
