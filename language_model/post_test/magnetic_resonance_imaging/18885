We studied the possibility of objective diagnosis of zzso zzso through zzso findings by evaluating cerebral and zzso zzso in magnetic resonance images of patients with zzso A statistically significant difference was seen in the zzso area index zzso and the zzso area index zzso of healthy elderly zzso zzso analysis with these two indexes demonstrated a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso with an overall accuracy of zzso Multiple zzso analysis with zzso and zzso by stage of zzso showed an overall accuracy of zzso for discrimination of four zzso These results indicate that quantitative magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be used as an objective diagnostic technique for zzso zzso
