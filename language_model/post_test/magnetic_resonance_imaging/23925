To seek neural sources of zzso zzso zzso brain zzso related to rare target stimuli detection in auditory and visual oddball tasks were zzso using a high zzso resolution functional zzso zzso There were multiple zzso specific and zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso were seen in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso superior zzso planes while visual specific zzso were seen in the bilateral zzso zzso and their junctions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were seen in multiple areas including the bilateral zzso and zzso association areas, bilateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral zzso areas, bilateral supplementary motor areas and anterior zzso zzso zzso were consistent with previous zzso evoked potential recording studies, and supported the multiple generator theory of the zzso zzso zzso
