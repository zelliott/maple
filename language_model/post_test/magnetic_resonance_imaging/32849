zzso between zzso and benign zzso on the basis of MR images depends on the experience of the zzso For zzso we aimed to develop a simplified systematic zzso approach that uses depth, size and zzso on zzso weighted MR images zzso to differentiate between zzso and benign zzso and evaluated its diagnostic zzso 

MR images of zzso patients with zzso proven zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso according to depth zzso or zzso size zzso zzso zzso and signal intensity zzso or zzso on zzso to determine the ability of each to predict benign and zzso zzso These three parameters were zzso into systematic combinations of different orders of application, and each combination was assessed for its ability to differentiate between benign and zzso zzso 

zzso analysis showed that depth, size and zzso on zzso differed significantly between benign and zzso masses zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis, however, showed that depth was not helpful in distinguishing benign from zzso zzso The systematic combination of signal intensity, size and depth, in that order, was superior to other combinations, resulting in higher diagnostic values for zzso with a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a positive zzso value of zzso a negative zzso value of 59% and an accuracy of zzso 

A simplified systematic imaging approach, in the order signal intensity, size and depth, would be a reference to distinguish between benign and zzso zzso zzso for zzso
