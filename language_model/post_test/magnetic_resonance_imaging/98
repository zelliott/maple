We investigated appropriate slice locations for magnetic resonance zzso imaging evaluation of the zzso zzso area zzso of individual rotator cuff zzso muscles in normal adults and zzso 

We used a zzso MR system with zzso and spine coils to obtain zzso zzso zzso shoulder images of 29 normal adults (16 men, 13 zzso 6 zzso competitive swimmers (4 men, 2 zzso 10 zzso female badminton zzso and 7 zzso male zzso We calculated the zzso zzso zzso minor, and zzso zzso at the zzso locations on the zzso zzso zzso zzso into 11 zzso 0 representing the zzso border of the zzso and 1, the zzso zzso zzso We evaluated the differences in zzso at relative locations on the zzso for each muscle in normal adults, swimmers, badminton players, and zzso using a one-way analysis of zzso followed by the zzso test zzso 

The zzso zzso were zzso at zzso for all zzso The zzso zzso were zzso at zzso for normal men and women and badminton players, zzso and zzso locations for swimmers, and zzso for zzso The zzso minor zzso were zzso at zzso for all groups except the swimmers (1 zzso The zzso zzso were zzso at zzso in men, swimmers, and badminton players and zzso in women and zzso 

The appropriate slice locations for evaluating zzso zzso are slightly lateral to the center of the zzso for the zzso and zzso at approximately the center of the zzso for the zzso and near the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso These slice locations should be clinically useful for zzso and/or zzso assessments of shoulder zzso zzso
