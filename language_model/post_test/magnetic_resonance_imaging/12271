zzso state functional zzso zzso which is used to measure blood oxygen zzso zzso from resting zzso is a relatively new and powerful method for evaluating regional interactions that occur when a participant is not performing an explicit zzso Because of the zzso to the phase shift and length of time courses of the zzso recordings, region of interest based conventional correlation and zzso methods are no longer suitable for zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a more robust and consistent method, dominant frequency zzso to analyze zzso zzso We found a dominant frequency of zzso recordings, zzso zzso in resting human brains that is consistent across participants and brain zzso This frequency is detected mainly in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Superior zzso and zzso zzso which control the human social behavior, emotion, and decision zzso In the meantime, we found that zzso zzso are most inconsistent in the brain regions of zzso Superior zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, zzso and part of the zzso whose functions are about zzso
