To zzso and zzso compare breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

A prospective zzso Ethics zzso approved study was performed in 31 women zzso age zzso zzso with 114 zzso (9 benign, 105 breast zzso 24 patients with unilateral and 7 with bilateral zzso zzso bilateral breast zzso resolution zzso dynamic zzso was performed at zzso using 3 zzso zzso dynamic zzso sequences in all patients zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso resolution 41 zzso per dynamic zzso and after zzso h at zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution 65 and 72 zzso per dynamic zzso zzso enhancement ratio, number and features of enhancing zzso image quality and reliability were compared by two zzso zzso 

102 cancer zzso were detected at zzso and 105 cancer zzso were detected in 31 patients at zzso One cancer zzso was observed at zzso which was missed at zzso and 3 cancer zzso and one high-risk zzso zzso were detected at zzso while missed at zzso Enhancement rates were significantly higher at zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso Better image quality was observed at zzso zzso reliability was higher at zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of breast cancer shows a trend of better performance at zzso than at zzso
