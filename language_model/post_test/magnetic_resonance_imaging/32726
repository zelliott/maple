Imaging evidence indicates that brain zzso are primary to the full-blown onset of schizophrenia and seem to progress across zzso The potential effects of antipsychotic medication on brain structure represent a key factor in understanding brain changes in zzso We aimed to investigate the effects of low doses of haloperidol, zzso and zzso on cortical zzso 

We investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and low doses of zzso zzso in cortical thickness changes during zzso follow-up period in a large and zzso sample of schizophrenia spectrum zzso The relationship between cortical thickness changes and clinical and cognitive outcome was also zzso A group of 45 healthy volunteers was also zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging brain scans zzso were obtained and images were analyzed by using zzso 

There were no significant effects of time zzso zzso treatment group zzso zzso or zzso interaction zzso zzso for any of the cortical thickness zzso When the group of healthy controls was included in the zzso it is of note that zzso interaction showed a significant result for the frontal lobe at trend level zzso zzso After the zzso adjustment for multiple zzso there were no significant associations between changes in cortical thickness and clinical and cognitive zzso 

Low doses of haloperidol, zzso and zzso seem to equally affect gray matter cortical zzso overall and zzso at the zzso (1 zzso The clinical effectiveness of treatments was not significantly related to changes in cortical zzso
