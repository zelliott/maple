zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to zzso and zzso with 60 and 66 zzso have been investigated at the zzso level of density functional zzso On the basis of the zzso nucleus independent chemical shifts zzso at the cage center and also at the center of individual rings as magnetic criteria, zzso with 60 zzso are as aromatic as the parent zzso while those with 66 zzso are much less aromatic than zzso The very distinct zzso chemical shifts of the 66 zzso systems may be useful to identify the zzso through their zzso zzso zzso chemical zzso
