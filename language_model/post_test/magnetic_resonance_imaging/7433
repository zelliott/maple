The default mode network is part of the brain structure that shows higher neural activity and energy consumption when one is at zzso The key regions in the default mode network are highly interconnected as conveyed by both the white matter fiber tracing and the zzso of zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso However, the zzso information flow within the default mode network is still poorly zzso The current study used the dynamic zzso modeling on a zzso zzso data set to identify the network structure underlying the default mode zzso The zzso brain fluctuations were explicitly modeled by zzso series at the low frequency band of zzso and those zzso series were set as driving zzso of the zzso zzso Model comparison procedures favored a model wherein the zzso sends information to the zzso and the bilateral inferior zzso zzso sends information to both the zzso and zzso Further analyses provide evidence that the zzso connectivity might be higher in the right zzso than in the left zzso These data provided insight into the functions of each zzso in the zzso and also validate the usage of zzso on zzso zzso zzso
