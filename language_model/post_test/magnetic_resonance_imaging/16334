In acute stroke patients, there is a need for zzso measurement to monitor blood zzso zzso We investigated the utility of zzso zzso zzso to determine cerebral zzso in these zzso 

Eleven patients were investigated within zzso zzso zzso days after onset of an zzso middle cerebral artery zzso by monitoring the zzso of an intravenous zzso of zzso green zzso For zzso zzso zzso peak time, time to peak zzso zzso time between 0 and zzso zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso rise time zzso between 10 and zzso zzso zzso slope zzso zzso and blood flow index zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed within 24 zzso and the zzso differences of zzso values were zzso 

Stroke patients showed an increased zzso peak time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and rise time zzso zzso zzso whereas slope zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were diminished at the site of zzso as compared to the unaffected zzso The zzso differences of zzso as measured by zzso and zzso were closely correlated zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of cerebral zzso zzso by zzso provide a useful means of detecting cerebral zzso deficits in patients with acute stroke, which correlate well with those obtained by zzso
