This study was done to determine whether zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso structures, zzso can be counted in the zzso of zzso by means of magnetic resonance imaging zzso In zzso 1, the zzso from 15 German shepherd zzso (five in the zzso phase, one in the zzso period, five during the first 38 days of zzso and four between Day 48 of zzso and zzso zzso were embedded in gelatin to form three zzso with 10 zzso zzso Each phantom was exposed to zzso using a zzso slice zzso a zzso slice zzso a zzso size of zzso cubic and a variety of pulse zzso zzso the zzso were dissected and the numbers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images were superior to zzso zzso Each of three operators counted the numbers of zzso and zzso on zzso images obtained in the zzso zzso and zzso planes of each zzso which, for the 30 zzso provided zzso operator by zzso by plane zzso and 90 operator by zzso zzso for each type of zzso Images of zzso were zzso those of early zzso zzso and zzso similar and moderate and those of late zzso zzso zzso and not clearly zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso were too low in zzso correct in zzso and too high in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso were correct in three operator by zzso combinations, out by 1 in 22 and out by more than 1 in zzso No operator estimated zzso correctly in any zzso In zzso 2 zzso was done on three deeply zzso zzso in the zzso phase in an attempt to obtain images of the zzso in order to count the zzso The acquisition time of zzso zzso rendered images of poor quality from live zzso and none of their zzso could be zzso zzso is not suitable for counting zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso
