zzso floor dysfunction and zzso affect 50 % of women past middle zzso Failure to recognize the complex set of pelvic floor defects in individuals leads to most zzso zzso Imaging has so far not had an established role in the investigation of zzso The present study is an attempt to define the role of magnetic resonance imaging in zzso 

Thirty patients with clinically graded stage zzso zzso underwent routine physical examination and grading of POP in the Department of zzso and zzso zzso Dynamic MR evaluation with zzso zzso was done and organ zzso was measured through the zzso line zzso zzso The agreement of zzso physical examination and zzso examination was analyzed using zzso as the test of zzso 

zzso subjects with grade III and 2 subjects with grade IV zzso were zzso The mean age was zzso and the mean parity was zzso On zzso 19 patients were found to have grade III zzso 4 had grade IV zzso and the rest had grade I and II zzso There was poor agreement of zzso with clinical examination in anterior and middle compartments zzso zzso k zzso The agreement between zzso and zzso findings was zzso zzso for anterior and zzso zzso Kappa was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The agreement was better for zzso compartment and zzso zzso detected 5 out of 8 zzso zzso 

The study demonstrates that while dynamic zzso does not zzso any additional advantage in the diagnosis of anterior and middle compartment zzso the diagnosis of zzso which may be missed zzso is efficiently made on dynamic zzso zzso Additionally, zzso can differentiate zzso from a high zzso which can further zzso the surgery zzso There is also a need to zzso the protocol and the role of MR imaging in zzso
