High resolution magnetic resonance zzso techniques combined with standard techniques of zzso and texture analysis have been used to zzso zzso zzso Using dried excised specimens from the zzso zzso zzso 10) and radius zzso zzso 2) we evaluate the impact of using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging zzso the relative importance of echo time in zzso MR imaging, and the impact of different threshold values to segment the bone and bone zzso on the zzso of zzso bone zzso We also investigate the zzso between the different structural parameters derived from MR zzso Images were obtained using fast zzso and zzso imaging zzso with TE values ranging from 7 to 17 zzso using zzso and zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso image resolution ranged from 128 to 156 zzso and slice thickness ranged from 128 to 1000 zzso We derived zzso measures such as the mean intercept zzso zzso zzso fractional area of zzso bone, zzso number, and zzso zzso the zzso dimension as a zzso zzso and the zzso number as a measure of connectivity from these zzso We found that the mean intercept length as a function of angle traced an zzso with the orientation of the principal axis of the zzso a measure of zzso orientation, identical when measured from the zzso or zzso MR zzso Absolute measures such as the fractional area, zzso zzso zzso number, and zzso dimension as measured from zzso echo images were zzso zzso zzso and zzso greater, respectively, than those calculated from zzso images, while the zzso spacing was zzso less when calculated from zzso images compared to zzso zzso The structural parameters also depended on the echo time used to obtain the MR zzso The choice of the threshold used to segment the high resolution images also affected the estimated structural parameters zzso Our results indicate that MR may be used to zzso and zzso zzso bone zzso however, the different technical factors that could affect the appearance of MR images must be understood and considered in the data analysis and zzso
