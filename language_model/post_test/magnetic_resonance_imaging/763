The zzso basis for differences in disability in patients with multiple sclerosis is zzso 

We used magnetic resonance imaging to examine whether differences in disability in zzso of multiple sclerosis patients with similar zzso zzso volume and disease duration were associated with a more destructive disease process in the more disabled zzso 

The benign and severely disabled groups had similar brain zzso metrics and similar decreases of the zzso marker, zzso in the normal appearing white matter of the zzso on magnetic resonance zzso examination in zzso The severely disabled cohort had more spinal zzso zzso 

The zzso of spinal zzso zzso and cerebral zzso between these two groups suggests that the difference between the more benign and more disabled groups cannot be explained by a more aggressive pathological process that is affecting the entire zzso in a homogeneous zzso
