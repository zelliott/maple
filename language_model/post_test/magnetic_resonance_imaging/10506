Blood oxygen zzso zzso contrast largely depends on changes in cerebral blood flow zzso Because cerebrovascular disease may result in altered zzso we assessed the zzso dynamics and magnitude of the zzso response in patients with major zzso zzso 

Seven patients with zzso significant zzso affecting the anterior circulation zzso left internal carotid and middle cerebral zzso were compared with 7 zzso healthy zzso Continuous zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure resting zzso globally and within various vascular zzso The zzso response was acquired during a visually guided bilateral zzso squeeze task while motor performance was recorded by a pressure zzso 

zzso zzso was reduced in bilateral middle cerebral artery and left anterior cerebral artery territories in zzso A prolonged zzso zzso response was observed in patients in bilateral primary motor zzso but not visual zzso Patients also exhibited a larger early negative zzso response, or zzso zzso in left primary motor zzso There were no differences in motor performance between groups, suggesting behavioral differences were not primarily responsible for the characteristics of the zzso zzso 

An initial zzso followed by a delayed zzso zzso response was observed in patients, although resting flow values were not within an zzso zzso A simple zzso zzso zzso paradigm can reflect zzso in the zzso response in patients with zzso significant zzso
