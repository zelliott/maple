A sheep study was performed to compare the in zzso performance of bone plates of zzso stainless steel and a new titanium zzso titanium + zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso which had been subjected to a diffusion zzso treatment to produce a blue, wear resistant zzso Bone plates and screws of stainless steel and diffusion hardened zzso were implanted in adult zzso in one group (with zzso zzso for 16 weeks, and in the other (with zzso zzso for 8 zzso At harvest, the diffusion hardened zzso devices had superior fixation strength, with greater screw zzso out strength and fewer loose zzso In the zzso animals, the zzso with diffusion hardened zzso plates had higher zzso strength after removal of the zzso however, the difference was not statistically zzso In the zzso animals, the zzso strength of the zzso was identical for both zzso There was a slightly reduced zzso of infection zzso zzso for the sheep with diffusion hardened zzso zzso In a parallel in zzso study, the magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso was significantly superior to that of stainless zzso This indicates that diffusion hardened zzso may be an attractive alternative material for zzso
