zzso Effect Imaging zzso is an zzso technique that has been proposed for direct imaging of zzso zzso While promising results have been obtained in zzso and in the human median nerve in zzso its contrast mechanism is still not fully zzso In this paper, zzso model simulations were used to investigate how zzso zzso may explain the zzso zzso Three zzso models of an zzso phantom subject to an applied current zzso synchronized to zzso magnetic field zzso of an zzso zzso were developed to determine the zzso and displacement of water molecules as well as the resulting signal loss in an MR zzso The simulated images were compared to images from previous zzso phantom experiments with identical properties for different stimulus current zzso and zzso The first model, which evaluated zzso zzso based on zzso flow using different mobility values, did not generate an appreciable signal loss due to an insufficient number of water molecules associated with the zzso zzso zzso The second model, which zzso particle drift based on the zzso force of charged particles in free space, was able to approximate the zzso but not the distribution of signal loss observed in the experimental zzso The third model, which zzso zzso based on the zzso force and zzso equations for flow of a conducting fluid, provided results consistent with both the magnitude and distribution of signal loss seen in the zzso zzso Our zzso model further yields information on electrical potential, zzso zzso and pressure, which are not readily available in an experiment, thereby providing a robust means to study and zzso zzso for imaging zzso activity in the human zzso
