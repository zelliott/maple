The zzso zzso zzso zzso uses prior sensory information for motor zzso Here, we used a zzso approach in 11 healthy male humans zzso age 27 zzso to further clarify the role of zzso in anticipatory motor zzso We zzso disrupted zzso processing in zzso using either continuous zzso burst stimulation zzso at zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of active motor zzso The conditioning effects of zzso on zzso brain activity were assessed with functional zzso while participants lifted a light or heavy weight in response to a zzso zzso An additional zzso zzso correctly predicted the weight in zzso of the zzso Participants were asked to use this prior information to prepare for the zzso In the sham condition, grip force showed a consistent zzso if the zzso incorrectly prompted the preparation of a light zzso Likewise, an zzso that falsely announced a heavy weight produced a consistent zzso in grip zzso In trials with incorrect S1, zzso activity in left zzso during the zzso delay period predicted grip force zzso but not zzso Real zzso selectively abolished this zzso in grip zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso activity in left zzso no longer predicted the individual zzso after real zzso Our results provide zzso evidence for a zzso involvement of zzso in anticipatory zzso but not zzso of grip force, suggesting an zzso role of zzso in anticipatory grip force control during object zzso
