A three-dimensional zzso registration zzso was created and compared to rigid body registration of magnetic resonance zzso pelvic volumes including the zzso The rigid body registration method combines the advantages of mutual information zzso and correlation zzso at different zzso zzso registration is based upon independent zzso of many zzso placed control points zzso using zzso and a thin plate zzso zzso More than 100 registration experiments with 17 MR volume pairs determined the quality of registration under conditions simulating potential zzso zzso treatments of prostate zzso For image pairs that stress rigid body registration zzso zzso the diagnostic position, and legs raised, the treatment zzso both visual and zzso evaluation methods showed that zzso consistently worked better than rigid zzso zzso showed that approximately 180 zzso placed zzso were sufficiently expressive to capture important features of the zzso
