There are two major problems for the zzso zzso invading the zzso zzso zzso differentiation of extension and invasion and inability to demonstrate the zzso wall via zzso imaging zzso Two important corridors are defined in zzso cavernous zzso zzso the lateral and zzso zzso 

A retrospective analysis was performed in 400 zzso zzso approaches and 360 zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso surgery in our department between September 1997 and December zzso 48 patients affected by the zzso involving the cavernous zzso were included in this zzso 

We performed an zzso evaluation of cavernous zzso invasion considering zzso of the zzso wall zzso zzso zzso zzso minor zzso extensions through small focal pit holes of the zzso wall of zzso or confirming carotid segments of zzso by zzso zzso zzso involvement was classified into three types according to the zzso and lateral corridor extension of the tumor as 25 isolated zzso corridor involvement zzso zzso 5 isolated lateral corridor involvement zzso zzso and 18 total involvement zzso zzso 

Our zzso depends on fully surgical zzso approach supported by zzso techniques and anatomical studies and shows a good zzso value for all cavernous zzso zzso
