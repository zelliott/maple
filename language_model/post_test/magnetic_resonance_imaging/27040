Many women with zzso desire zzso zzso zzso zzso focused ultrasound surgery zzso is a new zzso zzso We describe our early results regarding efficacy and safety of zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso 

zzso French women, over 18 years of age, who were candidates for surgical zzso zzso or zzso artery zzso due to symptomatic zzso were treated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and followed up for at least 6 zzso zzso or zzso zzso with a size between 4-12 zzso and a zzso low intensity zzso image were selected in women with no abdominal zzso and no zzso zzso The modified symptom severity score zzso was examined before and after the treatment at 6 zzso Second treatment rate during the first follow-up year was zzso 

No serious complications were recorded during the treatments or follow-up zzso Seven women had initial failure mostly because of zzso zzso six of them had zzso artery zzso The mean modified zzso value for patients before zzso was zzso and the values diminished significantly to a mean value of zzso A total of zzso of women had a reduction of at least 10 points zzso zzso score of 41 zzso zzso and 22 zzso zzso at 6 month zzso Good correlation was observed between zzso destruction and the symptoms zzso During the follow-up period, ten patients zzso required invasive interventions (six zzso two zzso and two zzso The average reduction in zzso volume determined by MR imaging at 6 months after treatment was zzso This volume reduction is poorly correlated with the zzso treated volume of zzso zzso 

zzso can safely be used for symptomatic treatment and avoid the need for surgical intervention in most zzso Additional follow-up is needed to determine the long-term durability of this promising zzso approach and to obtain zzso
