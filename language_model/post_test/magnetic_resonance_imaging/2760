A model of zzso signal intensity was developed for zzso column zzso containing zzso gels, which were used to simulate tissue zzso and the exchange of zzso between zzso and zzso tissue zzso Computer simulations of zzso and zzso models were compared in experiments that used two zzso zzso One column contained a zzso zzso gel that had a smaller pore size and a slower rate of exchange between zzso and zzso compartments than did a second column, which contained a zzso gel with a larger pore zzso In both columns the beads were of approximately the same size to simulate the same ratio of zzso volume to zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed with the columns oriented parallel to each other in a zzso T zzso and parallel to the magnetic field, with water flowing through each column perpendicular to the slice at mean flow zzso ranging between 0 and zzso zzso The results of the experiments agreed with computer simulations, which showed that the zzso signal intensity in the zzso columns is a function of the rate of exchange between zzso and zzso zzso The exchange process zzso the transit time of zzso passing through an excited zzso The simulations also showed that both zzso and zzso models could be used to fit the experimental zzso zzso with zzso gel columns are a preliminary investigation into the potential of using zzso to measure the exchange between zzso and zzso compartments of zzso zzso during blood zzso of biological zzso
