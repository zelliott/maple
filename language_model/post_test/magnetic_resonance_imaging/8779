Multiple object tracking zzso has proven to be a powerful technique for studying sustained selective zzso However, surprisingly little is known about its underlying neural zzso Previous zzso investigations have identified several brain areas thought to be involved in zzso but there were disagreements between the studies, none distinguished between the act of tracking targets and the act of attending targets, and none attempted to determine which of these brain areas interact with each zzso Here we address these three zzso First, using more observers and a random effects analysis, we show that some of the previously identified areas may not play a specific role in zzso Second, we show that the frontal eye fields zzso the anterior zzso zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the human motion area zzso are zzso activated by the act of zzso as distinguished from the act of zzso Finally, by using an zzso modified from the computer science literature, we were able to map the interactions between these brain zzso
