The purpose was to describe magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of breast cancer liver zzso using zzso acid zzso with an emphasis on the added value of the zzso phase zzso 

Nine patients with 13 liver zzso were included in the study after the medical records of 29 breast cancer patients who underwent zzso zzso between February 2008 and June 2010 were zzso The diagnoses of liver zzso were established by zzso liver biopsy or surgery and on the basis of image zzso Two zzso zzso evaluated signal intensity zzso and sizes of zzso and patterns of enhancement in an zzso The zzso ratio was calculated as the zzso of the central zzso portion in zzso zzso divided by the zzso of nearby normal liver zzso on the zzso We also measured apparent diffusion zzso zzso values from zzso zzso Image zzso 

Liver zzso were all zzso zzso zzso on zzso imaging zzso and many zzso had a zzso appearance with a central high zzso and a peripheral low zzso rim zzso on zzso Dynamic study showed rim enhancement on the zzso phase zzso and a zzso appearance, consisting of a central enhancing portion with peripheral zzso or zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The mean zzso ratio was zzso The mean zzso value of zzso appearing zzso was zzso zzso zzso range zzso compared with a mean value of zzso zzso zzso range zzso in homogeneous zzso on the zzso There was statistically significant difference zzso 

Breast cancer liver zzso commonly demonstrated as a peripheral ring enhancement on zzso dominant phase and a target sign with a central round enhancing portion and a peripheral zzso rim on the zzso
