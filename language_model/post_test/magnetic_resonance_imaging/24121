To determine whether the association of zzso III zzso zzso an oral MR contrast agent, to zzso acid zzso zzso will improve zzso and delivery of zzso to the zzso 

zzso or zzso zzso suspension was zzso administered to rats and the time course of zzso concentration in zzso zzso and zzso solution was zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the liver were also zzso 

Association of zzso to zzso reduced the time it took to reach one-half zzso zzso zzso and enhanced the rate and the extent of zzso elimination of this contrast zzso In addition, the results obtained from zzso studies indicate that zzso zzso complex may enhance zzso zzso in the liver, observed as a lower dose required to reach equivalent tissue zzso Taken together, complexion to zzso zzso may provide rapid zzso enhanced liver zzso and efficient elimination of zzso 

Association with zzso zzso may enhance the rate of zzso zzso and zzso zzso while promoting the extent of liver zzso of zzso in zzso This strategy may provide a means to provide safe and effective use of zzso as an MR contrast zzso
