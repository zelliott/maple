zzso learning is required for zzso association and is impaired in alcoholism, but the cognitive processes and brain structural components underlying this deficit remain zzso It is also unknown whether prompting zzso to implement a deep level of processing during zzso zzso would enhance zzso 

zzso zzso and controls performed a zzso zzso learning zzso Participants indicated whether the face was that of an honest person zzso zzso or that of a man zzso zzso zzso was examined using an zzso zzso recognition task and a zzso zzso or name only) recognition zzso Participants also underwent zzso structural zzso 

Compared with controls, zzso had poorer zzso and zzso learning and performed at similar zzso Level of processing at zzso had little effect on recognition performance but affected reaction time zzso zzso with brain volumes were generally modest and based primarily on zzso in zzso where the deeper the processing at zzso the more restricted the correlations with brain zzso In zzso longer control task zzso correlated modestly with smaller tissue volumes across several anterior to zzso brain zzso shallow zzso correlated with zzso and zzso zzso deep zzso correlated with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso recognition zzso correlated with zzso zzso In controls, poorer zzso recognition with deep zzso correlated significantly with smaller volumes of frontal and zzso zzso 

Despite zzso zzso did not take advantage of zzso memoranda at a deep level to enhance zzso recognition zzso Nonetheless, conditions of deeper zzso resulted in faster zzso and more specific relations with regional brain volumes than did shallow zzso The normal relation between zzso recognition and zzso volumes was not present in zzso Rather, their zzso zzso occurred at the expense of accuracy and were related most robustly to zzso zzso
