zzso zzso is a recently described zzso which is highly accumulated in zzso The present investigation was designed to evaluate the feasibility of single zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to image brain zzso under routine clinical zzso Using a zzso and a zzso zzso camera, zzso kinetic and brain zzso as well as zzso urinary and zzso analysis were determined in four patients with zzso after intravenous injection of zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso were zzso compared with zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso were clearly demonstrated by zzso zzso at 30 zzso zzso and zzso zzso even in patients with low grade zzso In patients with glioblastoma, excellent zzso of the zzso was possible even at zzso zzso indicative of the high retention of the zzso in cerebral zzso Analysis of the zzso in plasma and urine zzso to the high in zzso stability of zzso Blood clearance was rapid zzso zzso after 10 zzso and zzso was zzso predominantly by the zzso the urinary zzso zzso ranging from zzso at zzso to zzso of injected doses at zzso zzso The average effective dose for adults was estimated to be zzso leading to an effective dose of zzso in a typical brain zzso investigation with 250 zzso zzso This result strongly suggests that zzso is a potentially valuable brain zzso imaging agent for widespread clinical studies with zzso Its high specific zzso zzso and retention even in low grade zzso represent a major advantage compared to presently available zzso zzso Moreover, the radiation dose estimates indicate that clinical use of zzso will result in acceptable radiation dose levels in zzso
