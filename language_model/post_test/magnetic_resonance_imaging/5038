zzso and multiple sclerosis zzso can both cause white matter zzso that appear similar on conventional zzso This study aimed to compare these zzso and to find anatomical zzso specific for zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso of 17 zzso and 15 patients with zzso were zzso zzso zzso and their zzso distribution assessed on zzso inversion recovery zzso We found that migraine zzso affected mainly the deep white matter and zzso zzso belonged to the anterior zzso appeared more frequently in the frontal and zzso zzso showed no difference in average size between zzso and were smaller and fewer than in zzso Most of the zzso zzso were in the frontal lobe and were the smallest average size, while the fewest zzso with the largest size were in the zzso zzso The pattern of zzso zzso appearance differs between the two zzso however, accurate differential diagnosis of zzso by conventional zzso is probably not possible in individual zzso
