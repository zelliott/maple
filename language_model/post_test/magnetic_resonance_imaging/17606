Research in the zzso zzso and neural sciences that relates to the concept of zzso specificity was reviewed and zzso 

zzso specificity has a long history as an organizing construct within a diverse collection of mainstream scientific zzso The principle of zzso specificity was contrasted with the zzso inclusive zzso which holds that auditory tests alone are sufficient to make the zzso zzso Evidence from a large body of data demonstrated that the zzso framework was unable to delineate zzso processes from more generalized zzso it lacked zzso zzso and resulted in an incomplete zzso zzso any hypothetical model resulting from incomplete assessments or potential therapies that are based on indeterminate diagnoses are themselves questionable, and caution should be used in their zzso 

zzso specificity of diagnosis is an imperative core issue to the area of zzso Without zzso the concept has little explanatory zzso Because of serious flaws in concept and design, the zzso inclusive framework should be abandoned in favor of a more valid approach that uses zzso zzso
