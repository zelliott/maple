The purposes of this study were to examine the effect of sensitivity zzso zzso factors on cortical thickness zzso and to determine which zzso factor to use to reliably measure cortical thickness in zzso T and zzso T zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso images were acquired from 11 healthy volunteers with 6 different zzso acceleration factors from zzso (without zzso zzso to zzso on a zzso T zzso and 9 different zzso factors from zzso to zzso plus a zzso zzso acquisition on a zzso T zzso zzso thickness was calculated for the entire cortical surface that was further subdivided into 33 zzso zzso measures zzso analysis of zzso revealed that the main effect of zzso factors zzso zzso zzso was a significant zzso of cortical thickness at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso T and at zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso measures zzso showed that thickness zzso at the zzso superior zzso zzso the zzso part of the superior frontal zzso and zzso zzso are highly affected by zzso zzso zzso factors affect thickness zzso more significantly at zzso T and thus zzso T imaging provides less reliable estimates using zzso zzso zzso imaging can be done without too much loss of reliability using a high zzso factor, such as zzso at zzso T with acquisition time being zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
