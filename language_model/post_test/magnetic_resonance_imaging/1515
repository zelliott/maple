In 48 consecutive patients, we applied a new zzso imaging technique to individually zzso the zzso target before zzso A zzso zzso zzso density sequence zzso time, 6 minutes 5 zzso was used for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso border, zzso zzso border, and zzso tract were zzso zzso in all zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were clearly zzso in zzso of the zzso The zzso target point was chosen in the middle of the zzso zzso zzso irrespective of the position of this point in relation to zzso The zzso of zzso border, zzso zzso zzso and zzso boundary of zzso were measured zzso in each patient, and the zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso The zzso of structures zzso from a point 2 zzso anterior to zzso point and at a level 2-4 zzso below anterior zzso zzso line) showed a wide zzso The position of the zzso border varied by up to almost 1 zzso between the most zzso and the most lateral zzso There were also variations in the position of the zzso structures between left and right zzso in the same zzso The zzso zzso was slightly more wide on the left than the right zzso Given the significant zzso and zzso zzso of the position of zzso structures, it may be hazardous to rely solely on the zzso and the zzso for zzso A magnetic resonance imaging sequence that enables zzso in each individual patient of the target area and its surroundings may contribute to less zzso passes during zzso zzso exploration and to more exact location of the zzso or chronic zzso in the zzso zzso
