The zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso and the zzso dynamic zzso MR imaging zzso techniques have both been shown to be effective in the assessment of human pulmonary zzso However, no comprehensive comparison of the zzso by these two methods has been zzso In this study, healthy adults were zzso with FAIR and zzso performed for an zzso of the relative pulmonary blood flow zzso zzso of interest were zzso from the right and left zzso with zzso zzso ratios zzso zzso indicated that, on zzso zzso zzso the zzso ratios obtained with the FAIR technique agreed well with zzso zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso On middle zzso zzso however, FAIR showed a substantially lower zzso by up to zzso in the right lung compared with zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso between zzso by FAIR and zzso methods is attributed to zzso zzso effects of zzso inflow when the middle zzso slice contains the zzso right pulmonary artery, whereas the left lung zzso is less affected due to zzso orientation of the left pulmonary zzso zzso comparison on additional subjects using FAIR at different slice zzso supported the above zzso It is concluded that FAIR imaging for pulmonary zzso in the zzso plane provides equivalent zzso information with zzso only in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso FAIR should be carefully exercised to avoid misleading zzso
