Left zzso zzso is a zzso zzso characterized by a zzso organized into two zzso one zzso and one zzso We aimed to zzso zzso function, zzso and delayed enhancement using zzso in patients with zzso zzso and to compare these results with those of normal zzso 

We included 12 patients with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso in at least one segment apart from the zzso and 12 healthy subjects matched for age and zzso We calculated the zzso and zzso volumes, stroke volume, ejection zzso cardiac zzso zzso volume and mass, zzso zzso and zzso wall zzso and zzso From the delayed enhancement images, we obtained the volume and percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso test was used to compare zzso 

We observed a statistically significant increase in zzso and zzso volumes in patients with zzso zzso as well as decreased ejection zzso wall motion, and relative maximum zzso in segments 4, 9, and zzso No significant differences were found in delayed zzso 

zzso zzso revealed decreased zzso cardiac function and decreased zzso zzso relative maximum zzso in the lower segments in patients with zzso
