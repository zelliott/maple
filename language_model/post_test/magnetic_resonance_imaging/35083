The zzso center zzso by coinciding zzso and zzso zzso been proposed in the literature as a reference point to represent zzso zzso In this study, we tested whether the zzso lies in a peculiar anatomical point and whether its trajectory reflects zzso zzso In 11 zzso individuals zzso zzso four zzso aged zzso zzso 4 zzso and 4 zzso were tracked with dynamic zzso In a zzso lattice zzso zzso zzso constructed solidly around each zzso the zzso was the point with zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were more zzso on closing than on zzso consistent with zzso distances being smaller on closing than on zzso However, zzso were never located on zzso main axes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nor did they coincide with points best zzso zzso shapes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso center's anatomical and functional significance therefore appears to be zzso
