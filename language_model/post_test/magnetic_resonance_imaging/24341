Metals have vital functions as prosthetic groups in zzso but in zzso form they can zzso zzso zzso The primary function of zzso is to store zzso iron in the form of zzso In animals, zzso is also used to traffic and zzso iron, and to zzso zzso iron zzso However, the effect of zzso zzso on cellular iron zzso remains poorly zzso Moreover, putative in zzso interactions of zzso with other metal zzso have been proposed, but their zzso relevance remains zzso Here, zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso were subjected to dietary iron zzso to study the dynamics of iron partition between zzso and other zzso zzso magnetic analysis of whole fly samples indicated that iron loading of the zzso core varied in the different zzso Total zzso iron content, a likely correlate of zzso iron, was reduced in flies zzso zzso when compared with control white zzso Further, three-dimensional maps of the zzso protein shell and iron core were obtained from single particle transmission electron zzso imaging and confirmed the similarity between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also contained small amounts of zinc and zzso zzso that zzso zzso accumulated in their bodies half the amount of zzso compared to their respective zzso Our results indicate that zzso may be involved in the zzso of other zzso metals, besides iron, and that zzso of zzso sometimes employed to rescue neurodegenerative models of disease, serves to limit zzso metal zzso in zzso
