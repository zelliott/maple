Human cardiac zzso cells have demonstrated great potential for zzso repair in small and large animals, but robust methods for zzso assessment of their zzso in humans is not yet readily zzso In this study, we sought to zzso and evaluate the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter gene imaging for monitoring human cardiac zzso cell zzso transplantation in a mouse model of zzso zzso 

zzso were isolated and expanded from human zzso samples and zzso zzso with zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso PET reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized in zzso and transplanted into zzso zzso zzso models zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso loop analyses revealed improvement in left zzso zzso function 2 weeks after transplant zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso PET imaging was used to track zzso fate over a zzso time period, demonstrating a substantial decline in surviving zzso zzso early cell zzso as assessed by PET was found to predict subsequent functional improvement, zzso a zzso zzso We isolated the transplanted cells from recipient zzso by laser capture zzso for in zzso zzso zzso Our results provide direct evidence that zzso augment cardiac function after their transplantation into zzso zzso through zzso zzso of growth zzso 

PET reporter gene imaging can provide important diagnostic and zzso information regarding the ultimate success of zzso treatment for zzso zzso
