To investigate whether zzso fluid zzso zzso levels correlate with disability or active disease in zzso and to determine whether elevated zzso zzso levels are only seen in zzso 

zzso fluid zzso was zzso using zzso zzso zzso in duplicate by an observer blinded to the clinical status of the zzso zzso fluid samples were not obtained from any patient who had received high-dose zzso therapy in the month before zzso

Thirty patients (18 women and 12 zzso age range, zzso zzso with clinically zzso zzso and 36 patients zzso women and 14 zzso age range, zzso zzso with other neurological diseases zzso or zzso illnesses were included in the zzso 

Disease activity for patients with zzso was based on observations in the year preceding the study, including the number of zzso the change in disability according to the Expanded zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso or zzso zzso on brain magnetic resonance zzso 

Higher zzso zzso levels were seen in patients with zzso having active disease and in patients with zzso that are actively deteriorating or zzso However, zzso zzso levels in patients with zzso did not correlate with disability zzso 

zzso fluid zzso levels do not correlate with disability in zzso but tend to be higher in patients with active zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are not a specific marker for zzso as they are found in patients with zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the highest zzso zzso levels are seen in patients with rapidly progressive neurological dysfunction or widespread inflammation of the central nervous zzso
