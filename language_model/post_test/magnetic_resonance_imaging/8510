zzso disease zzso is accompanied by zzso zzso on zzso MR zzso A few studies have also demonstrated reduction in zzso transfer ratio zzso suggesting zzso changes in remaining brain zzso This study assessed the value of measuring zzso in addition to zzso MR in zzso patients with zzso from control zzso 

zzso zzso images and zzso zzso maps were obtained from 18 patients with zzso and 18 zzso control zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso volumes were measured using zzso techniques and adjusted for total zzso zzso Mean zzso was obtained for zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed for zzso zzso Among patients, associations between zzso and zzso parameters and the zzso State zzso zzso were zzso 

Patients with zzso had significantly reduced zzso volume zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso and zzso mean zzso zzso compared with control zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed significant reduction in the 25th zzso point in patients with zzso zzso Both zzso volume and mean zzso were independently associated with zzso status after adjusting for the other using linear zzso zzso However, measuring zzso mean zzso added no statistically significant zzso value over and above zzso volume measurement zzso Of all MR imaging zzso only zzso volume was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates the independent reduction of zzso volume and mean zzso in zzso This suggests that the 2 parameters reflect complementary aspects of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso
