Alzheimer's disease zzso patients show lower zzso zzso for zzso zzso of alpha or other dominant zzso zzso frequency components in the zzso zzso In the present study, we performed computer simulations to discover which of zzso of zzso activity lower zzso in a manner similar to that seen in severe zzso zzso was estimated from simulations of various electric zzso generator zzso within the zzso zzso under conditions of widened cortical zzso (a severely zzso zzso zzso or no zzso widening (a normal zzso The cortical and scalp surfaces, derived from the subjects' zzso were assumed to be zzso zzso zzso zzso placed, zzso zzso ranging from 1 to 4 zzso per zzso were used in both the normal and zzso models to simulate the electrical effect of zzso zzso zzso In both models, zzso decreased as total zzso size zzso However, the zzso model showed lower zzso than the normal model for both individual zzso sizes and for larger total zzso zzso The larger decline in zzso in the zzso model appears to be due to zzso widening which zzso the effect of zzso buried within zzso These simulations identify a possible mechanism explaining why zzso zzso changes plus progressive cortical zzso in zzso brains (and presumably other cortical disorders producing zzso alter zzso patterns and zzso differently from normal zzso damaged by similar zzso
