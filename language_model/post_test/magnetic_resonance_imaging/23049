zzso commonly understand the zzso mental states of others by observing their zzso zzso simulation theories suggest that this ability may be based in areas of the zzso mirror zzso system, yet zzso studies that explicitly investigate the human ability to draw mental state zzso point to the involvement of a zzso system consisting of regions that do not overlap with the mirror zzso zzso For the present study, we developed a novel action identification paradigm that allowed us to explicitly investigate the neural bases of zzso observed zzso Across repeated viewings of a set of ecologically valid video clips of ordinary human actions, we manipulated the extent to which participants identified the zzso mental states of the actor zzso or the zzso mechanics of their behavior zzso Although areas of the mirror zzso system did show an enhanced response during action zzso its activity was not significantly modulated by the extent to which the observers identified mental zzso Instead, several regions of the zzso system, including zzso and zzso aspects of zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso were associated with zzso actions, whereas a single region in left lateral zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso These data suggest that embodied simulation is insufficient to account for the sophisticated zzso that human beings are capable of while observing another and that a different system along the cortical zzso and in anterior zzso zzso is involved in zzso an observed zzso
