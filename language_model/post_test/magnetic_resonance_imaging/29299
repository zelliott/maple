Global spatial zzso zzso a brain image so that its principal global spatial features zzso orientation and zzso match those of a standard or zzso brain, supporting consistent analysis and zzso of brain zzso The convex zzso zzso derived from the zzso surface, was selected as the basis for zzso and zzso global spatial zzso The accuracy and precision of zzso global spatial zzso of PET and MR brain images were evaluated in normal human zzso 

Software was developed to extract zzso of brain surfaces from zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method was modified to fit individual zzso zzso to a template zzso zzso and calculate a zzso coordinate transformation to perform spatial zzso A template zzso was refined using MR images from 12 subjects to zzso global spatial feature zzso to the 1988 zzso zzso zzso The template was tested in 12 additional zzso Three major performance characteristics were zzso zzso quality of spatial zzso with anatomical MR images, zzso optimal threshold for PET and zzso quality of spatial zzso for functional PET zzso 

As a surface model of the human brain, the zzso was shown to be highly consistent across subjects and imaging zzso In MR images zzso zzso 24), mean errors for anterior and zzso zzso generally were zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso errors generally were zzso zzso and zzso limits were within 1-2 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The optimal threshold for defining brain boundaries in both zzso zzso zzso 8) and zzso zzso zzso zzso PET images was zzso of the brain maximum zzso The accuracy of global spatial zzso of PET images was shown to be similar to that of MR zzso 

The global features of zzso zzso brain images zzso orientation and zzso were consistently transformed to match the zzso zzso in both MR and PET zzso The zzso method supports zzso and zzso global spatial zzso of zzso brain zzso
