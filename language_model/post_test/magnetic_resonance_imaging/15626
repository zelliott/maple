zzso is one of the most common late-life zzso zzso The objective of our study was to examine the zzso zzso of apathy in older subjects with and without geriatric major depression zzso 

zzso subjects zzso patients with zzso and 41 normal comparison subjects) underwent comprehensive zzso examination, physical examination, and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso brain scans on a zzso GE zzso zzso zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso image analyses included cortical surface zzso tissue zzso and cortical zzso methods to measure the gray and white matter volumes in two prefrontal zzso the anterior zzso and zzso zzso 

The depressed group had smaller zzso gray matter volumes compared to the zzso normal comparison zzso The severity of apathy was associated with the decreased gray matter volume in the right anterior zzso gray matter volumes using partial correlation and zzso analyses after controlling for age, sex, and zzso 

zzso and depression were associated with different anatomical zzso in the prefrontal regions implicated in the regulation of zzso and zzso Our findings offer new understanding of the zzso characteristics of apathy and depression in late life, and have broad implications for the zzso of zzso
