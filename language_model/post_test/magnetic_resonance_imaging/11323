T cells zzso to zzso are present in the peripheral blood of patients with zzso diseases as well as in healthy zzso Although T zzso to the zzso zzso zzso basic protein zzso has been widely investigated in multiple sclerosis zzso patients, very little is known about the evolution over time of this response and its correlation with the disease zzso In recent years magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques have provided new tools for following the inflammatory activity in the central nervous system zzso of zzso zzso In the present study the T cell response to zzso was zzso investigated in terms of frequency, zzso zzso and zzso production profile in four patients with zzso zzso enrolled in a zzso zzso serial zzso In spite of different profiles of inflammatory activity within the zzso all the patients examined showed major changes in their zzso to zzso during the follow-up period in terms of both frequency and zzso zzso zzso expansions of zzso T cell populations were observed in each patient, and overall they did not correlate with disease zzso In these patients the zzso 1) occurred in the context of a steady level of disease activity, 2) correlated with a burst of zzso zzso 3) followed the appearance of a new active zzso and 4) were observed even in the absence of zzso signs of zzso inflammation during the entire follow-up zzso These results suggest that the evolution over time of the T cell response to a zzso such as zzso is more complex than previously zzso The short-term repertoire dynamics of zzso T cells in zzso underscore the importance of zzso studies for evaluating zzso to zzso zzso and probably to any zzso in other zzso zzso
