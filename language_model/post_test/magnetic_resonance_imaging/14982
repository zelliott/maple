Previous studies have reported zzso in zzso matter volume and cortical thickness in individuals at high risk of developing psychosis and patients in the early stages of the zzso Because these studies have typically focused on either zzso matter volume or cortical thickness zzso the relationship between these two types of zzso is currently zzso In the present investigation we used both zzso cortical thickness zzso and zzso zzso zzso to examine zzso differences in 21 individuals with an At zzso Mental State zzso for zzso 26 patients with a First Episode of zzso zzso and 24 healthy zzso zzso zzso were made at zzso after correction for multiple zzso zzso thinning in the right superior zzso zzso was observed in both individuals at high risk of developing psychosis and patients with a first episode of the disorder, and therefore is likely to represent a marker of zzso In contrast, the right zzso zzso zzso showed cortical thinning in zzso patients relative to individuals at high risk, and therefore appears to be implicated in the onset of the zzso These zzso differences were expressed in terms of cortical thickness but not in terms of zzso matter volume, and therefore may reflect specific cortical zzso as opposed to variations in zzso and zzso zzso
