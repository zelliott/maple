In some people the blood supply to the zzso cerebral artery occurs partly or even exclusively via the carotid zzso This zzso zzso may influence the risk of zzso lobe zzso We studied the presence and direction of flow in the zzso zzso artery zzso in patients with an zzso lobe zzso and in healthy zzso 

zzso patients with an zzso lobe zzso were studied by MR zzso as well as 50 young healthy zzso Special attention was paid to the presence of a zzso and, if present, to the direction of zzso 

zzso fewer patients than controls had an exclusive blood supply to the zzso cerebral artery via the carotid system, in both the affected zzso versus zzso zzso zzso of difference, zzso to zzso and unaffected zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso of difference, zzso to zzso Patients also less often had a patent zzso with zzso flow than controls zzso hemisphere, zzso versus zzso unaffected hemisphere, zzso versus zzso zzso zzso of differences, zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso With analysis at the level of individuals, significantly more patients showed no zzso flow through the zzso in either zzso than controls zzso versus zzso zzso zzso of difference, zzso to zzso 

Supply of the zzso cerebral artery by the carotid system occurs less often in patients with an zzso lobe zzso than in healthy zzso The same was true for the unaffected zzso of patients, which suggests that the zzso difference represents a zzso factor zzso collateral pathways after zzso of the zzso cerebral artery or its zzso rather than a consequence zzso of blood flow after zzso zzso
