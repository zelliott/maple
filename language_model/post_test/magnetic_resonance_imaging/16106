The zzso of frontal lobe zzso zzso in stroke patients is zzso We aimed to ascertain whether zzso zzso changes were more associated with zzso than with zzso lobe zzso zzso and zzso lobe zzso zzso 

Brain magnetic resonance images zzso from zzso Chinese zzso stroke patients were zzso zzso zzso was defined by a widely used visual rating zzso All patients were divided into zzso zzso and severe zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso lobe zzso The severity of white matter zzso zzso was rated with the zzso zzso Clinical and zzso features were compared among the zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to determine the risk factors of zzso and severe zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The frequency of zzso in our cohort was zzso zzso Severe zzso occurred in 30 zzso zzso Age, previous stroke, and zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso were independent risk factors of zzso Age and deep white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso were independent risk factors of severe zzso zzso and zzso were not independent risk factors of zzso and zzso 

zzso lobe zzso in zzso stroke patients may be associated with small vessel zzso The association between zzso and zzso was zzso over zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso which suggests that the frontal lobe may be vulnerable to zzso zzso zzso
