A retrospective zzso zzso 

To investigate differences between number of levels of zzso surgery for zzso spinal canal zzso zzso as decided by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and to investigate zzso reliability and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso 

Although the decision to carry out zzso surgery for zzso largely depends on the severity of zzso on imaging along with clinical findings, no universally accepted imaging criteria have been defined for determining severity of zzso The decision to carry out zzso surgery for zzso thus seems relatively zzso and would differ according to both observer and the findings of zzso zzso 

We zzso selected 50 patients with zzso who underwent zzso zzso Mean patient age was 69 years, and mean number of levels carried out zzso surgery was zzso Each of 4 spine surgeons zzso decided levels of zzso surgery 4 times, according to the findings of zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated differences between number of levels of zzso surgery decided by zzso and zzso with zzso and also investigated zzso reliability and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso 

The number of levels of zzso surgery as decided by zzso with zzso was significantly greater than that by zzso zzso zzso for zzso reliability and zzso zzso revealed zzso with zzso as more reliable and zzso than zzso 

The number of levels of zzso surgery for zzso as decided by zzso would be less than that by zzso with zzso zzso with zzso is more reliable and zzso than zzso for zzso evaluation of zzso
