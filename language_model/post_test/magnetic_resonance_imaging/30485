Memory and zzso zzso are among the zzso of traumatic brain injury zzso The Neurological zzso zzso zzso includes 10 tasks and was previously designed to assess the functional status of mice after zzso The object recognition task zzso measures specific episodic memory and is expressed by the percent time spent by an animal at a novel, unfamiliar object zzso Index zzso It is an ideal tool for evaluating cognitive function after zzso The present study sought to validate the use of the zzso and zzso in severe and mild focal zzso in mice, and to confirm that the spontaneous recovery and the zzso zzso shown by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso are dependent upon injury zzso Mice were subjected to severe and mild closed head injury zzso at 1 h zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated for 25 days and showed a decrease by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso units in the severely and mildly injured mice, zzso zzso revealed zzso in severely injured group of zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso in zzso zzso on day 3 and zzso zzso zzso on day zzso In contrast, the mildly injured mice did not show cognitive impairment throughout the same zzso The damage seen by zzso at 24 h after injury, strongly correlated with zzso (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a reliable tool for evaluation of neurological damage in zzso mice, zzso predicts the motor dysfunction, cognitive damage, and zzso characteristics as depicted by zzso zzso The combined assessment of zzso and cognitive function along with zzso is most useful in evaluating recovery from injury, especially when testing effectiveness of novel treatments or genetic zzso
