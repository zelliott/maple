zzso zzso and zzso accelerate the progression of zzso but clinical tools to zzso these factors in patients are zzso Here, we evaluated the use of two magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques, zzso zzso and blood oxygen zzso zzso to assess kidney zzso and zzso of the zzso in 142 patients with either diabetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without diabetes zzso zzso zzso or acute kidney injury zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso values of zzso correlated with estimated zzso zzso rates zzso in the diabetic zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso values of zzso and zzso displayed good correlation in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso we did not observe a significant correlation between these values in the diabetic zzso group, suggesting that factors other than zzso zzso determine the degree of zzso in the zzso zzso In the zzso group, neither the zzso nor zzso values correlated with zzso Renal zzso from patients with zzso demonstrated that the zzso and zzso zzso values correlated with zzso zzso Taken together, zzso and zzso values appear to serve as accurate zzso for evaluating zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso zzso can thus contribute to zzso zzso in zzso assessment of kidney zzso
