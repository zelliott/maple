zzso resonance imaging zzso has provided important information in characterizing zzso lateral sclerosis zzso in humans and in animal zzso A frequently used animal model to study mechanisms of zzso and the efficacy of drugs in ALS is a transgenic mouse zzso the human zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso In our study, we applied zzso to find suitable progression zzso which can be used to monitor the development of ALS and to evaluate therapeutic approaches at early stages of the zzso zzso we generated zzso maps of the zzso relaxation time zzso and the apparent diffusion zzso zzso starting at day 70 after birth, zzso before motor scores decline around day zzso Depending on the progression of the disease, zzso mice showed significantly increased values of zzso in the brain stem motor zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso compared to zzso zzso mice and transgenic mice zzso the zzso zzso human zzso zzso Similar effects in these motor zzso were revealed by zzso zzso Furthermore, in the upper spinal cord, a zzso difference with significantly higher zzso values in the zzso part was demonstrated by zzso zzso While both zzso and zzso might prove useful as progression markers and enable the zzso zzso evaluation of ALS in zzso mice, the potential is limited by zzso effects in case of zzso zzso
