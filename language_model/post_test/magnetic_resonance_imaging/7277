Eight zzso children developed isolated lateral zzso following shunt zzso for progressive zzso after closure of a zzso In all patients a zzso zzso slit valve zzso system preceded development of an isolated zzso zzso Six of 8 children required a second zzso shunt for a symptomatic isolated zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated a collapsed zzso zzso to the shunt secondary to distortion of the zzso of zzso This was clearly depicted using three-dimensional color reconstructions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso slit valves should be avoided in zzso children to prevent zzso zzso zzso
