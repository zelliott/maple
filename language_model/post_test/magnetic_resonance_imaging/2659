Thirty chronic rotator cuff tears were repaired zzso and evaluated zzso using a precise zzso description of the tear that included the rotator zzso the zzso functional score, and an assessment of the zzso state and the zzso of the zzso muscle by zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso Early correlations zzso zzso zzso zzso attempted to define zzso factors of the final outcome of the repair, physical factors indicative of final zzso state, and zzso evolution of zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso views showed that zzso zzso correlated with the zzso and zzso extent of the tear and represented a strong zzso factor of zzso zzso At zzso 15 zzso cuffs were continuous and thick, seven zzso were continuous but thin, and six zzso were zzso Two zzso cuffs had been repaired only zzso In the group with a persistent zzso zzso strength and differential zzso score were correlated with the final zzso state with no excellent or good results, and with less than 4 zzso of zzso zzso zzso improved in 18 of the 22 zzso continuous cuffs, but never decreased in persistent tears, although there was pain relief and functional zzso
