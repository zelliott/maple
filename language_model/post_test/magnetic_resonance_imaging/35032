White matter zzso zzso have been proven to be associated with cognitive zzso As zzso the decline of cognitive function is the most frequent zzso disorder in zzso and zzso patients with zzso have a relatively high prevalence of zzso the question is raised whether zzso in patients with zzso are also associated with cognitive zzso 

A high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso with impaired and zzso cognitive functioning and a healthy control group were zzso Furthermore, the performance of an automated zzso detection algorithm, based on regional intensity zzso was zzso 

The prevalence of zzso detected on zzso T zzso images, is zzso in healthy volunteers and zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso No relationship between zzso volume and cognitive performance was zzso The zzso volumes from the automated zzso method were found to be significantly correlated to the volumes obtained by zzso zzso 

No relations could be found between zzso and zzso in the zzso population of patients with zzso Other clinical characteristics of chronic zzso such as seizures, age of zzso and medication are more likely to play an important role in cognitive zzso Furthermore, the automated zzso detection zzso using a regional zzso analysis can successfully segment and zzso the zzso on zzso zzso
