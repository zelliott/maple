The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso characteristics and pathology related to the formation of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso patients with zzso were examined by zzso and cerebral zzso The zzso factors possibly related to zzso zzso such as patient age, sex, tumor location, tumor size, zzso rim zzso zzso shape of tumor margin, signal intensity of tumor in zzso zzso blood supply, and pathology, were zzso We defined the zzso volume ratio as zzso and used this index to evaluate zzso zzso 

Male sex zzso zzso zzso tumor size zzso zzso zzso signal intensity of tumor in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood supply zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso on zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso blood supply was statistically significant as a factor for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Male sex zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso might have statistical probability in zzso zzso 

In our results, male sex, zzso on zzso and zzso blood supply were associated with zzso zzso in zzso that influence the clinical prognosis of zzso
