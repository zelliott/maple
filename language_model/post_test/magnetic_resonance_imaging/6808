This work investigated how the quality of prior information zzso data acquired during the training zzso influences zzso zzso zzso The impact of several factors, such as the amount of training data, the presence of spatial zzso in the training data, and the effects of zzso was investigated with simulations and in zzso zzso It is shown that zzso zzso zzso sliding window zzso even with very limited training zzso By increasing the amount of training data, reconstruction error continues to decrease, albeit by a diminishing zzso However, an increased amount of training data also increases zzso to zzso of the training zzso zzso of the training data with the goal of reducing zzso artifacts had only minor impact on reconstruction zzso Considering the balance among obtaining the most benefit from the training data, minimizing zzso to zzso and keeping data acquisition to a zzso it is concluded that in cardiac imaging the training zzso should be limited to zzso profiles in zzso for a typical field of zzso The training data may be acquired in a separate zzso without much penalty, if care is taken to minimize zzso such as with a zzso
