The avian zzso provides a multifaceted model to study zzso mechanisms because of its accessibility to zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso imaging, and molecular zzso Early two-dimensional zzso growth of the avian zzso mimics human development and provides unique access to complex cell migration patterns using light zzso Later zzso events continue to permit access to both light and other imaging zzso making the avian zzso an excellent model for zzso zzso For example, significant insights into cell and tissue behaviors within the primitive streak, zzso region, and cardiovascular and peripheral nervous systems have come from avian zzso zzso In this review, we provide an update to recent advances in zzso and tissue slice culture and imaging, zzso cell zzso and gene zzso We focus on how technical advances in the chick and quail provide a clearer understanding of how embryonic cell dynamics are beautifully choreographed in space and time to zzso cells into functioning zzso We zzso how these technical advances help us to better understand basic zzso mechanisms that may lead to clinical research into human birth defects and tissue zzso
