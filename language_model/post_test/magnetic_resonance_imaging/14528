In concert with zzso control areas of the zzso the zzso shows differential zzso patterns during a variety of zzso zzso However, the spatial details and extent of the complex and zzso zzso systems involved in action control remain zzso In this study, we use intrinsic functional connectivity zzso to examine zzso networks of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that have been zzso identified to form the functional basis of zzso zzso A refined zzso zzso selection allowed us to identify a network of primary zzso and supplementary motor areas zzso a network of zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions zzso and two largely overlapping networks involving zzso and superior zzso regions, the zzso junction as well as zzso regions zzso All networks involved the zzso zzso zzso These cerebral clusters were used in a partial correlation analysis to systematically map cerebral connectivity throughout the entire zzso We discuss these findings in the framework of affective and cognitive control, zzso zzso systems, and zzso zzso Within the zzso we found that zzso systems seem to run in zzso as indicated by distinct zzso functional topography of zzso zzso zzso cingulate, and zzso zzso However, all areas showed overlapping connectivity to various degrees in both zzso The results of both analyses demonstrate that different zzso parts of the zzso zzso may dominate in different aspects of primary or zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso organization provides a more detailed structure for zzso interaction which contributes to our understanding of complex motor zzso
