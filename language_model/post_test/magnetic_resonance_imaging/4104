The zzso has anatomical connections to the cerebral cortex, through which it can affect language zzso To study these connections, we investigated patients with chronic zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We selected 15 such patients (9 male, 6 female, aged zzso years, mean age 56 zzso from 30 chronically zzso zzso Using the results of zzso we divided them into patients with zzso 1) and without zzso 2) crossed zzso zzso zzso We compared the language function of the two zzso Patients in group 1 showed classical zzso zzso while patients in group 2 showed mainly zzso zzso Patients with zzso hat zzso involving the lower part of the frontal zzso but patients without zzso did not, which suggests that this region may have functional and anatomical connections with the zzso Our findings support the notion that the zzso contributes to zzso
