zzso memory deficits are proposed as a potential intermediate zzso of zzso We examined deficits in visual episodic memory and associated brain zzso differences among early course schizophrenia zzso first-degree relatives zzso and healthy controls without personal or family history of psychotic disorders zzso Study participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging on a zzso scanner while performing visual episodic memory zzso and retrieval zzso We examined zzso behavioral performance evaluating response time and accuracy of zzso zzso zzso response differences were analyzed using zzso correcting for multiple zzso There was an incremental increase in response time among the study groups zzso zzso zzso with no differences in accuracy for zzso Response time for retrieval was significantly increased in schizophrenia subjects compared to healthy controls with no difference in zzso Although there were no significant differences in zzso responses for the zzso task, we noted increased zzso response to retrieval in the prefrontal regions zzso areas 9 and zzso zzso and zzso among the schizophrenia subjects compared to healthy controls, and first-degree zzso zzso risk for schizophrenia may be associated with zzso similar but zzso milder abnormalities in visual episodic memory retrieval but not for zzso in the prefrontal zzso and zzso
