We sought to compare zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the assessment of zzso zzso 

Thirty-four patients with prior zzso zzso underwent zzso and zzso zzso The area of delayed enhancement by zzso was defined as zzso zzso The region with zzso reduced zzso and zzso metabolism was defined as zzso zzso In a zzso model, the zzso extent of zzso was compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All segments were divided into five different zzso by zzso extent of zzso in zzso and were classified into different viability situations by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

A total of zzso segments were zzso zzso and specificity of zzso in identifying segments with zzso match were zzso and zzso zzso zzso assessed relative zzso zzso tissue correlated well with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, of the 431 segments defined as normal by zzso 82 segments zzso were scored as zzso by zzso zzso During these zzso 48 showed less than 50% reduced zzso zzso 25 showed zzso reduced zzso zzso and nine showed no zzso zzso 

zzso zzso as a marker of zzso zzso closely agrees with zzso and zzso zzso Nuclear technology and zzso show their own predominance and limitation in assessment of zzso viability and detecting zzso injured zzso
