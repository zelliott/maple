This study was designed to evaluate a potentially important source of error in zzso zzso measurement unique to zzso multiple sclerosis treatment trials that would not be detected by the standard zzso and zzso error zzso The effect of this zzso of serial zzso was tested by using the zzso zzso approach and a modified zzso space zzso approach applied to a database of five consecutive zzso To simulate the conditions of a zzso treatment trial, each patient had immediate repeat MR studies of the brain with imperfect head zzso The study hypothesis was confirmed that with an improved quantitative methodology, the zzso of serial zzso zzso zzso would exceed the zzso zzso
