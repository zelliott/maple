zzso stabilizer muscle response and zzso zzso were evaluated in 19 women with anterior knee pain zzso and 20 healthy women during maximum voluntary zzso contraction zzso with the knee positioned at zzso zzso and zzso zzso during open zzso and closed zzso kinetic chain zzso zzso zzso was evaluated through zzso tilt and zzso and the electrical activity of zzso zzso through the root mean square zzso during zzso and zzso with the knee at zzso zzso Data revealed that the zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso was more active in the control group compared to the zzso group during zzso exercises with the knee at zzso zzso However, no difference in the zzso zzso was observed between these zzso zzso the correlation between these parameters also zzso with the knee at zzso zzso that lateral zzso tilt increase was associated with a reduction in the activity of lateral zzso zzso in the control group and with an increase in the zzso activity in the zzso zzso In conclusion, electrical activity is an important factor in evaluating zzso and in zzso treatment zzso
