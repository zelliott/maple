A quantitative analysis of scalp electric fields in patients suffering from zzso zzso lobe zzso was performed in order to study the development of rhythmic zzso activities over zzso 

A method that zzso zzso zzso maps in the frequency domain zzso was applied to zzso zzso recordings in 10 zzso zzso The onset of the zzso dominant frequency was determined and its zzso evolution over a time period of 46 s around the zzso zzso onset was zzso The analysis was completed by a linear inverse solution that estimated the sources of the dominant zzso 

This method permitted the identification of an zzso dominant frequency which started on the average prior to the onset of initial zzso signs as determined by visual zzso The frequency zzso during the evolution of the seizure in all zzso The linear inverse solution zzso localized the source of this frequency to the brain region which was clinically determined as the site of seizure onset and whose zzso rendered all patients zzso 

Our data suggest that the constant increase of the zzso dominant frequency is related to the amount of zzso lobe tissue generating the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso electric fields can be reliably used to detect focal pathological activity early during seizure onset arising in deep structures such as the zzso zzso zzso
