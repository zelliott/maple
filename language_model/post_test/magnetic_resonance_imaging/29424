zzso zzso is commonly found in zzso lobe zzso zzso but its zzso remains incompletely zzso We hypothesized that zzso changes reflect the preferential networks involved by zzso zzso We zzso the topography of zzso zzso according to zzso patterns in 50 patients with unilateral zzso sclerosis zzso and consistent features of zzso Based on zzso zzso we identified four groups: zzso zzso group (13 zzso characterized by zzso seizure onset without evidence of early spread beyond the zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso group zzso 18 zzso with early anterior spread involving the anterior lateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso widespread zzso group zzso 15 zzso with wide spread zzso both anterior and zzso lateral zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso group (four zzso with early zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso imaging in each group were compared with those of 10 control subjects using statistical zzso mapping software zzso zzso data and surgical outcome in each group were compared with zzso zzso zzso was limited to zzso zzso zzso pole and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso involvement of lateral zzso cortex, zzso and zzso areas was observed in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso group differed from the others with mild zzso involvement, bilateral insular zzso and longer zzso zzso zzso structural abnormalities outside of the zzso zzso were detected in zzso of the zzso Neither the severity of HS nor zzso zzso appeared related to the topography of zzso However, zzso zzso was more extended when zzso signal changes were zzso Among operated patients zzso zzso zzso zzso outcome was obtained in zzso zzso outcome appeared more zzso in the zzso zzso However, the difference between the four groups was not zzso Our results suggest that zzso in zzso may be related to zzso discharge generation and spread zzso even if structural changes and zzso duration may also play a zzso
