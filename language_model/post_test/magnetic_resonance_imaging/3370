Surface area of the cerebral zzso is a highly zzso zzso yet little is known about genetic influences on regional cortical differentiation in zzso Using a zzso fuzzy zzso technique with magnetic resonance imaging data from zzso zzso we zzso cortical surface area into genetic zzso creating a human brain zzso based solely on genetically zzso zzso zzso of the genetic divisions corresponded largely to meaningful structural and functional zzso however, the divisions represented previously zzso zzso different from conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso The genetic organization of cortical area was zzso zzso and predominantly zzso zzso across zzso We also found that the results were consistent with zzso regions being subdivisions of previously zzso genetically based zzso zzso zzso
