Central nervous system zzso drainage may occur via connections to the zzso but in animal models up to 50% occurs via zzso zzso and primitive zzso drainage to cervical zzso zzso We evaluated zzso of particles from the brain to cervical zzso zzso in normal rats, using zzso iron zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso or intravenous injection of zzso in normal Long Evans rats, particle zzso was assessed by zzso and zzso for iron and the zzso coat zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso injection, but not zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso signal changes in the deep cervical zzso zzso around the carotid artery, and, less zzso in the superficial cervical zzso Within 2 h of zzso administration, iron was zzso localized in cervical zzso zzso with patched zzso of capsule and peripheral zzso consistent with delivery via multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in groups receiving zzso zzso was significantly different from controls zzso zzso zzso and was significantly localized in the deep zzso superficial cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The trafficking of the zzso iron particles from the zzso in the rat could be zzso by zzso and zzso zzso provides a powerful tool to rapidly assess drainage of zzso particles from the zzso
