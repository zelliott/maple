Selective attention is the cognitive process of selecting and processing the task relevant information and ignoring the task irrelevant zzso Though the neural zzso involved in this cognitive process are well established, the mechanism of selection process is the point of zzso To study the effect of selection process on the information processing we performed functional zzso on 23 healthy zzso male subjects while performing a modified face word zzso zzso The word processing area did not show any attention dependent changes in the level of activity whereas the activity of face processing area was higher when the faces were target, but there was no decrease in baseline activity when faces were zzso Our results suggest that during selective attention there is no zzso of sensory processing for automatically processed stimuli like words whereas there is amplification of task relevant information when stimuli are processed in controlled zzso
