The purpose of this work was to define the characteristic MR features of zzso zzso zzso and to correlate the zzso pool with the signal intensity of this zzso 

zzso of 12 cases of zzso proven zzso zzso containing zzso was zzso We analyzed the signal intensity of tumor on zzso and zzso MR images and correlated the area of zzso high signal intensity on zzso images with the zzso pool on the zzso zzso Two zzso independently estimated the area of high signal intensity in the tumor on zzso images and one pathologist estimated the amount of zzso pool in the zzso zzso 

In 9 zzso of 12 cases, focal or diffuse high signal intensity areas were detected on zzso fast spin echo zzso In seven cases in which zzso pools were seen zzso partial zzso zzso 3) or diffuse high signal intensity areas were noted on the zzso zzso Among the five cases in which microscopic zzso pools were detected on the zzso zzso three cases showed no high signal zzso on MR images, and in the remaining two cases, high signal intensity areas were noted as small zzso 

zzso high signal intensity on zzso fast spin echo MR images occurs in zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso pools on zzso zzso
