zzso zzso of gray and white matter volume is common in studies involving elderly patient zzso The aim of the present study was to describe the effects of not accounting for zzso white matter zzso zzso on tissue volumes in zzso Disease patients with varying degrees of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

An automated tissue zzso protocol that was zzso for an elderly population, a brain regional zzso zzso and a zzso zzso protocol were applied to measure tissue volumes zzso brain and regional zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso to zzso the volume of zzso zzso 

After application of the tissue zzso protocol and zzso analysis, mean total percentage zzso volume across all subjects was zzso zzso zzso of whole brain volume zzso for total zzso zzso Mean percentage of zzso tissue volumes for the severe group was zzso of whole brain, which translates to a mean volume zzso zzso Gray matter volume was most overestimated in the severe group, where zzso of the total gray matter volume was derived from zzso zzso The regional analysis showed that frontal zzso zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were most affected by tissue zzso 

zzso zzso studies of zzso Disease that do not account for zzso can expect an erroneous inflation of gray or white matter volumes, especially in the frontal and inferior zzso zzso To avoid this source of error, zzso zzso studies in patient populations susceptible to zzso should include a zzso zzso zzso
