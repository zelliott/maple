Second language zzso acquisition is more susceptible to environmental and idiosyncratic factors than first language zzso Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging for zzso learners of different ages of first exposure zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a formal school environment, and compared the cortical zzso involved in processing English sentences containing either zzso or spelling zzso where the testing ages and task performances of both groups were zzso We found novel zzso patterns in two regions of the left inferior frontal zzso zzso that correlated zzso with the performances of the late and early zzso Specifically, zzso of the zzso and zzso triangular part zzso of the left zzso correlated positively with the accuracy of the zzso task for the late zzso whereas zzso of the left zzso zzso correlated zzso with the accuracy for the early zzso In contrast, other cortical regions exhibited differential correlation patterns with the reaction times zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso part zzso of the left zzso as well as those of the left angular zzso correlated positively with the zzso for the late zzso whereas those zzso correlated zzso with the zzso for the early zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso of the left zzso was maintained for both the late and early zzso These results explain individual differences in zzso zzso such that the acquisition of linguistic knowledge in zzso is zzso by at least two distinct inferior frontal regions of the left zzso and zzso
