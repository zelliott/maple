As tissue oxygen tension zzso is an important variable in cancer therapy, it would be of major clinical benefit to be able to measure zzso zzso Current methods for determining zzso in clinical settings are limited to superficial zzso The authors measured the apparent diffusion constant zzso in an implanted zzso zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging and correlated the zzso with tissue zzso measured by electron zzso resonance zzso The zzso zzso significantly with tissue zzso in this tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and so may provide a zzso index of zzso in zzso
