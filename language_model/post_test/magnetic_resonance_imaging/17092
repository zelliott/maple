The aim of the study was to evaluate the zzso changes that occur in the zzso and zzso zzso tissue in patients with rotator cuff tear trying to correlate these changes to their healing zzso 

zzso patients were clinically evaluated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed preoperatively and ultrasound were performed zzso For each patient, a biopsy of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed, and the specimens were zzso zzso 

zzso zzso features consisted of loss of structural organization, poor or absent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso features consisted of zzso absence of zzso zzso zzso and absence of zzso zzso correlation was seen between zzso and zzso zzso and time of the onset of zzso between zzso zzso zzso fibrosis, zzso zzso zzso and patient zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso fibrosis, zzso zzso zzso and zzso size; on the contrary, zzso fibrosis, zzso and zzso tissue inflammation decrease as time passes from the onset of zzso zzso fibers zzso zzso and inflammation decreases as the patient's age zzso zzso tissue zzso decreases as zzso size zzso 

zzso zzso techniques should be employed routinely to assess the tissue quality, with the aim to predict future clinical evolution zzso or zzso Comparing the zzso data with the zzso information and the descriptive statistics, it is possible to define the zzso repair at risk and identify which zzso will be able to zzso
