Previous studies have shown that magnetic resonance imaging zzso is sensitive to white matter changes in children receiving zzso radiation of zzso zzso or zzso The current study used zzso to investigate the integrity of white matter in children receiving zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso Ten survivors of acute zzso leukemia zzso who received zzso zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso zzso of zzso radiation were studied with zzso and zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso scans were normal in nine of ten zzso One patient had prominent and zzso lateral zzso and mildly enlarged cortical zzso White matter tracts were normal in zzso However, seven of nine children had below average intellectual zzso zzso indicate that children receiving less than zzso zzso of zzso radiation fail to show white matter changes on zzso despite evidence of cognitive zzso
