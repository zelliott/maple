Although it is important to evaluate the zzso zzso in patients with zzso syndrome, it is difficult to depict its zzso even by MR zzso Using zzso studies of the direction of nerve fibers around the zzso zzso we attempted to depict this entity with zzso zzso MR imaging to evaluate its zzso changes in patients with Parkinson's disease and secondary zzso 

We measured the zzso zzso on 72 zzso zzso MR images obtained in 36 healthy control subjects, on 47 images obtained in 25 patients with Parkinson's disease, and on 10 images obtained in five patients with secondary zzso We considered the zzso of the minor axis of the zzso zzso as its zzso which appeared as a zzso region in the zzso 

zzso imaging portrayed the zzso zzso distinctly better than did zzso imaging, because the surrounding white matter appeared as an area of high signal zzso The mean zzso zzso thickness values of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso in control subjects, zzso zzso in patients with Parkinson's disease, and zzso zzso in patients with secondary zzso 

zzso zzso imaging is a better imaging technique than zzso imaging for demonstrating a change in size of the zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso is not reduced in size in patients with Parkinson's disease, but it is reduced in patients with secondary zzso
