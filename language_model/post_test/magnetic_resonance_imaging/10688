Recent imaging studies have suggested that zzso changes may parallel aspects of adult learning in cortical zzso becoming less diffuse and more focal over zzso However, while adult learning studies examine changes within subjects, zzso findings have been based on zzso samples and even comparisons across zzso Here, we used functional zzso in children to test directly for shifts in cortical activity during performance of a cognitive control task, in a combined zzso and zzso zzso Our zzso findings, relative to our zzso ones, show attenuated zzso in zzso prefrontal cortical areas, paralleled by increased focal zzso in zzso prefrontal regions related to task zzso
