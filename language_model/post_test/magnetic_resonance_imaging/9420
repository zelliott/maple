The main therapeutic approach for zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso of the zzso zzso is wide local zzso Sacrifice of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso often is required to obtain complete zzso and therefore can be associated with significant zzso While peripheral nerve repair is commonly used in the setting of traumatic nerve injury, little is known about its potential use in the treatment of zzso 

We present a patient with an enlarging right neck mass who was diagnosed with zzso of the zzso zzso The patient underwent gross total zzso of the zzso requiring zzso of the upper trunk of the zzso zzso as well as associated zzso Following zzso zzso nerve zzso were used to connect the zzso nerve root to the anterior division of the upper trunk and the spinal accessory nerve to the zzso zzso whereas a zzso branch of the zzso nerve was zzso directly to the anterior division of the zzso zzso 

By 20 months after surgery, the patient had regained significant strength in her upper trunk distribution and demonstrated no evidence of tumor zzso zzso zzso reconstruction offers a potentially valuable surgical adjunct to zzso zzso
