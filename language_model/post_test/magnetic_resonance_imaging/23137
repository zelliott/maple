Variations of response time zzso in selective attention tasks are often associated with variations of activity and functional connectivity in sensory zzso that process relevant zzso Here, we investigated whether such relationships are influenced by spatial zzso To investigate this hypothesis, we asked zzso healthy adults to perform a covert spatial attention task, which made use of bilateral stimulus displays, while we recorded their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso As expected, activity in the middle zzso zzso increased when spatial attention was directed to the zzso zzso the zzso visual zzso Surprisingly, variations of zzso were not associated with variations in the magnitude of this zzso zzso As predicted, however, they were linked to opposing variations of functional connectivity between middle zzso regions zzso (but not zzso to the attended visual field and the left zzso zzso which is thought to figure prominently in the zzso processing of visually presented zzso These findings suggest that zzso variations of zzso zzso at least zzso zzso variations in the extent to which spatial attention enhances functional connectivity between sensory regions that process relevant zzso
