zzso zzso plaques may be identified by their large zzso zzso particularly liquid zzso zzso zzso covered by a zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso would identify mobile zzso in zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso Human carotid zzso specimens zzso zzso 10) were zzso ex zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso at high field zzso zzso utilizing standard zzso and zzso spin echo zzso MRS zzso were acquired from 1 zzso zzso localized to plaque regions that we judged by zzso to be zzso rich or zzso zzso The zzso revealed zzso and zzso zzso of fatty zzso chains with relative zzso and zzso characteristic of pure zzso by comparison with zzso zzso zzso judged to be zzso rich by zzso showed much more intense zzso zzso than did zzso zzso The integrated zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso water peak zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution by zzso zzso and zzso showed strong zzso zzso zzso MRS accurately identified zzso in selected regions of zzso plaque as small as 1 zzso in an ex zzso zzso This procedure may permit the zzso detection and zzso of zzso in zzso plaque in zzso
