Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso over pelvic zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso for local staging of prostate zzso However, few have studied which evaluation is more accurate at 3 zzso zzso In this study, we compared the accuracy of local staging of prostate cancer using pelvic zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso 

Between January 2005 and May 2010, 151 patients underwent radical zzso All patients were evaluated with either pelvic zzso zzso or zzso zzso prostate zzso prior to surgery zzso zzso coils and 88 pelvic zzso zzso zzso stage based on zzso was compared with zzso zzso We calculated the zzso sensitivity and accuracy of each group in the evaluation of zzso extension and seminal zzso zzso 

Both zzso zzso and pelvic zzso zzso zzso achieved high zzso low sensitivity and moderate accuracy for the detection of zzso extension and seminal zzso zzso There were statistically no differences in zzso sensitivity and accuracy between the two zzso 

zzso staging zzso sensitivity and specificity were not significantly different between zzso zzso and pelvic zzso zzso zzso
