To describe our experience of the magnetic resonance imaging zzso appearances after zzso zzso focusing on the normal pattern of zzso changes in signal intensity within the zzso zzso and appearances of local disease zzso 

This was a retrospective review of the records of patients identified on our zzso zzso database who had undergone zzso zzso at our zzso zzso were divided into one group consisting of zzso zzso findings and another group demonstrating local zzso zzso zzso findings were assessed for signal intensity, zzso and presence of the zzso texture zzso within the zzso zzso zzso were grouped according to time from zzso zzso demonstrating local recurrence were assessed for site, signal intensity, zzso and zzso dimensions of zzso zzso zzso was made to zzso zzso 

Thirty-five patients with zzso MR images were zzso zzso examinations were reviewed zzso zzso per zzso The zzso zzso comprised 18 patients zzso female, 11 male, mean age 44 years, range zzso zzso with 47 examinations zzso The zzso texture zzso was preserved in all examinations in this zzso Up to 6 months after surgery, zzso (10) of examinations showed zzso zzso and zzso inversion recovery zzso signals within the muscle zzso indicating zzso Only after 4 years was the muscle zzso signal zzso in all cases zzso Up to 6 months after surgery, 50% (5 of 10) of examinations demonstrated zzso zzso but after 1 year, zzso zzso showed zzso Twenty percent (2 of 10) of examinations zzso months from surgery showed zzso zzso signal within the muscle zzso consistent with fatty zzso but after 2 years, zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso group comprised 20 patients (six female, 14 male, mean age zzso years, range zzso zzso with 30 examinations demonstrating zzso disease or zzso There were 23 zzso zzso of which zzso (10) were in the muscle component of the zzso zzso zzso (3 of zzso were in subcutaneous zzso of the zzso zzso (3 of zzso were at the zzso margin of the bone zzso and zzso (3 of zzso were zzso All zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso and STIR zzso The signal intensity pattern of recurrence closely followed that of the original zzso The zzso texture zzso was absent in all examinations demonstrating recurrence in muscle zzso 

A pattern of zzso signal intensity and zzso changes is observed within normal zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso disease is most likely to occur within the muscle zzso typically of high zzso signal intensity and characteristically follows the signal pattern of the original zzso
