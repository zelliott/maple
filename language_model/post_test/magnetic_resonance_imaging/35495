zzso knowledge of the structures to be targeted and of the zzso involved is crucial in zzso functional zzso The present study was undertaken in the context of surgical treatment of motor disorders such as essential zzso zzso and Parkinson's disease zzso to precisely determine the course and three-dimensional zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso tracts in the human zzso The course of the zzso tracts to the zzso was traced in the zzso region using multiple zzso procedures and their entrance into the zzso determined according to our zzso of the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso Healthcare zzso New zzso zzso three-dimensional coordinates were determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocks parallel to zzso planes and, in two cases, by correlation with magnetic resonance images zzso from the same brains prior to zzso The major contributions of this study are to zzso zzso evidence that the zzso of the zzso and zzso tracts are clearly separated up to their zzso entrance, zzso zzso maps of the two tracts in the zzso region, zzso the possibility to discriminate between different zzso zzso tracts on the basis of zzso zzso zzso correlations of zzso identified zzso tracts with high-resolution zzso and zzso evaluation of the zzso zzso of the zzso systems in the zzso zzso This study should provide an important basis for accurate zzso zzso targeting of the zzso region in motor disorders such as zzso and zzso
