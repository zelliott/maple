This study examined in a regional cohort of 66 term age very low birth weight zzso the relationship between qualitative magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures of cerebral white and gray matter abnormalities and infant zzso functioning assessed by structured neurological zzso The diagnostic utility of the zzso zzso neurological examination in identifying children with severe cerebral abnormalities was also zzso zzso results revealed the presence of high rates of neurological zzso with zzso of infants scoring in the zzso range relative to infants born full zzso Linear associations were found between the severity of structural cerebral zzso on zzso and the quality of clinically rated infant zzso zzso with increasing abnormalities being significantly associated with poorer neurological zzso In particular, white matter abnormalities were significantly associated with lower mean tone and tone pattern scores and a tendency toward lower mean zzso zzso Gray matter abnormalities were significantly associated with lower tone and tone pattern scores and a tendency toward lower spontaneous movements and zzso zzso Finally, the zzso Neonatal Neurological zzso was found to have relatively good sensitivity zzso negative zzso value, zzso but poor specificity zzso positive zzso value, zzso for identifying children with significant zzso zzso zzso of these findings for the neurological evaluation of the very low birth weight infant are zzso
