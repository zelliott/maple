zzso aging is accompanied by a range of structural and functional differences in the brain, even in the absence of neurodegenerative zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have reported increased bilateral zzso during task performance in elderly participants compared to their younger counterparts, particularly in frontal zzso zzso have also been observed in the functional architecture of the resting brain, suggesting that aging is associated with changes in the organization of the networks of the zzso However, previous studies have largely focused on the default mode network, and little is known about the effects of age on other resting zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate zzso in resting state functional connectivity zzso using zzso data obtained during rest from zzso healthy participants aged zzso zzso Using independent component analysis zzso and zzso the results revealed age-related increases in zzso across a range of zzso including zzso networks in frontal and zzso zzso In contrast, age-related reductions in the default mode network and zzso visual networks were zzso Furthermore, whereas the effects of age on the various zzso were found independent of age-related decreases in gray matter volume, sex and subject motion, we report strong positive and widespread effects of estimated subject motion on the zzso across zzso The results provide support for the notion of zzso effects in aging, zzso as increased zzso zzso of zzso networks, supporting zzso cognitive functions and cognitive control, along with reduced zzso default mode network and sensory visual networks during zzso The present results also corroborate recent evidence of strong influence of subject motion on estimated functional connectivity measures and strongly suggest that studies using zzso measures as imaging zzso should adjust for individual differences in zzso subject zzso
