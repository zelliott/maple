To explore the diagnostic potential of zzso transfer ratio zzso zzso analysis in patients with zzso systemic lupus zzso zzso by using zzso zzso analysis zzso 

zzso zzso transfer imaging was performed in nine patients with active zzso zzso zzso 10 patients with zzso who had had zzso zzso zzso 10 patients with zzso but no history of zzso zzso 10 patients with inactive multiple zzso and 10 healthy control zzso For each subject, an zzso zzso of the whole brain was generated, and an zzso score was produced for each zzso Each patient was assigned to a clinical zzso on the basis of these zzso zzso For assignment, zzso comparisons between zzso were zzso The accuracy of this zzso method was assessed and compared with that of conventional zzso zzso zzso 

With zzso the success rate of zzso zzso was zzso depending on which two groups were zzso When the different clinical zzso were zzso zzso parameters were always better than conventional zzso zzso zzso with P values ranging zzso to less than 1 zzso zzso of those attained with the best conventional zzso 

With zzso zzso zzso of brain tissue may provide diagnostic information for individual patients in the clinical context of zzso
