This study was performed to test whether the zzso rate of free zzso zzso from zzso zzso is significantly increased when the contrast agent is dissolved in ethanol and whether the magnetic resonance zzso signal of zzso solutions is enhanced to a degree that promises reliable detection during MR zzso zzso administration, such as for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso 

The apparent zzso zzso enhancement of the zzso zzso relaxation rate of sterile zzso solutions, stored at a temperature of 24 degrees C zzso 5 degrees C in the dark, was monitored for 2 zzso The content of zzso zzso zzso was determined after 6 and zzso months of zzso The signal difference between contrast zzso solutions and muscle tissue was assessed with imaging at zzso T and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso diluted with zzso ethanol was not shown to have released toxic zzso during storage times that exceed its zzso circulation and zzso times after intravenous injection by a factor of more than zzso A maximum zzso rate of zzso per month was estimated from the detection limit of the zzso The apparent zzso zzso of the contrast agent in the zzso varied by less than zzso zzso per second with no zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast increased with zzso zzso to zzso of 15 zzso (at zzso zzso and 25 zzso (at zzso zzso 

Neither limited zzso nor release of zzso zzso could be identified as a general safety hazard associated with the application of zzso zzso solutions at zzso zzso of zzso zzso and such zzso zzso could be efficiently and reliably zzso
