Evaluate zzso the contribution of focal cortical zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and traditional zzso metrics of brain damage to zzso disability and cognitive performance in a zzso multiple sclerosis zzso zzso 

Thirty-four patients with early or established disease including clinically isolated syndrome, zzso zzso and secondary progressive zzso were scanned on a human zzso zzso zzso scanner to acquire fast zzso shot zzso zzso images for characterization of white matter and deep gray matter zzso volume, and zzso zzso Patients also underwent anatomical zzso zzso for cortical thickness zzso and zzso testing within 1 week of the zzso zzso zzso patient scans were acceptable for further zzso zzso disability was measured using the Expanded zzso zzso zzso 

Type zzso zzso had the strongest relationship to physical disability zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso White matter zzso volume and type I zzso are each significantly associated with 6 of 11 zzso test zzso Type zzso zzso significantly correlate with 4 of 11 zzso test variables whereas type II zzso deep gray matter zzso volume, and cortical thickness metrics are less frequently associated with cognitive zzso 

zzso zzso I) and zzso zzso zzso identified on zzso zzso sequences are potential cortical zzso of cognitive and zzso status in zzso
