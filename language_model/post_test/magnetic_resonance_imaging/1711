The purpose of our study was to describe patterns of airway zzso identified on zzso imaging in infants and children with either right zzso arch and zzso left zzso artery or left zzso arch with zzso right zzso zzso 

Data from MR imaging and CT performed to evaluate pediatric patients for zzso airway zzso were reviewed for cases that revealed an zzso right or left zzso zzso zzso zzso and imaging findings in identified cases were zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso were reviewed among zzso 

Twelve patients with right zzso arch with zzso left zzso artery and nine patients with left zzso arch and zzso right zzso artery were zzso All 12 with right zzso arch with zzso left zzso artery had airway zzso zzso with multiple sites or diffuse zzso in zzso Of these 12 patients, nine had zzso at the level of the arch and zzso zzso artery (10 had zzso zzso and nine had zzso of the zzso airway in association with a zzso descending zzso Five of the nine patients with left zzso arch and zzso right zzso artery had airway zzso zzso all at the level of the arch and zzso zzso zzso None of these zzso was associated with either zzso zzso or zzso descending zzso 

Both right and left zzso zzso arteries can be associated with symptomatic airway zzso but the patterns of zzso are zzso The airway zzso in right zzso arch with zzso left zzso artery is often associated with either zzso zzso or zzso descending zzso whereas zzso associated with left zzso arch and zzso right zzso artery is zzso
