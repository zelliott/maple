The importance of the zzso zzso lobe in memory has been studied extensively at the zzso neural ensemble, and systems zzso In this report, we discuss recent systems level zzso results in relation to zzso studies of the zzso and related structures within the zzso zzso zzso By combining our knowledge across the cellular and systems levels we sought to gain theoretical insight and a better understanding of the function of the zzso and related zzso zzso lobe zzso The integration of information from studies carried out at the cellular and neural ensemble level with studies at the systems level is difficult because of the vast differences in spatial and zzso resolution of the different research zzso differences in zzso across species, and differences in the types of behavioral and cognitive zzso used in zzso nonhuman zzso and human zzso Despite these zzso and zzso differences, the zzso studies offer insight into many of the questions raised by recent zzso zzso For instance, there is zzso evidence that suggests that the zzso memory system is functionally heterogeneous, which may explain some of the discrepancies in the location and extent of zzso reported by different imaging studies of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we describe recent zzso models of the zzso which may be useful for bridging the gap between zzso and zzso zzso
