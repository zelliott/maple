zzso volume determination of the zzso zzso is of importance in several clinical conditions, including Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso and benign zzso zzso Previous studies have investigated the accuracy with which magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be used in clinical practice to evaluate the zzso zzso However, adequate evaluation of pathological conditions depends on a sufficient amount of zzso data from normal zzso To begin establishing this data base for zzso subjects, we evaluated the zzso scans of 38 subjects found to have no apparent pathology and calculated the zzso volume in each case by using methods previously developed in our zzso The results were then compared with published volumes determined from studies that used either zzso casts or computerized zzso zzso The average total zzso volume for all 38 subjects was zzso zzso while that for males was zzso zzso and that for females was zzso zzso A small but significant correlation was found between age of subject and zzso volume, with zzso size increasing with zzso
