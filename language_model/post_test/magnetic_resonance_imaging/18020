zzso zzso is a movement disorder characterized by zzso zzso zzso postures and psychiatric zzso A zzso in the zzso gene zzso half of MD zzso We zzso that MD results from a dysfunctional zzso zzso network causing insufficient zzso motor zzso To test this hypothesis functional zzso zzso was performed using a validated zzso zzso task, in order to zzso zzso dependence zzso effects corresponding to Response zzso zzso 

zzso MD patients zzso zzso zzso and 24 matched controls responded with a button press to Go zzso or No go zzso to as zzso cues, resulting in analyses of accurate response suppression to Stop cues zzso and incorrect responses to Go cues zzso or to Stop cues zzso 

Response accuracy in patients was impaired due to frequent zzso zzso Image analysis of the zzso contrast demonstrated zzso zzso and zzso activity in both zzso Compared to controls, MD patients showed increased primary motor zzso and insular zzso During zzso trials, patients revealed increased activity in the zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso and zzso zzso In a zzso analysis comparing MD patients, zzso positive patients demonstrated anterior zzso zzso on all contrasts and increased zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates a distinct association of motor symptoms in MD with the zzso lateral nucleus of the zzso zzso dysfunction zzso zzso positive from negative zzso We suggest that MD might be best considered as a disorder of the zzso zzso
