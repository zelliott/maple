The neural mechanisms of zzso and target detection were investigated by combining high density zzso potential zzso recordings with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso responses were recorded using the same paradigm and the same zzso zzso zzso zzso a mismatch zzso zzso in the zzso In the zzso data, zzso of zzso zzso zzso bilateral were zzso zzso zzso generated an zzso followed by an zzso zzso For this condition, zzso zzso in both superior zzso zzso and the zzso were zzso These zzso were taken as zzso constraints for the zzso of equivalent current zzso zzso solutions for zzso orientation provide evidence for significant zzso close to zzso zzso during zzso processing in the zzso time zzso zzso whereas target detection could be modeled by two zzso in the superior zzso zzso between 320 and 380 zzso
