zzso resonance zzso zzso has been recently developed to assess zzso inflammation in inflammatory zzso disease zzso zzso Evaluating animal models of inflammation with zzso may be important in new zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of zzso in zzso rats and confront it with model zzso 

Colitis was induced by zzso injection of zzso acid zzso in 13 rats while six rats received the zzso zzso was performed at day zzso zzso inflammation and production of inflammatory zzso were zzso Image quality was assessed by wall and motion zzso zzso criteria were zzso wall zzso wall signal intensity on zzso zzso and zzso images, the appearance of a target sign pattern, and irregular patterns of zzso zzso 

zzso quality was good or excellent in zzso examinations with no difference between zzso Colitis rats were significantly different from controls in terms of wall thickness zzso zzso zzso the appearance of a target sign pattern zzso zzso zzso irregular patterns of zzso surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso images zzso zzso zzso All zzso criteria except zzso zzso wall thickness were associated with colon zzso ratio and inflammatory zzso (all P zzso zzso zzso zzso wall thickness and wall signal intensity on zzso images were associated with zzso score zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is feasible and reliable in rats with zzso zzso zzso criteria including colon wall zzso wall signal intensity on zzso images, zzso in zzso zzso and the appearance of a target sign pattern may be potential targets for new zzso zzso
