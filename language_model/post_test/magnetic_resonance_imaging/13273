To evaluate position and function of zzso Ahmed and zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging with head and surface zzso 

Eight patients (5 zzso with shunt implants were included, 4 with Ahmed zzso and 4 with zzso zzso single zzso All patients were operated at least 6 months before zzso In 3 cases (2 with zzso and 1 with Ahmed zzso the zzso pressure zzso was above 21 zzso zzso despite zzso medical zzso The shunt zzso tube and filtering zzso were identified in zzso and zzso images with both head and surface zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and filtering zzso and calculation of the zzso position along zzso zzso and vertical axes were performed in zzso and zzso images using head zzso 

The shunt zzso was identified in zzso and zzso images zzso zzso as a low intensity zzso zzso band at the zzso aspect of the zzso surrounded by a pocket of water density, corresponding to the filtering zzso The anterior position of the zzso and smaller volume of the zzso cavity (less available zzso zzso were associated with higher zzso zzso zzso volume was zzso correlated with zzso In the unsuccessful cases, filtering zzso was zzso 

zzso resonance imaging provides insights into the mechanism of zzso zzso and causes of failure of zzso A lower zzso volume is associated with anterior position of the shunt zzso and poor shunt zzso
