zzso control methods have been recently introduced to improve the design of selective radio frequency zzso and several zzso selective zzso that can produce excellent slice profiles have been zzso These zzso usually require high peak zzso zzso to implement and thus can not be widely zzso because of the limitations of the specific zzso rate and the zzso power amplifier of a clinical zzso We have a zzso zzso T zzso clinical zzso Several pulse files which consist of the bandwidth matched 90 degrees and 180 degrees selective zzso are zzso Some of these can produce excellent slice zzso However, they can only be used in the pulse sequences with the pulse length of zzso zzso The purpose of this paper is to improve the slice profiles produced by the pulse file in the pulse sequences with the shorter zzso zzso pulse zzso A pulse file zzso by the zzso zzso method is proposed to substitute the zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso Our experimental results confirm that the slice profiles and images are improved by the zzso pulse file with a lower peak zzso The proposed pulse file can also be applied in other clinical zzso zzso
