To demonstrate an in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique that maps the zzso change of regional zzso blood volume zzso during the cardiac zzso 

The method is based on the dominant zzso zzso effect of iron oxide zzso magnetic zzso zzso in zzso in the steady zzso The technique was demonstrated in zzso with normal mouse hearts at zzso zzso The regional zzso maps in left zzso zzso were zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso echo zzso zzso zzso zzso changes of zzso in normal mice were analyzed zzso in different zzso and angular zzso 

zzso zzso maps at various cardiac points were zzso The study showed a general regional zzso decrease from zzso zzso to zzso zzso Percentage reductions were zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the lateral wall and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of zzso zzso distribution were also zzso 

The zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso contrast agent zzso can be used to map the zzso change of regional zzso This imaging approach is relatively simple and may provide a new perspective for functional assessment of the zzso in zzso
