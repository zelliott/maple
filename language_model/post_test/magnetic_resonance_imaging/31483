zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is of proven clinical value in the zzso imaging of cardiovascular zzso zzso requires rapid image zzso but acquisition speed is fundamentally limited in conventional zzso Parallel imaging provides a means for increasing acquisition speed and zzso However, zzso zzso limitations and the limited number of receiver channels available on most MR systems have in the past imposed practical constraints, which dictated the use of moderate zzso in zzso High levels of zzso which were unattainable zzso have become possible with zzso MR systems and zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting imaging speed improvements can be exploited in a number of ways, ranging from enhancement of spatial and zzso resolution to efficient whole heart coverage to streamlining of zzso work zzso In this review, examples of these strategies are zzso following an outline of the fundamentals of the highly accelerated imaging approaches employed in zzso Topics discussed include basic principles of parallel zzso key requirements for MR systems and zzso zzso practical considerations of zzso management, supported by zzso zzso zzso noise averaging and high field zzso highly accelerated clinical zzso art cardiovascular imaging applications spanning the range from zzso to zzso and current trends and future zzso
