To evaluate the magnetic properties of the zzso stainless steel glaucoma drainage device during zzso 

Experimental zzso 

The zzso glaucoma drainage device zzso stainless zzso was examined for magnetic field interactions under standard zzso zzso and zzso T zzso scanning zzso Testing included zzso of zzso and zzso motion of the device induced by zzso magnetic zzso In addition, the change in the temperature of the device was measured to assess the presence of zzso heating of the stainless steel zzso 

Degree of angular zzso device displacement and zzso and change in zzso 

During induced zzso testing, displacement did not occur under zzso and zzso T conditions, although a significant amount of displacement occurred in the zzso T zzso zzso amounts of angular zzso were demonstrated at all three field zzso We did not record significant temperature changes during brain zzso sequences at any of the three zzso zzso 

The zzso glaucoma drainage device, manufactured from grade zzso stainless steel, does move in the presence of high magnetic zzso The clinical significance of this finding and translation to in zzso conditions are not currently zzso Further studies are needed to better understand how patients might be affected by the magnetic properties of this device post zzso and how patients should be zzso in regards to safety of zzso in the early and late zzso zzso
