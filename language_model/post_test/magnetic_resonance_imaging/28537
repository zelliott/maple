The horizontal zzso muscle volume of 11 normal adults and 3 zzso patients was measured with magnetic resonance imaging zzso using a zzso zzso zzso system which can provide zzso weighted images of 3 zzso zzso slices of the orbit with the spin echo zzso The zzso film was projected and magnified on Kent paper with an overhead zzso muscle shapes were traced and cut from the zzso Muscle volume was defined as the total weight of the Kent paper shapes representing the muscles from all zzso zzso The average volumes of the zzso and lateral zzso muscles zzso zzso of the 11 subjects were zzso zzso 87 zzso and zzso zzso 77 zzso In two patients with peripheral nerve zzso the small muscle volume was classified as zzso in the one patient with zzso zzso the large muscle volume was classified as zzso This measurement technique is useful for evaluation of the zzso muscles, especially in zzso
