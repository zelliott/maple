The zzso and the zzso zzso are thought to play fundamental and distinct roles in learning and memory, supporting two zzso memory zzso Interestingly, however, the zzso and the zzso zzso have each, zzso been implicated as necessary for reversal zzso ability to zzso change a response when previously learned zzso zzso are zzso Here, we compared the contribution of the zzso and the zzso zzso to distinct aspects of learning and zzso zzso subjects with selective zzso damage, Parkinson subjects with disrupted zzso zzso function, and healthy controls were tested on a novel zzso learning and reversal zzso In this task, reversal can be achieved in two ways: zzso can reverse a previously learned response, or they can select a new cue during the reversal phase, effectively zzso zzso of the zzso We found that both patient groups were intact at initial learning, but differed in their ability to zzso zzso subjects failed to reverse, and continued to use the same cue and response learned before the zzso Parkinson subjects, by contrast, opted out of the reversal by learning a new zzso zzso These results suggest that both the zzso and the zzso zzso support reversal learning, but in different zzso The zzso zzso are necessary for learning a new response when a previously learned response is no longer zzso The failure of the zzso subjects to reverse their response or to learn a new cue is consistent with a more general role for the zzso in zzso learning, and suggests it may also support the ability to respond to changes in zzso zzso
