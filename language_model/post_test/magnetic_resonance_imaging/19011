To evaluate the reliability of zzso and frontal functional zzso zzso zzso for the assessment of language dominance, as compared with the Wada zzso 

Ten patients with zzso lobe zzso were studied using blood oxygen level dependent zzso and zzso imaging zzso Three tasks were zzso semantic verbal zzso covert sentence repetition, and story zzso Data were analyzed using zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were defined for several regions of interest as the ratio zzso - zzso + zzso L being the number of activated zzso in the left zzso and R in the right zzso Wada zzso zzso were defined as the difference in the percentages of errors in language tests between left and right carotid zzso 

zzso verbal zzso The asymmetry of frontal zzso was correlated with Wada zzso zzso The strongest correlation was observed in the zzso frontal zzso frontal zzso zzso Story zzso The asymmetry of zzso but not zzso zzso was correlated with Wada zzso zzso zzso sentence zzso No correlation was zzso 

There was a good zzso between zzso dominance for language as assessed with the Wada test and zzso zzso zzso in the frontal but not in the zzso zzso The story listening and the covert sentence repetition tasks increased the sensitivity of detection of zzso language sites that may be useful for brain zzso zzso
