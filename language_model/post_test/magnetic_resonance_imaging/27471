When zzso zzso transmission field represents zzso the reception field represents zzso The distribution of those maps demonstrates zzso features at high field magnetic resonance zzso zzso Both maps are in mirror symmetry to one zzso Almost zzso distribution of the zzso field was expected on the laboratory frame in a zzso sample loaded inside the zzso zzso designed to achieve a homogeneous zzso zzso Then, a simple change was made in the coordinate transformation equation of zzso fields between the rotating and laboratory frames in both linear and zzso modes to investigate the source of this feature of zzso The magnitude of rotating frame zzso zzso and zzso consists of the magnitude and the phase difference of the laboratory frame zzso The rotating frame components differ in the sign of the zzso phase zzso zzso is equal to zzso at lower field because phase changes that depend on position can be zzso At higher fields, the magnitude component has a zzso profile, and distribution in the phase component is zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso and zzso maps demonstrate mirror zzso zzso of magnitude and phase components were examined in the laboratory zzso Their maps were zzso from zzso and zzso maps of the human brain and of a zzso saline phantom measured at zzso It was concluded from these zzso and experimental results that the zzso and mirror zzso zzso in zzso and zzso are derived from the phase difference in the laboratory zzso
