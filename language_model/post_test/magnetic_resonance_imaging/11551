The purpose of this study was to provide in zzso demonstrations of the functionality of a truly hybrid zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso 

A digital flat-panel zzso system zzso array of 200 zzso zzso 30 frames per zzso was integrated into an zzso zzso zzso The hybrid system is capable of MR and zzso imaging of the same field of view without patient zzso Two zzso procedures were performed in a zzso zzso model: placement of a zzso zzso zzso shunt zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso MR zzso portal zzso and zzso zzso zzso and mock zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso artery branch and MR evaluation of zzso zzso 

The resolution and frame rate of the zzso zzso images were sufficient to zzso and place devices, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso branches of the zzso artery could be zzso The quality of both real-time zzso frames per zzso and standard MR images was not affected by the zzso zzso During zzso zzso placement, the zzso and the portal vein could be easily zzso allowing successful puncture from zzso to portal zzso 

Switching back and forth between zzso and MR imaging zzso without requiring movement of the patient was zzso The integrated nature of the system could be especially beneficial when zzso and MR image guidance are used zzso
