The main cerebral components of the human pain zzso have been defined using functional imaging zzso The experience of pain is likely to be elaborated as a result of parallel processing within this zzso There is not, therefore, a single pain zzso The zzso of pain are as likely to be determined by zzso as by bottom-up zzso The precise function of the different components of the zzso are just beginning to be zzso There appear to be important zzso responses in the zzso components of the zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides are strong candidates for the zzso of some of these zzso More extensive and sequential behavioral and functional imaging studies are required to establish the contribution these zzso responses make to the perception of zzso
