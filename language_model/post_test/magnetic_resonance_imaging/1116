zzso It has been suggested that inflammatory cells within vulnerable plaques may be zzso by zzso iron oxide zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the time course for zzso zzso with in zzso zzso zzso using an zzso zzso iron oxide zzso agent in symptomatic human carotid zzso 

Eight patients scheduled for carotid zzso underwent zzso zzso of the carotid zzso before and 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso particles accumulated in zzso in 7 of 8 patients given zzso Areas of signal intensity reduction, corresponding to zzso zzso zzso were zzso in all 7 of these patients, zzso between 24 and 36 hours, decreasing after 48 hours, but still evident up to 96 hours after zzso 

zzso zzso of carotid zzso can be used to identify zzso in zzso The zzso change in the zzso signal intensity reduction on zzso suggests an optimal time window for the detection of zzso on zzso zzso
