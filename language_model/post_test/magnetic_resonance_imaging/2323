To evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso zzso for detecting zzso duct zzso and zzso 

At MR zzso 108 patients suspected of having zzso duct zzso or zzso were examined with two-dimensional fast zzso MR sequences and respiratory zzso On the basis of findings at surgery and/or zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso final diagnoses were normal zzso ducts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 23), zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso benign or zzso zzso duct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), and zzso duct zzso without zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso images were analyzed zzso by three zzso who were unaware of final zzso 

zzso was diagnosed with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso readings occurred because small or impacted zzso at the zzso common zzso duct or zzso were difficult to detect or distinguish from zzso zzso duct zzso was diagnosed with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso or absence of zzso duct zzso was assessed with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso agreement was very good zzso zzso zzso 

With MR zzso zzso duct zzso and zzso can be diagnosed with high accuracy and good zzso zzso
