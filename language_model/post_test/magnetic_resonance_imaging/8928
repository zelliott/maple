Single cell recording and zzso techniques in the monkey have allowed to find a mosaic of visual areas in the zzso zzso Thanks to zzso methods, several of these areas have been mapped also in the human brain and named in humans based on zzso in their zzso organization with zzso zzso zzso We have recently found a new, zzso cortical visual area, that we have called zzso Area zzso was first described in the zzso monkey and then, recently, in the zzso In both zzso it is located in the zzso zzso region of the zzso Like the other zzso areas, zzso contains a zzso map of the entire zzso zzso but unlike other zzso areas, zzso lacks an emphasis of the central visual zzso In macaque, area zzso receives visual information directly from zzso and from other zzso areas of the zzso zzso and sends visual information to several zzso areas, all belonging to the so called zzso visual zzso The zzso of zzso zzso are very sensitive to the direction of motion of visual stimuli and act as zzso zzso It has been reported that patients with cortical damages which include the cortical region where human zzso is located are unable to recognize the direction of motion of visual zzso or to detect the visual motion per zzso According to these data, we suggest that zzso is involved in the zzso of movement in the visual zzso
