zzso activity associated with generating an zzso was measured using zzso Participants read three-sentence passages that differed in whether or not an zzso needed to be drawn to understand zzso The zzso was based on either a zzso intention or a physical consequence of a character's zzso zzso was expected in zzso of Mind brain regions for the passages based on zzso intentions but not for the physical consequence zzso The zzso measured in the right zzso junction was greater in the intentional passages than in the consequence passages, consistent with predictions from a zzso of Mind zzso In contrast, there was increased zzso zzso in the physical zzso zzso For both types of passage, the cortical activity related to the reading of the critical zzso sentence demonstrated a recruitment of a common zzso cortical zzso This general zzso zzso appeared zzso in the language processing areas (the inferior frontal zzso the zzso zzso and the angular zzso as well as in the zzso to superior frontal zzso which has been found to be active in zzso of Mind zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that component areas of the discourse processing network are recruited as needed based on the nature of the zzso A zzso monitoring and synthesis network is proposed as a more accurate account for zzso of Mind zzso during narrative zzso
