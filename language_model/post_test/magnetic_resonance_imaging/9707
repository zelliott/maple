zzso zzso image registration zzso for zzso data generally ignore continuous movements and signal changes that occur throughout image zzso We emphasize the case of functional magnetic resonance images, which present zzso distortion due to the combination of head motion during scanning and staggered slice zzso While there exist techniques to correct for motion and slice timing zzso a common dilemma is to determine which correction should be applied zzso This paper proposes a zzso realignment zzso to perform both tasks zzso zzso conducted on simulated zzso with known movements suggest that the proposed zzso provides more accurate image reconstruction than the classical zzso realignment procedure zzso then zzso as zzso for instance, in the statistical zzso mapping zzso
