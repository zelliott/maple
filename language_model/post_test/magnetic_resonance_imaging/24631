The purpose of our study was to describe the salient magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in primary zzso peripheral primitive zzso zzso zzso 

A retrospective review of the clinical and zzso images of 7 zzso proven cases of zzso peripheral zzso was zzso The various zzso such as zzso level of zzso zzso location, size, zzso and zzso signal intensity of the zzso the presence of zzso or zzso any signal zzso assessment of the adjacent zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso tissue zzso or zzso or other zzso changes, were zzso 

All 7 patients had zzso in the zzso zzso Three patients had zzso zzso 4 had zzso zzso zzso and none had zzso zzso Six zzso were well zzso Only 1 patient had zzso zzso All zzso were of zzso or zzso signal on zzso imaging, whereas all but one were zzso on zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso except 1 zzso zzso zzso which enhanced zzso A zzso mass was noticed in 2 zzso zzso collapse was present in 1 zzso 

zzso peripheral zzso are rare spinal zzso Although imaging characteristics are not specific, a focal circumscribed zzso in a young individual at the zzso zzso zzso or zzso spinal location that shows zzso and zzso signal on zzso and zzso images, respectively, requires zzso to be considered in the zzso
