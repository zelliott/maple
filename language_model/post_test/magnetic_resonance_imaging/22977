The aim of this study was to explore the differential diagnostic value of PET using the zzso acid zzso zzso in patients with newly diagnosed solitary zzso zzso showing ring enhancement on zzso zzso 

zzso PET analyses were performed on 14 consecutive patients with zzso zzso zzso Eleven of the patients were additionally studied with zzso zzso In all patients, the main differential diagnosis after zzso was a zzso zzso in particular zzso zzso versus a benign zzso in particular brain zzso A zzso tumor was suspected for zzso showing increased zzso zzso on PET images with a mean zzso ratio of at least zzso zzso PET zzso A zzso zzso was suspected in cases of minimal or absent zzso zzso with a mean zzso ratio of less than zzso zzso PET zzso zzso diagnosis was obtained by serial zzso in 13 of the 14 zzso One patient refused the zzso but follow-up indicated an zzso because his zzso zzso under zzso zzso 

zzso and clinical follow-up showed high-grade zzso zzso in 5 patients and zzso zzso in 9 zzso The findings of zzso PET were positive in all 5 zzso patients and in 3 of 9 patients with zzso zzso including 2 patients with brain zzso and 1 patient with a zzso zzso The findings of zzso PET were positive zzso zzso matter ratio zzso or zzso zzso in 4 of 4 zzso patients and 3 of 7 patients with zzso zzso 

Although zzso PET has been shown to be valuable for the diagnostic evaluation of brain tumors, our data indicate that, like zzso zzso zzso PET has limited specificity in distinguishing between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso investigation of biopsy specimens remains mandatory to make this important differential zzso
