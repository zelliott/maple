To assess the clinical implications and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso lobe zzso zzso not associated with bilateral zzso abnormalities or zzso zzso zzso 

The authors compared the clinical, zzso and zzso zzso Wada test, and neuropsychology data of 15 patients with intractable complex partial zzso of zzso lobe origin and zzso with those of 13 consecutive patients with unilateral zzso associated with unilateral zzso zzso zzso who remained seizure free for more than 3 years after anterior zzso zzso zzso PET scans were analyzed visually and zzso and ratios of counts in individual zzso areas to the rest of the zzso were compared with the corresponding values from 11 normal control subjects and with the zzso zzso of the 13 patients with zzso zzso was defined as more than zzso zzso below control values for two or more zzso areas on each side irrespective of any zzso 

zzso reflected bilateral independent seizure onset in eight patients zzso The topography of the zzso depression was not a reliable predictor of zzso but involvement of the inferior zzso zzso was related specifically to zzso seizure onset zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso In patients with unilateral zzso zzso zzso was associated with longer disease duration and worst memory performance during the Wada test, which amounted to global zzso after zzso injection in three patients, zzso surgical zzso zzso seizure spread in the zzso zzso was significantly faster in patients with zzso 

In zzso zzso or zzso zzso may signal bilateral independent seizure onset in approximately half the patients, especially when involving the inferior zzso zzso zzso it may reflect an advanced stage of the disease process, characterized by a breakdown of the zzso mechanisms in the zzso hemisphere, and secondary memory deficit associated with higher risk of zzso memory zzso Patients with zzso and zzso but without bilateral zzso changes may still be operated on zzso but surgical suitability should be proved by comprehensive zzso zzso studies and Wada zzso
