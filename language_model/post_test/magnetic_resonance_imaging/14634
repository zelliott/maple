The dominant zzso model of empathy has emphasized the overlap between brain mechanisms involved in the zzso and the decoding of internal zzso The role of zzso empathy has been extensively studied in this research, but several other individual factors fundamental to communication processes have been largely zzso We studied the effects of zzso zzso in chronic back pain patients to determine if the decoding of zzso and zzso information signaling pain in others would be enhanced in individuals displaying a spontaneous propensity to consistently express more pain during a zzso zzso standardized lifting task performed on 2 separate zzso Blood zzso zzso signal change was measured in response to pictures showing facial pain expressions and zzso in zzso situations in chronic back pain patients and healthy zzso zzso brain responses to others' pain were comparable between zzso However, more expressive patients rated others' pain higher and showed stronger zzso pain responses in the right zzso part of the inferior frontal zzso the right zzso and the zzso zzso in the right zzso correlated positively with both the patients' zzso zzso and the intensity of the pain perceived in the images zzso suggesting that this structure linked the zzso zzso with zzso pain zzso zzso these effects were independent from zzso empathy and were found with both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and foot) zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is a zzso factor that zzso zzso pain processing and might reflect individual tendencies to rely on social coping zzso 

This article shows that pain zzso in chronic pain patients increased the zzso brain responses and the sensibility to others' zzso These results may help provide empirical support for better defining models of pain communication in chronic pain zzso
