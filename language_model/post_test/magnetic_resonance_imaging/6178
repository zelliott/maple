To evaluate efficacy and zzso findings after intravenous zzso and/or zzso in a human zzso animal model, we zzso male nude rats with zzso zzso human zzso zzso to four groups: zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on the day of treatment zzso zzso and 1 week later, and rats were followed for zzso Dynamic zzso was done in three controls and three rats treated with zzso with or without zzso before and 24 h after zzso Median overall survival zzso was as zzso group 1, 16 zzso group 2, 23 zzso group 3, 22 zzso group 4, 36 zzso zzso was significantly longer in group 4 than in group 1 zzso zzso zzso group 2 zzso zzso zzso and group 3 zzso zzso zzso and rats had significantly larger zzso No objective tumor responses were observed on MR images at 1 week after zzso however, after zzso dynamic zzso showed reduced zzso enhancement intensity and increased time to peak, consistent with decreased vascular zzso zzso + zzso is effective and superior over zzso or zzso zzso in this animal zzso Increased survival zzso with increased zzso tumor volume is suggestive that vascular targeting with reduced zzso zzso and mass effect contributes to the efficacy of zzso The promising survival data warrant future clinical trials using zzso + zzso
