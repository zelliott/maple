We studied whether default functionality of the human brain, as revealed by zzso decreases in activity occurring during zzso behaviors, is functionally reorganized by zzso Three groups of otherwise normal adults were zzso early blind, zzso blind, and normally zzso They were zzso by using functional zzso during performance of a word association task zzso generation to zzso administered by using auditory stimuli in all groups and zzso reading in blind zzso In sighted people, this task normally produces robust zzso decreases relative to a baseline of quiet zzso with eyes zzso Our functional zzso results indicate that zzso decreases are zzso similar across all participant groups in zzso and zzso zzso lateral zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso decreases are consistent with the hypothesis that functional reorganization resulting from the absence of a particular sensory zzso does not zzso affect default functionality as revealed by zzso zzso More generally, these results support the notion that the brain largely operates zzso with sensory information modulating rather than determining system zzso
