We studied clinical features and seizure zzso in 14 patients with zzso and intractable zzso zzso complications were present in nine patients, childhood zzso convulsions in two, zzso zzso in 12, and intellectual impairment in zzso Ten patients had zzso complex partial zzso zzso three had zzso simple partial seizures, and one had generalized zzso zzso Surface zzso showed zzso onset in nine patients (one zzso and zzso onset in zzso zzso showed zzso in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery in eight patients, zzso cerebral in three, internal carotid in one, and multiple vessels in zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso formation zzso in 13 patients zzso unilateral and five zzso and zzso zzso in 10 patients zzso unilateral and one zzso zzso formation zzso was zzso with zzso zzso in 10 patients zzso and with zzso zzso zzso in nine zzso Two patients had zzso confirmation of zzso zzso sclerosis and were seizure free after zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso sclerosis often coexists with zzso and is the likely seizure focus in the presence of zzso zzso zzso This recognition implies that effective surgical intervention can be offered to certain patients with zzso seizure zzso The dual pathology and association with zzso cerebral vascular zzso suggest a common zzso zzso
