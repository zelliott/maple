The objective of our study was to zzso evaluate zzso and zzso the enhancement patterns of zzso liver tissue and zzso zzso zzso after administration of the zzso contrast agent zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso on dynamic zzso and to determine the time point of maximum zzso zzso 

Twenty-five patients with zzso in liver zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences before and between 15 seconds and 20 minutes after the injection of 10 zzso of zzso were zzso zzso ratios zzso of liver zzso and zzso zzso ratios zzso were calculated and plotted over zzso Enhancement patterns of zzso were characterized zzso by two zzso 

The zzso of liver zzso increased significantly at 15 seconds and 60 seconds after contrast injection and remained stable zzso zzso showed positive zzso during the zzso phase and increasingly negative zzso during the further time course zzso zzso zzso The maximum absolute zzso was found at 20 minutes after contrast zzso There was no correlation between the degree of enhancement at any time point and tumor zzso On qualitative zzso 16 zzso showed zzso enhancement with early zzso and five showed zzso enhancement with late zzso In the remaining four zzso enhancement persisted until 20 zzso zzso zzso at 20 minutes after contrast injection was at least equal to or higher than it was on the remaining sequences in 19 of the 25 zzso 

After zzso injection, most zzso showed typical zzso enhancement with early zzso zzso contrast was best at 20 zzso
