The purpose of our study was to describe the structural organization of the zzso zzso of zzso cartilage of the zzso plateau and its influence on zzso zzso 

zzso images of 11 zzso zzso zzso acquired at 7 T were compared with the structure of the zzso zzso as shown by fracture zzso the samples in the plane of zzso Four samples were scanned at two different zzso relative to the main magnetic field zzso zzso maps were acquired in two zzso on three of these four zzso 

On the basis of the presence of zzso regional variations in the shape of the zzso a characteristic zzso architecture was zzso The location of peak signal intensity and zzso on zzso correlated with the level at which the zzso was estimated to be aligned at approximately 55 degrees to zzso zzso zzso zzso This correlation of zzso orientation relative to zzso with zzso and signal intensity on zzso was not altered by regional variations in the shape of the zzso or by imaging samples at two different zzso 

The structure of the zzso zzso through its zzso influence on zzso zzso exerts a strong influence on the zzso appearance of zzso At the zzso zzso a characteristic zzso architecture is associated with an equally characteristic zzso zzso
