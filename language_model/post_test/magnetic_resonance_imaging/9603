We describe the zzso diagnostic pathway, and management of 28 patients with benign zzso zzso 

A zzso kept zzso tumor database was reviewed to identify patients who presented to the Royal Marsden Hospital with zzso zzso 

From 2001 to 2009, 28 patients presented with zzso zzso In 13 patients, tumors were identified zzso 8 patients presented with pelvic or abdominal symptoms and 7 patients presented with a palpable zzso zzso occurred in the pelvis and 11 occurred in the abdominal zzso zzso The median age was 47 years and 21 patients were zzso the mean follow-up period was 39 zzso Twenty patients underwent zzso and 8 patients were managed conservatively with zzso zzso An initial zzso diagnosis was accomplished in 19 of 28 zzso Complete zzso was achieved in 17 of 20 patients and 3 patients with pelvic zzso underwent a zzso zzso zzso tumor size ranged from 5 to 23 zzso zzso 9 zzso and weighed between 64 and 2,300 g zzso 500 zzso There was no surgical zzso In the 3 zzso zzso tumors, no progression of residual disease or zzso transformation has been noted on follow-up zzso All 8 patients in the surveillance group had a zzso diagnosis and typical zzso zzso 

An accurate zzso diagnosis is important because the risks of complicated surgery in the zzso and pelvis for what is a benign zzso should be considered zzso zzso imaging combined with a needle biopsy should in all cases provide the correct zzso Management options include zzso surveillance in zzso patients or surgical zzso in symptomatic zzso
