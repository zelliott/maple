We recently experienced 4 cases of intramuscular zzso and analyzed zzso findings, comparing them with zzso zzso zzso showed that all tumors were depicted with a homogeneous low signal intensity on zzso images and a markedly high signal intensity on zzso images, findings which are similar to those of zzso zzso like intramuscular zzso However, tumors were zzso and finely enhanced on zzso images with intravenous zzso zzso Three cases showed the characteristic fat rim and fat zzso A diffuse zzso zzso demonstrating intermediate signal intensity on zzso images and high signal intensity on zzso images was also found in the adjacent muscle surrounding the tumor in 3 of 4 zzso In this zzso tumor invasion, diffuse and severe muscle zzso blood and zzso congestion with zzso and zzso zzso tissue formation were zzso The present results suggested that for the clinical diagnosis of intramuscular zzso with zzso examination, the combination of three zzso signs such as homogeneous low signal intensity on zzso zzso markedly high signal intensity on zzso images, and an enhancement effect with contrast medium are important, but the fat rim or fat cap, and the surrounding muscle zzso as detected by zzso are also characteristic and allow for a more firm zzso We zzso that the diffuse and severe muscle fiber zzso induced by tumors may cause such specific surrounding muscle zzso
