We report the case of a 50 year old female who presented with visual zzso due to zzso zzso and foreign body zzso 9 months after cotton wrapping for zzso anterior zzso artery zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso revealed enhanced mass zzso around zzso complex and zzso signal on zzso zzso and right zzso tract by zzso inversion recovery zzso Despite the repeated steroid pulse therapy, she deteriorated and zzso showed expansion of the zzso zzso over 5 zzso zzso removal of foreign body zzso resulted in marked improvement of visual zzso as well as of the zzso zzso We conclude that the use of cotton sheet close to the zzso nerve should be avoided, and that surgical removal of the zzso would be the optimal choice especially for the patient in whom steroid therapy fails to improve clinical zzso
