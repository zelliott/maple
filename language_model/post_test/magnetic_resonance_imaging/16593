Most response criteria for patients with zzso rely on increases in the contrast enhancing zzso to determine tumor zzso Our aim was to determine zzso in patients with zzso whether diffusion restriction can predict the development of new enhancing mass zzso 

We reviewed the brain MR imaging scans (including zzso and zzso zzso of 208 patients with zzso Patients with restricted diffusion in or adjacent to the tumor were identified, with further analysis only performed on those patients with zzso zzso without zzso These patients were followed to determine if new zzso enhancement developed at the site of the zzso zzso A zzso signed rank test, competing risk analysis, and zzso zzso were used to compare the mean drop in zzso values, assess zzso survival, and determine overall survival, zzso 

In 67 of the 208 patients zzso visibly zzso restricted diffusion was seen during zzso The study cohort was formed by the 27 patients with zzso zzso and no corresponding zzso zzso zzso patients developed zzso tumor at the site of restricted diffusion a median of zzso months later zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean decrease in zzso was zzso from baseline zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso survival probability was zzso zzso zzso zzso The 12-month overall survival probability was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diffusion predicted enhancement regardless of zzso therapy with zzso 

In a subset of patients with glioblastoma, development of a new focus of restricted diffusion during treatment may zzso the development of new enhancing zzso
