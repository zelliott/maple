To compare breast zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso with and without zzso parallel zzso zzso zzso 

After institutional review board approval, we evaluated 14 consecutive breast MR examinations performed at zzso that included three-dimensional zzso maps created separately with conventional zzso and zzso parallel zzso zzso zzso We measured zzso values zzso as % of intended zzso ) on each zzso map at zzso level in multiple bilateral locations: zzso zzso central, zzso and zzso Mean whole breast and location specific zzso values were calculated and compared between right and left breasts using paired zzso 

Mean whole breast zzso values differed significantly between right and left breasts with standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not with zzso parallel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso specific zzso values differed significantly between right and left on zzso in the lateral zzso zzso zzso central zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso values differed significantly on zzso parallel zzso zzso for only the anterior zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is improved with zzso parallel zzso zzso on zzso breast zzso when compared with standard zzso zzso zzso zzso
