To determine the frequency of symptomatic and zzso zzso discs and root zzso in patients with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and to correlate clinical zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso patients with unilateral zzso were included in the zzso Using the visual analogue scale, two physicians independently localized the most likely zzso level of zzso These clinical predictions of zzso were correlated with the zzso zzso 

zzso showed abnormalities on the symptomatic side in 42 of 57 patients zzso In zzso of the patients, zzso confirmed an zzso at the exact same level as determined after clinical zzso On the zzso side, zzso showed abnormalities in 19 of 57 patients zzso 13 zzso of these patients had zzso root zzso 

In more than two-thirds of the patients with unilateral zzso there was no exact match between the level predicted by clinical examination and zzso zzso These discrepancies complicate the decision whether or not to zzso
