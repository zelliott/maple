zzso zzso recordings may be required in some cases of zzso surgery to delineate the best region for cortical zzso We usually implant depth zzso according to zzso zzso zzso zzso By using these permanently implanted depth electrodes, we are able to perform zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We report the technical data required to perform such multiple cortical zzso as well as preliminary results in terms of seizure outcome in a group of 20 zzso 

zzso were performed by using zzso to zzso bipolar current zzso zzso applied for 10 to 50 zzso Each zzso produced a zzso to zzso diameter cortical zzso In total, two to 16 zzso were performed in each of the 20 zzso zzso were placed without zzso No general or zzso complication occurred during the zzso Two transient zzso side effects, consisting of zzso sensations in the mouth and mild zzso of the hand, were zzso 

At a follow-up time of 8 to 31 months zzso 19 zzso zzso of the patients became seizure free, zzso experienced a zzso or zzso reduction of their seizure frequency, and zzso were not significantly zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a safe zzso Our preliminary results indicate that such zzso can lead to a significant reduction of seizure frequency and could be proposed as a zzso procedure if no zzso surgery is zzso A zzso controlled trial is needed to determine which patients are likely to respond to zzso zzso zzso
