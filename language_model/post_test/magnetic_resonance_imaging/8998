To investigate whether baseline zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso rate as a measure of disease progression in patients with zzso disease zzso patients with mild cognitive impairment zzso and controls, controlling for baseline zzso and zzso zzso 

We assessed data from 31 patients with zzso 25 patients with zzso and 19 controls zzso age 68 zzso 8 years; 39 zzso zzso who visited our memory clinic and had received serial zzso scanning zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso 181 zzso were zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were assessed using visual rating scales for zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso global cortical zzso and white matter zzso zzso zzso rates were estimated using regional zzso zzso registration of follow-up scan to baseline zzso 

zzso multiple linear regression, adjusted for age and sex, showed that increased zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline was independently associated with higher subsequent zzso zzso rates zzso zzso zzso together with poorer memory performance zzso zzso and more severe zzso zzso zzso The association of memory function with zzso zzso rate was explained by the link with diagnosis, because it disappeared from the model after we additionally corrected for zzso 

zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso at zzso 181 are independently associated with subsequent disease zzso as reflected by zzso zzso zzso This effect is independent of baseline zzso and zzso zzso Our results imply that predicting disease progression can best be achieved by combining information from different zzso
