While the changes in the volume of the zzso lobe and its zzso over the course of illness have been studied in patients with zzso few studies have examined changes in the frontal lobe between the first episode and the chronic zzso In this study, we zzso on the effect of illness stage and duration of illness on the volume of frontal lobe regions, though we also examined several other regions to establish the specificity of any effects, if observed, in this zzso We compared the volumes of brain regions among 34 zzso schizophrenia patients, 49 chronic schizophrenia patients, 18 healthy controls zzso on average, to the zzso patients and 21 healthy controls zzso on average, to the chronic zzso zzso zzso analyses examined the relationships between the duration of illness and the brain regional volumes in the patient zzso The results showed that chronic patients had smaller prefrontal cortical zzso matter volumes, but larger zzso cortical and zzso volumes compared to zzso patients and matched healthy zzso Although there were significant zzso group interactions in the zzso and zzso cortical zzso matter volumes, these did not survive correction for multiple zzso There was a significant exponential relation between the duration of illness and the volumes of prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso zzso matter, zzso and zzso suggesting that these regions are susceptible to change as the disorder zzso The enlargement of the zzso zzso and zzso are likely to be a result of antipsychotic zzso
