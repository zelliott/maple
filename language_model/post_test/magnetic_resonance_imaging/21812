This study examined the zzso and zzso detail of high resolution zzso digital zzso zzso brain zzso zzso image data and zzso from zzso human brain were compared to in zzso zzso for the ability to delineate zzso zzso zzso surface reconstructions in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso New York, 1988) coordinate system enabled zzso comparisons for a representative sample of zzso zzso zzso resolution of zzso images averaged 200 and 170 zzso for whole head and brain, respectively, and 40 zzso for isolated the brain zzso zzso detail was far superior to zzso particularly in deep zzso regions such as the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso Digital repositioning in the zzso coordinate system enabled efficient structure zzso and zzso zzso zzso from collected tissue sections provided zzso detail that could be mapped to its approximate zzso zzso This approach permits comprehensive zzso analyses necessary for an zzso framework to a digital zzso of the human zzso
