The purpose of this study was to use high resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso combined with structure analysis to investigate the zzso structure of the human zzso zzso and to compare this technique with bone mineral density zzso using dual energy X-ray zzso zzso in the prediction of bone strength in zzso Thirty-one fresh human zzso zzso specimens were examined with zzso using a zzso zzso zzso in a zzso plane zzso size: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In these images structure parameters analogous to standard bone zzso were obtained in a zzso head, neck, and zzso region of interest zzso In addition, zzso zzso were obtained using zzso and finally, all specimens were tested zzso in a materials testing machine, and maximum zzso strength zzso was zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were significant zzso zzso with zzso up to zzso zzso structure parameters and zzso zzso up to zzso zzso zzso were zzso Using zzso zzso analysis, combining structure parameters and zzso improved correlations versus zzso substantially (up to R zzso zzso P zzso In conclusion, this study showed that in an experimental setting, structure parameters determined in high resolution MR images of the zzso zzso correlated significantly with bone zzso The highest zzso however, were obtained combining zzso and structure zzso
