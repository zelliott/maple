As a Mardi Gras joke, the original jam or custard zzso of German Mardi Gras zzso are frequently replaced with mustard which cannot be identified on the outside of the zzso The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of modern CT and zzso techniques on the diagnostic evaluation of zzso filled with mustard, jam or zzso 

4 commercially available zzso were included in the zzso One was filled with custard zzso and one with jam zzso Two zzso were specifically prepared and filled with Bavarian mustard zzso or zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso was performed with T zzso and T zzso zzso diffusion and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso underwent zzso zzso 

zzso was able to be easily differentiated from the other zzso due to its zzso in the STIR sequences and zzso in the T zzso zzso zzso was able to be differentiated from S zzso and S zzso on the basis of its diffusion zzso S zzso demonstrated a pronounced zzso of its zzso especially in zzso In CT, zzso showed a pronounced zzso with negative zzso units in contrast to the strongly zzso zzso S zzso and S zzso S zzso and S zzso demonstrated X-ray zzso considerably dependent on the X-ray zzso 

Donuts filled with jam, custard or mustard can be readily differentiated by modern zzso and CT zzso zzso eating a zzso zzso can be reliably zzso
