zzso cerebral zzso was measured in zzso using dynamic zzso contrast magnetic resonance zzso A zzso acquisition was used to eliminate zzso The zzso input curve was measured in a separate slice in the neck to minimize partial volume zzso Data analysis was performed using a maximum likelihood expectation zzso method to be less sensitive to noise or contrast arrival time zzso From the contrast response zzso zzso the cerebral blood volume zzso and flow zzso and the timing parameters mean transit time zzso time of appearance zzso and zzso peak zzso were zzso zzso slices were measured to permit discrimination between zzso and zzso zzso The group investigated consisted of 41 subjects without cerebral pathology on anatomical zzso zzso parameters for gray zzso and white matter zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 96 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso and average zzso ratio for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Measured zzso aspects of zzso were: mean transit time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 seconds, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seconds, time of appearance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seconds, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seconds, and zzso peak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seconds, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The average values were in agreement with those from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were estimated using an zzso test, and the sources of zzso in the zzso such as image noise, biological zzso and measurement errors of the zzso input curve were found to be of the same order of zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
