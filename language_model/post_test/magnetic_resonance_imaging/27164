zzso small vessel disease zzso including white matter zzso and zzso zzso is related to gait zzso zzso zzso are another manifestation of zzso but their clinical impact remains zzso We therefore investigated the relation between the number and location of zzso and zzso independently of white matter zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso scanning was performed in zzso zzso elderly individuals with cerebral zzso The number and location of zzso were zzso zzso was assessed with a zzso system and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were related to gait parameters by age, zzso total brain volume, white matter zzso and number of zzso zzso linear zzso 

A higher number of zzso was independently related to a shorter stride length and poorer performance on the zzso and zzso zzso These relations seemed to be explained by zzso in the zzso and frontal lobe and zzso zzso including the zzso 

This study offers the first indication that zzso may be associated with gait zzso independently of other zzso markers of zzso
