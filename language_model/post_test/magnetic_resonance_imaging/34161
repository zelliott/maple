To determine the clinical utility of zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the brain by comparing results with those at zzso zzso MR imaging with zzso transfer zzso zzso 

In 105 consecutive patients referred for zzso brain imaging, zzso and zzso MR imaging with zzso zzso were performed before and after administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso of body zzso zzso and zzso images were evaluated to determine the presence of abnormal contrast enhancement and whether enhancement was more conspicuous with the zzso or zzso zzso 

Thirty-nine studies showed zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso images with zzso zzso showed superior enhancement in 14 studies, whereas zzso fast zzso images showed superior enhancement in 15 zzso Four cases demonstrated approximately equal contrast enhancement with both zzso Six cases showed some areas of enhancement better with zzso imaging with zzso zzso and other areas better with zzso fast zzso zzso zzso enhancement was typically better seen with zzso fast zzso zzso 

Fast zzso images have noticeable zzso contrast making zzso enhancement zzso zzso enhancement in zzso that are zzso on zzso zzso images, such as zzso tumors, may be better seen on zzso images than on zzso fast zzso zzso However, zzso fast zzso images may be useful for detecting superficial zzso such as zzso disease, because they do not demonstrate contrast enhancement of vessels with slow flow as do zzso zzso
