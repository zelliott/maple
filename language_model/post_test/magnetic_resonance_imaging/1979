How does the brain maintain information in working memory while challenged by incoming zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we measured human brain activity during the memory delay of a spatial working memory task with zzso We found that, in the prefrontal zzso zzso the magnitude of activity sustained throughout the memory delay was significantly higher on correct trials than it was on error zzso By contrast, the magnitude of sustained activity in zzso areas did not differ between correct and error zzso The correlation of activity between zzso areas was, however, associated with correct memory performance after zzso On the basis of these findings, we propose that memory representations gain resistance against distraction during a period of active maintenance within working zzso This may be zzso by interactions between prefrontal and zzso zzso
