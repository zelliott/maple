We studied the effect of intravenous infusion of sodium zzso zzso on muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in three patients with muscle zzso zzso zzso and three healthy subjects during zzso rhythmic zzso exercise (5 s of contraction zzso with 5 s of zzso performed for 3 zzso Healthy subjects were matched to zzso patients for gender and zzso zzso zzso Force production was recorded and during zzso infusion was matched to that without zzso zzso resonance zzso was used to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pH in the zzso zzso zzso of the exercising zzso La infusion had no effect on healthy subjects or patients during zzso In healthy subjects, La infusion had no effect on depletion of zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or decline in pH in exercising zzso In contrast, during exercise in zzso patients, zzso was higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 136 zzso 176 zzso 61 zzso were lower zzso zzso zzso during La infusion than in control zzso The effects of La infusion on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso patients are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso La zzso the rate of zzso zzso in active muscle by bypassing the zzso block at zzso
