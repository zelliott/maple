zzso spinal zzso injury zzso comprises a zzso condition caused by a complex array of mechanical forces that damage the spinal zzso - making each case somewhat zzso In addition to zzso injury, a subset of patients experience severe inflammation in the zzso space or zzso which can lead to the development of zzso zzso a condition called post-traumatic zzso zzso Currently, there are no therapeutic means to address this devastating complication in patients and zzso once zzso is zzso treatment is often prone to zzso We hypothesized that reducing zzso inflammation using a novel zzso strategy would improve outcome in a zzso model of zzso A zzso of zzso and zzso cellulose zzso was injected into the zzso space 24 h post zzso injury in zzso zzso injection of zzso reduced the extent of zzso and inflammation in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso promoted improved zzso recovery, enhanced zzso zzso and reduced the extent of the zzso as assessed by zzso and zzso zzso These findings were additionally associated with a reduction in the post-traumatic zzso zzso zzso formation as evidenced by reduced zzso deposition and reduced zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is capable of modulating inflammation and zzso events, leading to improved functional recovery following severe zzso associated with zzso
