Prior studies from our laboratory zzso of zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso have demonstrated that discrete regions of the superior zzso zzso zzso are activated when a subject views a face in which the eyes shift their zzso Here we investigated the degree to which activity in the zzso and other brain regions is modulated by the context of the perceived gaze zzso that is, when the shift correctly or incorrectly acquires a visual zzso Fifteen subjects participated in an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment in which they viewed an animated face that remained present throughout each zzso On each of 21 trials within each run, a small zzso appeared and flickered at one of six locations within the character's visual zzso On zzso trials, the character shifted its gaze towards the zzso after a delay of 1 or zzso On zzso trials, the character shifted its gaze towards empty space after the same zzso On zzso zzso trials, the character's eyes did not zzso zzso larger zzso responses zzso were evoked by gaze shifts compared to no gaze shifts in primarily right zzso zzso The zzso zzso was significantly delayed in peak zzso for zzso compared to zzso zzso For zzso shifts, a strong effect of context was observed in which errors evoked a zzso with extended zzso Although this study focused upon zzso similar effects were also observed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
