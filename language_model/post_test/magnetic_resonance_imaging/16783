Although zzso matter damage in multiple sclerosis is currently zzso zzso of zzso matter volume and its relationship with disability are not yet zzso 

The objectives of the study were to measure zzso and white matter volumes across different disease zzso identify zzso parameters associated with zzso matter zzso and study zzso and white matter volume as explanatory variables for clinical zzso 

This is a zzso study in which zzso data of 95 clinically isolated syndrome, 657 zzso 125 zzso and 50 zzso multiple sclerosis patients from three zzso were zzso Grey and white matter volumes were determined, together with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Physical disability was assessed with the Expanded zzso zzso zzso cognitive impairment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Data were zzso using multiple zzso 

Grey matter volume was lower in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in clinically isolated syndrome patients zzso zzso zzso and even greater relative zzso was found in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso In contrast, white matter volume in zzso patients was comparable to that in zzso zzso Grey matter volume was the strongest independent predictor of physical disability and cognitive zzso and was associated with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings show that zzso matter volume is lower in zzso than in zzso zzso Grey matter volume explained physical and cognitive impairment better than white matter volume, and is itself associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso
