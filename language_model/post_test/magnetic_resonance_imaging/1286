zzso zzso zzso acid zzso enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance zzso imaging was used to monitor the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso a zzso agent that produces damage in the zzso convoluted zzso Ten New Zealand white rabbits zzso were divided into two groups and were evaluated at two clinically relevant doses of zzso Group 1 (four zzso received zzso zzso at 125 zzso over 1 zzso zzso in Group 2 (six zzso were infused with zzso at 40 zzso each day for 5 consecutive zzso Dynamic MR images were performed in the zzso plane at zzso T using a zzso recalled acquisition in the steady state sequence with an echo time of 11 zzso a repetition time of 20 zzso and a flip angle of 10 degrees after a zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequential post zzso images zzso zzso were obtained over 2 zzso 45 s at a single zzso All rabbits underwent baseline normal and serial post zzso zzso enhanced dynamic MR zzso Analysis of the zzso in the normal pattern of zzso enhancement caused by zzso was facilitated by using a stacked profile image and quantitative region of interest zzso of signal zzso Normally, after the injection of zzso a dark band promptly appears in the outer zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso toward the zzso reflecting the zzso concentration of zzso In Group 1 zzso zzso due to zzso was observed as early as 9 h after administration of the drug, with a complete disappearance of the dark band by 7 zzso In Group 2 zzso the band disappeared gradually and zzso zzso days after the completion of zzso treatment, indicative of zzso damage and recovery with return of the concentrating ability of the zzso These results illustrate the feasibility of using zzso dynamic MR as a sensitive monitor of drug induced zzso of zzso zzso
