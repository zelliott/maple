The zzso response to peripheral zzso stimulation is not well zzso Prior literature suggests that zzso stimulation can affect zzso zzso We studied the effects of electrical stimulation near the median nerve on the response to an zzso increase in synaptic zzso We applied the electrical stimulation close to the median nerve 20 zzso after administration of zzso zzso We used zzso and zzso to measure markers of zzso zzso release, together with the release of associated zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso Changes in cerebral blood volume zzso a marker used in zzso indicate that electrical stimulation significantly attenuated increased zzso release zzso to zzso in the zzso thalamus, zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso showed that electrical stimulation increased zzso and zzso release and attenuated the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso dynamics correlated with the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that electrical stimulation near the median nerve activates zzso release, which subsequently zzso excess zzso zzso zzso These data provide evidence for zzso zzso caused by zzso at points near the median zzso
