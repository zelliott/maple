Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso provide independent measures of zzso related to tumor zzso We compared the zzso and absolute values of zzso and zzso zzso in the same tumors in an animal model, to investigate the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso were each performed zzso on three consecutive days in each of twelve rats bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded zzso transfer constant zzso zzso zzso space volume fraction zzso and contrast agent zzso rate constant zzso and zzso blood flow zzso blood volume zzso mean transit time zzso and zzso area product zzso using zzso and zzso zzso models, with zzso and zzso seconds zzso resolutions, zzso zzso in zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso components zzso zzso zzso of variation for zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso and for zzso parameters zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were: zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso seconds, and zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso estimates from zzso zzso were zzso higher than from zzso zzso despite application of appropriate zzso zzso and zzso zzso of tumor zzso have similar zzso suggesting that they may have comparable utility, but their derived zzso values are not zzso
