Imaging of the painful zzso currently relies on standard and dynamic zzso There are no literature data on zzso of the zzso This examination could provide information on the cause of zzso 

zzso patients with severe chronic zzso underwent zzso and dynamic zzso of the zzso 

zzso abnormalities zzso in 70 zzso were related to either the presence of zzso liquid zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso similar to zzso 1 changes zzso or uncertain abnormalities zzso zzso of the tip of the zzso zzso in 41 zzso were located in the surrounding soft zzso zzso zzso zzso soft tissue inflammation zzso and ambiguous images zzso zzso bone zzso was observed in five cases and a benign zzso was observed zzso The type of imaging feature depend broadly on the mobility of the zzso the 105 cases with a mobile zzso mainly presented abnormal features mainly in a disc zzso cases zzso 4 cases for the zzso whereas the 67 patients with a rigid zzso mainly showed abnormal features at the tip zzso cases zzso 7 for the zzso zzso 

We recommend zzso of the painful zzso when dynamic zzso fails to reveal clearly a pathological zzso zzso normal or slightly increased mobility of the zzso or a rigid zzso lacking a zzso
