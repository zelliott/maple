The presence of zzso zzso has been implicated as a predictor of poor outcomes for patients diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso single institution preliminary reports suggest a similar negative relationship may exist for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we attempt to validate the zzso value of zzso zzso in a large, zzso cohort of zzso zzso 

Data on 469 patients with localized zzso from 5 zzso referral centers who underwent a radical zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso without zzso chemotherapy were integrated into a zzso zzso zzso zzso data, including presence zzso absence and high zzso low grade, were available in zzso zzso The association of zzso with zzso features was zzso 

A total of 254 men and 154 women with a median age of 69 years zzso zzso were zzso Overall, 192 patients zzso had zzso disease, 145 zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or positive zzso zzso and zzso zzso had high grade zzso on final zzso zzso percent of patients had tumors in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso in both zzso zzso 223 patients zzso were noted to have zzso zzso zzso low grade and zzso high zzso zzso was associated with zzso stage zzso zzso zzso zzso disease zzso zzso zzso and high grade zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso analysis adjusting for zzso age, and tumor location, zzso was an independent predictor of muscle invasive zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and high zzso grade zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso zzso was associated with advanced stage zzso This readily available imaging zzso may improve zzso risk zzso for zzso patients thereby guiding use of zzso versus zzso surgery as well as the need for zzso chemotherapy zzso
