The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso zzso using zzso zzso iron oxide zzso in the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso in patients with early stage breast zzso 

Ten women with breast cancer without swollen zzso zzso zzso were enrolled in this zzso zzso MR zzso was performed zzso after administration of zzso On the MR examination, a zzso surface zzso was placed on the zzso zzso zzso zzso parts as defined by a zzso zzso zzso method, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso images were zzso zzso zzso were differentiated as normal or diseased zzso by the enhancement zzso The day after MR examination, zzso biopsy zzso was zzso The imaging results were compared to the zzso zzso 

On MR images, the mean number of zzso zzso was zzso per zzso Eight patients who zzso had no zzso zzso zzso were diagnosed as zzso and two patients who had 3- and zzso zzso areas in the zzso respectively, were diagnosed as zzso zzso No side effects were zzso 

zzso MR zzso using zzso enabled us to obtain good zzso zzso zzso evaluation zzso These results suggest that this method of imaging may contribute to better zzso zzso zzso zzso
