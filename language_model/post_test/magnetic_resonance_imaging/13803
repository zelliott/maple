zzso of zzso parameters of zzso bone zzso in zzso is possible with high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso zzso These zzso may prove useful in the determination of bone strength and fracture risk, but must be related to other measures of bone zzso In this study in zzso MR imaging was used to derive zzso bone structure measures and combined with zzso element analysis zzso to determine the effects of zzso bone zzso on bone mechanical properties in the zzso zzso The subjects were studied in two groups: zzso zzso women with normal bone mineral density zzso zzso zzso 22, mean age 58 zzso 7 zzso and zzso zzso women with spine or zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso below young normal zzso zzso 37, mean age 62 zzso 11 zzso MR images of the zzso radius were obtained at zzso zzso and measures such as apparent zzso bone volume fraction zzso zzso zzso number and thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso were derived in regions of interest extending from the joint line to the zzso zzso The high-resolution images were also used in a zzso element model to derive the directional Young's zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso ratios such as zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso spine and hip were assessed using zzso X-ray zzso zzso Bone formation was assessed by serum zzso and bone zzso by serum type I collagen zzso zzso breakdown products zzso zzso and urinary zzso zzso zzso The zzso architecture displayed considerable zzso zzso of zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso were lower in the zzso group zzso zzso markers between the two groups were comparable in value and showed no significant difference between the two zzso App zzso zzso and zzso were higher, and App zzso lower, in the normal group than the zzso zzso All three directional measures of elastic and zzso zzso were lower in the zzso group compared with the normal zzso zzso of zzso bone zzso as measured by the ratios of the mean intercept length zzso values zzso zzso and the zzso in elastic zzso zzso zzso were greater in the zzso group compared with the normal zzso The correlations between the measures of architecture and zzso are higher than those between elastic zzso and zzso zzso multiple zzso analysis showed that while App zzso is highly correlated with the mechanical properties, additional structural measures do contribute to the improved prediction of the mechanical zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of using MR imaging with zzso modeling in zzso in the study of zzso
