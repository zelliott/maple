zzso A1 zzso has been proposed as a candidate gene for zzso spectrum disorder zzso as it regulates zzso patterning of zzso structures implicated in zzso zzso In line with this notion, a zzso single zzso zzso within a highly zzso domain of zzso zzso been linked to both zzso risk, and zzso differences in superior zzso zzso zzso anatomy in late zzso Despite evidence for early onset and zzso dynamic zzso involvement in zzso little is known of the relationship between zzso zzso and maturation of the zzso over early zzso We addressed this issue using 296 zzso acquired structural magnetic resonance imaging brain scans from 116 healthy individuals between 5 and 23 years of zzso Mixed models were used to compare the relationship between age and zzso measures of zzso volume in zzso zzso and carriers of the G zzso zzso Total zzso volume increased between ages of 5 and 23 years in both zzso However, this was accelerated in the zzso relative to the AA group zzso interaction term, P zzso zzso and driven by zzso differences in the rate of bilateral superior zzso zzso volume change with age zzso zzso zzso zzso although superior zzso zzso volume did not differ significantly between zzso groups at age 5 zzso zzso zzso by age 23 it was zzso greater in zzso than AA zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that common genetic variation within this putative zzso risk gene has the capacity to modify the development of zzso systems implicated in zzso zzso
