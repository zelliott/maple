The silent period induced by zzso magnetic stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso figure of eight zzso loop diameter 7 zzso in active muscles supplied by zzso nerves zzso zzso and zzso was studied in 14 control subjects and nine patients with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In the patients, zzso of the silent period were also made in the first zzso zzso and zzso anterior zzso In the controls, there was a silent period in zzso as well as zzso zzso muscle and the duration of the silent period increased with increasing stimulus zzso The mean duration of the silent period was around 140 zzso in zzso zzso muscle and around 90 zzso in zzso zzso muscle at zzso zzso threshold stimulation zzso Whereas the duration of the silent period in zzso zzso muscle was shorter than on the zzso side it was similar on both sides in zzso zzso In patients with focal zzso of the face associated primary motor zzso and corresponding central facial zzso the silent period in zzso muscle was shortened whereas it was unchanged or prolonged in limb muscles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with stimulation over the affected zzso By contrast, in a patient with a zzso within the zzso cortex, the silent period in zzso muscle was prolonged with stimulation of the affected zzso
