zzso of zzso zzso discs by engineered tissue is a clinical challenge in spinal zzso zzso are zzso of zzso disc cells and determination of their zzso zzso The influence of disc damage in different spinal disorders on the outcome of disc cell cultures has not been discussed zzso This study showed the feasibility of zzso of cells from damaged human zzso discs and the dependence of cellular culture properties on the underlying disc zzso Human zzso disc cells were isolated from disc tissue obtained during surgical procedures for zzso zzso and disc zzso After proliferation in zzso culture, cells were embedded in a mixed zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid content, zzso content, and zzso synthesis were determined on Days 7, 14, and zzso In a three-dimensional environment only cells obtained from zzso and zzso discs showed significant zzso acid and zzso zzso However, zzso content increased only in cells from zzso zzso The results of this study show that the formation of zzso zzso components under three-dimensional culture conditions is dependent on the nature of zzso disc damage of the tissue zzso
