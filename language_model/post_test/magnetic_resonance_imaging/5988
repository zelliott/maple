We aimed to investigate structural abnormalities in zzso zzso geriatric depression zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso in closely matched patients and healthy controls, and examining the relationship of performances on zzso tests with regional white matter zzso 

Forty subjects with zzso zzso and 36 zzso healthy controls were recruited for this study and zzso tests and magnetic resonance imaging zzso were conducted on the zzso The differences in regional white matter volume were determined between these two groups by zzso zzso 

The white matter volumes of left inferior zzso zzso and right inferior frontal zzso were significantly larger in patients with zzso relative to healthy zzso zzso patients performed significantly worse in the delayed recall of zzso Trail Making Test A and B zzso and zzso zzso zzso Test when compared with the control group (all zzso And there was a significant positive correlation between white matter volume of right inferior frontal zzso and Trail Making Test A zzso zzso in patients with zzso 

This study is zzso therefore it cannot determine whether increased white matter volume is a state marker or trait marker of zzso 

These results reveal that zzso is associated with larger white matter volumes of left inferior zzso zzso and right inferior frontal zzso and the right inferior frontal zzso may thus be involved in the zzso of executive function in zzso
