Taking the first-person perspective zzso centered upon one's own body as opposed to the zzso perspective zzso which enables us to take the viewpoint of someone else, is zzso for human zzso At the underlying zzso or cognitive level, these operations are processed in an zzso reference frame, where locations are represented centered around another person's zzso or one's own perspective zzso To study zzso and zzso both operating in zzso zzso a virtual scene with an avatar and red balls in a room was presented from different camera viewpoints to normal volunteers zzso zzso zzso in a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The task for the subjects was to count the objects as seen either from the zzso perspective zzso or one's own perspective zzso The scene was presented either from a ground view zzso ) or an aerial view zzso ) to investigate the effect of view on perspective zzso The factors perspective zzso zzso zzso and view zzso zzso zzso ) were arranged in a zzso zzso zzso times were increased and percent correctness scores were decreased in zzso as opposed to zzso To detect the neural mechanisms associated with perspective taking, functional magnetic resonance imaging was zzso Data were analyzed using zzso in each subject and zzso statistics on the group zzso zzso common to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso were observed in a network of zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso zzso common to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso were observed predominantly in zzso zzso zzso cortical and lateral superior zzso areas zzso zzso increases of neural activity were found in zzso superior zzso and right zzso zzso during zzso zzso to zzso whereas differential increases during zzso zzso to zzso were found in zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso cortex, and superior zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that in addition to joint neural mechanisms, for example, due to zzso processing and decision making, zzso and zzso rely on differential neural zzso zzso cortical areas are involved in zzso processes when the spatial task is solved from one's own viewpoint, whereas zzso operations from another person's perspective zzso draw upon cortical areas known to be involved in spatial zzso
