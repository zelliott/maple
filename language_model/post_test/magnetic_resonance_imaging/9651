We demonstrated increased zzso zzso in injured peripheral nerves in a model of zzso pain using zzso zzso 

A zzso pain model in rats was created by zzso injury of the left zzso zzso zzso rats without nerve injury were used as a zzso The presence of pain was confirmed by testing for zzso zzso zzso zzso PET and zzso scans of the zzso were obtained and zzso zzso was performed on harvested nerves and zzso 

The group with zzso injury showed the development of zzso in the operated limb zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso was observed on both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the operated nerve in this zzso zzso zzso in the nerves correlated well with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Animals with zzso pain show increased zzso zzso in the affected zzso zzso zzso can be effectively used to zzso zzso zzso in peripheral zzso
