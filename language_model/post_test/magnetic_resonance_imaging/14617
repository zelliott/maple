The combination of zzso iron oxide zzso with zzso zzso zzso is used to produce two types of zzso contrast agents to enhance medical ultrasound and magnetic resonance zzso The zzso are either zzso linked to the shell or physically zzso into the zzso In this paper, the characterization of the acoustic properties zzso power, zzso pressure, zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and ultrasound imaging of the two types of magnetic zzso are zzso In zzso zzso images are generated using a medical ultrasound scanner by applying a zzso signal processing technique that is suitable to detect zzso bubbles and based on the combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Even if both types of zzso can be considered to be effective ultrasound contrast agents, the different structure of the shell loaded with zzso has a pronounced effect on the zzso and the detection sensitivity of the imaging zzso The best results are obtained using zzso that are zzso coated with zzso A zzso power of zzso was achieved at lower zzso and an zzso of zzso in the zzso ratio was observed with respect to the more rigid zzso with particles zzso into the zzso
