While zzso zzso zzso were detected in some patients with Sheehan's syndrome zzso suggesting an zzso zzso involvement in the development of their zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso have not been investigated so zzso 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of zzso and zzso in SS patients to verify whether an zzso zzso process can contribute to their late zzso 

Twenty women with SS with a duration of disease ranging from 3 to 40 years zzso zzso zzso were enrolled into the zzso Out of 20 patients, 12 zzso had zzso and the others had partial zzso well corrected with appropriate replacement zzso None of them had clinical central diabetes zzso zzso and zzso were investigated by zzso method in all zzso In addition, a zzso zzso method was used to verify whether zzso zzso zzso cells zzso or zzso 

zzso were found in 8 out of 20 zzso and zzso in 7 out of 20 zzso patients with zzso ranging from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso however, in none of these positive patients zzso zzso zzso zzso None of controls resulted positive for both zzso 

Patients with zzso even many years after the onset of zzso can show zzso to zzso and/or zzso but not zzso zzso zzso to unknown zzso cells zzso zzso zzso other than zzso suggest that an zzso process involving both the zzso and zzso zzso may contribute to late zzso dysfunction in SS zzso
