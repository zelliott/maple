zzso zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso are linked to coronary artery disease zzso The association between zzso zzso and severity of zzso in known zzso zzso disease was zzso 

zzso cardiac zzso patients zzso age zzso years, zzso zzso with peripheral zzso disease, carotid zzso or zzso aneurysm underwent coronary zzso zzso zzso Patients were divided into zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso single vessel (N zzso zzso and zzso zzso (N zzso zzso EAT and zzso were zzso on zzso zzso images using zzso zzso 

zzso did not significantly differ by age, zzso or cardiovascular risk zzso Median EAT was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and median zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso single vessel, and zzso zzso zzso In zzso and zzso analysis, only EAT was significantly associated with zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso per 10 zzso increase in zzso P zzso zzso This remained in zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In patients with known zzso zzso disease, zzso is correlated with zzso but not with zzso These results suggest that EAT has a local effect on coronary zzso apart from the zzso effect of visceral zzso
