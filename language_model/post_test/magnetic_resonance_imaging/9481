The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso results of anterior cruciate ligament zzso reconstruction with zzso hamstring zzso by use of remnant preservation and a zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 53 patients who had zzso reconstruction by use of remnant zzso zzso preservation and a zzso zzso technique were zzso Clinical evaluation at a minimum of 2 years after surgery included range of motion, zzso test, zzso test, zzso zzso testing zzso San Diego, zzso and clinical zzso Plain zzso were evaluated for tunnel zzso zzso was obtained for evaluation of graft zzso zzso mass zzso and positioning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in 33 zzso 

The clinical scores improved zzso There were statistically significant differences between zzso and zzso zzso tests, zzso tests, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was available in 48 patients, and it showed intact graft in 45 patients, 2 partial tears, and 1 complete loss of zzso There were zzso mass zzso in 12 patients, but none showed an extension limitation or pain at zzso The position of the zzso tunnel on the zzso and zzso view was similar to the position of the normal zzso zzso zzso The measured zzso tunnel widening on the zzso at final follow-up was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Reconstruction of the zzso by use of preservation and zzso zzso of the remnant tissue showed good clinical results without increased concerns regarding incorrect tunnel zzso zzso zzso showed an increased zzso of zzso mass zzso but no clinical significance was zzso 

Level IV, case zzso
