Performance of complex motor tasks, such as rapid sequences of finger movements, can be improved in terms of speed and accuracy over several weeks by daily practice zzso This improvement does not zzso to a matched sequence of identical component movements, nor to the zzso zzso Here we report a study of the neural changes underlying this learning using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of local blood zzso zzso zzso signals evoked in primary motor zzso zzso Before training, a comparable extent of zzso was activated by both zzso However, two ordering effects were zzso repeating a sequence within a brief time window initially resulted in a smaller area of zzso zzso but later in larger area of zzso zzso suggesting a switch in zzso processing mode within the first session zzso zzso By week 4 of training, concurrent with zzso performance, the extent of zzso activated by the zzso sequence enlarged compared with the zzso zzso irrespective of order zzso zzso These changes persisted for several zzso The results suggest a slowly evolving, zzso zzso reorganization of the adult zzso which may zzso the acquisition and retention of the motor zzso
