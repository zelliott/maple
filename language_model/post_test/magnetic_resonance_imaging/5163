zzso is one of the most lethal bacterial diseases for fetuses and zzso However, pregnant women who get infected with zzso may experience only mild symptoms, making the diagnosis difficult, even when the fetus is fatally zzso 

To reveal features of this infection, we conducted a zzso imaging study of zzso zzso using a pregnant mouse zzso In this model, fetal morbidity and mortality can be observed in zzso zzso and the timing and extent of infection can be carefully zzso By employing in zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso infections were localized over time such that a correlation of infection to outcome could be determined without the need to kill the animal zzso The morbidity and viability of fetuses were assessed with zzso and fetal zzso was zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The ultrasound revealed sustained fetal zzso the slowing of the fetal zzso in infected zzso with an association between slowed fetal heart rate and strong zzso zzso 

zzso fetuses showing no zzso signal in the same zzso horn exhibited normal zzso Thus, fetal zzso during infection was localized to the infected fetus and was not systemic or zzso
