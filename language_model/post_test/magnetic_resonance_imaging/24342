The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso contain a short zzso motif zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso zzso with the zzso domain of the zzso proteins such as zzso through this motif and zzso in this motif disrupted zzso zzso We carried out structural studies for a zzso derived from the zzso domain of the zzso in different zzso using circular zzso and solution zzso zzso Our results showed that this domain was zzso in an zzso solution and formed a zzso structure in zzso zzso Fluorescence studies suggested that the zzso zzso zzso in the motif zzso with zzso The solution structure of the zzso in sodium zzso zzso zzso was determined and an zzso zzso was zzso This zzso may have similar function to the zzso 8 of other G zzso zzso
