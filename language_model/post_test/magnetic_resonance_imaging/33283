The zzso is thought to be involved in memory formation and consolidation, with zzso models proposing the process of pattern separation as a means for zzso overlapping zzso Previous research has used zzso related targets and zzso to investigate zzso responses to zzso zzso Here, we attempted to define the response function of the human zzso and its zzso during pattern separation by zzso varying zzso similarity in a continuous recognition zzso We also investigated the effect of task demands zzso vs incidental zzso on pattern separation zzso We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data while participants were shown a series of zzso In the intentional zzso participants identified objects as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso seen objects that were subsequently rotated by varied zzso In the incidental zzso participants were shown the same stimuli but identified objects as zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was best fit with a power function, consistent with predictions made by zzso models of pattern separation processes in the zzso The degree of pattern separation was driven by the information most relevant to the zzso pattern separation was seen in the left zzso when semantic information was more important to the task and seen in the right zzso when spatial information was more zzso We also present data illustrating that zzso processes zzso activity in the zzso visual processing zzso
