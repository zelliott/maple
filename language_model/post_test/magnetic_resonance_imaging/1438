MR studies of the zzso spine in 111 patients were analyzed at 469 disks to assess the prevalence of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso MR studies were performed on either zzso zzso magnet zzso zzso or zzso magnet zzso zzso The pulse sequences reviewed were zzso recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso short zzso TE spin echo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso 34 zzso and long zzso TE spin echo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso zzso zzso All study were done in a zzso plane with 10 zzso slice zzso The conclusions were as zzso 1) On a 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso image, zzso were detected in more than zzso of disks in patients over 30 years old but in only zzso of disks in patients under 20 years zzso 2) In both imaging system, zzso showed zzso more frequently than zzso and zzso 3) zzso were less frequently demonstrated in the disk with decreased signal intensity on zzso magnet as compared with zzso zzso 4) On zzso and zzso there is an increase in the prevalence of zzso in the disk with decreased signal zzso We suggest that the zzso will be a good landmark of the pathological process of the zzso zzso such as zzso
