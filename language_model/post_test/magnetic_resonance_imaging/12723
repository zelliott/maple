zzso resonance imaging zzso of active inflammatory changes of the zzso joint zzso in zzso zzso is performed with short zzso inversion recovery zzso sequences and zzso zzso fast zzso zzso sequences after administration of zzso contrast medium zzso The aim of the present study was to compare these two pulse sequences in terms of diagnosis, diagnostic confidence, and zzso of inflammatory zzso 

The study included 105 patients with suspected zzso 72 patients developed clinical zzso over zzso All patients were examined with STIR and zzso and each of the two sequences was analyzed separately in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso zzso For quantitative zzso of inflammatory changes, each zzso joint zzso was divided into 4 zzso (and severity per zzso was assigned a score of zzso resulting in a maximum sum score of 16 per zzso zzso confidence was assessed on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to zzso 

Active zzso was diagnosed in 46 patients and ruled out in 34 using zzso whereas findings were zzso in 25 zzso The corresponding numbers for zzso were 47, 44, and zzso zzso confidence was significantly lower for STIR zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso The sum scores were zzso zzso for STIR and zzso zzso for zzso for the right zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the left zzso zzso was high with zzso correlation zzso zzso values of zzso for the right zzso and zzso for the left zzso and positive correlation zzso right, zzso zzso 

STIR sequences alone are sufficient for establishing a reliable diagnosis and zzso the amount of inflammation in active zzso A zzso study is zzso in patients with established disease or in the setting of clinical follow-up zzso However, a zzso MR sequence is beneficial to ensure maximum diagnostic confidence when patients with early zzso are zzso
