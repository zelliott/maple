To evaluate the ability of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to differentiate several tumor entities of the zzso zzso in a prospective clinical zzso 

A total of 112 patients with zzso tumors were examined with dynamic zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was used to select five slices for the dynamic zzso zzso a zzso zzso sequence was used for the dynamic contrast study zzso zzso zzso zzso body zzso zzso agent application and the zzso sequence were started zzso Ten acquisitions of 10 zzso scan time each were performed zzso acquisition time 1:40 zzso Signal intensity versus time zzso zzso was obtained for all zzso After correlation of the zzso zzso curves, these were compared with zzso Finally, all zzso together with the tumor specific zzso zzso were zzso and correlated with zzso zzso All reading sessions were done by three experienced zzso 

Four characteristic zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso showed a gradual increase in signal intensity, followed by a plateau phase on a low intensity zzso zzso showed a zzso course at a low signal intensity zzso zzso as well as zzso showed a rapid increase in signal intensity followed by a plateau zzso zzso significance was found for the zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso and for the maximum peak signal intensity values for zzso Together with other zzso zzso criteria zzso enhancement, border zzso and clinical features, a differentiation between zzso and zzso was zzso 

With additional dynamic zzso zzso a more reliable differentiation between common zzso tumors is possible before zzso
