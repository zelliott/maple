In patients who present with clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple zzso zzso zzso is effective in delaying evolution to clinically zzso disease and in reducing zzso disease zzso We aimed to assess whether this drug can also reduce the rate of brain volume decrease in such patients enrolled in the zzso zzso treatment of multiple zzso zzso 

zzso data for brain volume zzso at zzso month 12, and month 24 were available from zzso 111, and 112 patients assigned treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 98, and 99 patients assigned zzso zzso zzso brain zzso volume zzso at baseline and percentage brain volume changes zzso were measured with a zzso zzso zzso The primary zzso was conversion to clinically zzso multiple sclerosis due to clinical zzso Analysis was by intention to zzso 

41 zzso of 131 patients on zzso zzso and 62 zzso of 132 on zzso converted to clinically zzso multiple sclerosis zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso for patients on zzso was zzso during the first year, zzso during the second year, and zzso during the entire study zzso zzso values for treated patients were zzso zzso and zzso The changes in brain volume were significant in both groups at all zzso A significant treatment effect was detected for month 24 versus baseline values zzso The number of new zzso zzso formed during the first year correlated zzso with zzso during the second zzso 

Early treatment with zzso zzso is effective in reducing conversion to clinically zzso multiple sclerosis and in slowing progressive loss of brain tissue in patients with clinically isolated zzso The modest correlation between new zzso formation and brain volume decrease suggests that inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes are, at least partly, zzso from the earliest clinical stage of multiple sclerosis zzso
