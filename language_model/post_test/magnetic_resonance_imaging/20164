Most current models of the zzso of basic reading processes agree on a system involving two cortical zzso a zzso stream zzso used when zzso familiar words zzso in zzso memory, and a zzso stream zzso used when zzso decoding words zzso mapping zzso spelling onto zzso The models zzso however, on the issue of whether the insular zzso is zzso The present zzso study required participants to read aloud exception words zzso zzso which must be read via zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which must be read via zzso spelling to sound zzso to examine the processing zzso as well as the insular cortex, and their relationship to zzso and zzso reading zzso The present study supports the notion of independent zzso and zzso streams, and further suggests the insular zzso to be sensitive to zzso processing zzso zzso zzso zzso These latter findings illuminate the nature of insular activity during reading, which must be explored further in future studies, and accounted for in models of the zzso of zzso
