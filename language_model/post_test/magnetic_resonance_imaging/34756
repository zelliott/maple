To compare staging of advanced primary cervical zzso zzso by conventional and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with the giant cross section zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso cancer of the zzso and clinically suspected invasive cancer zzso zzso were zzso examined by conventional zzso and zzso zzso spin echo zzso and zzso zzso All zzso findings were compared with the giant cross section zzso and zzso as the standard of zzso For zzso zzso a zzso recovery zzso sequence was used with a high zzso resolution of 13 s per ten zzso Signal time changes were analyzed using a zzso model and the zzso zzso values were zzso by color-coded zzso 

Analysis of zzso invasion on zzso images resulted in an accuracy of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso images and on zzso MR images zzso zzso of analysis of zzso and/or zzso wall invasion was significantly zzso zzso zzso higher on zzso MR images zzso than on zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso images improved staging accuracy compared with zzso images zzso vs zzso 

At present, conventional zzso zzso images are superior to zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR images in depicting zzso of the zzso However, suspected zzso of the zzso and/or zzso zzso is diagnosed more accurately on zzso images than on conventional MR zzso
