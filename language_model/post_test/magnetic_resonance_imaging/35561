Models of effective connectivity characterize the influence that zzso populations exert over each zzso Additionally, some approaches, for example Dynamic zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso describe how effective connectivity is modulated by experimental zzso zzso both are based on zzso zzso where the zzso term models the effect of experimental zzso on zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, zzso an important aspect of zzso interactions that has been established with invasive zzso recording zzso zzso how the connection between two zzso units is enabled or gated by activity in other zzso These gating processes are critical for controlling the gain of zzso populations and are zzso through interactions between synaptic zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso They represent a key mechanism for various zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso learning and zzso This paper presents a zzso extension of zzso that models such processes (to second zzso at the zzso population zzso In this way, the zzso of network interactions can be assigned to an explicit zzso zzso We present simulations and empirical results that demonstrate the zzso and usefulness of this zzso zzso of synthetic data showed that zzso and zzso mechanisms can be distinguished by our extended zzso When applying the model to empirical zzso data from a blocked attention to motion zzso we found that zzso increases in zzso responses could be best explained as a gating of the zzso connection by activity in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we zzso zzso data from an zzso zzso rivalry paradigm and found that interactions amongst zzso visual areas were modulated by activity in the middle frontal zzso In both practical examples, zzso model selection zzso the zzso models over corresponding zzso zzso
