zzso amputations above the zzso body often involve increased surgical complexity leading to long-term zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso amputations have substantially higher zzso morbidity compared with more zzso zzso zzso 

We evaluated the effect of zzso zzso level on zzso outcomes within 90 days of zzso zzso measures included blood loss, intensive care unit zzso and hospital stay, hospital cost, and zzso of a major and minor zzso Survival analyses were adjusted for the level of zzso and zzso zzso 

Thirteen zzso and 14 zzso zzso were zzso In comparing zzso versus zzso zzso median estimated blood loss was 4 L versus 1 L zzso zzso zzso zzso stay was 4 days versus 0 days zzso zzso zzso hospital stay was 19 days versus 8 days zzso zzso zzso hospital cost was zzso dollars versus 7,500 dollars zzso zzso zzso with one or more major complications in zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso Survival analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso level did not influence survival zzso zzso zzso whereas the type of tumor did influence survival zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso above zzso demonstrate increased zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso be reserved for patients with a realistic cure zzso
