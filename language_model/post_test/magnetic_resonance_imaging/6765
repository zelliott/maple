Loss of integrity of the zzso barrier zzso resulting from zzso and zzso is a hypothesized precursor to zzso transformation zzso and worse clinical outcome than would be expected from the beneficial effects of zzso We used a novel magnetic resonance imaging marker to characterize early zzso disruption in acute focal brain zzso and tested associations with zzso zzso and poor outcome zzso Rankin score zzso The zzso disruption was evident as delayed zzso enhancement of zzso fluid space on zzso inversion recovery zzso images and, for zzso has been termed zzso acute zzso marker zzso zzso was found in 47 of 144 zzso zzso stroke zzso zzso was found to be the strongest independent predictor of early zzso disruption zzso in zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso and worse clinical outcome (after adjustment for initial zzso It was also associated with more severe strokes at onset and greater zzso Because the timing of the disruption was early enough zzso estimate zzso hours from zzso to make it relevant to acute zzso therapy, early zzso disruption as defined by zzso may be a promising target for zzso therapy to reduce the complications associated with zzso therapy, broaden the therapeutic window, and improve clinical zzso
