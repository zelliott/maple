Recent zzso studies suggest that cortical face processing extends well beyond the zzso face area zzso including unspecified portions of the anterior zzso zzso However, the exact location of such anterior zzso zzso and their role during active face recognition, remain zzso Here we demonstrate that (in addition to zzso a small bilateral site in the anterior tip of the collateral zzso zzso the anterior zzso face zzso is selectively activated during recognition of faces but not houses (a zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso prediction that zzso and contrast reversed faces are processed like other zzso objects, both zzso and AT (but not other visual zzso were also activated during recognition of zzso and contrast reversed zzso However, response accuracy was better correlated to zzso activity in zzso compared to zzso These data support a zzso zzso model of face recognition processing, extending to the anterior zzso zzso
