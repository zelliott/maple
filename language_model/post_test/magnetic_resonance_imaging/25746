Our objectives were to study the cerebral zzso of zzso with the zzso technique of magnetic resonance imaging to compare the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to detect cerebral abnormalities in zzso with that of zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso received both magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso percent of the magnetic resonance imaging was abnormal and zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso This higher zzso of abnormal magnetic resonance imaging scans was present in spite of the fact that they were obtained significantly longer after the patient's seizure zzso The most common abnormalities were zzso zzso and white matter zzso 

zzso resonance imaging and zzso zzso scan abnormalities in zzso are usually zzso zzso imaging is not necessary in patients with uncomplicated zzso
