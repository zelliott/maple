The successful applications of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in medicine are mostly due to the zzso and zzso nature of zzso zzso zzso studies of humans and animals are easily accomplished, taking advantage of the fact that zzso does not use harmful radiation that would be needed for plain film zzso computerized zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional studies using the strong signal from the most abundant magnetic nucleus, the zzso can also provide zzso information when combined with in zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso MRS can be performed using either zzso or zzso (meaning any magnetic zzso other than zzso or zzso including carbon zzso or zzso zzso In zzso MR zzso can be obtained from single region of interest zzso or zzso or multiple zzso simultaneously using the technique typically called chemical shift imaging zzso Here we report applications of zzso to marine samples and describe a technique to study in zzso zzso metabolism in oysters using zzso MRS 12 h after immersion in a sea water chamber zzso with zzso This is the first report of zzso zzso in a marine zzso
