The zzso barrier zzso plays an important role in the zzso of the zzso zzso dysfunction has been implicated in the zzso of various neurological disorders, including zzso in which it may contribute to disease zzso zzso understanding of zzso dynamics during zzso may be of importance for the assessment of future therapies, including zzso leakage zzso zzso changes in zzso integrity can be studied with in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in combination with zzso contrast zzso Although this approach has shown to be suitable to detect major zzso leakage during the acute phase in experimental zzso models, so far no studies have provided information on dynamics of the extent of zzso leakage towards later zzso Therefore a sensitive and quantitative approach was used in the present study, involving fast zzso mapping zzso zzso during a zzso infusion of zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This was applied in an experimental zzso model in which previous zzso studies failed to detect zzso leakage during zzso Adult male zzso rats were injected with zzso acid to induce status zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed before zzso zzso and during the acute (1 day) and chronic zzso zzso (6 weeks after zzso zzso leakage was zzso by fast zzso mapping zzso zzso echo zzso with a time resolution of 48 s from 5 zzso before up to 45 zzso after 20 zzso zzso infusion of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was acquired before and 45 zzso after zzso zzso data were compared to zzso microscopic analysis using the zzso zzso zzso Our zzso data showed zzso zzso which was evident at 1 day and 6 weeks after zzso in the zzso zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso These findings were confirmed by microscopic analysis of zzso zzso Furthermore, our zzso data revealed zzso zzso leakage throughout zzso This study demonstrates zzso leakage in specific brain regions during zzso which can be zzso using zzso zzso zzso may be a valuable tool for experimental or clinical studies to zzso the role of the zzso in zzso
