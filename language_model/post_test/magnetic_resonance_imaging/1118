To develop new treatment strategies for patients with zzso zzso zzso potential therapeutic agents have to be tested in zzso models zzso In zzso magnetic resonance imaging has an additive value in zzso monitoring of the effects of therapeutic agents on zzso Previously, we described a zzso mouse model for zzso melanoma zzso In this paper, we zzso zzso melanoma zzso in mice on both zzso weighted MR images and zzso zzso acid zzso enhanced zzso weighted MR images, using a zzso MR zzso We conclude that both MR sequences can be used to detect and monitor zzso of melanoma cells in zzso Our data further suggest that zzso are more clearly zzso using zzso weighted zzso enhanced zzso imaging than zzso weighted zzso
