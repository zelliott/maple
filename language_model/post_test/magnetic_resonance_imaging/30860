zzso of lung zzso by zzso zzso zzso using partial parallel imaging zzso 

Eight healthy volunteers were examined using a zzso dynamic zzso zzso sequence with partial parallel imaging technique at zzso T zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso The whole lung was covered by 36 zzso zzso A zzso middle and zzso slice of each lung was manually segmented and zzso zzso were zzso For absolute zzso of blood flow through the right and left pulmonary artery, zzso flow zzso were zzso 

No significant difference was found between the signal intensity in the right zzso zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso signal intensity ratio of zzso A significantly higher signal intensity was found in the zzso regions of the lungs zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso The time to peak of the signal intensity was significantly shorter in the zzso zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso regions of the lungs zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso than in the zzso regions zzso zzso The ratio between blood flow through the left zzso zzso and right zzso zzso lung was zzso 

zzso parallel image acquisition can assess the zzso of the lungs at high zzso zzso The zzso is slightly higher on the right than on the zzso The signal increases faster and has a higher peak in the zzso lung zzso
