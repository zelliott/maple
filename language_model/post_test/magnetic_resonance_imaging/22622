The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of zzso dynamic zzso in predicting the disease activity of Crohn's zzso 

Forty-eight patients in two hospitals who had clinically suspected zzso of Crohn's disease were included in this zzso In three levels of thickened zzso wall, zzso dynamic zzso sequences were performed every 4-6 zzso for a total duration of 2-3 zzso after contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were acquired both before and after contrast zzso The slope of enhancement, enhancement ratio, time to enhancement, enhancement time, and thickness of the zzso wall were zzso These zzso results were compared with overall clinical grade, Crohn's disease activity index zzso and Van zzso activity zzso Clinical grade was based on clinical information, physical findings, laboratory studies, zzso surgery, and other imaging zzso zzso correlation zzso and p values were determined per zzso zzso zzso was applied before pooling the correlation zzso from both zzso 

The enhancement ratio based on the zzso series showed significant correlation with the clinical grade zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and Van zzso activity index zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The enhancement ratio based on the dynamic series correlated significantly with the zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Wall thickness correlated significantly with clinical grade zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and Van zzso activity index zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

These data suggest that the enhancement ratio of zzso wall after IV administration of zzso and zzso wall thickness are weak to moderate indicators of the severity of Crohn's zzso
