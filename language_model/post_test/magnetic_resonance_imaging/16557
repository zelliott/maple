zzso neuropsychology and functional zzso evidence indicates that simple and complex mental calculation is zzso by a zzso zzso However, the effective connectivity zzso direction and zzso among regions within the zzso network is still zzso Combining zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we administered a zzso zzso task to healthy participants asking them to solve single and double-digit zzso The goals of our study were first, to identify the effective connectivity of the zzso network, and second, to compare the effective connectivity patterns between a low and a high zzso competence zzso zzso The manipulation of zzso difficulty revealed a zzso network encompassing bilateral zzso zzso zzso left zzso motor area zzso left zzso zzso zzso and right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso The network was driven by an zzso zzso circuit hosting a representation of zzso quantity intertwined with a zzso zzso circuit engaged in temporary storage and updating of zzso zzso Both circuits received additional zzso from the zzso and zzso playing more of a supportive role in mental zzso The high zzso group compared to the low zzso group displayed a greater zzso in the right zzso and based its calculation more on a feedback driven zzso zzso circuit, whereas the low competence group more on a feedback driven zzso zzso zzso This study provides first evidence that zzso zzso is a sensitive approach to investigate effective connectivity of mental processes involved in mental calculation and to compare group level performances for different zzso
