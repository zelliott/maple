zzso resonance imaging zzso has become an important technique for zzso cell tracking in zzso zzso Following appropriate cell labeling zzso can be used to detect larger cell zzso and also single cells in zzso in zzso Cell distribution to different zzso such as brain, liver, zzso and zzso can be zzso zzso and followed over zzso Thus, the fate of single tumor cells and their eventual development to solid zzso could be zzso zzso zzso cells can be used as a paradigm for zzso tumor zzso We have demonstrated a strategy for magnetic and fluorescent zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso cell injection with efficient systemic cell delivery, and high-resolution zzso for repetitive zzso of zzso zzso zzso on a zzso level in zzso in zzso Furthermore, the fluorescent labeling of cells enabled effective zzso zzso
