The emerging and rapidly growing field of molecular and zzso imaging is providing new opportunities to directly zzso the biology of living zzso By combining our growing knowledge regarding the role of specific genes and proteins in human health and disease, with novel ways to target these entities in a manner that produces an zzso zzso zzso it is becoming increasingly possible to zzso and zzso specific biological processes in a zzso zzso All the major imaging zzso are contributing to this new field, each with its unique mechanisms for generating contrast and zzso in spatial resolution, zzso resolution and sensitivity with respect to the biological process of zzso Much of the development in molecular imaging is currently being carried out in animal models of disease, but as the field matures and with the development of more individualized medicine and the molecular targeting of new zzso clinical translation is inevitable and will likely forever change our approach to diagnostic zzso This review provides an introduction to the field of molecular imaging for readers who are not experts in the biological sciences and discusses the opportunities to apply a broad range of imaging technologies to better understand the biology of human health and zzso It also provides a brief review of the imaging technology zzso for zzso nuclear and optical zzso that is being developed to support this new zzso
