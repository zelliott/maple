Breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been shown to have high sensitivity for cancer detection and is increasingly used following zzso to evaluate suspicious breast zzso 

To determine the accuracy of breast zzso in conjunction with zzso for the detection of breast cancer in patients with suspicious zzso or clinical zzso 

Prospective zzso investigation of the International Breast MR zzso conducted at 14 university hospitals in North America and Europe from June 2, 1998, through October 31, 2001, of zzso patients referred for breast biopsy for American College of zzso category 4 or 5 zzso assessment or suspicious clinical or ultrasound zzso 

zzso examinations performed prior to breast zzso zzso results were interpreted at each site, which were blinded to pathological zzso 

Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso sensitivity, and specificity of breast zzso 

Among the zzso patients, there were zzso zzso index zzso of which 63 were zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso were invasive zzso Of the zzso zzso index zzso zzso were benign, 47 showed zzso zzso and 4 were zzso zzso in zzso The zzso pooled over all institutions was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso correctly detected cancer in zzso of zzso cancer cases zzso or invasive zzso resulting in a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and correctly identified as negative for cancer 281 of zzso cases without cancer, resulting in a specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performance was not significantly affected by zzso breast density, tumor zzso or zzso zzso The positive zzso values for zzso of zzso patients was zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso for zzso of zzso patients was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dynamic zzso did not improve the zzso compared with zzso zzso alone, but the specificity of a zzso pattern for 123 of 136 patients without cancer was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Breast zzso has high sensitivity but only moderate specificity independent of breast density, tumor type, and zzso zzso Although the positive zzso value of zzso is greater than zzso zzso does not zzso the need for subsequent tissue sampling in this zzso
