zzso resonance imaging zzso studies suggest that antipsychotic zzso patients with schizophrenia show a decrease in zzso volumes, whereas zzso patients with bipolar disorder show marginal increases in zzso zzso Although these clinical data are zzso by illness, zzso and other medications, they do suggest that typical antipsychotic drugs and zzso have contrasting effects on brain zzso 

zzso models offer a zzso system to test this hypothesis, and we therefore examined the effect of chronic treatment (8 weeks) and subsequent withdrawal (8 weeks) with clinically relevant dosing of an antipsychotic zzso zzso or zzso zzso on brain volume using zzso in zzso structural zzso and confirmed the findings zzso using unbiased zzso 

zzso zzso treatment induced decreases in whole brain volume zzso and cortical gray matter zzso accompanied by zzso of the corpus zzso zzso In contrast, chronic Li treatment induced increases in zzso volume zzso and cortical gray matter zzso without a significant effect on zzso zzso Following 8 weeks of drug withdrawal, zzso changes in brain volumes zzso whereas zzso animals retained significantly greater total brain volumes, as confirmed zzso However, the distribution of these contrasting changes was zzso zzso with the zzso decreases more prominent zzso the zzso increases were more prominent zzso 

The implications of these findings for the clinic, potential zzso strategies, and further drug development are zzso
