To determine the zzso value of structural zzso in the clinical setting following zzso 

Prospective zzso design, comparing groups with regard to: zzso the presence or absence of cerebral pathology and zzso the location of cerebral zzso The zzso value of injury variables was investigated using zzso zzso 

zzso children, between 6 and 14 years, who sustained a moderate to severe zzso 5 years previously participated in this zzso Children's performances on five measures of zzso control were examined in relation to the presence, location and severity of their zzso as coded by the zzso zzso system zzso 

zzso zzso severity was not zzso of performance on any of the zzso However, generalized zzso and zzso and zzso zzso severity was zzso of poor zzso 

These findings support the argument that functional organization in children may differ from that in adults, suggesting that multiple cerebral regions, or a diffuse cerebral network, may mediate children's executive functions zzso zzso are also consistent with the hypothesis that the amount of damaged brain zzso rather than its location, may be more zzso of zzso outcome following early zzso
