A rat model was used to distinguish between the different factors that contribute to muscle tissue damage related to deep pressure zzso that develop after zzso zzso The separate and combined effects of zzso and deformation were zzso zzso was applied to the zzso of rats for 2 zzso Muscle tissue was examined using MR imaging zzso and zzso An zzso loading device allowed simultaneous loading and measurement of tissue zzso Two separate loading protocols incorporated zzso zzso resulting in tissue zzso and zzso zzso zzso loading was applied to the zzso anterior by means of an zzso and zzso loading was accomplished with an inflatable zzso zzso of the muscle tissue during zzso loading was measured using MR zzso zzso of the zzso for 2 h led to increased zzso values, which were correlated to zzso regions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso indicated a large zzso region during zzso zzso zzso loading for 2 h led to zzso tissue zzso From the zzso experiments, local strain fields were zzso A zzso zzso corresponding to a surface pressure of 150 zzso resulted in maximum zzso strain up to zzso There was a good correlation between the location of damage and the location of high zzso zzso It was concluded that the large zzso in conjunction with zzso provided the main trigger for irreversible muscle zzso
