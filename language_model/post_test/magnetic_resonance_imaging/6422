The assessment of regional pulmonary ventilation and zzso is essential for the evaluation of a variety of lung zzso Pulmonary ventilation zzso using zzso oxygen as a contrast medium can be obtained with a clinical MR zzso without additional equipment, and has been demonstrated to be a feasible means of assessing ventilation in animal models and some clinical zzso However, few studies have reported on MR zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of zzso ventilation in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso in a canine model of pulmonary embolism and airway zzso 

zzso pulmonary zzso were produced in eight dogs by intravenous injection of zzso strips at the pulmonary zzso zzso level, and airway zzso were created in five of the dogs by inserting a zzso balloon zzso into a secondary zzso zzso MR ventilation images were produced by zzso images from before and after inhalation of pure zzso Pulmonary zzso MR images were acquired with a dynamic three-dimensional fast zzso zzso MR ventilation and zzso images were read and contrasted with results from general examinations of pathological zzso zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso 

zzso identified as having airway zzso matched using both MR ventilation and zzso imaging, but regions of pulmonary zzso were zzso The area of airway obstruction defects was smaller using MR ventilation imagery than that using ventilation zzso zzso zzso regions due to pulmonary zzso were divided into defective regions and reduced regions based on the time course of signal intensity zzso In the diagnosis of pulmonary zzso with the technique of ventilation and zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso respectively, and the diagnostic results of this zzso technique were in agreement with the results of zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso ventilation in combination with pulmonary zzso zzso can be used to diagnose abnormalities of airways and blood vessels in the zzso and can provide regional functional information with high spatial and zzso zzso This method possesses great potential value for clinical zzso
