In this work, the effectiveness of using zzso zzso with an external magnetic field to improve retention of transplanted adult zzso stem cells zzso during cellular zzso was zzso As a zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso cell tracking label, the zzso are zzso carbon zzso capsules that render zzso magnetic when zzso zzso were internally labeled with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cell rolling zzso and ex zzso cardiac zzso experiments zzso demonstrated increased zzso retention of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell injections were performed around a zzso T zzso ring magnet zzso onto the left zzso of female juvenile pigs zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso magnet exposure time, and zzso were varied to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the proposed zzso zzso of retained cells in collected zzso by zzso analysis zzso or zzso showed that the external magnet helped retain nearly three times more zzso zzso than zzso zzso The zzso magnet was tolerated for up to zzso zzso however, an inflammatory response to the magnet was noted after 48 zzso These zzso studies support the feasibility and value of using zzso as a magnetic zzso zzso to improve cell retention during cellular zzso
