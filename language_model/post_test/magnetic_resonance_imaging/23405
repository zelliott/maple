The current study examined the neural systems underlying zzso zzso phonetic variation in spoken word zzso Participants were asked to read aloud zzso presented words, which either had a voiced minimal pair zzso neighbor zzso zzso or lacked a minimal pair zzso neighbor zzso zzso The voiced neighbor never appeared in the stimulus zzso zzso results showed longer zzso time for zzso target words, replicating earlier behavioral results zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso of interaction in speech zzso Language and zzso zzso 24, zzso zzso zzso results revealed reduced zzso for zzso words compared to zzso words in a network including left zzso superior zzso zzso the zzso zzso inferior frontal zzso and zzso zzso These findings support cascade models of spoken word production and show that neural zzso at the zzso level zzso zzso in those brain regions involved in zzso selection, zzso planning, and, ultimately, motor plans for zzso The zzso effects for words with zzso neighbors suggest that competition effects reflect the overlap inherent in the zzso representation of the target word and its zzso zzso
