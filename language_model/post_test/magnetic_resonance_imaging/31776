While much has been learned regarding the neural zzso supporting episodic zzso using highly controlled experimental zzso relatively little is known regarding the neural bases of episodic zzso of real-world zzso In an effort to examine this issue, we measured zzso activity while observers viewed a novel TV zzso Three weeks later, subsequent memory zzso for the narrative content of movie events was zzso We analyzed the zzso data for zzso correlations zzso based on subjects' subsequent memory zzso performance to identify brain regions whose zzso response is significantly more correlated across subjects during portions of the movie that are successfully as compared to unsuccessfully zzso These regions include the zzso zzso superior zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Further analyses reveal zzso that these correlated regions can display distinct zzso profiles and zzso that the results seen with the zzso analysis are complementary to more traditional linear models and allow analysis of complex time course zzso Thus, the zzso analysis extends traditional subsequent memory findings to a rich, dynamic and more ecologically valid zzso
