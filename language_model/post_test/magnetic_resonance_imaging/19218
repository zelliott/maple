zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in patients with acute head injury was conducted to study if contrast zzso was associated with development of zzso zzso A series of 60 zzso patients were admitted to our emergency zzso zzso zzso zzso scans and skull zzso films were taken as rapidly as possible after zzso zzso severity on admission was evaluated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso score, motor score, and zzso examination, while overall outcome was assessed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 months after zzso Of all patients admitted, MR imaging with zzso enhancement was performed in 18 patients who were at high risk of developing zzso zzso within 6 h after zzso In these patients we investigated whether contrast zzso was associated with development of zzso zzso All 18 patients presented abnormal findings on their admission CT zzso Admission zzso score in those patients who underwent MR imaging with zzso enhancement was 13 or more in 12 patients, 9-12 in four patients, and 8 or less in two zzso Fourteen of 18 patients showed contrast zzso corresponding with an evolution of zzso zzso Nine of 14 patients who demonstrated zzso of the contrast medium required surgical zzso The results of the current study suggest that zzso of contrast medium indicates a zzso of zzso zzso Thus, MR imaging with zzso enhancement in acutely zzso patients may constitute a reasonable strategy for predicting the development of zzso zzso
