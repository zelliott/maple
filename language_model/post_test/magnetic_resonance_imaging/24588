This paper describes an automatic zzso that uses a zzso zzso approach to restore the shape of three-dimensional zzso left zzso zzso models created from magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The basic premise is to restore the zzso shape such that the zzso zzso surface is smooth after the restoration and that the general shape characteristic of the zzso is not zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Minimum zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso surface are used to construct a zzso zzso objective function to restore the shape of a zzso zzso via a zzso zzso deformation process and a zzso geometric deformation zzso A limited memory zzso algorithm, zzso is then used to solve the zzso zzso The goal of the zzso is to achieve a smooth zzso shape by zzso zzso and zzso translation of zzso in the zzso zzso We tested our zzso on 30 sets of zzso models with simulated motion artifact generated from a very smooth patient sample, and 20 in zzso zzso models which contain significant motion zzso In the 30 simulated samples, the zzso distances with respect to the Ground Truth are significantly reduced after restoration, signifying that the zzso can restore geometrical accuracy of zzso zzso zzso In the 20 in zzso zzso models, the results show that our method is able to restore the shape of zzso models without altering the general shape of the zzso The zzso of zzso translations are also consistent with existing registration techniques and experimental zzso
