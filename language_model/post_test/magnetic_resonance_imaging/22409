zzso phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging zzso provides a tool to zzso regional zzso wall motion of the entire zzso It allows the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso fields with high spatial resolution that reflect the zzso evolution of zzso zzso over the cardiac zzso In contrast to other imaging zzso such as zzso left zzso performance can be assessed without limited anatomical or functional zzso 

Compared to other techniques that zzso local zzso zzso zzso implanted zzso zzso by means of regional zzso phase contrast zzso provides information about local and global left zzso zzso zzso zzso by utilizing the intrinsic motion sensitivity of zzso The zzso motion components of contraction, expansion, zzso zzso and zzso of the left zzso are described in high spatial and zzso zzso Phase contrast zzso were performed in 12 healthy volunteers with a zzso technique in order to achieve a high zzso resolution of zzso to demonstrate the detailed assessment of global and regional zzso zzso 

Data revealed details in left zzso motion patterns that were previously not seen in phase contrast zzso and are only known from zzso For all volunteers, characteristic zzso motion patterns and locally different zzso zzso contraction and zzso zzso zzso twisting and zzso and zzso zzso lengthening and zzso motion components could be detected with high zzso 

The phase contrast zzso technique for high zzso resolution zzso mapping is therefore very promising for the investigation and better understanding of the zzso motion in normal subjects and patients with disturbed left zzso performance and may validate further testing of different models of cardiac zzso
