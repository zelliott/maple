To zzso determine the zzso stability and potential changes of functional parameters in zzso zzso recipients obtained from zzso imaging zzso and blood zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Nine zzso zzso recipients underwent zzso and zzso twice, once 7 zzso 3 months after zzso and again 32 zzso 2 months after the first zzso zzso yielded an apparent diffusion zzso zzso and the zzso contribution zzso zzso zzso imaging yielded zzso providing an zzso of zzso zzso zzso of variation between zzso ) and within subjects zzso ) were zzso 

The parameters were stable after 32 months in eight of the nine patients, who had zzso zzso Mean diffusion values were very similar in the first and second zzso zzso and zzso for zzso values were less than zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso and zzso but were higher for zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were also low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased significantly zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso suggesting reduced cortical oxygen zzso One subject with decreased zzso zzso rate demonstrated strongly altered zzso 

In the absence of graft dysfunction, zzso and zzso imaging yield consistent results over 3 years in stable human zzso zzso zzso
