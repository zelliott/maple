Working memory zzso representations can bias visual selection to matching stimuli in the zzso zzso biases can, however, be modulated by the level of cognitive load, with zzso guidance reduced as memory load zzso Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish between competing hypotheses for the reduction of zzso guidance under zzso 1) poor neural representations of memory contents under high load, 2) strategic control at high loads to direct attention away from search zzso matching the zzso content, and 3) reduction of frontal zzso zzso of visual areas with increasing memory zzso We show that matching between zzso contents and the visual display appeared to be well represented in visual areas under high memory zzso despite a lack of zzso guidance at the behavioral zzso There was little engagement of zzso zzso areas in the prefrontal zzso during search at high zzso More importantly, zzso guidance at low loads engaged a set of frontal regions in the superior and inferior zzso frontal zzso zzso connectivity analyses revealed frontal regions working in concert with zzso areas at low memory zzso but this zzso was disrupted by increased memory zzso We discuss the implications for understanding the mechanisms supporting the interplay between zzso and zzso
