zzso duct injury is one of the serious surgical complications of zzso zzso zzso Clear zzso tract imaging to detect the anomaly of the zzso ducts before operation is thought to be useful to prevent this zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the zzso feasibility of using zzso zzso zzso scanning after drip infusion zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso were carried out in 33 patients and zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso were also carried out in all of these zzso We evaluated the recognition of the junction of the zzso duct and detection of anomalies of the zzso zzso ducts using the latter two zzso 

In 33 patients, zzso showed the junction of the zzso duct in 31 zzso and zzso in 25 zzso patients, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso ducts or the zzso duct were detected in four zzso patients by zzso but zzso could show only one of these zzso There were no major adverse reactions in either zzso 

zzso is an zzso zzso technique as compared with zzso for the zzso tract zzso zzso may be of benefit for both patients scheduled to undergo zzso and their zzso
