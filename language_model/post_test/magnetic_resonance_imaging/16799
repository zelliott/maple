The role of the zzso in imagining the future has been of considerable zzso zzso right zzso engagement is observed for imagined future events relative to remembered past events, and patients with zzso damage are impaired when imagining detailed future zzso However, some patients with zzso damage are not impaired at zzso suggesting that there are conditions in which the zzso may not be necessary for episodic zzso Given the known zzso role in memory zzso the zzso activity associated with imagining may reflect the zzso of simulations rather than event construction per zzso The present functional zzso study investigated this zzso Participants imagined future events in response to person, place, and object zzso A zzso zzso test probing memory for detail sets classified future events as either successfully zzso or zzso A contrast of successfully versus unsuccessfully zzso events revealed anterior and zzso right zzso zzso When imagined events were successfully zzso both anterior and zzso zzso showed common functional connectivity to a network including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cortex, and zzso prefrontal zzso However, when zzso was zzso only the anterior zzso and not the zzso exhibited this pattern of zzso These findings demonstrate that right zzso activity observed during future simulation may reflect the zzso of the simulations into zzso This function is not essential for constructing coherent scenarios and may explain why some patients with zzso damage are still able to imagine the zzso
