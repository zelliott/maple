To evaluate the utility of zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in detecting zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in 25 patients with acute and 23 patients with chronic zzso and in 20 control subjects without known pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fast zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were zzso These three sets of images were evaluated both zzso for decreased or zzso signal intensity zzso scale, zzso and zzso zzso of interest zzso in the head, body, and tail of the zzso in each zzso 

Good correlation between zzso assessment and objective data was zzso The zzso sequence showed an zzso with greater frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnitude zzso zzso score, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than that of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The overall sensitivity and specificity of zzso was zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of signal intensity and enhancement, zzso was not able to differentiate acute from chronic zzso 

zzso was highly sensitive for disease zzso particularly using the zzso zzso but using the sequences zzso was not able to differentiate acute from chronic zzso
