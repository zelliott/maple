A barrier to the acceptance of active surveillance for men with prostate cancer is the risk of zzso the cancer burden on initial zzso We assessed the value of zzso magnetic resonance imaging in predicting upgrading on zzso biopsy in men with low risk prostate zzso 

A total of 388 consecutive men zzso age zzso years, range 33 to zzso with clinically low risk prostate cancer zzso biopsy zzso score 6 or less, prostate specific zzso less than 10 zzso clinical stage zzso or less) underwent zzso magnetic resonance imaging before zzso zzso Three zzso independently and zzso scored tumor visibility on zzso magnetic resonance imaging using a zzso scale zzso no tumor to zzso zzso zzso agreement was assessed with weighted zzso zzso zzso between magnetic resonance imaging scores and zzso biopsy findings were evaluated using measures of diagnostic performance and zzso zzso zzso 

On zzso zzso zzso score was upgraded in 79 of 388 zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging scores of 2 or less had a high negative zzso value zzso and specificity zzso for upgrading on zzso zzso A magnetic resonance imaging score of 5 was highly sensitive for upgrading on zzso biopsy zzso At zzso analysis patients with higher magnetic resonance imaging scores were more likely to have disease upgraded on zzso biopsy zzso ratio zzso zzso agreement and diagnostic performance were higher for the more experienced readers zzso zzso zzso zzso than for the least experienced reader zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging performed similarly in predicting low risk and very low risk zzso score 6, less than 3 positive cores, less than 50% involvement in all zzso prostate zzso 

Adding zzso magnetic resonance imaging to the initial clinical evaluation of men with clinically low risk prostate cancer helps predict findings on zzso biopsy and assess eligibility for active zzso
