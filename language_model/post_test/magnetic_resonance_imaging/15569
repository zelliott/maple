To zzso evaluate the accuracy of contrast zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging for determining impaired coronary flow zzso reserve zzso by using zzso flow measurement as the reference zzso 

The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and all patients gave written informed zzso zzso patients underwent zzso cardiac MR imaging and invasive measurement of zzso For zzso MR imaging, a zzso zzso zzso recovery zzso echo sequence with zzso free zzso was zzso Sections were divided into six zzso For each segment, a zzso and zzso zzso zzso reserve index zzso was calculated by using the zzso of the signal zzso curve during the first pass of contrast material at rest and during zzso infusion zzso zzso per zzso body weight per zzso zzso of vascular regions were compared with the corresponding zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analysis was performed to find the number of segments needed for best diagnostic accuracy of zzso and to find a zzso value for zzso in the detection of a reduced zzso 

Thirty-five patients were evaluated zzso ratio, zzso mean age zzso standard zzso zzso years zzso zzso mean body mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso and 43 vascular regions were zzso A linear correlation was found between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso was significantly lower in vascular regions with a zzso of less than zzso than in regions with a zzso of zzso or greater zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso of less than zzso was more accurate with zzso zzso zzso than with zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso of the segments with the three lowest zzso of a vascular region showed the best diagnostic performance in the detection of a zzso of less than zzso zzso under the zzso curve, zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso by using a zzso value of zzso 

The diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso analysis in zzso cardiac MR imaging is higher than that of zzso zzso
