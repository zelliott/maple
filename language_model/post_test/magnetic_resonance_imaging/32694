A fast spiral chemical shift imaging zzso sequence was developed for application to zzso zzso zzso The sequence exploits sparse zzso which can occur in such applications, and prior knowledge of resonance zzso to reduce the measurement time by zzso the data in the spectral zzso As a consequence, multiple reconstructions of a given data set have to be zzso in which only components with zzso within a certain bandwidth are reconstructed zzso zzso while others are severely blurred zzso zzso The sequence was tested at 3 T on a phantom containing approximately zzso solutions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (with two zzso zzso and zzso at zzso equilibrium zzso all enriched to zzso zzso in the C1 zzso zzso zzso from zzso with a single spatial zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso were compared with those obtained by zzso free induction zzso zzso zzso The zzso maps of all four zzso for zzso zzso and of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso demonstrate resolution and zzso properties similar to those of the zzso zzso The zzso maps of Ala and zzso for zzso zzso contain minor artifacts due to signal overlap of zzso zzso
