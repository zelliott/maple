Recent advances on functional magnetic resonance technology have greatly broadened its application in many disciplines including zzso research zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso which combines the anatomical and functional features of the neural system, is a zzso and zzso zzso Among so many zzso blood zzso level dependent zzso reflects the neural activities of visual zzso diffusion zzso imaging traces nerve zzso zzso enhanced zzso could access zzso barrier zzso zzso enhanced zzso reveals zzso transport and zzso projection to zzso zzso blood volume zzso could evaluate zzso zzso of zzso wall; while magnetic resonance zzso investigates the molecular metabolism in nerve zzso zzso may damage the whole visual pathway, and zzso would helps us estimate the in zzso fiber integrity and visual functional status quo in glaucoma zzso Here we first review the basic principles of several zzso techniques and then discuss the applications in research related to zzso
