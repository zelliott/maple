The zzso of regional mechanical dysfunction in the border zone zzso region of left zzso aneurysm was studied in an zzso model using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and regional deformation zzso 

zzso zzso were created in adult zzso sheep zzso zzso 8) by zzso of the zzso zzso coronary artery and were allowed to mature into left zzso zzso for 8 to 12 zzso Animals were zzso subsequently using double zzso magnetic resonance imaging with zzso tissue zzso Short axis slices were selected for analysis that included predominantly the zzso component of the aneurysm as well as adjacent zzso regions in the anterior and zzso zzso zzso Dark grid patterns of magnetic zzso were placed on the zzso and tracked as they zzso during the zzso zzso zzso and zzso ejection zzso of the cardiac zzso Regional zzso wall strains were calculated in zzso regions and regions remote from the aneurysm and compared with strains measured in corresponding regions from normal control sheep zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso strains zzso zzso were relatively zzso but abnormal zzso lengthening strains were observed in the zzso regions during zzso zzso Peak zzso strains ranged from zzso to zzso in the zzso regions but averaged zzso in the normal hearts zzso zzso zzso for the anterior zzso and p zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso fiber strains were depressed in the anterior zzso zzso to zzso for the zzso versus zzso for the normal heart, p zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our data support the theory that the stretching of zzso fibers during zzso zzso contributed to a reduction in fiber zzso during zzso ejection and thus reduced the overall contribution of these fibers to forward zzso zzso
