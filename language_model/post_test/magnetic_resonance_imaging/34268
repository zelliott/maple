We assessed the value of zzso magnetic resonance zzso wrist zzso in comparison with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the evaluation of 13 individual wrist ligaments in 35 patients with zzso wrist zzso In 20 of these patients MR findings were correlated with the findings from zzso wrist zzso For MR imaging zzso zzso a three-dimensional volume acquisition with a zzso echo sequence and zzso zzso effective slice thickness was zzso The zzso of individual wrist ligaments was rated as zzso in zzso of zzso MR and zzso of MR zzso zzso zzso evaluation was possible with high diagnostic confidence in zzso by zzso MR imaging and zzso by MR zzso With wrist zzso as the standard of reference, average zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso defects were zzso for zzso MR imaging and zzso for MR zzso Our findings suggest that MR zzso is more accurate than standard zzso in zzso and evaluating the ligaments of the zzso
