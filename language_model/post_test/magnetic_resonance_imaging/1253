A cohort zzso 

To determine the frequency of swelling of the spinal zzso with an zzso zzso occurring after zzso for zzso cervical zzso and the possible mechanism of zzso motor zzso of the upper zzso 

zzso enlargement of the spinal zzso with an zzso zzso after zzso surgery for cervical zzso zzso has been zzso But the frequency of the zzso remains zzso zzso motor zzso occurring mainly in the zzso and zzso segments is known but various theories on its zzso exist, including the root involvement hypothesis and the spinal zzso impairment zzso Thus, the zzso is zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with cervical zzso zzso were included in this zzso All of them underwent zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso magnetic resonance imaging 3 weeks after zzso We watched for the occurrence of zzso zzso deterioration including paralysis of the upper zzso We also observed the presence or absence of zzso abnormal expansion of zzso zzso intensity areas on magnetic resonance imaging in the spinal zzso 

Seven patients zzso showed zzso abnormal expansion of the zzso zzso intensity area; 3 of the 7 were zzso A total of 9 patients zzso experienced unilateral upper motor zzso after zzso In 4 of the 9 cases, zzso of the unilateral zzso biceps and zzso muscles zzso zzso occurred between 4 and 6 days after zzso None of the 4 showed zzso abnormal expansion of the zzso zzso intensity zzso In 3 other of the 9 patients, zzso zzso occurred just after surgical zzso Two of the 3 showed zzso abnormal expansion of the zzso zzso intensity area and 1 showed slight expansion of the zzso In the other 2 cases, diffuse zzso occurred, and their zzso magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal expansion of the zzso zzso intensity zzso 

Spinal zzso enlargement with abnormal expansion of the zzso zzso intensity area, although not common, is an zzso complication after zzso This was strongly related with zzso and diffuse type of zzso zzso of the upper zzso without deterioration of lower motor function, but was little associated with a zzso type of zzso so-called zzso and zzso zzso
