To investigate whether zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has the diagnostic capability and sensitivity comparable to the combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso iron zzso zzso zzso zzso in the detection of small zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with 56 zzso zzso range, zzso zzso who underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a mean zzso of 4 days zzso zzso zzso were included in this zzso zzso were diagnosed by zzso zzso zzso 25) and imaging findings zzso zzso zzso Two observers independently reviewed the zzso acid set zzso early zzso and zzso phase zzso and the zzso zzso set, at an initial reading session, and then reached zzso zzso accuracy and sensitivity were evaluated using the zzso response receiver operator characteristic zzso 

zzso accuracy zzso and sensitivity were similar for both image sets zzso zzso for zzso acid set; zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were 5 and 3 zzso that were verified only on the zzso acid set and zzso zzso set, zzso All 9 zzso that were not verified on the zzso acid set were assigned a low confidence rating of 1 or zzso However, 3 of the 11 zzso which were not verified on zzso zzso were not seen even upon retrospective zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can replace zzso zzso for the detection of zzso Because all zzso were delineated on zzso zzso zzso even with a low confidence rating, and 3 zzso were not seen on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be more advantageous than zzso zzso for zzso zzso
