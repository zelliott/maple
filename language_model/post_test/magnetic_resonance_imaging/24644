In the visual zzso zzso demand on a zzso task has been shown to zzso the extent to which irrelevant information can be disregarded at a zzso stage of zzso In the auditory zzso the effect of zzso demand on neural representations of zzso sounds is zzso We compared simultaneous zzso and zzso responses associated with zzso sounds across zzso modulated zzso task demands in a zzso zzso Participants performed a signal detection task in one ear zzso zzso while ignoring zzso syllable sounds in the other ear zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso of syllable processing by auditory zzso demand in an zzso in middle left superior zzso zzso and in negative zzso activity zzso zzso post stimulus zzso zzso the zzso demand in the zzso ear was associated with a reduced neural response in both zzso and zzso to zzso zzso These findings are in support of a selection model zzso ongoing zzso demands zzso zzso sound processing in auditory zzso
