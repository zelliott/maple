Over the past decade, the use of zzso MR zzso imaging in the pediatric zzso population has become increasingly accepted as an innovative and important zzso zzso The authors zzso their experience using a mobile zzso zzso imaging unit with integrated zzso with the goal of identifying procedures and/or zzso in which the application of this technology changed the course of surgery or modified the operative zzso 

A database has been zzso maintained for this patient zzso The authors reviewed the hospital charts and imaging results for all patients in the zzso This review revealed 105 zzso procedures performed in 98 children zzso male and 49 zzso between March 1998 and April zzso zzso zzso and/or quality assurance images were obtained at the discretion of the zzso 

The median age at surgery was 12 years (4 zzso zzso One hundred zzso and 5 spinal procedures were zzso 22 of these procedures were performed for zzso zzso zzso planning scans were obtained for 102 procedures, and zzso was used in 93 zzso The greatest impact of zzso imaging was apparent in the 55 procedures to zzso zzso zzso ID scans were obtained in 49 of these zzso Further surgery was performed in zzso of the procedures during which ID scans had been zzso A smaller proportion of ID scans in the different zzso pathology groups (5 of 21 zzso cases, 4 of 9 vascular zzso resulted in further zzso to meet the surgical goal of the zzso Two ID scans obtained during 5 procedures for the treatment of spinal disease did not lead to any change in zzso zzso scans did not reveal any acute adverse zzso There was 1 zzso adverse event in which a Greenberg zzso was inadvertently left on during ID scanning but was removed after the scout zzso 

The application of zzso imaging in the pediatric zzso population zzso at zzso the opportunity to perform less invasive surgical zzso Its potential is greatest when its high-quality imaging ability is coupled with its superior zzso capabilities, which permits tracking of the extent of zzso of zzso tumors and, to a lesser extent, other zzso during the surgical zzso
