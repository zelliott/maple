A case of zzso zzso and zzso following zzso zzso using a single carbon fiber zzso cage is zzso 

To describe a previously zzso complication of zzso zzso and zzso following zzso zzso zzso fusion using a single carbon fiber zzso 

Various complications have been reported with zzso These include graft migration, zzso implant zzso zzso zzso incidental zzso zzso transient or permanent zzso deficits, persistence of pain, and wound zzso There are no reported cases of zzso zzso or zzso zzso associated with zzso 

A 35-year-old infantryman on active duty with chronic low back pain and single-level zzso disc zzso underwent zzso zzso after reporting no improvement with 3 years of zzso physical therapy and zzso pain zzso His back pain was reported improved at 6 weeks after zzso At 12 weeks after surgery, he presented to the emergency department with intense back pain and zzso Laboratory data were remarkable for elevated zzso zzso rate zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso imaging studies, including a zzso zzso did not demonstrate any zzso The patient continued to spike zzso and a repeat zzso zzso 1 week later clearly demonstrated the presence of an zzso zzso at the level of the zzso zzso The patient was treated with surgical zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso cage was left in zzso zzso cultures identified zzso zzso as the zzso and the patient was placed on intravenous zzso During the ensuing 3 weeks, his clinical symptoms worsened and his zzso demonstrated zzso in the region of his zzso zzso Repeat zzso was performed, and his zzso cage and zzso screw zzso were removed 4 months after initial zzso 

The disc space infection resolved following removal of the zzso zzso at 6 months after zzso removal demonstrated solid bilateral zzso zzso The patient returned to active duty 1 year after his initial surgery, reporting that his back pain was reduced compared with his zzso zzso 

There is a paucity of literature on zzso zzso and zzso as complications associated with zzso In this case, the infection persisted despite surgical zzso and intravenous zzso The patient ultimately required removal of the zzso implant and zzso zzso The patient developed solid zzso zzso despite the presence of deep infection, which led to early implant removal 4 months after the initial zzso This case underscores the potential importance of zzso zzso fusion, particularly following wide zzso and zzso required for zzso
