To test for zzso damage or dysfunction in white matter tracts remote from acute zzso zzso we used brain zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging to measure changes in zzso zzso zzso an index of zzso integrity, in the white matter of the zzso zzso of three patients with large, solitary brain zzso zzso of the type seen early in multiple zzso During the acute phase of their disease, all patients showed normal ratios of zzso to zzso zzso resonance intensity throughout the zzso zzso to the zzso However, on examination 1 month later, all of the patients showed zzso low zzso resonance intensity ratios zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso which were zzso to the zzso zzso Other zzso in the zzso zzso showed normal zzso relative resonance zzso The decrease in zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso resolved in all patients after 6 months, with a time course similar to that observed for zzso from zzso within the zzso We conclude that effects of damage or dysfunction to zzso zzso inflammatory zzso can be transmitted over long distances in the zzso white zzso Such remote, secondary effects may be an expression of dysfunction of zzso in projection pathways or of the reorganization of functional pathways seen in brains recovering from an acute zzso
