Several recent studies have attempted to evaluate the accuracy of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in predicting the likelihood of zzso involvement of the zzso zzso zzso margin zzso in zzso cancer with the intention of selecting patients who might benefit from zzso therapy and as a guide to zzso The aim of this study was to assess whether such studies can provide a valid answer as to whether zzso zzso can accurately predict zzso involvement by zzso 

The study design and methodology of studies on this topic were critically zzso 

Features identified as affecting the efficacy of these studies were: zzso of patients, definition of the margin assessed by zzso and by zzso lack of blinding of surgeons and zzso to zzso results, effect of zzso treatment, and number of patients zzso 

Because of zzso zzso in studies completed to date, there is insufficient evidence of the ability of a positive zzso result to predict an involved zzso Although zzso may be able to identify a zzso that has extended to the zzso zzso and/or zzso plane, zzso it cannot indicate where the surgical boundary of the zzso will ultimately lie, and therefore cannot zzso predict an involved zzso and should not be relied upon for this zzso
