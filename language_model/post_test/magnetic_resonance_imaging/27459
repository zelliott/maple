zzso iron oxide zzso zzso have been widely used for stem cell labeling and zzso Surface modification has been known to improve zzso zzso and labeling efficiency of zzso zzso However, the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on proliferation and differentiation of human zzso stem cells zzso remain zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate how zzso zzso zzso affected zzso In this study, zzso zzso and the zzso presence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso were demonstrated by zzso blue zzso transmission electron zzso and magnetic resonance zzso Moreover, accelerated cell proliferation was found to be associated with cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso differentiation zzso of zzso were impaired after treating with zzso while zzso potential was relatively zzso zzso zzso production profile in zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso may account for the increased proliferation and impaired differentiation zzso zzso of the growth factors in the zzso condition medium including zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso growth factor and vascular zzso growth factor, as well as soluble form of zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso were higher than in the zzso zzso In zzso although zzso zzso labeling is effective for cell zzso properties of zzso may alter as a consequence and this needs to be taken into account when evaluating therapeutic zzso of zzso stem cells in zzso
