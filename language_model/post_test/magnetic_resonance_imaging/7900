The zzso zzso nucleus zzso is a promising target structure for deep brain stimulation zzso in patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso would improve spatial accuracy in functional zzso neurosurgery for treatment of this zzso 

On zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso acquisition parameters were adjusted for optimal zzso of the zzso in 1 healthy zzso zzso of zzso zzso was then evaluated in 5 healthy individuals and 3 patients with zzso zzso 

In all individuals, an adjusted zzso sequence allowed for zzso of the zzso It was clearly distinguishable from zzso zzso zzso surrounding it zzso and zzso and appeared zzso compared to the adjacent zzso zzso Image resolution and contrast facilitated direct zzso targeting of the zzso prior to zzso surgery in all 3 zzso 

zzso targeting of the zzso can be zzso which has immediate implications for the accuracy of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso
