The ability of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to detect early brain meningitis was evaluated in a canine zzso zzso dose, timing zzso and imaging technique zzso the use of zzso zzso were zzso 

Imaging of five zzso was performed at zzso T 24 hours after injection of zzso staphylococcus into the zzso zzso Two control animals also were zzso using the same zzso with one animal receiving a zzso injection of zzso broth only and the other no zzso zzso doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso zzso were performed at 2, 12, and 22 minutes after an initial injection of zzso zzso At each time point, paired zzso scans with and without zzso transfer zzso were zzso Thirty minutes after the initial injection of contrast, a supplemental dose of zzso zzso was given (for a cumulative dose of zzso zzso zzso were then repeated at 2, 12, and 22 minutes after this dose was zzso A second supplemental contrast injection of zzso zzso (for a cumulative dose of zzso zzso was given at 70 minutes, and immediate zzso scans with and without zzso were zzso 

In the animals receiving a zzso injection of bacteria, the degree of zzso enhancement was greatest at zzso zzso intermediate at zzso zzso and least at zzso zzso These conclusions were constant whether imaging was performed with or without zzso zzso in control studies did not demonstrate abnormal zzso zzso zzso dose, zzso and acquisition of immediate zzso scans all resulted in statistically significant zzso On masked film review, abnormal zzso enhancement was noted in only 2 of 5 experimental dogs at a dose of zzso zzso zzso of the use of zzso compared with all animals at a dose of zzso zzso In 18 of 37 dogs zzso scans with and without zzso when abnormal enhancement was noted, the use of zzso improved the zzso of abnormal zzso zzso 

In early brain meningitis, zzso dose zzso zzso zzso and scanning immediately after injection improve detection of abnormal zzso enhancement, thus zzso the diagnosis of zzso Of these factors, contrast dose is the most zzso
