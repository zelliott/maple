Our aim was to describe the normal appearance of the Achilles zzso and zzso zzso in zzso active volunteers using high-resolution MR zzso 

One hundred clinically zzso Achilles zzso were zzso at zzso T with zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso shot zzso and short inversion time inversion recovery zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso junctions were separately evaluated by two zzso 

The average zzso diameter zzso of the zzso Achilles zzso was zzso zzso The anterior margin was flat or zzso in all, except for 10 zzso that showed mild zzso A zzso zzso which shifted from lateral to zzso in the zzso direction, was detected in the anterior margin of 56 zzso The signal intensity was zzso in 45 zzso In these zzso zzso stripes or zzso zzso were zzso A small (3 zzso intermediate intensity zzso region thought to represent zzso zzso was detected in four cases on zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained a prominent fluid collection in 15 zzso The zzso was zzso in all cases on both zzso and STIR zzso 

zzso MR imaging depicts the Achilles zzso and zzso soft zzso in great zzso The normal anatomy of the zzso Achilles zzso is zzso We zzso that the zzso may be a potential source of diagnostic zzso
