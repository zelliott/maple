zzso evidence suggests that during word processing people spontaneously map object, zzso and power information to locations in vertical zzso Specifically, whereas zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso and powerful nouns zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso zzso carpet), negative zzso zzso and powerless nouns zzso zzso are associated with zzso What has yet to be zzso however, is the precise nature of these zzso To explore this issue, an zzso experiment was zzso during which participants were required to categorize the position in which geometrical shapes appeared on a computer screen zzso upper or lower part of the zzso In addition, they also judged a series of words with regard to location zzso up zzso zzso zzso zzso good zzso zzso and power zzso powerful zzso zzso Using zzso pattern analysis, it was found that zzso that successfully distinguished between the positions of shapes in zzso of the inferior zzso lobe also provided zzso information to separate location and zzso but not power word zzso zzso analyses further revealed that, for location words, pattern transfer was more successful the stronger was zzso propensity to use visual zzso These findings indicate that visual coding and conceptual processing can elicit common representations of zzso but that divergent mechanisms may support the reported zzso
