To characterize evolution and distribution of abdominal zzso fat between 6 and 18 weeks of age in an animal model of energy consumption based on mice zzso the zzso zzso protein 3 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was performed six times during the 12 week study; zzso subcutaneous and zzso fat zzso were zzso 

The zzso zzso mice consistently have less zzso zzso zzso muscle and total fat throughout the zzso Mean zzso zzso volumes zzso of the three distinct zzso change between week 6 and week 18 as zzso wild zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso to zzso zzso visceral zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso to zzso zzso visceral zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Although they eat more zzso g compared with zzso g per day) the zzso always weigh less than zzso In zzso control animals, increases of all fat pools between week 6 and week 18 is highly zzso as it is for zzso visceral and total pools in the zzso zzso The zzso mice, however, show no significant absolute or relative increase in zzso zzso zzso is predominantly zzso in skeletal zzso 

zzso provides an excellent approach to comparative studies of fat distribution in animal models of energy expenditure such as the zzso zzso
