zzso is a good predictor of major zzso The current study explores the structural and functional neural zzso of zzso 

To explore structural zzso of zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2003) we used zzso zzso We relate these zzso of zzso to zzso of zzso matter reductions in depressed patients by means of a quantitative zzso on 16 zzso zzso zzso state data was used to zzso maps of the zzso of low frequency zzso 

zzso correlated zzso with zzso matter volume in bilateral inferior frontal zzso zzso left anterior zzso zzso zzso and bilateral mid zzso zzso The volume reductions were within proximity of zzso matter reductions identified in the zzso on depressed patients in bilateral zzso and zzso zzso reductions in resting state activity were overlapping with volume reductions correlated with zzso in zzso and right zzso 

The participants were all healthy control zzso Future research is needed to explore the neural zzso of zzso in major zzso 

The results show that zzso is associated with volume and resting state reductions in brain areas that have been related to cognitive control process of zzso and thought zzso We conclude that zzso not only qualifies as a zzso predictor of major depression but also goes along with zzso abnormalities that are similar to those identified for zzso
