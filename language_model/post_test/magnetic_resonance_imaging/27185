To determine whether it is possible to use bone zzso zzso zzso zzso as a substitute for magnetic resonance zzso imaging for zzso zzso from benign zzso zzso fractures zzso 

zzso fractures in patients who underwent both bone zzso and MR imaging were included in our zzso These 97 fractures were divided into two groups: zzso and benign zzso Two zzso separately classified zzso into zzso and benign according to the criteria for zzso zzso on the zzso zzso and MR imaging as zzso or benign, as reported by many investigators zzso In addition, 97 fractures were divided into two groups based on the MR zzso zzso with complete and partial replacement of the normal fatty zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of both the observers were zzso 

The accuracy of the MR images was significantly greater than that of the zzso images for both the observers zzso 1, zzso observer 2, zzso However, there were no significant differences in sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for zzso zzso from benign zzso with complete replacement of the normal fatty zzso for both the observers zzso 1: sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Bone zzso may be comparable with MR imaging for zzso zzso from benign zzso especially, in the case of zzso with a complete replacement of the normal fatty zzso
