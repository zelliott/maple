zzso and zzso defensive contexts represent two zzso responses to potential and imminent zzso In the context of a zzso the zzso reflects the initial detection of the potential threat, whereas the zzso is associated with direct predatory zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural organization of anticipation and avoidance of artificial predators with high or low probability of capturing the subject across analogous zzso and zzso contexts of zzso zzso with defense systems models, zzso threat zzso activity in zzso areas, including zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso active avoidance during zzso threat increased activity in zzso zzso and zzso zzso During the zzso condition, subjects showed increased zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso and decreased zzso with the zzso amygdala, and zzso Greater activity was observed in the right zzso zzso for high compared with low probability of capture during zzso zzso This region showed decreased zzso with the amygdala, zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso Finally, we found that locomotor errors correlated with zzso reports of panic for the high compared with low probability of capture during the zzso threat, and these zzso locomotor errors were correlated with zzso zzso These findings support models suggesting that higher zzso areas are involved in zzso responses, including the assignment and control of fear, whereas imminent danger results in fast, likely zzso defensive reactions zzso by the zzso
