During zzso choice, the zzso mechanism could include two process zzso a zzso valuation stage and a choice zzso Previous studies suggested that the contribution of zzso valuation may be recruited during the valuation stage, but that was absent during the choice zzso However, no studies have directly demonstrated the neural zzso of zzso valuation from choice processes in zzso zzso Combining a novel, temporally distributed zzso task with zzso zzso we examined this hypothesis whether the neural zzso of zzso valuation were activated in the valuation stage, not in the choice zzso zzso participants discounted delayed rewards following a zzso zzso function, and discount rates varied considerably between participants, reflecting different individual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prefrontal cortical zzso and zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso were correlated strongly with the zzso valuation in the valuation stage, whereas zzso prefrontal cortical zzso and inferior frontal zzso zzso were correlated with choice processes in the choice zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso projection regions show greater sensitivity to the zzso value during the valuation stage, and are absent during the choice stage, which demonstrates the neural zzso of zzso valuation from choice processes in zzso zzso
