zzso Echo zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso which detects changes in blood vessel zzso content, has been investigated as a zzso monitor of changes in human tumor zzso and blood flow, in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso images zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso alpha zzso 40 degrees, zzso zzso were acquired from 31 patients with primary and zzso disease, prior to and during zzso zzso Three patients underwent a follow-up examination after zzso 

zzso out of 34 tumors showed enhanced image intensity, consistent with an improvement in tumor zzso and blood flow, while 11 showed no zzso 6 studies were technical zzso In one patient a zzso zzso that had eluded zzso investigation was zzso A reduction in response was observed in the three patients studied zzso 

This method, which can be performed on a standard clinical zzso zzso provides a zzso measurement of tumor response to zzso flow zzso In principle, this should enable the zzso to zzso treatment zzso such as zzso breathing, for individual zzso zzso
