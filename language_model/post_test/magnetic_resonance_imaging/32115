Giant cell zzso zzso is a rare zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the CT characteristics and describe possible MR imaging features of zzso of the zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed 7 CT studies and 1 MR imaging study of 7 zzso proved cases of zzso in 2 men, 3 women, and 2 patients of unknown zzso aged zzso years, during a period of 10 years, from 1995 to zzso 

The zzso predominantly involved the zzso in 3 patients, the zzso in 2 patients, the zzso bone in 1 patient, and the zzso cavity in 1 zzso These zzso on imaging were zzso masses that demonstrated adjacent bone wall zzso and most were associated with zzso bone zzso They were predominantly masses with zzso zzso on CT scans and may have infiltrated the surrounding zzso zzso The patient with an MR imaging had a zzso that was zzso on both zzso and zzso MR zzso The zzso revealed avid homogeneous contrast zzso 

The imaging features of zzso are zzso However, this entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
