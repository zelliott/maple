zzso the features of the actual executed movement with the associated cortical zzso can enhance the reliability of the functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso data zzso This is crucial for zzso evaluation of motor recovery in neurological patients and for investigating detailed mutual interactions between zzso maps and movement zzso we have explored a new zzso combining zzso with an zzso motion capture system, which provides a zzso zzso of the performed motor zzso 

The cameras of the motion system were mounted inside the MR room and passive markers were placed on the subject skin, without any risk or zzso The versatile zzso allows zzso zzso acquisitions including recording of possible mirror movements, and it guarantees a high zzso zzso demonstrated the integrated zzso reliability through zzso zzso Then, an zzso zzso protocol combined with zzso recordings was tested on a healthy volunteer performing finger tapping and ankle zzso zzso A preliminary assessment of clinical zzso and perspectives was carried out by zzso and post rehabilitation acquisitions on a zzso patient performing ankle zzso zzso For all sessions, the proposed method zzso zzso data into the model design was compared with the standard zzso 

Phantom acquisitions demonstrated the zzso image zzso Healthy subject sessions showed the protocols feasibility and the model reliability with the zzso zzso The patient results showed that brain zzso maps were more consistent when the images analysis included in the zzso model, besides the zzso the zzso zzso zzso the actual executed movement zzso timing and zzso proving a significant model zzso Moreover, concerning motor recovery zzso after one rehabilitation month, a greater cortical area was activated during exercise, in contrast to the usual zzso associated with functional zzso Indeed, the availability of zzso data allows to correlate this wider area with a higher frequency and a larger zzso of zzso 

The zzso acquisitions resulted to be reliable and versatile to enrich the zzso images information and therefore the evaluation of motor recovery in neurological patients where large differences between required and performed motion can be zzso
