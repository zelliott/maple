Brain imaging studies have explored the neural mechanisms of recovery in adults following acquired disorders and, more recently, childhood zzso zzso However, the neural systems underlying adult rehabilitation of zzso based learning disabilities remain zzso despite their high zzso Here we characterize the differences in brain activity during a zzso manipulation task before and after a behavioral intervention in adults with zzso zzso zzso targeted training resulted in performance improvements in tutored compared to zzso zzso and these gains were associated with signal increases in bilateral zzso and right zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that behavioral changes in tutored dyslexic adults are associated with zzso increased activity in those zzso regions engaged by normal readers and zzso zzso activity in the right zzso zzso zzso behavioral plasticity in adult zzso zzso involves two distinct neural mechanisms, each of which has previously been observed either for zzso of zzso or acquired reading zzso
