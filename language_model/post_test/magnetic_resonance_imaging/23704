To determine whether a previously identified zzso reorganization of the cortical motor network after spinal zzso injury zzso is correlated with prognosis and zzso 

We applied the techniques of high-resolution zzso and zzso source analysis to record and map the motor zzso zzso of the zzso cortical zzso in 44 patients after zzso Twenty normal controls were also zzso zzso were analyzed using a distance metric to compare zzso zzso zzso was zzso with individual specific MR images and a boundary element model created for zzso source zzso 

zzso with finger movements were mapped to a zzso location in 20 of 24 zzso compared with normal zzso Two patients, one studied 4 and one 6 weeks after injury, initially had zzso zzso that, on serial testing, moved to an anterior position with zzso zzso source zzso of the zzso generators confirmed these zzso Nine of 20 zzso had a zzso zzso location with actual or attempted toe zzso All 5 patients who could move their toes had zzso zzso The zzso was zzso in 4 of the 15 paralyzed zzso This is a significant difference in zzso The only patient with zzso whose testing was repeated had an zzso that moved to an anterior position with zzso 

zzso reorganization has a significant relationship to prognosis in zzso and is reversed in some zzso patients who recover zzso zzso reorganization may result from a preferential survival of zzso that originate in zzso zzso and contribute to the zzso zzso These preliminary results should be verified by a larger prospective zzso
