To determine the feasibility of measuring diffusion into human zzso disks by means of MR imaging with an intravenous zzso zzso complex zzso 

In 18 patients undergoing zzso spine MR imaging, signal intensity was measured in the zzso disks after a dose of zzso zzso and after a supplemental dose of zzso zzso 

Signal intensity in the zzso disks increased with both zzso zzso A greater increase was consistently achieved with the zzso zzso zzso dose than with the zzso zzso zzso The increase was greater near the zzso than in the zzso of the zzso 

zzso into human zzso disks can be detected with MR imaging after intravenous administration of zzso MR imaging with a zzso contrast medium can be used to study diffusion into disk cartilage in zzso and zzso
