To compare the zzso risk formula zzso as a predictor for zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with prostate cancer with magnetic resonance zzso zzso using zzso zzso particles of Iron zzso zzso and with zzso as gold zzso 

zzso zzso analysis was performed with the results of zzso evaluation of the zzso as dependent variable and the zzso risk according to the zzso and the result of zzso as independent input zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analysis was performed to assess the performance of the zzso 

The analysis included 375 zzso In the zzso zzso models, the zzso and zzso results were both significantly zzso zzso of the presence of zzso zzso In the models with both zzso included, zzso was zzso zzso but zzso remained significant zzso For zzso sensitivity was zzso and specificity was zzso for zzso sensitivity was zzso and specificity was zzso After a negative zzso result, the probability of zzso zzso is zzso regardless of the zzso zzso After a positive zzso the probability of having zzso zzso is zzso 

zzso is a better predictor of the presence of zzso zzso than zzso Using only the zzso can lead to a significant zzso on the pelvic zzso by radiation zzso When the zzso result is available, the zzso is no longer of added zzso
