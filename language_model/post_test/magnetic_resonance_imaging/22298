We investigated the usefulness of modified Dixon technique at zzso T after zzso zzso administration in the characterization of adrenal zzso One hundred and one patients zzso men, 56 zzso mean age: zzso zzso zzso zzso with 125 adrenal masses found at previous US or CT of the abdomen were submitted to zzso The study protocol included preliminary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso zzso was administered and then zzso zzso scans were acquired with modified Dixon technique zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso 30 zzso 192 zzso 192 zzso no zzso zzso Acquisition time is twice as long with this technique as with conventional zzso zzso but three sets of zzso images are zzso conventional SE, zzso and zzso zzso The diagnosis was made at surgery (18 zzso and zzso biopsy zzso zzso or with stable US follow-up findings for at least 1 year zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso to liver in zzso and zzso images, but 32 of them exhibited a small high intensity spot in enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had zzso signal intensity, with relatively higher signal on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images were useful to assess fatty and zzso components within zzso zzso zzso zzso conditions were distinguished from zzso conditions with zzso sensitivity, zzso specificity and zzso diagnostic zzso To zzso modified zzso Dixon technique after contrast agent administration appears to be another useful diagnostic application of midfield zzso to characterize adrenal zzso
