zzso is a common negative symptom in zzso The authors investigated zzso performance and regional brain volumes in schizophrenia patients with high versus low levels of zzso 

zzso patients with low apathy levels zzso and high apathy levels zzso and 12 healthy comparison subjects completed zzso testing as well as magnetic resonance imaging scanning to obtain zzso volumes after total zzso volume was zzso 

The high apathy group scored lower than comparison subjects on rapid zzso sequencing and verbal zzso The high apathy group had lower performance zzso scores than the low apathy and comparison zzso Only the high apathy group showed significantly reduced bilateral frontal lobe volumes relative to comparison zzso both schizophrenia patient groups showed bilateral zzso lobe volume zzso 

The present findings are consistent with studies in other disorders showing frontal lobe involvement in zzso
