Recent research indicates gender differences in the impact of stress on decision behavior, but little is known about the brain mechanisms involved in these zzso stress zzso The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to determine whether induced stress resulted in zzso patterns of brain zzso during a decision task involving monetary zzso Specifically, we manipulated zzso stress levels using a cold zzso task, prior to a risky decision making zzso Healthy men zzso 12 zzso and women zzso 11 zzso completed the decision task after either cold zzso stress or a control task during the period of cortisol response to the cold zzso Gender differences in behavior were present in stressed participants but not controls, such that stress led to greater reward collection and faster decision speed in males but less reward collection and slower decision speed in zzso A zzso interaction was observed for the zzso zzso and anterior zzso With cold stress, zzso in these regions was increased in males but decreased in zzso The findings of this study indicate that the impact of stress on zzso decision processing differs depending on zzso
