Recently, pattern recognition methods zzso support zzso machines zzso have been used to analyze zzso zzso In these applications the zzso scans are treated as spatial patterns and statistical learning methods are used to identify statistical properties of the data that discriminate between brain states zzso task 1 zzso task 2) or group of subjects zzso patients and zzso We propose an extension of these approaches using zzso zzso This makes the dynamic aspect of zzso time series an explicit part of the zzso The proposed pattern recognition approach uses both spatial and zzso zzso zzso embedding was implemented by defining zzso zzso observations and applying a support zzso machine to these temporally extended zzso This produces a discriminating weight zzso encompassing both zzso and zzso The resulting zzso zzso discriminating responses, at each zzso without imposing any constraints on their zzso zzso
