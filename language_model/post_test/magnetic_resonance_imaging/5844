To evaluate the zzso zzso model of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso in mouse with zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR zzso 

zzso slices of the lung volume were acquired with zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 4, 24, and 48 h after zzso zzso A quantitative ventilation index was calculated from two zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso for a cell count was performed following magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The zzso exposure resulted in a significant increase of cells in zzso with maximum at 48 zzso zzso on zzso images were characterized by ventilation zzso whereas zzso on zzso images were zzso and were attributed to zzso The number of zzso was at maximum at 48 zzso At this time point, and for both zzso and zzso zzso the volume of the zzso was significantly higher for zzso mice compared to zzso At 4, 24, and 48 h the ventilation index from the zzso data was significantly smaller for the zzso animals compared to zzso 

The time point 48 h after zzso exposure was advantageous for zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso seems to be more sensitive than conventional zzso zzso
