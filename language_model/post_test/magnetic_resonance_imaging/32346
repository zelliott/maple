zzso zzso zzso zzso employs low zzso currents injected or induced inside an zzso The additional magnetic field due to these currents results in a phase in the MR zzso In this study, a modified fast zzso sequence was used to measure this magnetic field, which is obtained by zzso the MR phase zzso A finite element method with first order triangular elements was used for the solution of the forward zzso An zzso sensitivity zzso zzso was developed for the inverse zzso The resulting zzso zzso equation was zzso using the zzso method and solved using a zzso zzso zzso The spatial and contrast resolution of the technique was tested using zzso gel zzso A circular phantom with 7 zzso diameter and 1 zzso thickness is used in the phantom zzso The zzso of the injected current was 1 zzso 3, 5 and 8 zzso diameter zzso and high conductor objects are used for the spatial resolution study and an average zzso zzso value of zzso zzso is achieved for the 3 zzso zzso zzso For the contrast analysis, the zzso of a 15 zzso object is varied between zzso and zzso with respect to the background and results are compared to the ideal zzso
