The aim of this study is to assess reflected light intensity combined with zzso as a navigation aid during zzso zzso 

During creation of 21 zzso for zzso zzso of deep brain stimulation zzso in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso at 512 zzso and reflected light intensity at zzso zzso were measured continuously and simultaneously with a radio frequency zzso containing optical zzso The signals were compared with the zzso determined from zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The zzso were performed within minutes, and signal analysis was done zzso 

zzso light intensity was low from the cortex, lateral zzso zzso nucleus and zzso intermediate from the zzso zzso and zzso while it was high from the zzso white matter, internal capsule and zzso The electrical zzso was less consistent, but generally low in the cortex, intermediate in the zzso white matter, zzso zzso zzso and thalamus, and high in the internal capsule and zzso 

zzso light intensity and electrical zzso give complementary information about passed zzso and the combination seems promising as a navigation aid during zzso zzso
