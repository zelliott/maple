zzso zzso and zzso zzso are frequently discovered at zzso in patients with zzso zzso liver zzso zzso and zzso of these patients will develop a zzso zzso within 3 years, after a zzso liver zzso These findings strongly support the need for more effective zzso zzso The combined zzso zzso zzso zzso technique zzso has emerged as a promising diagnostic zzso for determining whether patients with zzso disease in the liver are suitable candidates for zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to assess the additional value of information provided by zzso compared to that of conventional zzso studies zzso and zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

Between June 2006 and August 2007, 63 patients evaluated for a first zzso of zzso were entered into a prospective zzso Each patient received a zzso and a zzso zzso patients underwent a zzso and 42 a zzso The main end point of the study was to assess the impact of the zzso findings on the therapeutic zzso 

New findings in the zzso resulted in a change in the therapeutic strategy in 9 zzso of the zzso However, zzso provided additional information was true positive by revealing abdominal zzso zzso only in 4 zzso patients, and falsely zzso four patients and under staged one zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso positive value for liver zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso alone, and zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso was superior to zzso for the detection of local recurrence at the site of the initial zzso zzso 

In the selection of patients with zzso being considered for surgical therapy, zzso provided useful information only in zzso of zzso Possibly longer follow-up will increase this zzso Our findings support the use of zzso mainly in patients with high risk of local zzso
