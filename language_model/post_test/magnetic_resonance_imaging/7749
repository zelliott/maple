Childhood onset motor zzso diseases or zzso are a clinically zzso group of zzso A particularly severe zzso first described in zzso and subsequently called zzso zzso syndrome, is characterized by progressive zzso zzso zzso hearing loss and respiratory zzso There has been no treatment for this progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which leads to respiratory failure and usually death during zzso We recently reported the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a new zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso We used both zzso and zzso sequencing to identify zzso zzso in patients presenting with zzso zzso and zzso zzso with or without respiratory zzso We undertook clinical, zzso and zzso characterization of patients with zzso in zzso functionally zzso the most prevalent zzso and initiated a regimen of high-dose oral zzso We identified 18 patients from 13 families with compound zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso individuals share a core zzso of rapidly progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso with sensory zzso severe weakness of the upper limbs and zzso muscles with distinctly preserved strength of the lower zzso hearing loss, zzso zzso and respiratory zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso cause reduced zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso protein zzso and we report the response to high-dose oral zzso therapy in patients with zzso zzso including significant and sustained clinical and zzso improvements in two patients and preliminary clinical response data in 13 patients with associated zzso improvements in 10 zzso The clinical and zzso responses of this zzso cohort suggest that zzso supplementation can zzso the progression of this neurodegenerative condition, particularly when initiated soon after the onset of zzso
