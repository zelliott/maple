To evaluate the potential of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the zzso of zzso size in patients with a first acute zzso zzso 24 patients with a first acute zzso zzso were studied by zzso gated zzso at a mean of zzso days after the acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the true zzso plane was performed 20 minutes after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso of body zzso zzso zzso regions of increased signal intensity on zzso images were considered to be zzso zzso size (in zzso was determined using zzso rule, and was compared with that based on cumulative release of zzso zzso activity in plasma and with peak zzso zzso level in zzso zzso size zzso with zzso correlated well with zzso zzso size (in g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso and peak zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso enables accurate zzso of zzso size in patients with a first acute zzso zzso
