This study was undertaken to assess the displacement patterns and shifts of the normal zzso zzso in zzso zzso on zzso and to determine if the position of the bright spot zzso represents a predicting factor for the position of the residual zzso zzso in pathological zzso 

In a control group of 102 patients without any zzso pathology, the presence of the zzso was zzso In 100 patients with zzso or zzso zzso presence and respective topography of zzso and zzso were scrutinized on zzso according to zzso type, size, zzso status and zzso findings in the surgical zzso 

The zzso was visible in zzso of 102 cases in the control group, as compared to 75 of the 100 patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso was identified in zzso of the patients, and zzso enhanced more than the zzso in all cases after contrast zzso The zzso was identified in zzso of the 75 zzso zzso patients, as compared to zzso of the 25 zzso zzso The normal residual zzso was zzso zzso in zzso of the 52 operated zzso in 37 zzso zzso patients, it was zzso zzso in zzso and in 28 zzso zzso patients, it was identified in zzso 

The zzso can be identified in the majority and zzso in more than half of the cases with zzso zzso on zzso zzso of both the zzso and zzso help predict the location of the normal residual zzso during surgery and, therefore, may contribute to preserving the zzso zzso
