A new method for measurement of water zzso zzso for zzso and first order movements was used to study the apparent diffusion zzso zzso in 15 patients with chronic multiple sclerosis zzso and in two patients with acute zzso Ten healthy volunteers served as zzso A significantly higher zzso was found within chronic plaques compared to the apparently normal white matter of the chronic zzso The zzso was higher in the acute plaques compared to the chronic zzso The zzso in apparently normal white matter of the chronic patients were significantly higher than in white matter of healthy zzso We zzso that an increase of the zzso in plaques may be related to an increase in the zzso space due to zzso and zzso The increased zzso in apparently normal white matter suggests that there may be a change in the composition of the white matter of chronic zzso patients, perhaps related to zzso and expanded zzso zzso
