To study the MR appearance of knee joint zzso cartilage according to age, sex and body weight 120 subjects underwent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso GE zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were zzso zzso surface, signal intensity and visibility of the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso As for cartilage zzso a statistically significant difference was found between males and females in nearly all the measurement sites, the mean values being always higher in zzso A statistically significant inverse correlation was found in males only, at the three load bearing regions of the zzso zzso zzso No significant correlation was demonstrated between the surface, the signal intensity and the zzso appearance of the cartilage and age, as well as body zzso The cartilage of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso showed a regular surface in zzso zzso and zzso of cases zzso The signal intensity was homogeneous in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso focal zzso were seen in few zzso The visibility rate of the zzso appearance of cartilage was zzso for the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso GE sequence was the best sequence to evaluate cartilage thickness and signal intensity, while zzso zzso sequence was the best sequence to depict the zzso surface and, together with zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso The most relevant result of this study is the inverse correlation between cartilage thickness and age as well as body weight, mainly in zzso in the three areas of greatest load zzso zzso zzso
