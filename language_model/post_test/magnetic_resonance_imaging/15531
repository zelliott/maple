The true zzso of serious zzso complications such as zzso zzso or zzso after zzso zzso infusions is still uncertain, in part due to inconsistencies in zzso data zzso 

Prospective data were collected over 16 zzso from the zzso Acute zzso Service, which is based in a large zzso teaching institution with a zzso general surgical zzso 

Over this period, zzso zzso zzso were inserted for zzso analgesia and 32 zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging scans were undertaken to exclude potential zzso zzso From these, two spinal zzso zzso and six zzso zzso zzso were zzso Only one patient required surgical zzso There were no long-term zzso zzso in any zzso In the past 6 zzso the frequency of investigation and diagnosis of zzso zzso has zzso Overall, the combined rate of zzso zzso or zzso was zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso with a need for operative intervention of zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

Spinal zzso was very rare zzso zzso zzso zzso was also rare zzso zzso but remains a potentially serious zzso Early diagnosis, using magnetic resonance imaging in patients with appropriate clinical zzso before the onset of zzso signs, enables conservative therapy in many cases and may help to prevent the development of serious zzso zzso
