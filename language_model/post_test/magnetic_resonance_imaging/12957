The aim of the current study was to explore the effects of problem structure, namely goal hierarchy and number of optimal solution zzso on the neural architecture that supports problem-solving and zzso Here, zzso problems with both an zzso and ambiguous goal hierarchy and single and multiple optimal solution paths were zzso In the task used, participants were encouraged to generate a solution plan before zzso The behavioral results revealed that problem-solving time and accuracy were both affected by both problem zzso The zzso zzso results revealed three major zzso First, the right prefrontal zzso revealed a significantly different zzso pattern than the other regions zzso This was the only region that revealed a larger response during the execution phase than the planning zzso Second, the effect of goal hierarchy was strongest during the execution zzso Finally, while there was no main effect of number of optimal solution zzso this zzso zzso with goal hierarchy in a number of regions across the zzso The present study also suggests that the minimum number of moves may not be the best measure of problem difficulty and that greater care be taken in the selection of zzso problems for both experimental studies as well as clinical zzso
