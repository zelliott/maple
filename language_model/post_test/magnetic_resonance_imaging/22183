There has been no previous systematic study of zzso multiple zzso This study of zzso pairs with complex traits investigated disease zzso and the genetic contribution to frequency and clinical zzso 

We studied 45 zzso pairs zzso for multiple sclerosis from 58 pairs recorded in a national register of familial disease, 86 offspring of the 45 pairs were individually assessed for clinical evidence of neurological zzso those over age 16 underwent zzso magnetic resonance zzso Clinical features were compared in 33 pairs in whom neither member had symptoms before they zzso 

Of the 86 zzso five zzso had clinically zzso multiple zzso A further five children had either characteristic imaging abnormalities or clinical symptoms consistent with zzso but did not meet the criteria for clinically zzso zzso There was no evidence of clinical zzso zzso at year of zzso or distortion of the expected pattern of age of onset in the second affected spouse from 33 zzso The crude recurrence in children of zzso pairs (1 in 17) is significantly higher than previously reported zzso risk for offspring of single affected parents (1 in zzso 

Taken with the low prevalence of multiple sclerosis in the spouses of affected individuals, and the lack of zzso for age at onset in these families, the disparity in crude recurrence between children of zzso pairs and those of single affected parents shows that the recurrence risk in children is determined by genetic factors inherited from both zzso
