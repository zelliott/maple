Development of zzso or zzso imaging contrast agents is important for accurate and zzso diagnosis of zzso We report a new multifunctional, zzso gold zzso zzso as a zzso contrast agent for magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso imaging of breast cancer cells in zzso and in zzso In this study, zzso generation 5 zzso zzso modified with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as templates to zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso of the remaining zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The formed zzso zzso were used for both in zzso and in zzso zzso imaging of human zzso cancer zzso Both MR and CT images demonstrate that zzso cells and the zzso tumor model can be effectively zzso The zzso zzso zzso mainly in the cell zzso was confirmed by transmission electron zzso The cell zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and flow zzso show that the developed zzso zzso have good zzso in the given concentration zzso Our results clearly suggest that the synthetic zzso zzso are amenable for zzso zzso imaging of breast cancer zzso
