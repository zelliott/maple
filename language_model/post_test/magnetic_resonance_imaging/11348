The aim of our study was to establish a simple in zzso method for water zzso in zzso zzso and provide data on imaging of mouse brain at zzso zzso zzso zzso and spin density values determined by zzso were found to strongly correlate with the zzso water content of mouse brain undergoing cold zzso Using a zzso zzso line between the spin density values for pure water and zzso of mouse brain, as well as the corresponding water contents in zzso water could be zzso with satisfactory zzso
