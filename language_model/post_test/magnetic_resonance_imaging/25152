Historically, zzso cancer with zzso spread and/or zzso zzso involvement has presented a major challenge to zzso with a variable and often high risk of local recurrence and poor survival zzso In recent years a large amount of literature has focused attention on the importance of surgical technique, tumor staging, and the optimal integration of CT and radiation zzso 

This article reviews the clinical trials that have defined the current approach to zzso cancer, the controversies regarding what should be considered the standard of care, and the ongoing clinical studies that will resolve some of these zzso 

The zzso staging of zzso cancer can be improved with the use of zzso ultrasound and (where zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso analysis, particularly of the zzso margin, provides important zzso information that enables better allocation of zzso zzso Although both radiation therapy and CT have a proven role in zzso therapy, the interpretation of many studies is zzso by unacceptably poor outcomes in the control arm, and in older studies the use of inferior chemotherapy and radiation therapy zzso zzso studies will better define the optimal combination and timing of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with respect to both toxicity and survival zzso 

A combined zzso approach to zzso cancer, zzso the colon and zzso surgeon, zzso medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist, is necessary to achieve optimal zzso The achievements to date and the ongoing vigorous debates regarding standard care continue to highlight the importance of quality ongoing research in a rapidly changing clinical zzso
