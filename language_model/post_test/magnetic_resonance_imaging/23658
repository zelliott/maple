An zzso patient with a zzso zzso zzso associated with an extremely elevated plasma zzso concentration is zzso The preoperatively high concentration of plasma zzso returned to the normal level after successful removal of the zzso zzso production and zzso gene expression were confirmed in the zzso by studies including zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid was verified by in zzso zzso zzso double zzso for zzso and zzso revealed their zzso in single zzso zzso These findings confirmed the zzso or zzso regulation of zzso production by zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso has recently been demonstrated, however, there have been no previous reports of a zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with an elevated plasma zzso zzso The existence of this zzso zzso suggests a possible role of locally generated zzso in the progression of zzso zzso zzso the zzso established zzso zzso develop further under the influence of locally produced zzso The demonstration of zzso production by this zzso zzso is of importance in clarifying the zzso or zzso regulation of zzso production and the progression of human zzso zzso
