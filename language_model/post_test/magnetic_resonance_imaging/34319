We determined zzso the long-term outcomes of zzso treatment of chronic zzso pain zzso 

Of zzso patients in a zzso randomized, zzso study of unilateral chronic zzso pain syndrome in the knee, zzso were zzso seven years after the initial trial of zzso In the earlier trial, the short-term zzso effects of zzso injections of zzso zzso combined with intensive zzso exercises were compared with those of injections of a zzso combined with exercises and with those of exercises zzso At seven years, the follow-up consisted of standardized zzso functional, and clinical assessments and zzso zzso as well as magnetic resonance imaging, zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso 

At six months, complete zzso functional, and clinical recovery had occurred in almost three-fourths of the patients and, with the numbers available for study, neither significant nor clinically important differences among the three initial treatment groups were zzso The zzso and functional parameters showed few changes between six months and seven years; almost three-fourths of the patients still had full zzso and functional recovery at the time of the latest zzso However, according to the zzso clinical zzso the number of patients who had no symptoms on the zzso zzso and apprehension tests decreased over time, from zzso zzso percent) and zzso zzso percent) of zzso patients at six months to thirty zzso percent) and zzso zzso percent) at seven years; these changes were significant zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso The number of patients who had zzso on the zzso zzso test increased over time, from zzso zzso percent) at six months to zzso zzso percent) at seven years zzso zzso zzso The zzso overall assessment showed a similar trend, with zzso patients zzso percent) having had complete recovery at six months compared with thirty zzso percent) at seven years; however, with the numbers available, this change was not significant zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging, performed for zzso patients, revealed no abnormalities in zzso (65 percent), mild abnormalities in four (11 percent), moderate abnormalities (a 25 to 75 percent decrease in the thickness of the zzso in seven (19 percent), and overt zzso zzso in two (5 percent) at seven zzso 

The seven-year overall outcome was good in approximately two-thirds of the zzso However, the remaining patients still had symptoms or objective signs of a zzso zzso
