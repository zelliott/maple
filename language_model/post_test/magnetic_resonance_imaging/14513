Sleep is strongly zzso within species, yet marked and perplexing zzso differences in sleep physiology are zzso Combining zzso sleep recordings and high-resolution structural brain imaging, here we demonstrate that the zzso of the human brain offers one explanatory factor of such zzso zzso Gray matter volume in zzso and zzso zzso correlated with the expression of slower zzso sleep zzso zzso supporting their proposed role in sleep protection against conscious zzso zzso and consistent with an involvement in zzso memory processing, gray matter volume in bilateral zzso was associated with faster zzso sleep zzso zzso In contrast to zzso gray matter volume in the zzso zzso center of the zzso zzso together with the zzso prefrontal cortex, accounted for individual differences in zzso slow wave zzso Together, such findings indicate that the qualitative and quantitative expression of human sleep physiology is significantly related to zzso specific differences in zzso brain zzso
