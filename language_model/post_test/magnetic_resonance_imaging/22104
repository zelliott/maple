To evaluate the ability of magnetic resonance zzso imaging to depict solid debris within pancreatic collections prior to intervention and to help assess zzso as well as to compare MR findings with those obtained at zzso zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso 

zzso collections in 18 patients were evaluated with MR imaging, CT, and US prior to zzso zzso blinded interpretations of imaging studies by three independent readers (each interpreted all the images obtained with only one zzso evaluated collection characteristics zzso consistency, zzso wall zzso and zzso and predicted zzso zzso were compared with clinical diagnosis and clinical outcome of zzso 

MR imaging and CT depicted all zzso US failed to depict two zzso In nine patients with zzso zzso collections, solid debris was seen in eight zzso at MR imaging, in two zzso at CT, and in eight zzso at zzso In seven patients with zzso debris was seen in two zzso at MR imaging and in none at CT, as well as in six zzso of six at zzso A collection was defined as zzso zzso on the basis of the depiction of solid zzso debris more than 1 zzso in zzso With this definition, statistically significant differences between sensitivity and specificity values, respectively, were found for the prediction of actual zzso MR imaging, zzso and zzso CT, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso MR imaging should be performed in patients with zzso pancreatic collections to avoid infectious complications from zzso zzso debris that cannot be removed with use of standard zzso drainage zzso
