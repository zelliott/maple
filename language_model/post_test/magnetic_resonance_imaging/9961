zzso deficits are common after the zzso procedure for zzso left heart zzso Because of the association of deep zzso circulatory arrest with adverse zzso outcome, regional zzso cerebral zzso has been used to limit the period of zzso brain zzso To evaluate the impact of this technique on brain zzso we performed serial brain magnetic resonance imaging in a cohort of infants before and after the zzso operation using regional cerebral zzso 

Twenty-two term zzso with zzso left heart syndrome were studied with brain magnetic resonance imaging before and at a median of zzso days after the zzso zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso and zzso risk factors to identify zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso demonstrated new or worsened zzso zzso in zzso of patients, with zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso occurring most zzso zzso low zzso cerebral zzso zzso for zzso minutes) was associated with the development of new or worsened zzso on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso occur commonly in zzso with zzso left heart syndrome before zzso Despite the adoption of regional cerebral zzso zzso cerebral zzso zzso are zzso occurring in the majority of infants after the zzso zzso zzso follow-up is necessary to assess the functional impact of these zzso
