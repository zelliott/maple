The present study was undertaken to investigate after-effects of 7 zzso zzso prolonged stimulation of the median nerve on zzso fields zzso The working hypothesis that conditioning peripheral zzso might produce delayed interfering zzso effects on the response of zzso zzso to test stimuli was zzso In the control condition, electrical thumb stimulation induced zzso in ten zzso In the experimental zzso a conditioning median nerve stimulation at wrist preceded 6 electrical thumb zzso zzso current zzso fitting zzso modeled responses of zzso primary area zzso and bilateral secondary zzso areas zzso following control and experimental zzso Compared to the control condition, conditioning stimulation induced no zzso zzso of zzso response at the initial zzso peak (20 zzso In contrast, later response from zzso (35 zzso and response from zzso were significantly weakened in zzso zzso but fast recovery towards control zzso levels was observed for the response from zzso while a slightly slower cycle was featured from zzso These findings point to a delayed zzso effect on the synchronization of zzso zzso after peripheral conditioning zzso This effect was found to be more lasting in zzso area, as a possible reflection of its zzso role in sensory zzso
