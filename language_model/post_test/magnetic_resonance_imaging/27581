Early dysfunction of the brain reward system in schizophrenia might be already recognized in the zzso phase of this zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the blood oxygen zzso response in the zzso zzso zzso of subjects with zzso risk for psychosis during the presentation of zzso and zzso zzso 

Thirteen zzso patients zzso age: zzso zzso zzso zzso and 13 zzso healthy volunteers participated in an incentive monetary delay task, in which visual cues predicted that a rapid response to a subsequent target stimulus will gain money, avoid losing money or have no zzso 

Compared with the neutral condition, anticipation of reward zzso zzso significant zzso of the VS in both healthy subjects and subjects with zzso risk for zzso but there was only a statistical tendency for less zzso during zzso anticipation in zzso compared to healthy zzso 

This study provides a first weak hint, as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging, for impaired zzso of a central area of the zzso zzso brain reward system, the zzso already in subjects with zzso risk for zzso which is in line with results of patients with full-blown schizophrenic zzso This pilot study has, however, strong limitations, and its results need to be zzso first before they can be used zzso for early recognition of patients in the schizophrenic zzso
