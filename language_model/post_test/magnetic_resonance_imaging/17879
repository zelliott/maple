With evidence for an zzso effect of zzso toxin type A zzso documented in typically developing muscles, this study investigated the immediate zzso zzso of muscles in children with cerebral zzso zzso after zzso zzso 

Fifteen children (10 zzso five zzso age range zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Motor zzso zzso System zzso I zzso and II zzso receiving zzso injections for zzso management were zzso None of the children was a first-time receiver of zzso zzso resonance imaging and zzso software assessed muscle volume, timed 2 weeks before and 5 weeks after zzso All participants received zzso zzso to the zzso muscle, and five participants also received zzso zzso to the zzso hamstring zzso zzso assessment measures used were the zzso Walk Test zzso the Timed Up and Go zzso test, and hand-held zzso 

zzso total muscle group volume of the injected muscle group remained zzso a zzso decrease in the injected zzso muscle volume zzso and a zzso increase in zzso muscle volume zzso was evident following zzso There were no statistically significant changes in function after zzso as assessed by the zzso There was also no statistically significant change in distance covered in the zzso Muscle strength, as assessed using hand-held zzso was also not statistically different after zzso zzso 

Muscle volume decreases were observed in the injected muscle zzso with synergistic muscle zzso that appeared to compensate for this zzso The zzso to zzso decrease in the volume of zzso injected muscles are not dramatic in comparison to reports in recent animal studies, and are a positive indication for zzso particularly as it also did not zzso alter zzso
