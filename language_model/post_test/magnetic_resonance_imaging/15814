Surgery for skull base zzso zzso can lead to complications because these zzso are difficult to approach and can involve zzso nerves and zzso The authors propose a scoring system to evaluate the relative risks and benefits of surgical treatment of zzso 

The authors used a zzso process to construct their zzso First, they derived significant zzso variables from retrospective data on 132 zzso cases treated surgically zzso surgeries only) between May 2000 and December zzso Next, they validated the zzso accuracy of their scoring system in 60 consecutive cases treated surgically between January 1995 and April 2000, including both primary and repeated zzso Finally, they investigated the effect of the surgery on the patients' zzso symptoms for consecutive cases treated surgically between January 1995 and December 2005, including both primary surgeries and zzso 

Five items that predicted surgical risk were zzso 1) tumor attachment size; 2) zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso 4) central cavity zzso and 5) zzso nerve group zzso The authors named their scoring system the ABC zzso zzso zzso after the initial letters of these zzso Each factor was assigned a score of 0-2 points, and an additional point was added for previous surgical treatment or for radiation, giving a possible total score of 12 zzso On average, the scoring system allocated 2 points for zzso zzso zzso points for zzso zzso and 9 points for zzso zzso with significant differences between zzso For cases scoring zzso 8 points, the percentage of cases showing neurological deterioration zzso exceeded the percentage showing zzso 

The authors conclude that this scoring system can be used to predict the extent of tumor removal and that the scores reflect the surgical zzso
