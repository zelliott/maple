Despite a zzso zzso appearance on magnetic resonance images, zzso of the zzso express distinct functional profiles as well as corresponding differences in zzso In particular, zzso analysis shows stronger connections for superficial zzso zzso and zzso compared with deep zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to lateral zzso zzso and stronger connections of deep compared with superficial, zzso to zzso areas in the zzso zzso Here, we use diffusion weighted imaging with zzso zzso to investigate these connections in zzso We use a zzso approach to segment the zzso into two zzso using zzso zzso The identified zzso are zzso zzso and their location zzso to deep and superficial nuclear zzso zzso of the connection strength between these zzso clusters and individual target regions zzso to qualitative zzso findings in zzso zzso indicating such findings can be zzso to zzso We propose that connectivity profiles provide a potentially powerful approach for in zzso zzso zzso and can serve as a guide in studies that exploit functional and anatomical zzso
