A zzso zzso decision task was used to investigate zzso deficits in patients suffering from zzso in the right zzso and in neurological controls without cortical zzso In all patients from one group zzso zzso zzso the right frontal lobe was affected causing a zzso zzso In the second group zzso zzso zzso zzso primarily affected areas in the right inferior zzso zzso Patients with motor deficits due to zzso in the spinal zzso or in the periphery served as neurological controls zzso zzso zzso zzso of three categories of words was zzso zzso referring to actions zzso zzso zzso nouns with strong visual associations zzso nouns zzso and nouns with both strong action and visual associations zzso nouns zzso zzso categories were matched for word length and zzso zzso zzso zzso scores revealed a significant word category by patient group zzso Patients with zzso in the right frontal lobe showed most severe deficits in processing action zzso whereas those with zzso in their right zzso areas showed most severe deficits in processing zzso zzso Neurological controls did not show any differences between word zzso The double zzso of the processing zzso seen in frontal versus zzso patients demonstrates that specific zzso deficits can arise from zzso in the right zzso zzso An account for these results in terms of distributed zzso systems representing words is zzso
