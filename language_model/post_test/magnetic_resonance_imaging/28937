Brain imaging and zzso recording studies in humans have reported discrete cortical regions in zzso zzso zzso zzso that respond zzso to faces, buildings, and zzso These findings suggest a zzso zzso zzso modular organization of the object vision zzso Here we present data from a functional zzso study in which we found three distinct regions of zzso zzso zzso that responded zzso to faces and two categories of other objects, namely houses and chairs, and had a highly consistent zzso zzso Although the data could be interpreted as evidence for separate zzso we found that each category also evoked significant responses in the regions that responded zzso to other zzso Moreover, each category was associated with its own differential pattern of response across zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the representation of an object is not restricted to a region that responds zzso to that object, but rather is distributed across a broader expanse of zzso We propose that the functional architecture of the zzso visual zzso is not a mosaic of zzso zzso but instead is a continuous representation of information about object form that has a highly consistent and orderly zzso zzso
