zzso and continuously varying the flip angle of the zzso zzso zzso in a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement zzso zzso spin zzso sequence is a useful means of addressing high zzso power deposition and zzso transfer function zzso distortion due to zzso This work presents a streamlined technique to generate a sequence of zzso flip angles on a zzso basis that produces relatively high zzso and limits blurring in a wide range of materials encountered in zzso Since the zzso zzso zzso defined as the time at which the center of zzso is zzso no longer zzso to the expected amount of zzso zzso contrast due to the mixing of zzso and spin zzso a zzso TE is defined and zzso demonstrated that allows zzso of a more accurate effective TE that matches the contrast produced by 180 degrees zzso Furthermore, contrast is shown to be zzso by the addition of zzso preparation pulse sequence zzso such as zzso to produce clinically desirable contrast for routine head and body zzso
