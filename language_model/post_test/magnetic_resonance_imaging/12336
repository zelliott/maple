We contribute a novel zzso strategy for computing the structure of functional networks in the brain from zzso spin labeling zzso zzso Our method zzso and zzso multiple functional signals by employing an zzso zzso reduction method, sparse zzso correlation analysis zzso There are two key aspects of this zzso First, we show how zzso may be used to zzso a zzso correlation between different regions of interest zzso In contrast to averaging the signal over the zzso this approach exploits the full information within the zzso Second, we show how zzso may simultaneously exploit both the zzso and zzso cerebral blood flow zzso time series to produce network zzso Our approach to fusing multiple time signals in network studies improves zzso over standard approaches while retaining the zzso afforded by the classic zzso zzso zzso We show zzso in zzso data that our sparse zzso method extracts biologically plausible and stable functional network structures from zzso We compare the zzso approach to the zzso approach while using zzso zzso zzso We then compare these results to the joint zzso networks in a zzso study and in a study of functional network structure in traumatic brain injury zzso Our results show that the zzso approach provides significantly more zzso results compared to zzso and in zzso the zzso approach reveals connectivity differences not seen with the region averaging zzso
