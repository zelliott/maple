In zzso testing is used to determine safe parameters before performing magnetic resonance imaging zzso on a patient with an zzso zzso the objective of this study was to evaluate a cardiac zzso using a zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

A modern cardiac zzso zzso I zzso Model zzso and zzso II, Model zzso pacing leads; zzso Corporation, St Paul, zzso was evaluated for magnetic field interactions at zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso heating was assessed using 3 different zzso scanners operating at various levels of zzso power and imaging zzso zzso aspects of the zzso were evaluated immediately before and after zzso (9 different pulse zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso field interactions for the zzso were zzso zzso changes measured in zzso were at levels that are not expected to pose a risk for specific MR conditions zzso zzso degrees zzso The function of the zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso were minor for the leads and relatively large for the zzso pulse zzso 

The findings indicated that this zzso exhibited acceptable safety features relative to the use of a zzso MR zzso If induced currents do not occur for this device, it may be safe for a patient to undergo zzso by following specific zzso The results are specific to the zzso tested, the MR systems, and conditions used in this zzso
