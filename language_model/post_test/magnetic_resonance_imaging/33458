The potential of zzso imaging to improve the quantitative accuracy of functional brain imaging through refined regional definition is widely zzso However, there are little data addressing the impact of approach to regional zzso on zzso of zzso images in the absence of gross structural zzso We compared zzso versus zzso approaches to the analysis of PET zzso zzso images using a standard adjustable template based on simple geometric zzso For the zzso approach, templates and individual regions were adjusted to each zzso zzso whereas the zzso definition involved only global zzso adjustment of the standard zzso zzso rates for zzso and zzso brain ratios were determined by two operators for 78 volumes of interest in five zzso zzso correlations indicated high zzso agreement for each approach and high zzso agreement for zzso versus zzso zzso zzso The stability of the zzso rates and ratios among operators and analysis approaches was supported by low zzso of variation across zzso and small average differences in paired zzso Thus, within the current spatial resolution of PET imaging, zzso of zzso images is relatively robust to image analysis approach in the absence of gross structural zzso To take advantage of the greater quantitative accuracy promised by high-resolution zzso and functional imaging, more refined zzso of zzso images will be zzso
