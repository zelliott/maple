The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso sequence is beneficial in the zzso assessment of zzso and zzso staging in patients with primary zzso zzso 

zzso patients with primary zzso cancer underwent zzso MR imaging, followed by surgical zzso Two zzso independently reviewed zzso zzso MR images zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images zzso + zzso zzso MR combined with zzso and zzso + zzso for the prediction of zzso and zzso stage compared with zzso findings as the end zzso zzso in the diagnostic performance of zzso only, zzso + zzso image only and combined zzso and zzso + zzso MR images were analyzed by comparing areas under receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso for each zzso zzso agreement was also zzso 

There was no significant difference in the zzso values of zzso only, zzso + zzso image only and combined zzso and zzso + zzso images for the prediction of zzso staging zzso of zzso zzso + zzso and combined MR images for reader 1, zzso zzso and zzso reader 2, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso staging zzso for reader 1, zzso zzso and zzso reader 2, zzso zzso and zzso zzso agreement for the prediction of zzso staging was moderate to substantial, while only fair agreement was noted for the prediction of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso did not increase the diagnostic yield for zzso and zzso staging, and may be omitted in the MR protocol for zzso assessment of primary zzso zzso
