zzso stem cell transplantation has an unproven role in the management of zzso zzso zzso theoretically justified through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and restoration of capacity for zzso zzso in neural tissue through zzso zzso the long-term outcome is zzso The rarity of the zzso zzso and slow progression of zzso disease zzso evaluation of zzso We report detailed clinical and zzso assessments after zzso stem-cell transplantation in a patient with a zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso decline, indistinguishable from the natural course of the disease, was serially documented over 11 years despite complete donor zzso and correction of zzso zzso A to wild type values; subtle motor deterioration was similarly noted and progressive cerebral volume loss was evident upon magnetic resonance zzso zzso nerve zzso deteriorated 17 months zzso with apparent zzso at 11-year zzso zzso stem-cell transplantation was ineffective for this rare attenuated zzso of zzso zzso In the few patients identified zzso or with zzso disease, clear recommendations are zzso when transplantation is considered, zzso zzso blood zzso from zzso donors with zzso zzso stem cell infusions from the same source may be zzso zzso outcomes will depend on enhanced awareness and early diagnosis of the disease, so that promising interventions such as genetically zzso zzso stem cell transplantation have the best opportunity of zzso
