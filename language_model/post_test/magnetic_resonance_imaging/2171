To assess the zzso of relying on zzso during zzso zzso the authors compared target coordinates in the zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained using magnetic resonance zzso imaging with those determined using an zzso The targets were used in deep brain stimulation zzso for the treatment of generalized zzso 

Thirty-five patients, who were treated using bilateral zzso of the zzso were included in this zzso The target was selected on three-dimensional MR images by direct visual recognition of the zzso The coordinates were automatically recorded using dedicated zzso They were translated into the anterior zzso zzso zzso coordinate system by using a zzso transformation zzso The same zzso target was zzso based on the locations of brain structures shown in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso target coordinates were statistically compared with the corresponding zzso coordinates by applying the Student zzso A significant difference zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso zzso and zzso directions between MR zzso and zzso zzso target zzso The comparison with zzso zzso zzso coordinates demonstrated a significant difference zzso zzso zzso in the y and zzso directions, although not in the zzso direction zzso zzso zzso No significant correlation existed between MR zzso target coordinates and patient age zzso zzso zzso No significant correlation was observed between MR zzso target coordinates and patient sex in the y and zzso directions zzso zzso zzso although it was significant in the zzso direction zzso zzso zzso A significant variation in coordinates and the length of the zzso line was revealed only in the y direction zzso zzso zzso 

A significant difference was found between target coordinates obtained by direct visual targeting on MR images zzso by zzso clinical zzso and those obtained by indirect targeting based on zzso
