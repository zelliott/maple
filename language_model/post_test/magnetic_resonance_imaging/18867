An innovative zzso for zzso zzso Imaging zzso capable of demonstrating the source of various zzso and driving the hardware and software acquisition process is zzso The zzso is based on the application of the Bloch equations to the zzso zzso of each point of the simulated object, as requested by the instructions of the zzso pulse zzso The collected raw data are then used to reconstruct the image of the zzso The general structure of the zzso makes it possible to simulate a great range of imaging situations in order to explain the nature of unwanted zzso and to study new acquisition zzso The way the zzso structures the sequence has also allowed the easy zzso of zzso data acquisition on a commercial zzso zzso data acquisition board, thus zzso the comparison between simulated and experimental zzso
