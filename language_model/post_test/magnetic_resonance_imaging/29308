The ability of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso to suppress multiple sclerosis activity, evaluated from zzso was assessed across a range of zzso enhancing at different zzso zzso doses and with different zzso 

Every 4 weeks, standard dose zzso zzso zzso zzso and triple dose zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained from 18 patients with zzso multiple sclerosis for 3 months before and 4 months after starting treatment with 44 zzso zzso zzso zzso once a zzso 

The total numbers of enhancing zzso were 145 and 126 on zzso scans and zzso and 192 on the zzso scans obtained before and after zzso The introduction of treatment zzso on average, the rate of appearance of new enhancing zzso seen on zzso and zzso scans by 37% zzso Treatment effects on new enhancing zzso seen on zzso scans was, on average, zzso higher than on those seen on zzso zzso The distribution of zzso sizes on zzso scans changed significantly during the treatment period zzso due to a marked decrease in the number of small zzso 

The effect of 44 zzso zzso zzso in reducing multiple sclerosis disease activity, as monitored by zzso enhanced zzso is not zzso but graduated according to the pathological characteristics and size of the zzso
