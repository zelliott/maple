zzso parameters of the functional zzso and the zzso barrier of zzso in rat brain were measured zzso by dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies of zzso zzso zzso Changes of apparent zzso zzso in time zzso were analyzed in a slice through the center of 10 zzso using fast zzso zzso The distribution of the contrast agent was zzso correlated with the distribution of zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso This method permits a distinction between zzso and zzso zzso with a disrupted zzso zzso In zzso slices of the whole zzso a spatial correlation was observed between CT maps and the two-dimensional distribution of zzso zzso In the next step, zzso zzso rates were zzso related to the zzso zzso density zzso or vascular surface area zzso In tumor zzso with zzso zzso a linear correlation was found between zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso No correlation was observed between k values and the total zzso zzso These are the first data that show a relation between zzso zzso rates and parameters of the functional zzso in zzso growing in rat zzso Now that zzso zzso studies can be related to parameters of the functional zzso they may be used more efficiently as a zzso tool before or during zzso
