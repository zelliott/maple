We aimed to zzso both load and regional zzso of zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso verified zzso bipolar patients and matched zzso 

zzso zzso on zzso zzso density and zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso were compared between 48 bipolar and 47 control subjects using zzso rating zzso 

zzso subjects had more severe frontal deep white matter zzso zzso zzso load was independent of age in bipolar patients but increased with age in zzso Global prevalence and severity of zzso did not differ between zzso zzso analysis showed zzso in excess in the left zzso in bipolar subjects but not in zzso 

zzso are consistent with clinical, particularly some zzso features of bipolar disorder and zzso zzso circuits in its zzso They more probably reflect a trait zzso or illness zzso rather than a mood zzso zzso zzso other than zzso and vascular factors may zzso their zzso
