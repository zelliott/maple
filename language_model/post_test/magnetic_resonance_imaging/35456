We assessed the contribution of zzso zzso and zzso imaging for the diagnosis and follow-up of zzso tumors, suspected to be grade II zzso zzso patients were included from April 2005 to July 2006, 17 initially and seven during their zzso The diagnosis was reconsidered in a first group of six zzso a high-grade tumor was suspected and confirmed in zzso These patients presented a zzso zzso the zzso results and the zzso and zzso ratios were not zzso The second group included patients with grade II zzso these 18 patients had a zzso zzso initially, then at three months and every six zzso For this group, no evidence of a change of grade were zzso zzso findings were noted in seven zzso among these patients, one developed zzso zzso one other had zzso progression associated with a zzso zzso zzso only zzso changes were noted in the third zzso the last patient had zzso progression with zzso and zzso zzso these four patients were zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso and zzso can provide supplementary information for diagnosis and follow-up of zzso zzso The presence of a zzso peak is of particular zzso The limitations of this work must also be taken into zzso the follow-up was too short for zzso zzso the population was small and patients may have undergone surgery during the study, leading to structural modifications which may have compromised zzso This work should be continued with new examinations every six months and inclusion of new zzso
