Internal contact angle is an important zzso for internal zzso zzso However, due to the limitation of optical imaging, methods available for contact angle measurement are only suitable for transparent or open zzso For most of the practical situations that require contact angle measurement in opaque or enclosed systems, the traditional methods are not zzso Based upon the requirement, a method suitable for contact angle measurement in zzso systems is developed by employing zzso zzso In the zzso the method is demonstrated by measuring internal contact angles in opaque zzso zzso It proves that the method also shows great feasibility in transparent situations and opaque zzso zzso By using the method, contact angle in opaque systems could be measured zzso which is significant in understanding the zzso behaviors in zzso systems and calculating zzso parameters in enclosed zzso
