Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso is a safe, zzso method that is the preferred technique for in zzso analysis of specific chemical compounds in localized brain zzso Besides zzso of compounds, zzso zzso allows the detailed analysis of zzso zzso and zzso metabolism following peripheral infusions of stable zzso zzso zzso The latter has been successfully applied to patients with different neurological disease states not including zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, single patients with zzso zzso who were zzso unremarkable have been studied with conflicting zzso One patient was shown to have an increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the second studied had unremarkable zzso In a 15-year-old patient, we were able to demonstrate elevated levels of zzso zzso and elevated zzso zzso ratios, indicating potentially increased zzso turnover and reduced zzso integrity in zzso white zzso Interestingly, zzso in zzso zzso were within normal zzso zzso studies to address zzso questions in zzso zzso are urgently zzso In particular, analysis of in zzso neurotransmitter metabolism following administration of zzso zzso precursors in patients with zzso zzso both when metabolically stable and when zzso may help to advance our understanding of the zzso of zzso zzso
