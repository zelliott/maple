zzso is a D3 preferring PET zzso which has recently opened the possibility of imaging D3 receptors in the human brain in zzso This imaging tool allows zzso of the distribution of D3 receptors in zzso and further investigation of their functional zzso The specific zzso signal is a mixture of D3 and zzso components with the relative magnitude of each component determined by the regional zzso zzso An accurate and zzso zzso of regions of interest zzso is therefore important for optimal analysis of human PET zzso We present a set of anatomical guidelines for the zzso of D3 relevant zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these structures using this approach allowed for high zzso and zzso zzso zzso we used a selective D3 zzso to dissect the total zzso signal in each region into its D3 and zzso components and estimated the regional fraction of the D3 signal zzso In descending order of magnitude the following results for the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An automated approach for the zzso of these anatomical regions of interest was also developed and investigated in terms of its zzso and zzso
