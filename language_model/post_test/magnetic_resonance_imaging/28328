zzso imaging has shown itself to be an important tool for improving analysis of flow zzso during zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a widely employed technique in enhancing oil and gas zzso However the success of such a process could be considerably reduced by instability of the zzso front with negative effects on production zzso zzso can be easily applied in evaluating the flow advancement because of its ability to distinguish different zzso during dynamic zzso In our study we have evaluated the shape of the zzso front during water injection in highly zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso which strongly characterize the rocks, revealed a marked influence on flow zzso zzso increase by zzso addition, in spite of a more zzso mobility ratio, resulted in a poorer performance because of higher zzso zzso The results of selected simulation experiments are zzso
