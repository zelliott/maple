We studied changes due to aging in carotid and cerebral zzso blood flows, and compared the difference between healthy adults and diabetics using a zzso quantitative blood flow measurement system zzso 2000 zzso Aging caused the carotid blood flow, blood zzso and diameter excursion rate on the carotid wall to decrease, and its diameter to zzso Both cerebrovascular resistance and zzso obtained from simulation models of blood pressure waves, increased with zzso zzso blood flows in aged healthy adults was not significantly different from those in aged zzso but clearly different from those in aged diabetics with abnormal findings on zzso When right and left cerebral blood flows were markedly different, zzso was observed on brain zzso This well agreed with findings on cerebral blood flow zzso zzso obtained from several zzso The zzso quantitative blood flow measurement system is considered a useful screening tool before CT or zzso zzso
