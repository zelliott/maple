The role of structural brain changes and their correlations with zzso symptoms and disability in Alzheimer's disease are still poorly zzso 

To establish whether structural changes in zzso matter volume in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease are associated with zzso symptoms and disability 

zzso Alzheimer's disease patients (9 zzso total mean age zzso y old zzso total mean education level zzso y zzso underwent a magnetic resonance imaging zzso examination and zzso zzso zzso zzso images were zzso zzso and zzso Grey matter images were smoothed and analyzed using a multiple zzso zzso The results were corrected for multiple zzso The zzso zzso was used to evaluate the zzso symptoms, and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Assessment for zzso were used for functional evaluation 

A significant negative correlation was found between the bilateral middle frontal zzso left inferior zzso zzso right zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A negative correlation was found between bilateral middle zzso zzso left zzso bilateral zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso There was a positive correlation between the right amygdala, bilateral zzso zzso right anterior zzso left inferior and middle zzso zzso right superior zzso zzso and zzso Assessment for zzso scores 

The results suggest that the zzso symptoms observed in Alzheimer's disease patients could be mainly due to frontal structural zzso whereas disability could be associated with reductions in zzso zzso
