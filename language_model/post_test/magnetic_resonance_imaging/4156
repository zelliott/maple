We assessed the utility of zzso clinical assessment and functional brain imaging with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in predicting the clinical outcome of zzso zzso for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease zzso Twenty-two zzso patients undergoing zzso zzso were assessed preoperatively with the Core Assessment Program for zzso zzso zzso ratings measured on and off zzso quantitative zzso was also performed before zzso zzso clinical and zzso zzso were correlated with changes in zzso zzso ratings determined 3 months after zzso Clinical outcome following zzso was also correlated with zzso measures of spontaneous zzso zzso activity as well as zzso zzso zzso of zzso volume and zzso We found that unilateral zzso resulted in variable clinical improvement in zzso zzso scores for the zzso limbs zzso change zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso were comparable in location and volume across the zzso Clinical outcome following surgery correlated significantly with zzso measures of zzso score change with zzso administration zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso outcome did not correlate with zzso measures of spontaneous zzso zzso firing zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of zzso zzso metabolism and zzso responsiveness may be useful indicators of motor improvement following zzso Both zzso quantitative measures, either zzso or in zzso may be helpful in selecting optimal candidates for zzso
