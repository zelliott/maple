Imaging studies of schizophrenia patients showed zzso brain volume deficits, while magnetic resonance zzso zzso studies of patients and unaffected biological relatives have found a zzso of the zzso marker zzso zzso in the zzso and frontal zzso and increased zzso zzso Using a zzso MR zzso we determined the zzso profile within zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso and left zzso of 36 zzso zzso adult relatives of schizophrenia zzso zzso zzso and 25 healthy controls with no family history of zzso zzso main effects of group were found on zzso ratios for both the left zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso as well as for the left zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Compared to age and sex matched healthy controls without a family history of zzso first-degree relatives of zzso had greater MRS zzso zzso than second-degree zzso Greater familial proximity to the schizophrenia zzso (or higher schizophrenia zzso among biological relatives was associated with zzso lowering of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The observed zzso zzso changes among young, zzso biological relatives are likely related to shared genetic vulnerability factors, and may assist in the early identification of schizophrenia for primary and secondary zzso
