To understand the features of magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings and the results of clinical follow-up study in 8 infants and children with zzso disease zzso complicated with acute zzso paralysis zzso who were admitted to Beijing zzso Hospital during the outbreak of zzso in zzso 

The clinical characteristics of the 8 zzso cases were investigated, and zzso findings were zzso The recovery of their impairment in limbs was followed up for three zzso 

All the 8 cases showed zzso zzso zzso of spinal zzso showed unilateral or bilateral zzso zzso which chiefly occurred in the anterior horn regions of the spinal zzso zzso or zzso on zzso zzso zzso of spinal zzso chiefly occurred in zzso Most of the cases showed mild paralysis, which occurred in more than half of cases in single lower zzso The patients who had acute paralysis of single lower zzso recovered faster than those with paralysis of four zzso 

In zzso with zzso cases, zzso of spinal zzso showed unilateral or bilateral zzso in the anterior horn regions of the spinal zzso zzso or zzso on zzso zzso zzso may be to some degree zzso in zzso zzso zzso can directly and completely show the range and degree of changes associated with zzso in zzso cases, thus provide zzso suggestions to its zzso The acute paralysis of zzso cases may be benefited from earlier treatment for zzso
