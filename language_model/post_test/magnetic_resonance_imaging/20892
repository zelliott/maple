We evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of zzso zzso and zzso iron oxide zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for focal zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso evaluated 11 patients with 11 zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging were zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso examination was used with the zzso acid dynamic zzso zzso MR imaging included zzso and zzso zzso We zzso and zzso compared zzso enhancement of both contrast zzso 

The mean zzso zzso ratio of the zzso zzso differed significantly on zzso and zzso imaging of each contrast medium zzso mean zzso zzso ratio did not zzso All observers described all zzso as zzso in the zzso phase on zzso zzso MR imaging and observed the presence of central scar, zzso zzso and rim most clearly in zzso zzso zzso phase zzso 

zzso zzso MR imaging was more useful than zzso MR imaging in characterizing zzso
