Working memory, the short-term maintenance and manipulation of information, relies strongly on neural activity in the frontal zzso zzso the functional role of this activity is a prerequisite for the understanding of cognitive control zzso zzso imaging studies in human participants have attempted to reveal neural zzso of the subdivision of visual working memory into different processes zzso vs zzso and according to the type of memorized zzso Here, we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, a zzso zzso of frontal activity, with zzso zzso areas supporting both maintenance and manipulation of spatial features and more zzso areas supporting maintenance and manipulation of zzso zzso activity was observed in the anterior middle frontal zzso the inferior frontal zzso and the inferior zzso lobe zzso These areas have been implicated in cognitive control, and their zzso by the manipulation task zzso to the demand on central executive resources in this zzso We suggest that the enhanced demand on cognitive resources in manipulation compared with maintenance was met by interplay of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
