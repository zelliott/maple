Steady state free zzso zzso signal theory is commonly derived in the limit of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso however, are frequently set up with minimal pulse repetition times and zzso zzso can thus constitute a considerable amount to the actual pulse repetition zzso As a result, finite zzso pulse effects can lead to zzso signal zzso from common zzso theory in the transient and in the steady state which may impair the accuracy of zzso quantitative imaging zzso In this article, a new and generic approach for intrinsic compensation of finite zzso pulse effects is zzso zzso is based on balancing relaxation effects during finite zzso zzso similar to flow or motion compensation of zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso in addition to the zzso of zzso moments with balanced zzso results in a zzso zzso sequence free of finite zzso pulse effects in the transient and in the steady state; irrespective of the zzso pulse zzso flip angles, relaxation times, or zzso zzso of zzso sequences can be used with all quantitative zzso techniques where finite zzso pulse effects are expected or where zzso zzso zzso are zzso
