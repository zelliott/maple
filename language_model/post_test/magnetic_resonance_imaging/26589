Application of zzso pattern analysis zzso to functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data enables reconstruction and zzso of cognitive status from brain zzso However, previous studies using zzso have extracted information about cognitive status that is experienced simultaneously with zzso zzso but not one that will be observed after the zzso In this study, by focusing on activity in the zzso zzso lobe zzso we demonstrate that zzso on zzso data is capable of predicting subsequent recognition zzso In this experiment, six runs of zzso signals were acquired during zzso of zzso zzso In the analysis, using data acquired in runs zzso we first conducted zzso zzso search for the clusters in the zzso whose signals contained the most information about subsequent recognition zzso Next, using the zzso signals acquired in runs 1-3 from the selected zzso we trained a zzso function in zzso Finally, the trained zzso function was applied to zzso signals acquired in runs zzso zzso we succeeded in predicting the subsequent recognition performance for stimuli studied in runs 4-6 with significant zzso This accurate prediction suggests that zzso can extract information that is associated not only with concurrent cognitive status, but also with behavior in the near zzso
