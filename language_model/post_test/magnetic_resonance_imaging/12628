Conventional group analysis of functional zzso zzso data usually involves spatial alignment of anatomy across participants by registering every brain image to an anatomical reference zzso Due to the high degree of zzso anatomical zzso a zzso average anatomical model is typically used as the target template, and/or smoothing kernels are applied to the zzso data to increase the overlap among subjects' image zzso However, such smoothing can make it difficult to resolve small regions such as zzso of auditory zzso when anatomical zzso varies among zzso Here, we use data from an auditory zzso study to show that using a zzso registration technique zzso results in an enhanced functional zzso ratio zzso for functional data analysis within auditory regions, with more localized zzso zzso The technique is validated against zzso a zzso zzso zzso as well as against commonly used zzso zzso techniques such as the techniques provided with zzso zzso basis zzso and zzso zzso zzso software zzso We also systematically examine how spatial resolution of the template image and spatial smoothing of the functional data affect the zzso Only the zzso technique zzso appears to be able to capitalize on the excellent anatomical resolution of a zzso reference template, and, as expected, smoothing increased zzso but at the cost of spatial zzso In general, results demonstrate significant improvement in zzso using zzso compared to analysis after zzso using zzso or conventional zzso such as zzso basis function and unified zzso in zzso with more precisely localized zzso zzso at least for zzso in the region of auditory zzso
