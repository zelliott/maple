To investigate if there is a molecular correlate in muscle tissue to the zzso decreased muscle function in patients with zzso inactive zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Muscle function was assessed using a muscle function index of zzso To assess disease activity both zzso investigation of muscle zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans of the thigh muscles were zzso zzso chronic disease was defined as zzso muscle weakness and absence of inflammatory infiltrates in muscle biopsy and absence of signs of inflammation on zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso class I molecules in muscle tissue was investigated with zzso 

Muscle weakness was confirmed by a reduction of muscle function zzso No signs of inflammation typical for zzso were zzso The most striking finding in our study was the strong expression of zzso and zzso class I molecules in muscle tissue from patients with inactive chronic PM and zzso Increased zzso expression was evident in zzso and increased zzso class I expression was detected in muscle fiber zzso 

zzso and zzso class I molecules may have an importance in the zzso of the chronic muscle weakness and fatigue in patients with PM and zzso
