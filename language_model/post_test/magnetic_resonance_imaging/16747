To study the staging accuracy of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients showing unilateral low-risk cancer on prostate zzso A total of 58 consecutive patients with low-risk cancer zzso zzso and unilateral cancer involvement on prostate zzso were included zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso zzso before radical zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso Each zzso was divided in eight zzso zzso zzso zzso identified on pathological analysis were matched with zzso zzso zzso examination showed tumor zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and bilateral tumor zzso zzso in zzso zzso For tumor detection in the peripheral zone zzso zzso performed significantly better than zzso and zzso alone zzso In the transition zone zzso only zzso performed better than zzso alone zzso With optimal MR combinations, tumor size was correctly estimated in zzso of tumor zzso involving more than one zzso zzso tumors were detected in zzso zzso of zzso In patients with unilateral low-risk prostate cancer on zzso zzso zzso can help to predict bilateral zzso zzso zzso may therefore have a zzso value and help to determine optimal treatment in such zzso
