We compared the zzso features and evolution of patients with two different types of abnormal cortical zzso unilateral zzso zzso zzso and unilateral zzso zzso Between February 1990 and June 2002, 51 children with either unilateral zzso or zzso zzso were selected through zzso analysis for investigation at our zzso We evaluated the frequency of zzso zzso features and zzso The mean time of follow-up was 7 years zzso zzso zzso All patients underwent neurological examination, zzso zzso scan and magnetic resonance imaging, serial zzso zzso recordings and zzso zzso zzso of the 51 patients had unilateral zzso All patients had zzso with mild zzso Mental zzso was mild in 20 and moderate in zzso In two patients zzso was zzso zzso motor zzso were recorded in 28 patients, with secondary zzso in zzso The median age at onset of zzso was 2 years zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed unilateral spikes in all zzso In 21 patients zzso worsened between the ages of 4 and 8 zzso zzso zzso with frequent zzso seizures, zzso absences, zzso negative zzso and gait zzso zzso showed continuous zzso activity or bilateral zzso spike zzso during zzso zzso zzso relapses of zzso and zzso zzso were seen in nine zzso At present, 16 patients are zzso Fifteen patients with unilateral zzso were included in the zzso zzso motor zzso were registered in seven cases, in three of them with secondary zzso The median age at onset of zzso was zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed unilateral spikes in these seven zzso All patients except one presented mild zzso zzso Mental zzso was mild in ten children, moderate in two and zzso was normal in zzso Although the underlying mechanisms leading to zzso and zzso are probably similar, the zzso phenomenon of secondary bilateral zzso with frequent negative zzso was not present in our cases with unilateral zzso zzso
