zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is an emerging methodology which provides various approaches to visualizing regional brain activity zzso Although the exact mechanisms underlying the zzso between neural function and zzso signal changes remain zzso zzso studies have been successful in confirming zzso zzso in a variety of brain regions, providing zzso evidence for functional zzso In particular, zzso methods based on blood zzso level dependent zzso contrast and zzso spin labeling zzso zzso contrast have enabled imaging of changes in blood zzso and cerebral blood flow zzso While zzso contrast has been widely used as the surrogate marker for neural zzso and can provide reliable information on the zzso underlying transient zzso and cognitive functions, recent evidence suggests zzso contrast is suitable for studying relatively long term effects on zzso both at rest or during zzso New developments in combining or simultaneously measuring the zzso and zzso signals allow a new class of studies that capitalize on dynamic imaging with high zzso zzso This article reviews the zzso bases and zzso of zzso and its applications to the clinical zzso with emphasis on the zzso resolution of zzso and its zzso with zzso under both normal and zzso zzso
