The purpose of our study was to define zzso anatomy with MR imaging and zzso 

Five zzso knee specimens underwent zzso and MR imaging using the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and five zzso planes and zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso Three knees were injected with gelatin zzso solution before zzso All five specimens were zzso zzso was made between findings derived from MR imaging, zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso images without zzso zzso were most useful for revealing the superficial layer and deep ligaments of the zzso however, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso planes showed the deep ligaments more clearly in their zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso as zzso structures with discrete superficial and deep layers but failed to distinguish the deep ligaments from one zzso 

Conventional zzso zzso MR images showed the various components of the zzso including the zzso zzso zzso which is an important stabilizing zzso Oblique imaging planes may be a helpful adjunct to zzso imaging zzso zzso can consistently identify the zzso and may be useful in their zzso
