zzso how dynamic changes in brain activity control behavior is a major challenge of cognitive zzso Here, we consider the brain as a complex dynamic system and define two measures of brain zzso the zzso of brain activity, measured by the spatial zzso of the zzso signal across regions of the zzso and zzso which we define as the extent to which zzso varies over zzso We investigate the relationship among brain network activity, zzso and cognitive state in humans, testing the hypothesis that global zzso is zzso by network zzso We study the following two conditions: zzso an zzso demanding choice reaction time task zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated increased zzso and decreased zzso was associated with increased activity within the zzso zzso attention network zzso activity and decreased default mode network zzso activity during the zzso compared with zzso Using a zzso model of neural dynamics that is constrained by white matter structure to test whether simulated changes in zzso and zzso activity produce similar effects, we zzso that zzso of the zzso increases global zzso and decreases zzso zzso zzso had the opposite zzso These results suggest that the balance of activity in the zzso and zzso might control global zzso providing a zzso explanation of how zzso state is shifted between an zzso mode characterized by high zzso and a zzso mode characterized by low zzso
