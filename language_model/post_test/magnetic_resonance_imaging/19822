It is well known that magnetic zzso variations lead to signal voids in zzso However, recent work has shown that zzso imaging of zzso field variations can provide signal enhancements rather than signal zzso In this paper, we propose a new method for generating positive contrast from zzso spins with zzso free zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso Based on theory and experiments, we demonstrate that zzso images can be acquired in the presence of zzso media with low flip angle zzso that are determined by the spin relaxation time zzso of the imaging zzso Compared to other techniques, this technique is substantially faster and has low specific zzso rates, permitting zzso zzso In addition to acquiring zzso images, we also show that it is possible to suppress the imaging medium to desired zzso thereby allowing for simultaneous registration of the background details surrounding the zzso zzso Among practical applications, we anticipate that the proposed technique can potentially facilitate high field zzso molecular zzso
