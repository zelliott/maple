To evaluate the accuracy of zzso for the diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting cervical zzso zzso of suspected unknown zzso zzso to understand its relative clinical utility and relevance when compared to classic zzso investigation zzso 

A retrospective study was zzso collecting information from clinical files of all patients who presented to the Portuguese Institute of Oncology - zzso from January 2005 to December 2011, with cervical zzso zzso whose primary hadn't been found, despite clinical examination and standard imaging zzso scan or zzso and therefore were submitted to a zzso Among those presenting with zzso zzso patients were subsequently analyzed according to: zzso those who performed examination under zzso zzso for zzso either before of after zzso 

Eighty nine patients were included in the zzso zzso rate was zzso with no statistically difference between those with zzso zzso and those with zzso in higher cervical levels zzso zzso zzso In this last group zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had had zzso and an zzso associated with zzso of the upper zzso tract in different orders, to complete diagnostic zzso in cases where the first performed was zzso No statistically difference was found between these two methods zzso zzso zzso Most of noticed false zzso were microscopic zzso located deep in the zzso zzso 

zzso showed to be an useful tool when searching for primary zzso whether zzso were zzso or located in higher levels of the zzso Despite its good accuracy and detection of zzso previously zzso by zzso with zzso zzso mainly due to sampling zzso zzso negative scan shouldn't zzso performing zzso Being evident that both tools are zzso It was not possible in this study to find any evidence that could show which one of these two exams should be performed zzso
