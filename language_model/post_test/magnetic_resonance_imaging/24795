To investigate the clinical, zzso and zzso zzso outcomes of zzso zzso crest zzso cylinder graft transplantation for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with large zzso zzso 

Between January 2008 and December 2010, 17 consecutive cases of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso larger than 10 zzso in diameter received transplantation of zzso zzso cylinder zzso which was harvested from the zzso zzso zzso The visual analog scale score for pain during daily activities, American zzso Foot & zzso Society zzso and ankle scores, and zzso satisfaction survey rating were zzso Plain zzso and magnetic resonance imaging of the ankle were obtained before and after zzso In 13 cases zzso zzso was performed 12 months zzso and the cartilage repair was assessed with the criteria of the International zzso zzso zzso
