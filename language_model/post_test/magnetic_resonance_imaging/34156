To determine whether a 10-minute magnetic resonance zzso imaging examination of the upper abdomen provides sufficiently comprehensive information to replace a longer MR zzso 

Images obtained with selected zzso and breath hold MR zzso with 2 minutes of total acquisition time and an estimated 10 minutes of total study time, in consecutive MR examinations of the upper abdomen in 72 patients (age range, zzso zzso were zzso reviewed in a blinded fashion by two separate zzso zzso was made of major and minor findings, and the two separate retrospective interpretations and the prospective clinical interpretation were correlated by using zzso zzso zzso and clinical findings were also correlated with imaging zzso 

In 61 patients, all major and minor findings were identical in the original clinical interpretation and the two retrospective zzso In 66 patients, the major findings were identical in these three zzso Close agreement was present between the two separate retrospective readings and the prospective clinical interpretation zzso zzso zzso 

The findings suggest that the diagnostic information provided by a shortened MR imaging protocol that includes zzso and zzso sequences is in close agreement with zzso MR zzso The advantages of a shortened protocol include increased patient zzso and decreased study zzso
