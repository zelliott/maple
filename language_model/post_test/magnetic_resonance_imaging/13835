The study of lung zzso dates back to the beginning of the 17th zzso Nevertheless, a number of important questions remain unanswered because a quantitative localized characterization of zzso requires knowledge of lung structure at the zzso level in the intact living zzso This information is not available from traditional imaging zzso and pulmonary function zzso zzso we report the first in zzso zzso of lung geometrical parameters at the zzso level obtained with zzso diffusion zzso in healthy human subjects and patients with severe zzso We also provide the first experimental data demonstrating that zzso gas zzso in the zzso of human lung is highly zzso A theory of zzso diffusion is zzso Our results clearly demonstrate substantial differences between healthy and zzso lung at the zzso level and may provide new insights into zzso zzso The technique offers promise as a clinical tool for early diagnosis of zzso
