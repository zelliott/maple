zzso identification of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso on zzso is zzso to avoid zzso zzso and subsequent treatment zzso Recently, we found that zzso acid zzso induced zzso IX zzso zzso can zzso areas with increased zzso and zzso activity in such zzso zzso As treatment of zzso is zzso based on zzso World Health zzso zzso zzso we analyzed whether zzso zzso can detect zzso zzso according to these zzso 

We zzso included zzso patients with zzso zzso that received zzso prior to zzso zzso multiple samples from zzso positive and negative zzso areas were collected using a modified zzso zzso In all samples, zzso WHO criteria and proliferation rate were assessed and correlated to the zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 215 tumor specimens were collected in 59 zzso Of 26 WHO grade III zzso 23 cases zzso showed focal zzso fluorescence, whereas 29 zzso of 33 WHO grade II zzso were zzso zzso In zzso areas with focal zzso fluorescence, zzso rate, cell density, nuclear zzso and proliferation rate were significantly higher than in zzso zzso The positive zzso value of focal zzso zzso for WHO grade III zzso was zzso 

Our study indicates that zzso induced zzso zzso is a powerful marker for zzso identification of zzso zzso according to the zzso WHO criteria in zzso with zzso zzso zzso application of zzso zzso tissue sampling for precise zzso diagnosis independent of zzso
