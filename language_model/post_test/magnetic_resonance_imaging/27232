To evaluate if zzso compromises zzso enhancement of zzso zzso both compounds competing in organic zzso transporting peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The study was approved by institutional review zzso Twelve healthy subjects zzso men, three woman; mean age, zzso zzso were examined twice by MR imaging with prior administration of zzso solution zzso or 1000 zzso of zzso following a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso body zzso was administered 15 zzso after the end of zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso sequences were zzso Relative enhancements of liver zzso and ratio of means were calculated from signal intensity zzso Plasma levels of zzso acid and zzso were determined and given in geometric means and zzso of variation zzso 

Concentration of zzso directly after end of infusion was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso 5 zzso after zzso acid administration were zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso infusion and zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso Mean relative enhancements of liver zzso were zzso zzso zzso after zzso infusion and zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso of relative enhancements was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso statistically not zzso 

zzso of zzso has no effect on zzso acid enhanced liver MR zzso
