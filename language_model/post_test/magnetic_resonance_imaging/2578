A case of central zzso that was confirmed with zzso and zzso studies has been zzso zzso thin zzso processes of tumor cells showed differentiation into zzso cells containing parallel zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso and/or clear zzso It was frequently found that the clusters of tumor cell processes were close to or around the zzso zzso were composed of zzso cells without zzso and had tight junctions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in thin cell processes appeared close to zzso and may have been zzso around zzso
