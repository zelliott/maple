zzso studies of text comprehension conducted thus far have shed little light on the brain mechanisms underlying strategic learning from zzso Thus, the present study was designed to answer the question of what brain areas are active during performance of complex reading zzso Reading comprehension strategies are designed to improve a reader's comprehension of a zzso For example, zzso is a complex reading strategy that enhances existing comprehension zzso It was hypothesized that reading strategies would involve areas of the brain that are normally involved in reading comprehension along with areas that are involved in strategic control processes because the readers are intentionally using a complex reading zzso zzso were asked to zzso zzso and zzso three different texts in a block design zzso zzso zzso was found in both executive control and comprehension areas, and zzso learning from text was associated with zzso in the anterior prefrontal zzso zzso The authors speculate that the zzso may play a role in zzso the internal and external modes of thought that are necessary for zzso new knowledge from texts with prior zzso
