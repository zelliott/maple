Using previously published functional magnetic resonance imaging work studying object recall as a zzso we describe the spatial and zzso properties of brain zzso as one plausible model of visually triggered access to semantic zzso We suggest that interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso area 6 facilitate the setting of object search criteria and perhaps drive the zzso The zzso nucleus of the thalamus, in concert with zzso zzso and zzso cortical regions, become active later, perhaps when the criteria are met or the target object is zzso
