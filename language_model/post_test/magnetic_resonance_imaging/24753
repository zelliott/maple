Visual cortical responses are usually attenuated by repetition, a phenomenon known as repetition suppression zzso Here, we use zzso pattern analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data to show that zzso zzso with the converse phenomenon zzso enhancement, zzso in a single cortical zzso We presented human volunteers with short sequences of repeated faces and measured brain activity using zzso In an independently defined zzso zzso region, the response of each zzso to repetition zzso zzso zzso was consistent across scanner runs, and zzso patterns for both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso zzso responded to repetition with zzso zzso and exhibited different patterns of connectivity with lower and higher visual zzso zzso simulations demonstrated that these effects must be due to differences in repetition sensitivity, and not feature zzso These findings establish that 2 classes of repetition responses coexist within 1 visual region and support models acknowledging this distinction, such as zzso coding models where perception requires the zzso of both predictions (which are enhanced by zzso and prediction errors (which are suppressed by zzso
