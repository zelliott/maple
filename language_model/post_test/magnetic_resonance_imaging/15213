The aim of this study was to differentiate the processing of zzso information, matched for pain intensity, from zzso zzso zzso control skin at multiple levels in the zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso approach, 12 male subjects underwent three functional scans beginning 1 h after topical application of zzso to a defined location on the zzso skin, when pain from zzso application had completely zzso Brush and two levels of painful heat zzso and zzso were applied to the site of zzso application and to the mirror image region on the opposite zzso Temperatures for each side were set to evoke zzso matched pain zzso temperatures zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso We found differences in zzso patterns following stimuli to treated and zzso sides in sensory circuits across all stimulus zzso Across the zzso zzso pathway, zzso stimulation of zzso skin evoked greater zzso in zzso zzso and nucleus, thalamus, and zzso zzso than the control zzso Thus, zzso zzso regions showed increased zzso in the context of zzso equal pain zzso Beyond these regions, contrast analyses of zzso zzso control skin stimulation indicated significant changes in bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso The involvement of these zzso regions suggests that they may be highly sensitive to context, such as prior experience zzso of zzso and the specific pain mechanism zzso zzso normal zzso
