This study was performed to compare two proposed zzso used when evaluating an adrenal mass discovered during staging evaluation of a patient with a known zzso Such evaluation was meant to lead to determination of the relative charges associated with each zzso 

zzso patients with known zzso who required evaluation of an adrenal mass underwent both chemical shift imaging zzso and zzso for zzso The hospital charges incurred for each procedure and any associated complications were zzso using national zzso scale charges and conversion zzso A decision analysis was performed to compare the relative charges that would have been incurred if adrenal MR imaging had been performed in all patients, followed by zzso biopsy only in those patients with MR findings not diagnostic of zzso zzso and the relative charges incurred if only zzso adrenal biopsy had been performed in every zzso 

zzso zzso of 54 adrenal masses were shown to be zzso by zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The charges incurred by performing MR imaging as the initial examination with subsequent zzso biopsy only in those patients with zzso findings not diagnostic of zzso would have been similar to those incurred by first performing zzso adrenal biopsy in every zzso 

zzso is an accurate, zzso technique for evaluating adrenal masses in patients with zzso If zzso biopsy is used only when zzso is not diagnostic of zzso zzso the associated charges would be virtually the same as when zzso biopsy is performed as the first test in every zzso Moreover, zzso could have been avoided in zzso of these zzso
