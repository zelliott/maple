To zzso evaluate whether magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the liver at zzso T is comparable to that at zzso T with respect to image artifacts, image quality, and diagnostic utility in terms of detection and characterization of focal liver zzso in patients with these zzso 

Patients provided informed consent after the study had been explained, and the institutional review board approved the study zzso An zzso comparative study was performed in 21 patients (12 men and nine zzso mean age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso with a total of 79 focal liver zzso zzso and zzso who were examined at zzso and zzso MR imaging within 1 zzso The imaging protocol consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences with or without fat suppression, as well as zzso zzso zzso sequences with or without zzso contrast zzso All images were rated independently by two zzso with respect to types of artifacts zzso motion, zzso image zzso and zzso zzso and in regard to zzso and characterization of focal liver zzso A modified sign test was used for statistical analysis zzso zzso zzso 

Motion artifacts were significantly more pronounced in zzso zzso zzso zzso images at zzso T zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso artifacts were more pronounced zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant differences zzso zzso zzso were observed for the remaining artifacts and zzso Of the 79 index zzso a total of 76 were zzso identified at zzso imaging and a total of 77 were identified at zzso zzso 

MR imaging of the liver at zzso zzso compared with that at zzso zzso is feasible with equivalent image quality and diagnostic utility in terms of detection and characterization of focal liver zzso
