To compare the ability of zzso versus zzso zzso ratios to differentiate zzso brain tumor from radiation injury using magnetic resonance zzso zzso in previously treated zzso 

Twenty-five patients with previous diagnosis of primary zzso zzso confirmed with zzso previously treated with radiation therapy zzso zzso zzso with or without chemotherapy and new contrast enhancing zzso on a zzso T magnetic resonance imaging at the site of the primary zzso participated in this retrospective zzso After zzso clinical, zzso and zzso data were used to zzso new zzso zzso as either zzso zzso or radiation zzso Volume of interest included both the zzso and zzso brain on the zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios were calculated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso values obtained within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratios were calculated using the zzso values from the zzso normal side: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were correlated with the final diagnosis by zzso zzso zzso 

Two of three zzso ratios, zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso and zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso significantly associated with tumor recurrence even after correcting for multiple zzso Of the six zzso ratios, only zzso significantly correlated with tumor recurrence zzso zzso specificity zzso but did not remain significant after correcting for multiple zzso 

zzso and zzso were the two ratios with the best discriminating ability and both had better discriminating ability than their corresponding zzso ratios zzso under the curve zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
