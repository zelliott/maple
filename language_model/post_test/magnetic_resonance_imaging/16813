To develop zzso that zzso pancreatic zzso cells for treatment of type I diabetes and enable zzso cellular imaging of transplanted zzso zzso 

All animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use zzso Gold zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with pancreatic zzso cells by using zzso zzso as a zzso zzso cross zzso Conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso were included as zzso The viability and zzso responsiveness of zzso cells were assessed in zzso and in zzso insulin zzso zzso was monitored for 6 weeks in zzso diabetic mice with zzso zzso 7) or without zzso zzso 8) zzso zzso zzso zzso Five zzso mice were included as zzso zzso between samples were calculated by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso To adjust for multiple zzso a significance level of P zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso equations were used to model cell function over zzso Three mice with zzso capsules were zzso in zzso with zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso human pancreatic zzso were functional in zzso for at least 2 weeks after zzso Blood zzso levels in the diabetic mice transplanted with zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cells returned to normal within 1 week after zzso and zzso was sustained for at least 6 weeks without the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso could be readily zzso with zzso zzso MR imaging, zzso and US both in zzso and in zzso 

Cell zzso with zzso provides a means of zzso zzso tracking of zzso zzso
