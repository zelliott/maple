Eight patients with zzso (four females and four zzso were identified in an zzso Average age on presentation was 46 years zzso zzso zzso zzso fluid showed zzso zzso elevated protein and decreased zzso zzso showed multiple or single zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated on zzso zzso was tried and resulted in improvement in five out of eight zzso In four patients, zzso treatment resulted in no improvement or worsening of clinical or zzso zzso 

The response to therapy of zzso zzso zzso where no zzso is identified after thorough investigations hints to zzso causes, and suggests current dogma regarding the significance of necrosis in zzso diseases should be zzso Our retrospective series suggests that patients may benefit from an early trial of zzso therapy, a hypothesis to be tested in a zzso zzso
