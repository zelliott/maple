To evaluate the zzso nerve zzso size and globe shape in zzso eyes using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to compare these values with those of the sound fellow eye and of normal control zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

Thirty-four zzso patients and 60 normal control patients were evaluated using surface zzso zzso zzso ON zzso maximum globe zzso globe zzso zzso major zzso zzso zzso length zzso and the ratio of zzso to ON zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso of the minimum angle of resolution acuity of all 34 zzso eyes averaged zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso ON zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso Although zzso and fellow zzso had similar zzso both were significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso significantly exceeded normal in zzso eyes zzso zzso zzso there was no significant difference between zzso and fellow zzso Globe zzso of zzso eyes zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and fellow eyes zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was significantly greater than that of control eyes zzso zzso zzso but zzso and fellow eyes did not differ zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with zzso but also with zzso zzso zzso greater than normal zzso and zzso zzso globe zzso These factors evidently do not determine which of the 2 eyes will become zzso zzso zzso of zzso and fellow eyes may reflect optical causes of zzso or bilateral zzso of globe shape secondary to zzso
