The effects of a zzso zzso alertness training on chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated zzso in seven patients by means of zzso tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Following the alertness training, the group showed improved alertness and a significant improvement in the performance of a neglect test battery over and above any improvement during a zzso baseline zzso zzso in the neglect tasks were accompanied by an increase of right zzso neural activity in frontal cortex, anterior zzso cortex, zzso zzso and angular zzso These areas have previously been associated with alertness and spatial zzso A similar pattern of increased neural activity was found for the left zzso Four weeks after the end of the training, the patients' neglect test performance had mostly returned to zzso while the increases in neural activity zzso in frontal areas, in the right anterior zzso cortex, the right angular zzso and the left zzso zzso zzso The data show that a zzso zzso alertness training can improve performance both in alertness and neglect tests and that these zzso improvements are associated with zzso in areas associated with alerting and zzso zzso The limited stability of these effects over time suggests that a zzso alertness training alone does not result in long lasting improvements in every patient, but refining the treatment protocol may lead to a more stable zzso of neglect zzso
