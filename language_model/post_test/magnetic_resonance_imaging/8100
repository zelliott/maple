zzso zzso zzso is the first clinical manifestation in approximately zzso of patients with multiple sclerosis zzso The inflammation and zzso of the zzso nerve are characterized by symptomatic visual impairment and zzso pain, and associated with decreased visual zzso decreased zzso and contrast sensitivity, delayed visual evoked zzso and visual field zzso zzso recovery of vision typically occurs within weeks or months after zzso depending on the resolution of zzso zzso restoration of zzso in zzso which persist zzso and zzso plasticity in the cortical and zzso visual zzso To assess where recovery takes place along the visual pathway, visual zzso was studied in the lateral zzso nucleus zzso the main zzso relay nucleus in the visual zzso and in three areas of the visual zzso the lateral zzso complexes zzso zzso and zzso We conducted a zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study of regions of interest zzso of zzso in zzso and visual zzso in 19 patients with acute ON at zzso 3 and 6 months from zzso With zzso we measured the zzso in the zzso and compared zzso during zzso stimulation of the affected and unaffected zzso In the acute phase the zzso of zzso during visual stimulation of the affected eye was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso compared to the unaffected zzso This difference in zzso zzso between the affected and unaffected eye diminished during recovery, and after 180 days the difference was no longer significant zzso zzso zzso The decreased difference during recovery was mainly due to an increase in the zzso signal when stimulating the affected eye, but included a component of a decreasing zzso signal from zzso when stimulating the unaffected zzso In zzso zzso and V2 zzso during visual stimulation of the affected eye in the acute phase was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso compared to the unaffected eye, and during recovery the difference diminished with no significant differences left after 180 zzso As the pattern of zzso in zzso zzso and V2 resembled the development in zzso we found no evidence of additional cortical zzso zzso The reduced zzso of the zzso to stimulation of the unaffected eye is interpreted as a shift away from early zzso changes established in the acute phase in zzso and may indicate very early plasticity of the visual zzso
