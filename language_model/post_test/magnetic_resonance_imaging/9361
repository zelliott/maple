zzso is routinely used for diagnosis, treatment planning and assessment of response to therapy for patients with zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are quite variable in terms of their response to zzso Patients classified as having zzso zzso have a median overall survival of 7 years or more, but need to be monitored carefully to make sure that their tumor does not upgrade to a more zzso zzso Patients with the most aggressive grade IV zzso have a median overall survival of zzso months and often undergo multiple surgeries and zzso therapies in an attempt to control their zzso Despite improvements in the spatial resolution and sensitivity of zzso images, there remain considerable ambiguities in the interpretation of changes in the size of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso images as a measure of treatment response, and in zzso between treatment effects and zzso tumor within the larger zzso zzso The planning of focal therapies, such as surgery, radiation and targeted drug delivery, as well as a more reliable assessment of the response to therapy, would benefit considerably from the integration of zzso and zzso imaging techniques into routine clinical MR zzso Advanced methods that have been shown to provide valuable data for patients with zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso examinations that include the acquisition of such data are able to assess tumor zzso zzso disruption of normal tissue architecture, changes in vascular density and vessel zzso in addition to the standard measures of changes in the volume of enhancing and zzso zzso zzso This is particularly critical for the interpretation of the results of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of novel therapies, which are increasingly including agents that are designed to have zzso and zzso properties as opposed to having a direct effect on tumor cell zzso
