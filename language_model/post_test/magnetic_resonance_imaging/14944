Recent studies suggest that computerized cognitive training leads to improved performance in related but untrained tasks zzso transfer zzso However, most study designs prevent zzso which of the task components are necessary for zzso In the current study, we examined whether training on two zzso of the zzso dual zzso task would affect untrained task performance and the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso Forty three healthy young adults were trained for three weeks with a high or low interference training zzso of the dual zzso task, or they were assigned to a passive control zzso While zzso training with high interference led to partial improvements in the Attention Network Test zzso we did not find transfer to measures of working memory and fluid zzso zzso analysis in the zzso task and the zzso indicated overlapping processes in the zzso time zzso Moreover, in the zzso we detected increased zzso activity for the interference training group zzso In contrast, we did not find zzso differences between the low interference training and the control zzso These findings suggest that training on an interference control task leads to higher zzso activity in the zzso cortex, which may be related to improvements in processing speed, zzso control, or zzso
