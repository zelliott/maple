To zzso and zzso compare liver magnetic resonance imaging zzso using zzso and zzso parallel zzso zzso transmissions at zzso for image quality, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Ninety-nine patients with 139 liver zzso underwent liver zzso at zzso Two zzso performed a consensus review of zzso images zzso heavily zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images, and zzso imaging using zzso and zzso zzso transmissions with regard to image quality and zzso zzso zzso ratios between liver zzso and liver zzso were also zzso 

Image quality was better with zzso than with zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso were similar for all zzso There was no significant difference in mean contrast ratios for all sequences zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso transmission provides a better image quality with zzso and zzso than with zzso However, 2 techniques showed similar zzso zzso
