The effects of zzso on a large volume of normal brain tissue as occurs in zzso zzso were zzso Double zzso seed zzso were zzso implanted into the right zzso zzso of eight adult Japanese monkeys zzso zzso The zzso changes induced in the normal brain tissue were evaluated with magnetic resonance zzso imaging with and without zzso acid zzso enhancement at 2 days and 1, 3, and 6 months after the zzso After each MR imaging examination, randomly selected experimental animals were sacrificed to analyze the zzso zzso The low intensity area seen inside the ring of contrast enhancement on the zzso image with zzso enhancement was well correlated with zzso defined zzso The high intensity area seen outside the area showing contrast enhancement on the zzso image was well correlated with an area of zzso zzso and zzso The sizes of the zzso and the high intensity area were maximum during the acute stage (2 zzso following zzso zzso This monkey model with MR imaging can be used to investigate the development of brain damage induced by zzso zzso We further recommend careful monitoring to detect the development of brain zzso during the acute stage after zzso zzso especially when large tumors are zzso
