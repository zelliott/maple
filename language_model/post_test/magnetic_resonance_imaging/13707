Near infrared zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso both allow zzso monitoring of cerebral cortical zzso responses to various zzso To compare these methods in elderly subjects and to determine the effect of age on cortical zzso responses, we determined zzso changes in zzso concentration zzso over the left motor zzso in six healthy young subjects (age 35 zzso 9 years, mean zzso zzso and five healthy elderly subjects (age 73 zzso 3 zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso consisted of seven cycles of zzso periods of zzso zzso at a rate as fast as possible zzso with zzso periods of zzso zzso averages over the seven cycles were used for further zzso zzso decreases in zzso over the motor zzso were measured by zzso with maximum changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the young and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the elderly zzso The zzso signal increased over the zzso volume under investigation with zzso with maximum changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the young and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the elderly zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed good correlation in the young zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and elderly subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso demonstrated zzso decreases in zzso cerebral zzso responses zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso demonstrated smaller areas of cortical zzso in the elderly subjects zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso and zzso similarly assess cortical zzso changes in young subjects and also in elderly zzso In addition, cortical zzso responses to brain zzso alter with zzso
