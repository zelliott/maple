zzso are highly mobile cells that travel throughout the body in response to a tremendous variety of zzso zzso zzso trafficking patterns in zzso is necessary for a complete understanding of immune function, as well as zzso and zzso interactions in immune development and in response to zzso Although the location of cell populations in various zzso at any given point in time may be revealed by techniques such as flow zzso and zzso these methods are not readily amenable to the assessment of dynamic cell migration patterns in zzso In the past 5 years, technologies for imaging molecular and cellular changes in living animals have advanced to a point where it is possible to reveal the migratory paths of these vitally important zzso Here, we review one advancement in cellular imaging, in zzso zzso imaging, which addresses the problem of zzso zzso This imaging strategy has the potential to zzso the zzso patterns of immune responses and the spatial distribution of zzso within the zzso
