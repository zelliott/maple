zzso studies suggest that patients with primary zzso zzso zzso experience significant problems with memory and zzso Studies of zzso disease have linked zzso and cognitive zzso In this study, we determined the prevalence of cognitive symptoms in zzso examined the relationship between symptoms and overt cognitive impairment and structural brain zzso and explored the role of zzso zzso The prevalence of cognitive symptoms was determined in 198 patients with zzso zzso representative zzso female patients with zzso and 11 matched controls underwent formal cognitive testing at baseline and after 2 years of zzso zzso nervous system function was assessed according to heart rate zzso and zzso zzso Eleven subjects with zzso had structural brain zzso zzso via magnetic resonance zzso zzso symptoms were frequent in our zzso population, with zzso of patients experiencing moderate or severe problems with concentration and/or memory, which were unrelated in their severity to zzso and zzso makers of liver disease severity, suggesting that this symptom burden is largely or entirely unrelated to zzso zzso zzso cognitive symptoms correlated with zzso assessed cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso deficits were seen in the zzso cohort compared with controls, with significant decline detected over 2 years of zzso zzso were seen between cognitive performance zzso intelligence zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with decline in cognitive function associated with zzso zzso zzso brain zzso were found in zzso the density of which correlated with degree of cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso function zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso symptoms are prevalent in zzso independent of liver disease severity and are associated with poorer performance on objective cognitive zzso zzso impairment is, in turn, associated with structural brain zzso and zzso dysfunction, which may predict risk of cognitive zzso
