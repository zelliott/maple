zzso zzso is one of the classic causes of zzso hearing zzso zzso zzso response zzso testing with a sensitivity of about 90 % in the diagnosis of acoustic zzso plays an important role as a screening zzso 

A patient suffering from an zzso unilateral zzso hearing loss with zzso recovered for a short period of time after being treated with low density zzso zzso zzso improving zzso Surprisingly, the reason for the sudden hearing loss was a tumor in the zzso angle with a maximum diameter of 2 zzso which was detected by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso response testing zzso zzso tests and other standard tests were negative concerning this zzso There was no previous evidence for an acoustic zzso in all investigations of cochlear zzso except zzso 

The acoustic zzso caused a zzso of the labyrinthine artery in the inner auditory canal resulting in an acute unilateral hearing loss with zzso Low zzso zzso was able to achieve a short term improvement of blood supply to the inner zzso Thus the zzso of the labyrinthine artery caused by an acoustic zzso could be compensated for the duration of about one zzso Within this time the effect of zzso decreased more and zzso After a sudden unilateral hearing loss an acoustic zzso must be ruled out even if the zzso testing by zzso primarily shows no prolonged zzso zzso
