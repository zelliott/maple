zzso functional theory calculations of isolated zzso zzso and zzso base pairs predict that zzso zzso zzso bond zzso isotope shifts due to zzso substitution at the zzso zzso zzso are sensitive to the zzso distance between the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso or zzso which supports the notion that zzso is sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso values at a given zzso distance are the same for isolated zzso and zzso base zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso with zzso zzso and substituting zzso in DNA with zzso do not statistically shift empirical zzso zzso Thus, we show zzso and zzso that the zzso zzso group of zzso has no measurable affect on zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso values of modified and unmodified zzso are more negative than those of modified and unmodified DNA, which supports our hypothesis that zzso hydrogen bonds are stronger than those of zzso It is also shown here that zzso is context dependent and that this dependence is similar for zzso and zzso
