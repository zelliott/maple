It has been suggested that the zzso of cerebral zzso zzso differs according to their location in the brain, with zzso zzso being caused by cerebral zzso zzso and deep or zzso zzso resulting from hypertension and zzso We hypothesized that there were associations between cerebral zzso zzso cardiovascular risk factors, and the occurrence of zzso We examined these relationships in the current zzso 

Three hundred zzso patients with zzso were analyzed in this zzso The zzso were listed according to the various zzso territories, and these were assessed for their relationship with cardiovascular risk factors, markers of small vessel disease, and their presence and location using multiple zzso zzso 

zzso blood pressure had a significant association with zzso in the territory of the zzso cerebral artery and the deep and zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso and white matter changes were associated with zzso in nearly all zzso zzso 

zzso increases the risk of zzso in the territory of the zzso cerebral artery and the deep and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be responsible for the zzso in the zzso area of zzso
