zzso coronary zzso infusion is a promising delivery method for cellular zzso Poor cell retention is the major obstacle to the establishment of this method as the preferred route for cell zzso Here, we explored whether magnetic targeting could enhance retrograde cell retention in a rat model of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso stem cells were labeled with zzso oxide zzso The magnetic responsiveness of zzso was observed while cells flowed through a tube that served as a model of blood vessels in a zzso magnetic zzso In a zzso rat model of acute zzso zzso zzso magnetic zzso stem cells were zzso injected into the left cardiac vein while a zzso magnet was placed above the zzso The cardiac retention of transplanted cells was assessed by using quantitative Y zzso zzso chain reaction, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and optical zzso zzso function was measured by using zzso and zzso analyses of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

The flowing iron zzso zzso stem cells were effectively attracted to the area where the magnet was zzso zzso hours after cellular zzso delivery, magnetic targeting significantly increased the cardiac retention of transplanted cells by zzso to zzso zzso analyses showed that more transplanted cells were distributed in the anterior wall of the left zzso The enhanced cell zzso persisted for at least 3 weeks, at which time, left zzso zzso was zzso and cardiac function benefit was zzso 

These results suggest that magnetic targeting offers new perspectives for retrograde coronary zzso delivery to enhance cell retention and subsequent functional benefit in heart diseases
