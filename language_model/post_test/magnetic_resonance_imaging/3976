We present the case histories of three premature infants with zzso zzso zzso 

The timing of the zzso was monitored in zzso in two of the three zzso zzso resonance imaging studies zzso in one case, within 24 hours of birth in all three zzso established the duration of the zzso and thereby added to the zzso zzso 

All three patients demonstrated a similar pattern of zzso consisting of zzso unilateral zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso residual blood in the zzso fluid with a zzso zzso reaction, zzso zzso zzso zzso on the side of the zzso with mild zzso and zzso zzso and zzso partial zzso of the zzso zzso On the basis of two cases in which information about the pregnancy was available and in which fetal zzso without zzso zzso was zzso we assume that this pattern of zzso may have resulted from a zzso episode followed by zzso zzso 

Because these three infants with zzso zzso were born during a period of only 18 months in a zzso center serving a region with 16,000 live zzso per year, we speculate that a zzso cause for zzso zzso zzso
