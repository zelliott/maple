The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso of dynamic zzso zzso and compare quantitative kinetic parameters with zzso methods, and whole zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso patients with a range of zzso types underwent paired zzso examinations within a week, of which 16 pairs were zzso A zzso zzso image was obtained prior to a dynamic series of 30 zzso zzso zzso echo images every zzso s with an intravenous zzso of zzso zzso given after the third baseline data zzso zzso zzso around the whole zzso and in skeletal muscle were drawn by the same observer on each pair of examinations and used for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement and zzso zzso under the zzso were derived from tissue enhancement zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso were obtained by the application of the zzso zzso Analysis was performed on data averaged across the whole zzso and on the median value from individual zzso within the zzso No zzso showed a significant change between zzso For all parameters except zzso the zzso was not dependent on the zzso value, so the absolute values for the size of changes needed for significance should be used for future reference rather than zzso The size of change needed for significance in a group of 16 in zzso for zzso zzso and zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For a single zzso changes greater than zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, would be significant zzso zzso For zzso enhancement and zzso the size of change needed for significance in zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively for a group of 16 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso In muscle, the size of change needed for significance in a group of 16 for zzso zzso and zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso enhancement and zzso it was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement and zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have greater zzso with larger changes in individuals required to be statistically zzso but are nevertheless sufficiently zzso to detect changes greater than zzso in a cohort of 16 zzso Pixel analyses slightly improve zzso estimates and retain information about spatial zzso zzso studies are recommended when treatment effects are being zzso
