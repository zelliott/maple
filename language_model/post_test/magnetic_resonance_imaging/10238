Whether MR imaging is superior to CT in evaluating the presence and extent of zzso invasion by zzso cell zzso remains zzso The purpose of this study was to directly compare the diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging and that of zzso 

MR and CT images in 51 patients with zzso cell zzso of the oral cavity were evaluated for the presence and extent of zzso zzso The results were correlated with zzso zzso 

Twenty-five of 51 patients had zzso evidence of zzso cortical zzso The tumor involved both the zzso and the bone zzso in all 25 patients and involved the inferior zzso canal in 5 zzso The sensitivity and specificity for zzso cortical invasion were zzso and zzso for MR imaging and zzso and zzso for CT, zzso Those for inferior zzso canal involvement were zzso and zzso for MR imaging and zzso and zzso for CT, zzso In both evaluations, the specificity of MR imaging was significantly lower than that of CT zzso test, P zzso zzso in the former and P zzso zzso in the zzso Chemical shift artifact by bone zzso fat was zzso to be the source of most zzso cases on MR imaging findings for zzso cortical zzso Those for inferior zzso canal involvement were due to MR imaging zzso of the tumor and surrounding inflammation with similar signal zzso 

In assessing the presence and extent of zzso invasion by zzso cell zzso the specificity of MR imaging was significantly lower than that of zzso
