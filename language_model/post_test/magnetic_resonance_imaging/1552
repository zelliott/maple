The contribution of MR imaging to identify zzso injuries has been studied mostly in zzso or zzso The purpose of this study was to describe the MR imaging findings of toddlers and older children with hypoxic coma and to analyze the zzso value of an MR imaging scoring zzso 

The conditions of 40 children with hypoxic coma (age range, 6 weeks to 18 zzso were clinically graded according to the pediatric risk of mortality score, and MR imaging studies were zzso zzso MR imaging studies were distributed in five categories according to their timing relative to the hypoxic zzso days 1 through 3, zzso zzso zzso and after day zzso These were evaluated zzso by using an zzso scoring system based on two zzso categories assessing watershed areas and zzso zzso involvement, including signal intensity and zzso features with respect to zzso zzso Two age groups zzso or zzso year and zzso zzso were zzso The surviving children were grouped according to zzso zzso 

The occurrence of watershed areas or zzso zzso involvement was not significantly different in association with zzso Sixteen children zzso Twelve children had moderate to severe zzso resulting from zzso disabilities, and 12 had good zzso zzso There was no correlation between pediatric risk of mortality score and zzso zzso There was a strong correlation between first MR imaging score zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity of the first MR imaging score was high zzso even when obtained during the first 3 days, with a specificity of 50% and a positive zzso value of zzso Six patients with zzso abnormal MR imaging findings experienced good zzso zzso 

The MR imaging scoring system proposed in this study can be used to establish an early prognosis in a significant proportion of children with hypoxic zzso It is zzso even during the first 3 days after the zzso However, some patients with zzso abnormal MR imaging findings may experience good zzso zzso
