The maintenance of zzso behavior relies upon a cascade of covert mental actions including motor imagery and zzso Here we investigated how cues imbued with motivational zzso can invigorate motor imagery networks preceding zzso We adapted the zzso zzso paradigm to explore this by substituting motor action with motor zzso Thus, reward was contingent upon a given level of zzso neural activity using real-time zzso We found that the zzso presentation of zzso cues during motor imagery not only enhanced neural responses in motivational centers zzso zzso and extended zzso but also exerted a motivational effect in the imagery network zzso Moreover, functional connectivity between zzso zzso (but not extended zzso and motor zzso was heightened during imagery in the presence of the zzso zzso The concurrent zzso of zzso and zzso networks may illuminate the neural process that links motivational cues to desires and urges to obtain zzso
