The majority of contrast agents used in magnetic resonance imaging zzso is based on the zzso element zzso zzso zzso could find promising applications in zzso diagnostic procedures of certain types of cancer, such as zzso zzso This is one of the most zzso lethal and poorly accessible forms of zzso Recent advances in zzso zzso synthesis have led to the development of zzso zzso of zzso oxide zzso 2-3 zzso zzso As of today, this is the smallest and the densest of all zzso zzso Cancer cells labeled with a sufficient quantity of this compound appear bright in zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso can be used to label zzso zzso zzso cells, followed by zzso and zzso in zzso using zzso Very high amounts of zzso are efficiently zzso and retained in cells, as confirmed with zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso in zzso at zzso T using the chicken zzso zzso This is one more step toward the development of zzso zzso cell tracking procedures with zzso
