zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso for 1 s at 4 zzso and zzso of the individual motor threshold was applied to primary motor zzso and adjacent cortical regions where no motor response could be zzso The zzso reaction was measured using an zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso While all volunteers showed a typical signal increase beneath the zzso during motor zzso zzso no consistent signal changes were present during frontal or zzso stimulation apart from zzso of auditory zzso The results suggest that zzso stimulation by zzso is followed by an zzso phase that compensates for the effect of an initial zzso zzso It is further concluded that the signal increases during motor zzso fit a sensory feedback from the moving body zzso
