The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the association of zzso joint zzso disc status and zzso zzso 

zzso subjects zzso female, 27 zzso with and without zzso disc abnormalities were followed for a mean time of 3 years 8 zzso Of this sample, 40 subjects (21 female, 19 zzso received zzso zzso zzso displacement and disc length zzso from magnetic resonance imaging of the jaw zzso were used to evaluate zzso disc zzso A principal component analysis was used to produce a single disc status score per zzso zzso and vertical growth changes were obtained from zzso zzso The zzso skeletal maturation index system was used to obtain the percentage of the total zzso growth zzso In addition, previous zzso treatment and time frames between the follow-up zzso zzso were zzso 

A zzso multiple linear zzso analysis was used to evaluate the influence of zzso disc status and zzso treatment on the displacement zzso between initial records zzso and final records zzso for each zzso zzso Less horizontal and vertical growth was found in specific regions of the zzso and the zzso in subjects with zzso disc zzso although their respective determination zzso were mild zzso zzso 

zzso disc zzso was associated with reduced forward growth of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso disc zzso was associated with reduced downward growth of the zzso zzso
