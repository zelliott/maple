The specificity of the zzso response function zzso is determined zzso by the vascular architecture and temporally by the evolution of zzso zzso The stimulus duration has additional influence on the zzso evolution of the zzso as brief stimuli elicit responses that engage only the local zzso whereas long stimuli lead to the involvement of remote vascular supply and zzso Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the zzso evolution of the blood zzso zzso zzso cerebral blood flow zzso and cerebral blood volume zzso zzso to zzso zzso stimulation in an zzso zzso zzso The zzso to a single zzso stimulus were robustly detected and consisted of a rapid response in both zzso and zzso with an onset time zzso of 350 zzso and a full zzso at zzso of 1 zzso In contrast, longer stimuli zzso a zzso transit of zzso blood across the cortical zzso that significantly prolonged the evolution of the zzso zzso but not the zzso The zzso and zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso are zzso released, and effective within 350 zzso However, the difference between the zzso and zzso OT zzso zzso was significantly smaller than the zzso transit time zzso zzso indicating an zzso contribution to the zzso zzso Finally, the rapid rate of growth of the active region with stimulus zzso suggests that functional zzso is an zzso process that involves the entire functional cortical zzso These findings offer a new view into the zzso dynamics of functional zzso regulation in the zzso
