Prospective zzso 

To test an zzso diagnostic tool to determine if it provided the surgeon with a safe, zzso accurate, quantitative measure of zzso spine motion segment zzso 

Several devices have been developed to measure motion segment zzso however, few have been tested zzso on humans, and none, to the best of the zzso knowledge have been tested as extensively as the device described in this zzso zzso criteria, such as those provided by an zzso zzso can be helpful in determining when and what type of fusion of a zzso spinal motion segment unit should be performed following zzso zzso 

The spinal zzso zzso placed between zzso processes of adjacent zzso applies a controlled, constant loading rate along the zzso zzso zzso producing a zzso curve from which zzso range of motion, and zzso can be zzso zzso from this tool were then used to investigate differences in zzso of the motion segment before and after zzso surgery, between spine levels, and between male and female zzso 

The spinal zzso gauge zzso zzso correlated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the same motion zzso The zzso zzso had excellent zzso zzso was dependent on the spine level, zzso and degree of disc zzso 

This study demonstrated the efficacy of the spinal zzso gauge for providing an objective, zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement of the zzso spine motion zzso
