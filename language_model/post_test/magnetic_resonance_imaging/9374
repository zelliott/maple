zzso three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has demonstrated its ability to predict fine zzso zzso zzso 

To address the zzso value of zzso zzso zzso in detecting and assessing features of zzso zzso zzso particularly regarding the degree of zzso exerted on the zzso in patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso for classic primary zzso zzso 

This prospective study includes 40 consecutive patients who underwent zzso for classic primary zzso zzso All patients underwent a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso driven equilibrium zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso were performed by 2 independent observers and compared with the operative zzso 

For prediction of zzso image analysis corresponded with surgical findings in 39 zzso Of the 3 patients in whom image analysis did not show zzso 2 did not have zzso at the time of zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was zzso zzso and specificity was zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso for predicting the offending vessel, its location, and the site of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Image analysis correctly defined the severity of the zzso in 31 of the 37 zzso The zzso zzso predicting the degree of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso 1 zzso zzso 2 zzso and 3 (marked zzso 

zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences proved to be reliable in detecting zzso and in predicting the degree of root zzso the outcome being correlated with the zzso
