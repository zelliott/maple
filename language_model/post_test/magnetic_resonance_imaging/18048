Parkinson's disease zzso is marked zzso by zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso and in zzso labeling studies demonstrate that this loss occurs most extensively in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previous structural studies have suggested reduced zzso volume and zzso of the zzso head in zzso zzso The spatial distribution of zzso in the zzso however, has not been zzso We aimed to delineate the specific locations of zzso in both of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso brain MR zzso images were obtained from 40 zzso and 40 control subjects having no zzso and similar age and gender zzso Shape analysis was performed using doubly segmented regions of zzso Compared to controls, zzso subjects had lower zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Surface contraction zzso were greatest on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and head and zzso body of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This spatial distribution of zzso zzso is consistent with the known pattern of zzso depletion in zzso and may reflect global consequences of known cellular zzso zzso
