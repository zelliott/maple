zzso of the anterior zzso zzso zzso are thought to be involved in the zzso of bipolar disorder, but structural zzso zzso Imaging zzso studies have reported variable zzso zzso for this include a failure to consider zzso in regional cortical folding patterns and a reliance on relatively coarse measures zzso zzso to index anatomical zzso We sought to overcome these limitations by combining a novel protocol for zzso the zzso and adjacent zzso zzso zzso that accounts for zzso variations in zzso and zzso zzso with a cortical zzso approach that allowed calculation of regional zzso matter volume, surface area and cortical thickness in 24 patients with bipolar I disorder and 24 matched zzso No changes in zzso matter volume or surface area were identified in any region, but patients did show significant reductions in cortical thickness in the left zzso zzso and right zzso zzso that were not attributable to group differences in cortical folding zzso These findings suggest that bipolar disorder is associated with more pronounced changes in the zzso and that reliance on zzso measures alone may obscure more subtle zzso
