High spatial resolution dynamic magnetic resonance zzso imaging performed with a zzso body zzso is a useful tool for evaluating zzso zzso The examination consists of fast zzso zzso and zzso images obtained in a single breath zzso zzso zzso fast zzso images obtained in a single breath zzso and contrast zzso images obtained in the zzso and delayed zzso zzso zzso with its predominantly zzso blood supply, usually appears zzso on zzso phase images and zzso or zzso relative to liver zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso especially those larger than zzso zzso contain a zzso capsule or an inner zzso which allows them to be differentiated from other zzso These characteristics are particularly important in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso which do not have an zzso blood supply and thus do not zzso zzso invasion, a relatively common finding in advanced cases, is seen as a zzso enhancing area that projects into the surrounding liver zzso adjacent to the main tumor on zzso phase images and as an zzso or zzso area on zzso zzso zzso vein invasion appears as an obstruction of the zzso and portal vein tumor zzso appear as zzso zzso The technique can also be helpful in the follow-up of zzso
