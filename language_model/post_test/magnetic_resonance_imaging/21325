zzso about functional zzso between functional networks of human and zzso primates largely rely on proximity and anatomical expansion zzso However, it has been demonstrated that zzso correspondent areas in two species can have different functional properties, suggesting that zzso approaches should be zzso with alternative methods to perform functional zzso We have recently shown that comparative analyses based on zzso correlations of zzso zzso responses can reveal functional correspondent areas in monkeys and humans without relying on spatial zzso zzso activity correlation zzso analyses require the definition of seed areas in one species to reveal functional zzso across the zzso of the same and other zzso Here we propose an extension of the zzso method that does not rely on any seed definition, hence a method void of any spatial zzso Specifically, we apply independent component analysis zzso separately to monkey and human data to define zzso networks of areas with coherent zzso zzso Then, we use a zzso cluster analysis to identify zzso zzso clusters of monkey and human networks with similar zzso We implemented this approach on zzso data collected in monkeys and humans during movie watching, a condition that evokes widespread zzso activity throughout large portions of the zzso Using zzso zzso we detected seven zzso zzso The zzso of several clusters showed significant zzso either with the motion energy in the movie or with zzso zzso Five of the clusters spanned putative zzso functional networks in either primary or zzso visual regions, whereas two clusters included zzso visual areas at zzso locations that are not predicted by cortical surface expansion zzso Overall, our zzso zzso analysis zzso the findings of our previous zzso zzso and suggested that functional processes can be executed by brain networks in different species that are functionally but not necessarily zzso zzso Overall, our method provides a novel approach to reveal zzso functional changes in the zzso brain with no spatial zzso
