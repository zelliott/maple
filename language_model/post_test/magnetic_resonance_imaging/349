The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of zzso medication in Parkinson's disease zzso on brain zzso during the performance of a zzso zzso Using zzso we have previously studied the patterns of activity observed in patients with zzso after overnight removal of zzso medication compared with control participants during the performance of different stages of the Wisconsin zzso zzso Task zzso The results revealed decreased cortical activity in the zzso group compared to controls in the conditions that significantly required zzso while increased cortical activity was observed when zzso was not zzso However, the effect of zzso medication in zzso patients on those patterns of activity has not yet been zzso 

Here, zzso zzso patients at early stage of the disease taking zzso medication were recruited and underwent two zzso sessions while performing the zzso one session while taking their normal dose of medication and the other following overnight zzso medication zzso We found that L-dopa medication helped restoring a normal pattern of activity when matching and not planning was required, by increasing cortical activity in the zzso zzso This effect was even stronger in the motor loop, zzso when the zzso was required for controls, when matching following negative zzso However, the medication did not change the pattern of activity in conditions relying primarily on a cognitive loop, zzso when the zzso nucleus was zzso 

These studies provide explanation at the neural level regarding the relatively poor effects of zzso on the cognitive deficits observed in zzso
