The purpose of this study was to determine whether a distinction could be made between benign and zzso urinary zzso in moderately zzso images obtained with the zzso fast zzso zzso zzso zzso in 39 patients with urinary obstruction were evaluated with the zzso fast zzso zzso technique with an effective TE of zzso zzso and without fat zzso zzso and zzso zzso were compared for the presence of zzso wall zzso and a signal intensity relative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso significant differences were found between benign and zzso zzso in both zzso change zzso and signal intensity of the zzso at the obstruction position zzso The combination of wall zzso and increased signal intensity as a predictor of zzso disease yielded a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso Neither increased signal intensity nor wall zzso as a predictor of benign disease yielded a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso The moderately zzso zzso technique without fat zzso can accurately distinguish between benign and zzso urinary zzso
