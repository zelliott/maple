zzso the neural basis of zzso disorders, such as zzso spectrum disorders zzso requires studying functional connectivity during childhood when cognitive skills zzso A functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging zzso analysis was performed on data collected during zzso task performance from 24 children ages 8-12 years (12 with zzso 12 controls matched on age and intellectual zzso We investigated the connectivity of the left and right inferior frontal zzso zzso BA zzso key regions for response zzso with other active regions in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Groups did not differ on behavioral measures or functional connectivity of either IFC zzso A trend for reduced connectivity in the right IFC for the zzso group was revealed when controlling for zzso In the zzso group, there was a significant negative correlation between age and 2 right IFC correlation zzso right zzso zzso motor area zzso 6) and right zzso zzso Compared with typical controls, children with zzso may not have gross differences in IFC functional connectivity during response zzso which contrasts with an adult study of zzso that reported reduced functional zzso This zzso suggests an zzso zzso trajectory in zzso for right IFC connectivity with other neural regions supporting response zzso
