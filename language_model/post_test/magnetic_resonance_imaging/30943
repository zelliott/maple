The results of zzso radiation therapy of zzso zzso are disappointing, with mean survival time zzso of zzso weeks and zzso survival rates ranging from zzso to zzso in the zzso A slightly more zzso prognosis is found in the following zzso in zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso in younger patients with respect to the more zzso the longer the duration of symptoms before zzso and in the event in which surgery has been zzso zzso An improvement in treatment outcome is foreseeable with the use of advanced volume definition techniques for radiation zzso 

Our experience with conventional radiation treatment shows therapeutic results in agreement with other zzso In the overall zzso cases zzso was 50 weeks and the zzso survival rate was zzso In patients affected by zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso survival rate was zzso whereas the figures for zzso zzso were 47 weeks and zzso zzso not statistically zzso probably due to the small number of zzso Patients of sixty years of age or less showed a more statistically zzso zzso zzso was 59 weeks and zzso survival rate was zzso compared with 44 weeks and zzso in patients above 60 years of age zzso The duration of symptoms of 6 months or less had a less zzso prognosis with respect to symptom onset of greater than 6 zzso in the former zzso was 49 weeks and zzso survival was zzso and in the latter the figures were 68 weeks and zzso zzso Lastly, the presence of residual zzso tissue after surgery is an zzso zzso in this case zzso was 41 weeks and zzso survival was zzso compared with 68 weeks and zzso zzso after zzso radical zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is still today an indispensable technique for radiation therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, nonetheless, provides greater definition of the zzso zzso The possibility of combining CT and MR zzso data together with zzso zzso techniques enables the optimal development of the three-dimensional treatment zzso This translates into high dose delivery to the zzso volumes without affecting the regions of the brain with no zzso zzso Furthermore, a real improvement in the prognosis of zzso zzso must also consider the results from research in the fields of zzso biology and functional zzso
