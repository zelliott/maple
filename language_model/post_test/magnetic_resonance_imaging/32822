In a zzso difference learning approach of classical zzso a theoretical error signal shifts from outcome zzso to the onset of the zzso zzso zzso of an expected outcome results in a negative prediction error zzso which is the initial step towards successful extinction and may therefore be relevant for fear extinction zzso As studies in zzso have observed a zzso relationship between fear extinction and rapid eye movement zzso sleep, we aimed to test the hypothesis that zzso sleep deprivation zzso recall of fear extinction through prediction error signaling in zzso In a three-day design with zzso controlled zzso sleep zzso 18 young, healthy subjects performed a fear zzso extinction and recall of extinction task with visual zzso and mild electrical shocks during combined functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and skin zzso response zzso zzso Compared to the control group, the zzso sleep deprivation group had increased zzso scores to a previously extinguished stimulus at early recall of extinction trials, which was associated with an altered zzso zzso in the left middle zzso zzso zzso contrasts corrected for measures of zzso sleep zzso also revealed zzso differences primarily in the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate altered prediction error signaling during recall of fear extinction after zzso sleep zzso which may further our understanding of anxiety disorders in which disturbed sleep and impaired fear extinction learning zzso Moreover, our findings are indicative of zzso sleep related plasticity in regions that also show an increase in activity during zzso zzso
