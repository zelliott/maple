zzso cerebral zzso may contribute to the development of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative zzso Little is known on cerebral zzso in the general population, as most measurement techniques are too invasive for application in large groups of healthy zzso Total cerebral blood flow zzso can be zzso measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso but is highly correlated with brain zzso We calculated total brain zzso by dividing zzso by brain volume, and we investigated zzso of total brain zzso in comparison with zzso zzso we studied whether persons with a low zzso or low total brain zzso have a larger volume of white matter zzso zzso This study is based on zzso persons aged 60 to 91 years from the Rotterdam zzso a zzso cohort zzso We performed two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Brain volume and zzso volume were zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed by interview and physical zzso We assessed associations between cardiovascular zzso and flow measures with linear zzso models, adjusted for age and zzso zzso between zzso or total brain zzso and zzso volume were assessed using general linear zzso We found that zzso of zzso and total brain zzso differed largely due to the large influence of brain volume on zzso zzso zzso with low total brain zzso had a significantly larger zzso volume compared with those with high total brain zzso Prospective studies are required to unravel whether zzso contributes to zzso formation or that tissue damage, zzso by zzso leads to brain zzso
