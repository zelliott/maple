To evaluate the relationship of memory decline that accompanies aging with structural changes in the zzso zzso zzso in healthy middle-aged and older zzso 

A sample of 35 zzso zzso subjects, between 55 and 70 years of age, were examined in a zzso follow-up zzso zzso investigation included tests of learning, verbal memory, and visual zzso zzso was performed with a zzso zzso system operating at zzso zzso using zzso slices of zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso was rated separately in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We did not find any statistically significant relationship between mild zzso or zzso zzso and memory test zzso Nor did the zzso decline in memory show a relationship with zzso lobe zzso 

The main outcome of our study was that age-related memory decline was not related to mild zzso lobe zzso in healthy subjects without mild cognitive zzso There could be other factors influencing memory functions besides age-related structural changes in zzso zzso
