The goal of this study was to compare MR imaging with zzso in evaluating triangular zzso zzso zzso 

The results of 178 MR imaging examinations of the wrist were independently reviewed by two musculoskeletal zzso who were unaware of the the clinical history, including any subsequent zzso One hundred zzso of these studies were obtained from symptomatic zzso Of these patients, 56 underwent zzso evaluation of the zzso The remaining 29 studies were obtained from control volunteers and duplicate cases to reduce zzso The data were divided into categories based on zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso and accuracy were calculated for each zzso 

Of the 56 patients who underwent zzso evaluation of the zzso 27 had zzso that were intact at zzso Also, 27 complete zzso and two partial defects were found at zzso zzso for detecting central degenerative zzso was zzso for both observers I and zzso zzso for detecting zzso zzso tears was zzso and zzso for observers I and II, zzso zzso for detecting zzso zzso was zzso and 50% for observers I and II, zzso 

MR imaging is accurate in revealing zzso zzso
