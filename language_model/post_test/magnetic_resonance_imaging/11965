A novel technique is proposed to facilitate the selective imaging of specific molecules from a zzso The application of the technique presented here demonstrates the ability to selectively produce zzso MR images of either zzso acid or the zzso emulsion zzso zzso when both molecules are present zzso Selective detection is based on the presence of zzso zzso in one zzso and differential zzso relaxation time zzso zzso an zzso system, is subject to zzso zzso which produces a zzso signal from the zzso components of the zzso zzso when an echo time zzso zzso zzso is used in a zzso zzso At this echo time the second zzso in this example zzso acid, a zzso spin system, is selectively zzso At longer echo times, zzso TE zzso zzso there is substantial recovery of the zzso zzso which may be solely observed due to zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso The method is demonstrated both using zzso and in zzso
