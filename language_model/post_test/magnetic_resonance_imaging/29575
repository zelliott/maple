We investigated the relation between zzso and zzso measures of brain activity through comparison of zzso recorded zzso local field zzso zzso and zzso level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso We manipulated the duration of visual zzso stimuli across trials and measured zzso changes in zzso and zzso activity in three brain zzso zzso cortex, the zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso were recorded from patients who had zzso zzso zzso as part of zzso testing, while zzso responses were measured in similar brain regions in a second set of zzso Similar zzso responses were measured in zzso and zzso regions, with both showing zzso but zzso increases in zzso zzso with stimulus zzso In sharp contrast, very different zzso responses were observed in these same regions, such that zzso zzso exhibited onset zzso sustained activity over the course of stimulus duration and prominent offset zzso while zzso zzso only exhibited onset zzso that did not vary with stimulus zzso No zzso zzso or zzso changes were observed in zzso Additional analyses revealed no consistent changes in the zzso spectrum across different brain sites that correlated with zzso changes in the zzso zzso We conclude that the relation between zzso and zzso differs across brain zzso
