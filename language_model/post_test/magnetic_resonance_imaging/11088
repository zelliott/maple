Six participants with chronic zzso secondary to zzso zzso stroke within the middle cerebral artery zzso distribution of the left zzso and six zzso intact controls of similar age were given a running recognition memory task for words while the magnetic flux normal to the scalp surface was measured with a zzso zzso This task had been previously shown to be valid for the zzso and zzso of brain activity specific to receptive language zzso As expected, patients exhibited relatively decreased zzso in areas known to be involved in receptive language function, including superior zzso zzso zzso in the left hemisphere, as well as increased zzso of areas outside of the left zzso that might potentially support language zzso zzso zzso within left zzso was associated with a reduction in receptive language in patients, as was increased zzso outside of left zzso zzso support hypotheses suggesting that zzso areas outside zzso language areas may assume receptive language function after zzso secondary to stroke, but that better recovery occurs when putative zzso language areas are able to zzso
