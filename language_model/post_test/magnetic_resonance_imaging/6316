The zzso water coordination number for zzso and zzso zzso with five zzso zzso in which one or two terminal zzso groups are zzso as zzso zzso or zzso zzso have been studied using zzso lifetime and nuclear magnetic relaxation zzso zzso zzso Both methods show that the water coordination number does not increase above that observed for the analogous zzso zzso The zzso lifetime results indicate that all five zzso complexes have one zzso water zzso at 25 degrees zzso The zzso profiles for three of the zzso complexes at 25 degrees C are also consistent with one zzso water zzso whereas two complexes have profiles consistent only with a mixture of complexes, 50% containing a single water zzso and 50% with zzso zzso the temperature alters the population of these species such that all five zzso complexes have significantly less bound water on average at 5 degrees zzso These results explain the anomalous temperature zzso of the zzso zzso reported previously for the zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso systems have a zzso coordination sphere zzso the amount of zzso coordinated water varies from near zero at 5 degrees C to a high of two near 37 degrees zzso
