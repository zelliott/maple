In this prospective study, we evaluated the efficiency of zzso minimal invasive surgical zzso of zzso zzso of the long zzso 

Fourteen patients (11 zzso 3 zzso mean age 13 years; range 4 to 22 zzso with zzso zzso of the long bones underwent zzso minimal invasive zzso extended zzso zzso all the patients were evaluated by plain zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of the zzso was determined by zzso on zzso zzso zzso CT scans and MR images and complete zzso of the zzso was performed by zzso minimal invasive zzso All the patients were evaluated by visual analog scale or faces pain scale to determine pain levels before and after zzso The mean follow-up period was 17 months zzso 13 to 31 zzso 

The mean visual analog scale scores were zzso zzso zzso and zzso (no zzso before and after surgery, respectively zzso Bone zzso or internal fixation were not required during zzso No zzso or zzso complications or zzso were zzso Early zzso was possible in all the zzso At the final zzso all the patients were zzso and had full functional use of their operated zzso 

zzso minimal invasive surgery is effective in the local control of zzso zzso affecting the long bones and causes less zzso This technique also provides a good identification of the zzso zzso
