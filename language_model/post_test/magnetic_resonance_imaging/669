This article addresses the impact that colored noise, zzso zzso and zzso zzso have on the zzso analysis zzso Specifically, it is shown why the detection of zzso designs benefit more from zzso than blocked designs in a colored noise zzso Both theoretical and empirical results are zzso Furthermore, a novel exploratory method for producing drift models that efficiently capture trends and drifts in the zzso data is zzso A comparison to currently employed zzso approaches is zzso It is shown that the novel exploratory model is able to remove a major part of the slowly varying drifts that are abundant in zzso zzso The value of such a model lies in its ability to remove drift components that otherwise would have contributed to a colored noise structure in the zzso time zzso
