To evaluate the use of dynamic zzso zzso acid zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso for assessing zzso with markedly zzso zzso systems and impaired zzso 

Eight children zzso age 30 months, zzso 25) were zzso diagnosed as having gross unilateral zzso with a mean zzso zzso zzso pelvic diameter of 36 zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso Dynamic zzso was performed after the patients were zzso with intravenous fluid and zzso and comprised a dynamic zzso sequence after zzso zzso zzso body zzso was zzso with a zzso curve of each kidney zzso zzso was diagnosed by a clearly declining zzso curve and direct zzso of contrast medium within the zzso in several zzso zzso or complete obstruction was diagnosed when drainage of contrast medium could not be zzso zzso results were compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the same zzso zzso units detected by zzso were treated conservatively with a close follow-up by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso showed drainage in three zzso units and poor zzso in zzso in contrast, zzso showed drainage in seven zzso systems (three showed poor zzso by zzso and obstruction in the remaining zzso The zzso units detected by zzso under conservative treatment thus showed no further deterioration of zzso function or progressive zzso in the subsequent follow-up zzso 18 months, range zzso 

These preliminary results suggest that dynamic zzso is a useful zzso imaging method in distinguishing zzso from zzso zzso systems, particularly in patients with zzso and reduced zzso zzso
