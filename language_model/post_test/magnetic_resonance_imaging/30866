We present a general zzso zzso scheme for functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data and compare it to zzso zzso the traditional zzso method used in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso routines were adapted to two-dimensional zzso images, and applied to zzso zzso zzso To test the effect of these methods on the zzso ratio zzso we compared the zzso of zzso zzso images before and after zzso using both zzso smoothing and zzso zzso We simulated a zzso series with a time signal in an active spot, and tested the methods on noisy copies of zzso The zzso methods were evaluated in two ways: by the average zzso zzso inside the original activated spot, and by the shape of the spot detected by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso methods that introduce much zzso are better suited for low zzso but for images of reasonable quality they are not zzso because they introduce heavy zzso zzso zzso methods that introduce less smoothing preserve the sharpness of the images and retain the original shapes of active zzso We also performed statistical zzso mapping on the zzso simulated time series, as well as on a real zzso data zzso False discovery rate control was used to correct for multiple zzso The results show that the methods that produce smooth images introduce more false zzso The less smoothing zzso methods, although generating more false zzso produce a smaller total number of errors than zzso smoothing or zzso methods with a large smoothing zzso
