The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to form zzso between a deep zzso copper cluster of the type zzso zzso and molecules with biological activity such as zzso and zzso A complex containing zzso bovine serum zzso and the copper cluster displayed activity toward affinity columns of zzso on zzso and the zzso zzso was immobilized on the zzso This interaction was completely blocked in gels which had been zzso with zzso zzso zzso The free and biologically active versions of the cluster have some potential for biomedical zzso For example, the short-lived zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso may be carried in the zzso zzso The cluster is zzso but it is a relatively weak zzso of water zzso zzso zzso Other members of this structural group of zzso compounds may have better magnetic properties, and the zzso reaction with zzso appears to be generally zzso to the zzso
