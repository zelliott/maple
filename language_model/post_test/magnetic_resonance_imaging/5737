Financial advice from experts is commonly sought during times of zzso While the field of zzso has made considerable progress in understanding the zzso basis of risky decision-making, the neural mechanisms through which external information, such as advice, is integrated during decision-making are poorly zzso In the current experiment, we investigated the zzso basis of the influence of expert advice on financial decisions under zzso 

While undergoing zzso zzso participants made a series of financial choices between a certain payment and a zzso Choices were made in two conditions: 1) advice from a financial expert about which choice to make was displayed zzso zzso and 2) no advice was displayed zzso zzso zzso results showed a significant effect of expert zzso Specifically, probability weighting functions changed in the direction of the zzso zzso This was paralleled by neural zzso zzso Brain zzso showing significant correlations with valuation zzso zzso by value of zzso zzso were obtained in the absence of the zzso advice zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso inferior frontal zzso and middle zzso zzso zzso no significant correlations with value were obtained in the presence of advice zzso These findings were zzso by region of interest zzso zzso zzso of probability weighting functions showed significant zzso in the zzso compared to the zzso condition in regions associated with probability zzso including anterior zzso cortex, zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso Finally, during the zzso condition, significant zzso in zzso junction and zzso zzso were zzso 

These results support the hypothesis that one effect of expert advice is to zzso the calculation of value of decision options from the zzso zzso
