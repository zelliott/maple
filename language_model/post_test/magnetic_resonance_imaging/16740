No direct proof has been brought to light in a link between hypoxic changes in zzso models and the effects of zzso zzso Here, we assessed the sensitivity of the detection of zzso through the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to the evolution of the tumor and its zzso 

zzso zzso tumors were induced in rats after zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso was administered from day zzso 17 to zzso At zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed to characterize tumor growth and zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso 

We showed that brain hypoxic volumes are related to zzso volume and its zzso and that an zzso treatment, leading to an increase in cerebral blood volume and a decrease in vessel zzso is accompanied by a decrease in the degree of zzso 

We propose that zzso PET and zzso magnetic resonance imaging are pertinent complementary tools in the evaluation of the effects of an zzso treatment in zzso
