zzso zzso of zzso MR imaging data sets was used to zzso the position of zzso strip and grid zzso relative to the underlying cerebral zzso in patients with zzso who were undergoing invasive zzso zzso The zzso of the cortical surface was delineated zzso and topographical relationships among surface zzso cortical zzso and zzso zzso were investigated by using serial convex planes parallel to the cortical zzso zzso contacts could be marked and their positions projected to underlying areas at different zzso This method is apt for routine purposes and allows zzso positions to be displayed with respect to cortical and zzso regions of zzso
