To determine the clinical efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the treatment of patients with zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive case series to assess the ability of PET to zzso identify zzso previously demonstrated on CT or zzso zzso characterize the zzso activity of these zzso and zzso determine the presence of metabolically active zzso elsewhere in the zzso 

zzso patients with suspected zzso zzso ages 32 to 78 years, underwent PET in addition to CT and/or zzso Sixteen of 18 also underwent zzso zzso zzso diagnosis included zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso were seen on conventional zzso Overall, zzso of zzso zzso were demonstrated on zzso including zzso of tumors that were zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5) of other zzso PET was useful in ruling out tumor recurrence after zzso in 2 zzso 

In this small clinical series, PET proved effective in demonstrating zzso zzso zzso This series is too small to study any correlation between zzso aggressiveness and PET findings in zzso zzso
