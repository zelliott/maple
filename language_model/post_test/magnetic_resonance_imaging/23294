The cognitive impairment in individuals with schizophrenia includes deficits of working memory in zzso prefrontal zzso and deficits of performance monitoring in zzso prefrontal zzso zzso Recent work suggests a more general role for zzso in predicting the outcome of actions and then evaluating those zzso Here we zzso in individuals with zzso two specific effects associated with this zzso the error likelihood effect zzso on trials with correct performance, but features that predict a high probability of zzso and the error zzso effect zzso on trials with an error, but features that predict errors are of low zzso In a rapid zzso zzso design with a modified version of the zzso task, a cue zzso predicting error likelihood was zzso into working memory by participants in order to perform a secondary delayed zzso zzso There were four key findings: zzso individuals with schizophrenia exhibited poorer working memory performance and reduced error signals in zzso zzso even in control and schizophrenia zzso matched on working memory performance, the schizophrenia zzso showed a deficit in zzso prediction in zzso at the time of the zzso zzso zzso the schizophrenia zzso also showed a deficit in zzso zzso activity when errors were zzso and zzso a mediation analysis indicated that zzso predictions successfully explained zzso evaluations in both controls and zzso zzso these findings suggest that individuals with schizophrenia have a zzso in the evaluation of outcomes that is the result of a primary deficit in the prediction of error likelihood in zzso
