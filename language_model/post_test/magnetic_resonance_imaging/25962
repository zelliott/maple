The zzso displacement artifact zzso the accuracy of MR zzso zzso This study proposes a post processing method for correction of this zzso zzso zzso were performed in a flow phantom containing a zzso zzso zzso were obtained from zzso parallel to the frequency, phase, and slice directions, zzso The zzso displacement artifact was most prominent when the frequency zzso direction was aligned with the flow zzso After zzso zzso assignment improved and a more accurate description of the flow was zzso In zzso zzso were performed in the zzso in a patient with a repaired zzso zzso The correction method was applied to zzso data along a streamline parallel to the frequency zzso zzso The result after correction was a new location of the peak zzso and improved estimates of the zzso zzso
