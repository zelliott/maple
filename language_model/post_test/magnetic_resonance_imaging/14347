Using a simple image analysis system, we have established zzso data obtained from magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans for the relative size and growth of the major structural zzso of the zzso zzso scans of the head were analyzed in 95 subjects aged 0 to 20 zzso Only scans with no zzso structural abnormalities of the brain were zzso zzso changes in the relative growth of specific structures were calculated by dividing patients into zzso age zzso No age-related changes were found in the size of the zzso zzso zzso zzso space, or zzso magna relative to the total zzso vault zzso A significant zzso less than zzso increase in the size of the corpus zzso relative to that of the zzso structures and relative to the total zzso vault space was noted to occur between the 6- to 10-year-old and zzso to 15-year-old age zzso This may reflect an increase in zzso of the corpus zzso that occurs during this zzso A small reduction in the ratio of the zzso zzso to the zzso space was found between the zzso to 5-year-old and the 6- to 10-year-old age groups, but the biological significance of this difference is zzso It appears from these data that quantitative analysis of zzso scans can be used to draw objective conclusions about the relative sizes and growth of the major brain zzso The development of zzso data for these structures and the simplicity of the methodology should have many clinical applications in the assessment of zzso brain zzso
