Dedicated linear accelerator zzso zzso has become an important treatment for zzso zzso zzso Although the use of gamma knife continues to be established, few large series exist using zzso The authors describe their results, comparing the effects of varied target and dose zzso 

Between August 1995 and January 2008, 179 patients were treated with zzso zzso Ten patients zzso had no clinical zzso The median age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso A total of 39 patients had secondary or zzso pain, and 130 had idiopathic zzso Initially, 28 patients received doses between 70 and 85 zzso with the zzso zzso line zzso touching the zzso Then, using 90 zzso 82 consecutive patients were treated with a zzso zzso and 59 patients with a 50% zzso zzso to the zzso 

Of 169 patients, zzso zzso experienced significant relief at a mean of zzso months zzso zzso zzso Average time to relief was zzso months zzso immediate to 6 zzso A total of 31 patients zzso had zzso pain at zzso zzso Of 87 patients with idiopathic zzso without prior procedures, 79 zzso had initial zzso Among 28 patients treated with 70 zzso and zzso zzso 18 patients zzso had significant relief, and 10 zzso had zzso Of the patients with 90 zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso 59 zzso had significant relief and zzso had zzso Among 59 consecutive patients with similar dose but the 50% zzso at the zzso 49 patients zzso had zzso zzso zzso averaging zzso on a zzso scale of 1 to 5, was experienced by zzso of the patients, 

Increased radiation dose and volume of zzso zzso may improve clinical outcomes with the zzso of zzso zzso Further study of the implications of dose and target are needed to zzso outcomes and to minimize zzso
