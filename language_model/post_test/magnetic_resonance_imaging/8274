The zzso zzso zzso factor gene is required for development of the zzso and zzso in zzso Human zzso gene zzso have been reported in five subjects with a zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso abnormal zzso zzso and limited neck zzso 

The objective of the study was to determine the frequency and nature of zzso zzso in patients with isolated zzso zzso or combined zzso hormone zzso zzso and characterize the molecular consequences of zzso 

The zzso sequence was zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso proteins resulting from observed zzso were characterized using reporter gene and DNA binding zzso 

The study included zzso patients with isolated zzso zzso or zzso 

In seven patients with zzso from four zzso zzso four novel, zzso zzso were zzso a deletion of the entire gene zzso zzso causing truncated proteins zzso zzso and a zzso causing a substitution in the zzso zzso The zzso were associated with diminished DNA binding and zzso gene zzso consistent with observed hormone zzso Whereas subjects with zzso zzso and zzso zzso had limited neck zzso patients with the zzso zzso did zzso 

zzso zzso are a rare cause of zzso involving deficiencies for zzso zzso zzso and zzso in all zzso Whereas most patients have a severe hormone zzso zzso after birth, milder forms can be observed, and limited neck rotation is not a universal feature of patients with zzso zzso This study extends the known molecular defects and range of zzso found in zzso zzso
