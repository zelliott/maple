zzso zzso first described in animal models of left zzso zzso stress and injury, occurs progressively in zzso patients after large zzso zzso and in those with zzso forms of zzso The gross zzso changes of increased zzso volume and zzso in the normal elliptical zzso chamber zzso is driven, on a zzso level, by zzso zzso and zzso and by increased zzso zzso Each of the techniques used for tracking this zzso zzso zzso and cardiac magnetic zzso advantages and zzso Numerous investigations have demonstrated the value of zzso volume measurement at a single zzso and over time in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure and in those after zzso zzso The structural pattern of zzso zzso and evidence of zzso on cardiac magnetic resonance have additional zzso zzso Beyond the impact of abnormal cardiac structure on cardiovascular events, the relationship between zzso zzso and clinical outcomes is likely linked through common local and systemic factors driving vascular as well as zzso zzso As demonstrated by a recent zzso of heart failure trials, zzso volume stands out among surrogate markers as strongly zzso with the impact of a particular drug or device therapy on patient zzso These findings substantiate the importance of zzso zzso as central in the zzso of advancing heart failure and support the role of measures of zzso zzso in the clinical investigation of novel heart failure zzso
