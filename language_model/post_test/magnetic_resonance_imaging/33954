We examined a patient who was clinically much better at reporting tactile stimulation when he could see his zzso zzso zzso we found that he had difficulty detecting taps accompanied by a salient (but not zzso light located directly above his concealed zzso However, his performance was dramatically improved if the light was attached to a rubber hand situated in line with the patient's hidden zzso Previous studies have suggested that tactile sensitivity can be improved by nearby visual zzso However, our effect shows that zzso sensory zzso does not only depend upon simple spatial proximity zzso Rather, a simultaneous visual event dramatically improves perception of touch specifically when it is attributed to the zzso zzso zzso
