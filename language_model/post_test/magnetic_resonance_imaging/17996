We investigated the relationship between individual differences in acute fatigue and zzso cortisol changes zzso by the sustained performance of cognitively demanding tasks zzso zzso Healthy males provided zzso cortisol zzso and zzso fatigue ratings, and were scanned zzso magnetic resonance zzso during memory zzso and recognition tasks in fatigue and control zzso A group of 15 zzso showed significantly higher cortisol levels in the fatigue condition than 12 zzso zzso showed higher zzso fatigue and reduced zzso and recognition zzso than zzso in the fatigue zzso An interaction in zzso changes in the right zzso during zzso reflected decreased zzso in responders, but somewhat increased zzso in zzso in the fatigue compared to control zzso Moreover, decreased zzso zzso in zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso are consistent with a central role for the zzso in differences between zzso and zzso and also zzso the right zzso in individual differences in induced cognitive fatigue zzso
