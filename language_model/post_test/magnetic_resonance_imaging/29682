This investigation compared patterns of regional cerebral blood flow zzso during exercise recovery both with and without zzso zzso zzso Eight subjects were studied on 3 days with randomly assigned conditions: 1) after 30 zzso of zzso 2) after 30 zzso of moderate exercise zzso at zzso heart rate zzso reserve during zzso and 3) after 30 zzso of light exercise zzso at zzso zzso reserve with no zzso Data were collected for HR, mean blood pressure zzso and ratings of perceived exertion and relaxation, and zzso was assessed by use of zzso zzso zzso With the use of zzso across conditions, there were differences zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso from rest during exercise recovery from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso -9 zzso 2 zzso but not from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso After zzso there were decreases zzso zzso zzso for the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso right and left inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso right inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso and left inferior anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso not observed after zzso There were zzso decreases for leg zzso regions after both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the left superior anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Data show that there are zzso reductions within specific regions of the insular zzso and anterior zzso zzso coupled with a zzso zzso response after zzso zzso suggest that these cerebral cortical regions, previously implicated in cardiovascular regulation during exercise, may also be involved in zzso
