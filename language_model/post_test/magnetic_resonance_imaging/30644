To zzso normal, in zzso zzso knee joint zzso in multiple weight bearing positions using zzso high-resolution zzso and discuss the potential of developing future zzso methods to assess patients with abnormal joint zzso 

Ten volunteers with clinically normal knees pushed zzso on the zzso of a weight bearing apparatus inside the MR zzso The volunteers held the weight zzso N) for five scans as the knee motion was evaluated from 0 degrees to 60 degrees of zzso Full extension was set as the zero point for all measured zzso Using zzso zzso zzso motion relative to the zzso and zzso angle was measured as zzso angle, zzso zzso zzso translation, and zzso zzso zzso and lateral compartment zzso contact areas were examined and zzso of the contract areas were zzso 

zzso internal rotation averaged zzso degrees at 40 degrees of zzso and then zzso zzso zzso increased by 8 degrees at 60 degrees of zzso zzso roll back also increased to zzso zzso average at 60 degrees of zzso while the zzso translated zzso zzso zzso zzso compartment zzso contact area started at 374 zzso and decreased to 308 zzso with zzso of 60 degrees, while lateral compartment contact area did not change significantly from 276 zzso 

zzso correlate with previous studies of knee zzso while providing greater three-dimensional zzso MR imaging allows excellent zzso evaluation of knee joint zzso with weight zzso This tool may potentially be used for assessing knee zzso in patients with knee zzso
