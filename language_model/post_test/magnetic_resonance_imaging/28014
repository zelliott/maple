The zzso of 8 healthy and informed volunteers were studied with a zzso MR unit at zzso T together with those of 10 patients with zzso zzso zzso The study was performed with round surface coils zzso and with zzso zzso coils in the anterior zzso Slices were 5 zzso thick, and acquired on the zzso zzso and zzso planes, with zzso zzso scans were repeated in the same locations with double zzso with zzso and zzso Five patients underwent additional scans after zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso was examined with zzso surface zzso on similar scanning planes and with similar pulse sequences to those described zzso the zzso was removed, investigated with zzso technique, and subsequently analyzed with thin CT slices and a high-resolution reconstruction zzso for the study of zzso zzso zzso anatomical sections were then compared with MR and CT scans, and the anatomical structures were recognized on the zzso MR scans of a zzso zzso Besides MR anatomy of supporting zzso structures, the authors describe in detail the muscles, zzso spaces and cavities which can be identified on the various planes, together with the changes in signal after zzso
