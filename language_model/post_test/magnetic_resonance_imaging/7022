zzso methods for hypothesis testing are described and their potential for zzso mapping of human functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data is zzso In this approach, we zzso convergence between methods of zzso zzso or shrinkage and the problem of hypothesis testing in both classical and zzso zzso Specifically, our interest will be focused on the zzso between type I probability error control and power zzso estimated by the area under the zzso zzso We describe a technique for controlling the false discovery rate at an arbitrary level of error in testing multiple zzso zzso generated by a zzso discrete zzso transform zzso of spatial maps of zzso time series zzso We also describe and apply zzso detection with zzso hypothesis testing methods that can be used to define a threshold unique to each level and orientation of the zzso and zzso methods, incorporating a formal model for the anticipated zzso of zzso zzso representing the signal or true zzso The sensitivity and type I error control of these zzso are comparatively evaluated by analysis of zzso images zzso with the subject at zzso and an experimental data set acquired from five normal volunteers during an zzso finger movement zzso We show that all three zzso zzso have good type I error control (the zzso method being most zzso and generate plausible brain zzso maps (the zzso method being most zzso We also zzso the formal connection between zzso methods for simultaneous zzso zzso testing and methods based on zzso zzso smoothing followed by statistical testing of brain zzso zzso
