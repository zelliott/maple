To investigate the image findings of zzso duct injury after zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

During the past 3 years, zzso patients with different zzso zzso had undergone a total of zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso developed zzso duct injuries from 3 weeks to 3 months after zzso All of the 18 patients received follow-up CT and zzso 14 zzso and 15 digital subtract zzso zzso The image data was zzso zzso with the potential zzso factors correlated to zzso zzso duct zzso 

zzso zzso duct injuries developed in 13 of 148 patients with liver zzso zzso 5 of zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso On image examination, focal peripheral zzso zzso duct zzso was detected in 4 cases, multiple zzso duct zzso with zzso or zzso distribution in 8, and a large zzso zzso zzso or zzso in 6 cases, and progressive zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso in 6 patients in whom the zzso zzso injury developed at different intervals after zzso The zzso of zzso duct injury was higher in zzso patients with zzso liver zzso than in patients with zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and it was also higher in patients using an emulsion of zzso or zzso than in patients using other zzso agents zzso zzso zzso The zzso was higher either in patients with zzso zzso than in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso including focal and multiple zzso zzso duct zzso and zzso zzso or zzso may develop and can be detected during the follow-up examination imaging in patients with zzso zzso after zzso zzso liver and intact function, due to the lack of zzso collateral zzso are the significant zzso factors to the development of zzso zzso duct zzso
