The expanding use of zzso in large-scale zzso studies of zzso outcomes has led to increasing concern for the consistent handling of incidental zzso Our purpose is to identify the prevalence of incidental zzso abnormalities in an adult population with past occupational exposure to lead who underwent brain zzso as part of a large, zzso cohort zzso 

zzso MR images obtained for the research study were reviewed by a zzso on an ongoing basis for findings of clinical zzso The subjects were recruited as part of a zzso research study designed to examine the effects of past lead exposure on zzso zzso The cohort examined consisted of zzso men who previously worked at an zzso manufacturing facility and had a wide range of lead exposure zzso and zzso MR images were also reviewed from 67 zzso control subjects from the same study who had no history of occupational lead zzso 

zzso findings were detected in zzso zzso of research zzso Of the zzso subjects with zzso zzso zzso required no zzso 51% zzso required routine zzso zzso zzso required urgent zzso and zzso zzso required immediate zzso zzso findings of all categories were observed in a larger percentage of older subjects, aged 60 years and zzso Using multivariable zzso zzso analysis, we found that age zzso zzso zzso but not lead history, was associated with an increased risk of incidental zzso zzso 

In the population zzso there was a high prevalence of incidental brain and head and neck zzso Of particular concern were the serious health problems observed requiring urgent or immediate referral in zzso of the zzso These findings underscore the need for zzso to evaluate the zzso images generated by research studies, particularly those with an older population zzso
