zzso zzso direct current stimulation zzso can reduce zzso of zzso in primary motor zzso zzso and may facilitate motor recovery after zzso However, little is known about the zzso effects of zzso on zzso upper limb zzso We hypothesized that suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso would produce zzso effects that depended on the severity of upper limb zzso Twelve patients with varying upper limb impairment after zzso stroke were assessed on clinical scales of upper limb zzso zzso and zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to determine zzso size and fractional zzso zzso within the zzso limbs of the internal capsules indicative of zzso tract zzso zzso within zzso zzso biceps zzso representation was determined from zzso zzso during selective zzso tasks, after zzso sham stimulation and after zzso These zzso data indicate that zzso improved selective zzso upper limb control for mildly impaired patients and worsened it for moderate to severely impaired zzso The direction of the zzso after effects of zzso was strongly related to upper limb zzso zzso function, and zzso asymmetry between the zzso limbs of the internal zzso These results indicate systematic variation of zzso for zzso upper limb control after stroke and that suppression of zzso zzso is not a zzso size fits zzso zzso
