zzso zzso is an uncommon zzso pain syndrome that is occasionally associated with cardiac zzso However, we relate zzso I syndrome as a cause of this clinical picture for the first time in the zzso The authors analyze the relevant literature and discuss the zzso and treatment of associated zzso We describe the case of a 45-year-old female patient who presented with a zzso history of left zzso zzso with occasional zzso and episodes of zzso when eating or zzso The pain was not zzso to the right side and was fairly well controlled by zzso The zzso attacks had a duration of about 10 zzso Neurological examination zzso a faint zzso associated with paradoxical zzso The zzso magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a bilateral zzso of the zzso zzso through the zzso zzso more evidently on the left zzso The patient received a zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso arch of zzso The zzso mater was opened, and we found both zzso displaced into the zzso zzso extending zzso toward the C1 zzso Both zzso were zzso the zzso and especially the low zzso nerves zzso The lower zzso nerves were compressed between the zzso inferior zzso artery zzso and the zzso zzso zzso on both zzso Both zzso were dissected by zzso technique and all the zzso zzso were zzso The left zzso was zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso was performed with the zzso zzso The zzso pain attacks and the zzso picture disappeared immediately after the zzso The patient was discharged on the 7th zzso zzso One year later, she was free of zzso This case provides clinical evidence of close connections between the zzso and zzso nerves, which control visceral sensation; and zzso of the IX and X nerves between the zzso zzso and zzso or zzso artery may cause an zzso sensory phenomenon, which is the origin of the zzso sensation and the cardiac zzso by means of cross talk between the fibers of the same zzso
