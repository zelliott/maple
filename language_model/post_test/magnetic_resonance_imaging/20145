The aim of this study is to evaluate the interest of diffusion weighted zzso for the study of white matter fiber zzso 

Fifteen subjects having undergone diffusion weighted zzso have been zzso Three white matter fiber zzso have been studied for each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results were compared to an zzso of human zzso 

All the white matter tracts studied have been zzso The zzso of the three white matter tracts was similar to standard zzso The orientation of the three white matter tracts was determined in zzso of the zzso 

diffusion weighted zzso allowed the zzso study of all the analyzed white matter zzso This technique might, therefore, help to evaluate nerve fiber tracts and guide zzso zzso
