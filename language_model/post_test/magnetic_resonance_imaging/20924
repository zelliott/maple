zzso can be modulated by several cognitive techniques, typically involving increased cognitive control and decreased sensory zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that pain can also be attenuated by zzso Here, we investigate the underlying brain mechanisms by which the state of mindfulness reduces zzso zzso practitioners and controls received unpleasant electric stimuli in the functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner during a mindfulness and a control zzso zzso practitioners, but not controls, were able to reduce pain zzso by zzso and anticipatory anxiety by zzso during a mindful zzso In the brain, this reduction was associated with decreased zzso in the lateral prefrontal zzso and increased zzso in the right zzso zzso during stimulation and increased zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso during the anticipation of zzso These findings reveal a unique mechanism of pain zzso zzso increased sensory processing and decreased cognitive control, and are in sharp contrast to established pain zzso zzso
