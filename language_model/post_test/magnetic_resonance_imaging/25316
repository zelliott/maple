Corpus zzso zzso area zzso may be a clinical indicator of disease zzso but factors influencing zzso zzso in healthy subjects must be determined before comparisons can be made in zzso We sought to define a reliable and easily zzso method for zzso measurement and to examine the effects of sex, age, zzso and cerebral zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers (age range, zzso years; mean age, zzso years zzso zzso zzso 44 men, 56 zzso 87 right zzso underwent conventional MR zzso Data were zzso in the image space to account for zzso variations in head position before the zzso plane was defined by using zzso of the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total cerebral volume were measured and correlated with sex, age, and zzso 

The mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Women had a larger zzso zzso to cerebral volume zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso P zzso The percentage difference for the zzso volume from the group mean was zzso in women and zzso in zzso Only a small linear relationship of zzso with cerebral volume was noted zzso zzso zzso and zzso was not significantly correlated with age or zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the largest study of zzso area in a community-based sample of control zzso such subjects provide controls for future zzso Our findings provide zzso evidence of sex differences in zzso zzso Much zzso zzso is independent of cerebral zzso
