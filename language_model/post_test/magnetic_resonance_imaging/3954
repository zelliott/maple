The authors tested the hypothesis that zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging can be used as a supportive diagnostic tool to differentiate clinically stable brain tumors from those progressing as a result of low- to high-grade zzso transformation or zzso zzso zzso patients with cerebral zzso verified on zzso examination were studied repeatedly with zzso imaging over a period of zzso zzso At the time of each zzso imaging study, clinical examination, MR imaging, zzso zzso zzso with zzso and biopsy findings (when zzso were used to categorize each patient as having either stable or progressive zzso zzso of the percentage changes in the zzso zzso zzso imaging signal intensity between studies, which were obtained without knowledge of the clinical zzso allowed the investigators to segregate the groups with a high degree of statistical zzso All progressive cases showed a zzso signal increase between studies of more than zzso whereas all stable cases showed an zzso of less than zzso no change, or even a decreased zzso The authors conclude that increased zzso levels coincide with zzso zzso of cerebral zzso and therefore may possibly be used as a supportive indicator of progression of these zzso
