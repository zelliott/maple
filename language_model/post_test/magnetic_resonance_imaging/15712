The spatial distribution of the liquid phase in a zzso partially zzso porous glass zzso zzso has been examined with the aid of magnetic resonance zzso and field zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The correlation length of the material turned out to be long enough to permit the zzso of the microscopic zzso of the material by magnetic resonance zzso Contrasts are dominated by zzso relaxation depending on local filling degree, which in turn depends on local zzso The zzso zzso of the latter was also zzso by scanning electron zzso The effect of zzso on an effective diffusion zzso has been examined for polar zzso and zzso zzso zzso
