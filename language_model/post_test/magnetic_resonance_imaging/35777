MR imaging of the head often reveals localized areas of decreased signal intensity zzso zzso within the zzso These flow voids are caused by turbulence within the zzso resulting from its zzso back-and-forth flow through the cerebral aqueduct and zzso We describe a phantom that mimics the essential features of the zzso flow, and discuss its use in studying the dependence of the zzso flow void zzso on zzso zzso and zzso pulse sequence zzso The phantom had zzso spaces to represent zzso and channels connecting these spaces to represent the aqueduct and zzso A pump pushed the fluid in a pulsing manner through the phantom at various zzso The zzso was zzso by measuring signal loss relative to zzso zzso The zzso did not appear to depend on repetition time or inversion zzso The zzso was, however, strongly dependent on echo time zzso and for zzso zzso sequences zzso became less severe as TE zzso An zzso zzso effect was observed for zzso zzso Slice thickness and field of view also affected the appearance of the zzso as did gating with respect to the zzso zzso These results imply that zzso field of view, slice zzso and gating must be considered when using the appearance or absence of the zzso in zzso
