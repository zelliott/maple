Recently, a new zzso technique, termed zzso zzso was introduced that uses zzso blood zzso to detect cerebral blood volume zzso changes during brain zzso However, similar to other zzso methods, this technique is hampered by the fact that there is only one zzso on the relaxation curve, presently limiting its application to zzso zzso A zzso zzso method is presented that employs a series of zzso 180 degrees zzso to periodically zzso the zzso and maintain it around zero, while acquiring slices in zzso The effects of zzso transfer and signal contamination by zzso echoes are zzso Solutions to reduce the effect of zzso zzso as a function of slice number are zzso Phantom data show excellent agreement between experiments and zzso zzso zzso zzso images of visual stimulation show effective blood zzso in all slices and appropriate functional zzso in all volunteers zzso
