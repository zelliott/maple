The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate graft zzso of zzso coronary artery surgery zzso by zzso flow measurement and to compare this technique with zzso magnetic resonance flow zzso Twenty patients (13 men and 7 zzso mean age, zzso zzso 76 zzso underwent zzso coronary artery zzso zzso zzso flow measurement of zzso was performed measuring zzso zzso and mean zzso For each zzso the zzso index was calculated by dividing the difference between the maximum and the minimum flow by the mean flow In the early zzso period zzso week), magnetic resonance flow mapping was performed using phase contrast flow zzso Mean zzso flow values and mean magnetic resonance flow mapping values were zzso At the same zzso session, zzso magnetic resonance zzso was performed to evaluate graft zzso In 20 patients, a total of 49 coronary graft flows were assessed with zzso zzso flow measurement and zzso magnetic resonance flow zzso Upon comparison, there was a strong correlation between techniques, with stable and statistically significant differences between the zzso and zzso flow mapping zzso One zzso vein graft was revised zzso due to graft zzso Our data suggest that the combined use of zzso zzso flow measurement and zzso magnetic resonance flow analysis has a potential role in the assessment of graft zzso in zzso coronary artery surgery although more study is zzso
