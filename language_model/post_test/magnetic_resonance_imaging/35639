zzso is a major complication of spinal zzso zzso Currently X-ray and zzso zzso zzso are used for evaluating the spinal fusion zzso However, both imaging zzso have limitations in judgment of the early stages of this fusion process, as they only zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso could be of great value as it is able to discriminate between different types of zzso A feasibility study was performed in nine animals from a goat spinal fusion study, to evaluate the detection capacity of different zzso with zzso In this study zzso zzso acid cages were zzso zzso and zzso follow-up specimens were scanned in a zzso T zzso zzso After zzso the specimens were processed for zzso Different types of tissue as well as the zzso cage material were identified in the fusion zone and designated as regions of interest zzso zzso the location of these zzso was determined on the corresponding zzso image, and average signal zzso of every individual zzso were zzso An excellent match was seen between the zzso sections and zzso zzso The zzso images showed quantifiable differences in signal intensity between bone with zzso zzso bone with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso implant zzso In time the signal intensity of bone with zzso zzso bone with zzso red zzso and of zzso tissue remained relatively zzso On the other hand, the signal intensity of the zzso implant material and the zzso changed significantly in time, indicating change of structure and zzso In conclusion, in our model using zzso cages the zzso provides us with detailed information about the early fusion process and may therefore, allow early diagnosis of zzso
