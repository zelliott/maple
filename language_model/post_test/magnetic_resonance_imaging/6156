Image integration is used in zzso zzso zzso To maximize the efficacy of image integration, it is essential to obtain good alignment between the zzso map and the zzso image of the zzso In the present study, we compared an zzso landmark registration with an zzso focused zzso surface zzso 

In 20 patients, registration was based on zzso landmarks acquired under ICE guidance zzso zzso in another 20 matched patients, a new zzso focused zzso surface registration technique was used zzso zzso In these latter patients, a single landmark was acquired in the inferior part of the zzso and several surface points were recorded in the zzso area of the left zzso zzso and around the zzso of the right zzso The mean zzso zzso image distance was calculated in both zzso In group A, the mean landmark zzso image distance was also calculated after adding the surface zzso The mean landmark zzso image distance was zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso when surface registration was zzso The zzso zzso image distance was significantly shorter in group B zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 3 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

This zzso focused zzso surface registration seems to be superior to landmark registration in achieving a better alignment between the zzso image and the zzso zzso The concurrent use of standard surface registration may result in rotation of the zzso zzso
