To develop quantitative methods for identifying cerebral anomalies on magnetic resonance images of subjects with language disorders and other learning zzso 

zzso blinded comparison of subjects with zzso unaffected relatives, and a control group balanced for age and socioeconomic zzso zzso zzso clinical diagnosis of zzso by physician or learning disabilities specialist on the basis of clinical assessment and family zzso 

Hospital pediatric neurology clinic and private reading zzso 



individuals with zzso zzso male and two female, aged 15 to 65 zzso from professional zzso unaffected zzso and second-degree relatives (four male and six female, aged 6 to 63 zzso available in the geographical area; and controls (five male and seven female, aged 14 to 52 zzso 

zzso echo three-dimensional scan in zzso zzso zzso 128 zzso consecutive zzso zzso 

zzso Average length of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso banks of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of asymmetry for T and P zzso zzso zzso zzso of asymmetry zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of asymmetry zzso zzso and zzso qualitative assessment of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

All groups had zzso asymmetry for the zzso bank and zzso asymmetry for the zzso zzso The group with zzso had exaggerated zzso zzso to a significant shift of right zzso tissue from the zzso to zzso zzso They also had a higher zzso of cerebral anomalies zzso zzso with zzso six of zzso relatives, two of 10; and controls, zero of zzso 

zzso assessment of high-resolution magnetic resonance images can reveal functionally relevant variations and anomalies in cerebral zzso Further refinement of these measurement techniques should improve the diagnosis, zzso and treatment of language disorders and other learning zzso
