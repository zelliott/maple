zzso zzso as well as MR zzso and MRS have been shown to contribute to the differential diagnosis of the Parkinson zzso of multiple system zzso zzso and zzso However, it is currently unknown whether zzso imaging zzso discriminates these zzso 

Ten patients with zzso zzso age, 64 zzso were zzso 11 with zzso zzso age, 64 zzso and seven healthy volunteers zzso age, 59 zzso matched for age and disease zzso Regional apparent diffusion zzso zzso were determined in different brain regions including zzso zzso gray matter, white matter, zzso zzso and zzso 

Patients with zzso had higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than both patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There were no significant differences in zzso zzso between patients with zzso and healthy zzso Moreover, none of the zzso zzso values in the zzso and control group surpassed the lowest value in the zzso zzso There were no significant group differences in the zzso values in other brain regions such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, thalamus, or gray and white zzso zzso zzso values correlated significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso OFF scores in patients with zzso as measured by the zzso rank zzso 

zzso even if measured in the slice direction only, is able to discriminate zzso and both patients with zzso and healthy volunteers on the basis of zzso zzso zzso The increased zzso zzso values in Parkinson zzso of multiple system zzso are likely to reflect ongoing zzso zzso whereas most zzso studies reveal intact zzso in zzso zzso imaging may represent a useful diagnostic tool that can provide additional support for a diagnosis of Parkinson zzso of multiple system zzso
