Several functional MR imaging studies evaluating the zzso of linguistic functions in patients who underwent Wada testing have been zzso There is extensive zzso in the zzso index zzso calculation across the studies, and the optimal calculation method remains zzso We attempted to calculate the zzso in different ways in the same subjects, in order to find the zzso calculation method with the highest correlation to the Wada zzso Fifteen patients (10 zzso 5 zzso suffering from medically intractable zzso lobe zzso zzso (12 left, 3 right) were admitted for the zzso The patients underwent a standardized bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso Language testing included spontaneous speech, oral zzso reading, object and picture naming, and zzso All the tasks were scored separately in order to increase the possibility of correlation between Wada and zzso A silent zzso verbal zzso task zzso was used as a language paradigm for functional zzso zzso of interest zzso with a known association with language function zzso area, the lateral prefrontal cortex, zzso were zzso First, the zzso were calculated from the zzso using a previously reported method zzso zzso zzso Next, we used several new methods of zzso calculation zzso of zzso methods independent of the choice of the statistical zzso zzso The most significant correlation with Wada was proven in the zzso that were evaluated from zzso area (up to R zzso zzso P zzso 1 zzso zzso However, the new zzso calculation methods used in the present study did not produce a statistically significant benefit in comparison to previously reported zzso
