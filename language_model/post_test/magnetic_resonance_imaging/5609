zzso errors result from the disruption of access either to zzso or to zzso zzso One way to determine the origins of these errors is to evaluate comprehension of words that elicit semantic errors in zzso We hypothesized that in acute stroke there are different brain regions where dysfunction results in semantic errors in both naming and comprehension versus those with semantic errors in oral naming zzso 

A consecutive series of 196 patients with acute left zzso stroke who met inclusion criteria were evaluated with oral naming and spoken zzso zzso tasks and magnetic resonance imaging within 48 h of stroke zzso We evaluated the relationship between tissue dysfunction in 10 zzso zzso areas zzso and the production of coordinate semantic errors resulting from zzso semantic deficits or zzso zzso access zzso 

zzso errors arising from semantic deficits were most associated with tissue zzso of left BA zzso zzso errors resulting from zzso access deficits were associated with zzso of left BA zzso 

Our study shows that semantic errors arising from damage to distinct cognitive processes reflect dysfunction of different brain zzso
