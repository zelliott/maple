zzso zzso in tumors reduces the efficacy of zzso treatment zzso such as conventional zzso and zzso Since tumor zzso is directly affected by the vascular resistance to flow of vessels feeding the zzso zzso drugs might be a way to increase tumor blood flow and zzso The effects of zzso oxide zzso donor administration on tumor zzso zzso and radiation sensitivity were studied in the zzso tumor zzso Local tumor zzso was measured using electron zzso resonance zzso and a zzso probe, zzso We zzso measured the zzso of tumor blood flow by laser zzso zzso We determined zzso tumor regrowth delay after zzso zzso administration and zzso compared to zzso breathing before zzso and with zzso zzso Administration of the NO donor improved the zzso tumor zzso zzso with an increase in tumor blood zzso We also demonstrated an increase in zzso tumor radiation sensitivity after zzso zzso administration, which was similar to the effect of zzso breathing in the same tumor zzso Administration of zzso zzso could be considered in terms of improvement in tumor blood flow and a possible zzso increase in accessibility of zzso agents to the zzso particularly in terms of modification of the tumor response to zzso
