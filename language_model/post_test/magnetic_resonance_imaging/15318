To allow perception of a continuous world, cortical mechanisms extrapolate missing information with highly constrained predictions about the environment just beyond the edges of a zzso Here, we report functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence for zzso of scene layout information beyond what was physically zzso an illusion known as boundary zzso zzso with behavioral reports, we observed boundary extension for zzso zzso in the zzso place area zzso and zzso zzso zzso but no such zzso of object representations in the lateral zzso complex zzso These results demonstrate that scene layout representations are zzso beyond the confines of the zzso zzso Such zzso may facilitate perception of a continuous world from zzso zzso
