To zzso determine normal ranges of total fetal lung volume zzso based on fetal body volume zzso and to determine whether prediction of zzso based on such ranges is independent of fetal zzso zzso 

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Clinical zzso informed consent was zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso measurement of fetal zzso liver, and body was performed in 200 fetuses without abnormalities affecting these zzso zzso was assessed with zzso zzso by using zzso zzso rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement at zzso weeks of zzso zzso was correlated to zzso age zzso liver volume, and zzso zzso zzso ratio for zzso was calculated by expressing the observed zzso as a percentage of the expected mean zzso for zzso liver volume, or zzso Three groups of fetuses were defined on the basis of zzso zzso for fetal weight obtained through zzso fetuses with weight at or below the 5th zzso those with weight at or above the 95th zzso and those with weight between these two zzso zzso Median zzso ratios, based on zzso and zzso in fetuses with weight below the 5th zzso and in those with weight above the 95th zzso were compared with median zzso ratio of zzso fetuses zzso U zzso 

zzso correlated best with zzso according to the following cubic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In 174 zzso zzso normal median zzso ratio based on zzso was zzso zzso zzso which was higher than that in 11 fetuses with weight at or below the 5th zzso zzso range, zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower than that in 15 fetuses with weight at or above the 95th zzso zzso range, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso median zzso ratio, based on zzso was independent of zzso indexes irrespective of the zzso for fetal zzso 

zzso correlated best with zzso irrespective of zzso zzso
