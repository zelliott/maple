We aimed to determine the impact of zzso zzso length as measured by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso upon zzso following radical zzso and zzso zzso 

A total of 40 male patients zzso age zzso zzso 7 zzso were subjected to radical zzso and zzso zzso substitution for zzso zzso zzso zzso length was measured by zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso high resolution zzso weighted zzso In all zzso patients, day and night zzso zzso as well as time to stable zzso were zzso zzso assessment included medium fill zzso and zzso pressure zzso 

Of all patients 10 were zzso Mean follow-up period was zzso zzso zzso zzso All the zzso patients were continent by zzso On the other hand, 13 were continent by night zzso 13 showed occasional zzso zzso and 4 were nightly zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso lengths were 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the three groups, respectively zzso zzso zzso Mean time to reach stable zzso daytime zzso was zzso zzso zzso whilst it was zzso zzso zzso weeks for nighttime zzso There was no significant correlation between zzso zzso zzso length and time to stable day or night zzso (R zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, such correlation was not observed with zzso zzso pressure zzso parameters including maximum zzso pressure, maximum zzso closure pressure or functional zzso length (R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso length has no value for judgment of zzso zzso status following radical zzso and zzso zzso zzso
