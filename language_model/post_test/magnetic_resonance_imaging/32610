zzso zzso zzso complexes have previously been shown to exhibit high zzso especially at the high magnetic fields that are clinically relevant for present and future clinical zzso This is due to more than one coordinated water zzso exchanging rapidly with bulk zzso These complexes, however, present poor water zzso zzso complexes which include a zzso zzso zzso maintain the high zzso characteristics of the zzso family and have been zzso with zzso zzso of various zzso The charge of the zzso significantly affects the stability of the zzso complex, with the most stable complex presenting a neutral zzso The zzso zzso also moderately affects the affinity of the complex for zzso zzso with the highest affinity observed for the positively charged zzso In any case, only two zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind the zzso complex with weak affinities that are comparable to other zzso zzso 1 complexes and much weaker than zzso zzso zzso 2 based zzso Furthermore, unlike zzso complexes, zzso zzso complexes do not show any noticeable interaction with zzso The nature of the zzso can also favorably stabilize the coordination of a third water zzso on the zzso center and lead to a zzso ground zzso Such complexes that attain zzso zzso 3 incorporate a zzso beta to the terminal zzso of the zzso zzso that is a zzso zzso suggesting that the third water zzso is coordinated to the metal center through a zzso zzso These zzso include zzso primary zzso and zzso Moreover, the coordination of a third water zzso has been achieved without zzso the zzso
