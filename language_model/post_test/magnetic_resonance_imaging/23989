The abdominal cavity extends from the zzso to the pelvic floor, and is lined by a zzso membrane known as the zzso The zzso is the largest zzso membrane in the body, and its surface area is comparable to the surface area of the skin zzso 2 zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso suspend the various zzso contained in the abdominal zzso The zzso is, therefore, comprised of two zzso a zzso layer lining the abdominal zzso and a visceral layer enveloping the contained zzso The zzso cavity is enclosed between these two zzso and is normally empty, apart from a small amount of zzso zzso As a result, the normal zzso cavity is only a potential zzso In men, the space is zzso In women, the zzso ends of the zzso tubes open into the zzso zzso and provide a potential route of communication with the zzso The zzso cavity and the specialized zzso zzso known as zzso are important disease sites in the zzso However, plain zzso zzso studies, and ultrasound are of limited utility in imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso and consistent imaging of such diseases only became possible with the development of zzso zzso zzso Initially, magnetic resonance imaging zzso was of limited utility, because of image degradation by motion zzso With modern fast zzso zzso it is now possible to depict many of these zzso and zzso conditions with an accuracy similar to zzso This review will discuss the normal anatomy and physiology of the zzso space and zzso and the related disease zzso with particular emphasis on CT and zzso zzso The review is structured along anatomical lines, because many disease processes in the abdomen are site specific, or spread along anatomical zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are discussed zzso because these two conditions are not site specific, and because they are conditions whose imaging features are not always well zzso Our aim is to present key anatomical and pathological concepts in the imaging of zzso and zzso zzso We hope this will facilitate a clearer understanding of the CT and zzso appearance of these diseases, and so enhance the ability of the clinical zzso to formulate rational differential diagnoses, to understand pathways of disease spread, and to apply greater critical analysis in zzso zzso The review is not intended as an zzso description of zzso anatomy and zzso
