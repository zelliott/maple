To evaluate the efficacy of integration of metabolism images into zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

From January to December 2012, 32 patients with brain zzso underwent zzso zzso biopsy guided by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso The cohort consisted of 16 male and 16 female patients, with a mean age of 45 years zzso 7 - 62 zzso zzso targets were identified according to PET and zzso zzso was performed with zzso zzso biopsy zzso zzso yield and complications were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were successfully implemented in all zzso zzso confirmed accuracy of biopsy zzso All the specimens obtained pathological diagnosis, the diagnostic yield was zzso In 1 patient, zzso found small zzso zzso 5 zzso surgical zzso wasn't needed with zzso complication rate zzso With the help of zzso zzso no patients had new or worsened zzso zzso 

zzso of metabolism images into zzso zzso provide not only zzso but also zzso and functional information for zzso zzso increasing diagnostic yield and avoiding zzso zzso zzso
