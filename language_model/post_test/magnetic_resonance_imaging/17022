Sleep deprivation zzso can give rise to faltering attention but the mechanics underlying this remain zzso Using a covert attention task that required attention to a peripheral target location, we compared the effects of attention and zzso on baseline activity prior to visual stimulation as well as on zzso zzso Volunteers were studied after a night of normal sleep zzso and a night of zzso zzso signal zzso evoked by zzso attention in the absence of visual stimulation were attenuated within zzso zzso zzso zzso and all zzso mapped visual areas during zzso indicative of impaired zzso zzso In response to visual zzso attention modulated zzso in higher cortical areas and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regardless of whether stimuli were zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso by attention was not affected by zzso unlike for the zzso period, suggesting a reduced number, but still functional circuits during zzso zzso in zzso attention in zzso dominate in the zzso period, whereas changes in zzso zzso arise from an interaction between compromised zzso zzso control of attention and reduced sensitivity of zzso visual zzso to zzso or bottom-up zzso
