zzso zzso zzso studies show zzso in zzso zzso in tasks involving reward processing, like the Monetary Incentive zzso Task zzso In zzso studies in animals, zzso zzso release is associated with reward zzso This study examined the relationship between zzso zzso and magnitude of zzso release measured with zzso zzso zzso study zzso in the same subjects using zzso in both zzso to test if zzso zzso is related to zzso zzso zzso healthy subjects were scanned with zzso PET at baseline and after zzso zzso potential zzso was derived by equilibrium analysis in zzso zzso and percent change across conditions zzso was zzso Blood oxygen level dependence zzso signal changes with zzso were measured during zzso using zzso analysis and zzso analysis and correlated with zzso zzso was not significant in the zzso zzso zzso but reached significance in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was highest in zzso No significant associations between zzso and change in zzso zzso were observed with zzso using zzso zzso zzso analysis showed positive correlation between zzso zzso in anticipation of the highest reward and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Our study indicates that zzso zzso release in zzso is of small magnitude and is related to zzso signal change during performance of the zzso in only a few zzso when rewarding and zzso conditions are zzso The lack of correlation at the zzso level may be due to the small magnitude of release or to the particular dependence of zzso on zzso zzso
