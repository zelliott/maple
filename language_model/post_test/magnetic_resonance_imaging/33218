To characterize the time course of tumor necrosis zzso zzso serum levels along with zzso zzso and zzso function in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and successful primary zzso coronary intervention zzso 

zzso levels of zzso zzso 6 zzso and zzso protein zzso were measured in 42 patients with zzso before, one and zzso after successful zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso function by zzso two-dimensional zzso and real-time three-dimensional zzso In a subset of 18 patients, zzso size was zzso by late zzso enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging zzso on day zzso 

zzso serum levels were in the upper normal range within the first zzso from symptom onset and increased continuously until day six, while zzso and zzso increased subsequently with a peak on day one after zzso zzso zzso on day one after zzso correlated with zzso zzso wall motion zzso and zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using multiple zzso linear analysis, zzso size on day six was predicted by serum zzso zzso after zzso zzso adjusted R zzso zzso 

Our data reflect the clinical significance of early zzso zzso in patients with zzso and primary zzso zzso Clinical Trials number, zzso
