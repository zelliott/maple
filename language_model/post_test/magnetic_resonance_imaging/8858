zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso are of interest for their usefulness in biomedical zzso In this work, we have zzso iron oxide zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso was zzso onto these zzso zzso along with an zzso during zzso The mass transport of the protein attached to the iron oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso under a zzso magnetic field of an zzso instrument was observed in zzso and in an egg as a model system for a biological zzso From the in zzso experiments in zzso gels, it was observed that the protein gets separated from the core during mass transport for some zzso but zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso These experiments demonstrated zzso for the use of zzso zzso in zzso directed drug zzso
