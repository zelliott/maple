To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of direct zzso CT zzso zzso and direct MR zzso zzso in patients suffering from chronic shoulder zzso 

zzso patients suffering from chronic shoulder instability were included into a prospective zzso In all cases, the indication for direct zzso and zzso was set by the orthopedic zzso Prior to the imaging procedures, 10 to 20 zzso of a special combination of contrast media (including zzso zzso and zzso in a relation of 125 : 125 : 1) was injected into the joint under sterile zzso First, zzso was performed with a zzso CT, with images reconstructed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso images were obtained using a zzso zzso spin echo sequence and zzso images using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso and zzso were compared with results obtained from zzso or zzso 

zzso was superior to zzso in the detection of zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso was 96 % and the specificity 96 zzso compared to a sensitivity of 76 % zzso zzso zzso and specificity of 92 % for zzso Both methods showed the same effectiveness concerning the assessment of capsule zzso zzso for both zzso 91 zzso 

zzso seems to be superior to zzso in the diagnostic zzso of chronic shoulder instability even when using a zzso CT zzso
