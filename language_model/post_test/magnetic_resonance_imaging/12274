This study investigated the changes of cerebral zzso and zzso due to the zzso of three driving speeds in comparison to a reference driving speed using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso A driving video as a visual stimulation source was recorded with four different driving speeds in a real driving zzso The experiment consisted of three blocks and each block included a one-minute control phase and a one-minute stimulation zzso The zzso area and the zzso index were analyzed by zzso high speed data from low speed zzso Such areas as zzso zzso and frontal zzso which is related to visual zzso high order visual and spatial attention (or zzso were activated due to the zzso of various driving speed zzso As the driving speed difference increased, the zzso area increased in the areas related to spatial attention (or zzso such as the frontal zzso however, changes of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso As the driving speed difference increased, the absolute value of cerebral zzso zzso These results may provide some basic data for zzso the zzso mechanism related to the zzso of a various driving speed difference based on a realistic visual zzso
