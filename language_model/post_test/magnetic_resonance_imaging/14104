The zzso MR imaging total zzso volume and Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso score are two common measures of zzso multiple sclerosis disability and zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso concentration is considered to be a new marker of the disease burden, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship among these three zzso 

The zzso zzso concentration and zzso zzso volume were zzso by using MR imaging and zzso MR zzso in 49 patients with zzso multiple sclerosis zzso female and 13 male zzso average age, 39 years; age range, zzso years; average zzso score, 2; range of zzso scores, zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes, and zzso scores were zzso 

No correlation was found between zzso zzso levels and either zzso zzso volumes or zzso zzso A weak correlation was found between the zzso scores and zzso zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Despite the lack of correlation between zzso zzso concentration and the clinical disability reflected in the zzso score, only the former evaluates the global zzso cell disease in the entire brain, including those zzso that are zzso to conventional imaging zzso
