By incorporating the zzso zzso inversion zzso with the zzso in zzso zzso zzso technique and by applying a zzso imaging method, we have selected only the zzso zzso signals from zzso human kidney and liver, using a single concentric zzso surface zzso zzso to the experimental results on animal studies, the zzso signal is dramatically reduced in the localized zzso Our zzso strategy also allows us to zzso easily on the zzso volume of interest and leads to high-resolution zzso that exhibit zzso zzso Our results indicate that we can obtain localized signals from deep small zzso and point the way for other human metabolism zzso
