The effect of zzso imaging zzso acoustic background noise on blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso was zzso Two zzso pulse sequences were zzso zzso conventional zzso with a pulsating sound component of typically 8-10 zzso which is a potent zzso zzso and zzso the more recently developed zzso zzso which is perceived as less zzso despite equivalent peak sound pressure zzso Sixteen healthy subjects performed an established demanding visual zzso working memory zzso Using an exploratory data analysis technique zzso zzso independent component zzso zzso we studied the zzso response zzso introduced by zzso versus conventional zzso acoustic background noise in addition to zzso and spatial signal zzso The analysis revealed a zzso component associated with the established zzso working memory and motor feedback response network, which exhibited a significant zzso increase in its average effect size for the zzso as opposed to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso such as primary visual areas, were not zzso zzso acoustic background noise influences much more than the auditory system per zzso This analysis provides additional evidence for an enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso due to less zzso acoustic background zzso zzso
