The authors describe a new magnetic resonance zzso imaging technique to demonstrate the status of the cervical nerve roots involved in zzso zzso zzso They discuss the accuracy and zzso of a MR zzso zzso for diagnosis of nerve root zzso compared with those of zzso combined with computerized zzso zzso zzso 

The overlapping zzso slice MR imaging procedure was performed in 35 patients with traumatic zzso zzso injury and 10 healthy zzso The results were zzso evaluated and classified into four major categories zzso zzso zzso injuries, zzso and zzso after confirming the diagnosis by surgical exploration with or without spinal evoked potential zzso zzso and by referring to zzso and CT zzso zzso The reliability and zzso of the MR zzso zzso was zzso assessed by eight independent observers, and its diagnostic accuracy was compared with that of traditional zzso zzso zzso correlated with surgical and spinal zzso findings in another 50 cervical roots in 10 patients with traumatic zzso zzso zzso 

In the retrospective study in which MR imaging and zzso zzso findings involving 175 cervical roots in 35 patients were zzso the sensitivity of detection of the cervical nerve root zzso was the same zzso with both zzso In the prospective study, zzso reliability and zzso zzso showed that there was no statistically significant difference between MR imaging and zzso zzso and that their accuracy for detecting cervical root zzso was the same as that in the retrospective zzso The overlapping zzso slice MR imaging technique is a reliable and zzso method for detecting nerve root zzso The information provided by this zzso enabled the authors to assess the roots of the zzso zzso and provided valuable data for helping to decide whether to proceed with zzso nerve repair, primary zzso or other imaging zzso
