Greater zzso pain syndrome is a common zzso condition related to underlying zzso but it may reflect zzso zzso with zzso disruption from the greater zzso Our goal was to evaluate our clinical experience with surgical repair of these zzso 

We zzso evaluated a consecutive series of zzso patients zzso zzso with a tear of the hip zzso zzso who underwent surgical reconstruction and were followed for a minimum of five zzso The zzso evaluation revealed chronic lateral hip pain, a positive zzso sign, and a tear documented by magnetic resonance imaging zzso The tears were defined zzso with a zzso scheme that accounted for the dimension of the tear ranging from zzso zzso tears to complete tears of the zzso muscle zzso zzso 

The mean Harris hip score improved from 53 points preoperatively to 87 points at one year and 88 points at five zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso score improved from zzso points preoperatively to zzso points at one year and zzso points at five zzso With the numbers available, no significant difference in the degree of clinical improvement was found on the basis of the severity of the zzso However, the three patients with poor results were in the group with the largest zzso Overall, zzso of zzso patients were satisfied with their surgical result and were willing to undergo the procedure again if zzso 

zzso repair of torn zzso zzso of the hip is a viable option when zzso and clinical findings are consistent with zzso disruption and zzso There was substantial and durable improvement in strength and clinical performance in most zzso
