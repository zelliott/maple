Although functional imaging of zzso activity by magnetic resonance imaging zzso has become the primary methodology employed in studying the brain, significant portions of the brain are zzso by this methodology due to its sensitivity to zzso magnetic field zzso induced near zzso cavities in the zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that this sensitivity is eliminated by a novel pulse zzso zzso zzso acquisition by sequential zzso and zzso zzso et zzso 2007), that can generate functional zzso This is accomplished because zzso acquired signals are purely and perfectly zzso zzso without any zzso that are inherent in the other image acquisition schemes employed to zzso zzso zzso sequences are also more specific to the site of zzso activity at zzso magnetic fields than zzso since they are dominated by signal components originating from the tissue in the zzso zzso The zzso based zzso response is zzso it is shown to have an inherently less noisy time series and to provide zzso in brain regions, such as the zzso cortex, which are challenging to image with conventional zzso
