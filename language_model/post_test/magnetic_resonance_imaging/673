Analysis of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso maps derived from zzso MR imaging is emerging as a zzso sensitive, and quantitative tool to evaluate brain damage in diseases of the white and gray zzso To explore the zzso of zzso maps analysis in degenerative zzso we examined 28 patients and 26 zzso controls with zzso zzso and diffusion zzso values zzso along the three main body zzso MR zzso zzso patients had inherited genetically proven diseases including zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas four patients had sporadic adult onset pure zzso zzso (three zzso one zzso zzso Area and linear zzso of the zzso structures contained in the zzso zzso zzso zzso preliminary enabled zzso of the patients in the three zzso categories reflecting the gross pathology findings, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso six zzso and four zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso 7: all zzso and cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso three idiopathic and one zzso zzso Seven patients with zzso zzso zzso 5) or zzso zzso zzso 2) had zzso changes reminiscent of zzso but their values were still in the lower normal range and were classified as zzso Mean zzso zzso maps of the entire brain were generated and D was measured with regions of interest zzso in the zzso zzso middle zzso zzso and the zzso white zzso Moreover, after exclusion of the skull with manual zzso and of the zzso with application of a threshold value, zzso were obtained for D of the zzso and zzso and for D of the cerebral zzso As compared to controls, a zzso zzso zzso increase of D was observed in the zzso middle zzso zzso and zzso white matter in zzso and undefined patients groups who had also significantly increased values of the 25th and 50th zzso in the zzso and zzso D zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso an increase of the 25th and 50th zzso of the D value was observed in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso group showed zzso zzso zzso an increased D in the zzso zzso A correlation between clinical severity as assessed with the zzso zzso Clinical zzso zzso zzso and the 50th zzso of the D value in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in patients with zzso or zzso zzso MR imaging reveals variable patterns of increase of D in the zzso zzso and cerebral zzso in degenerative zzso that match the known distribution of the zzso zzso
