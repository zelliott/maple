Despite continuing debates around zzso surgery in zzso zzso there is broad consensus that increased extent of tumor reduction improves overall zzso However, zzso of the extent of tumor zzso is hampered by difficulty in zzso discrimination between normal and pathological zzso In this context, two established methods for tumor zzso zzso guided surgery with zzso and zzso zzso zzso with integrated functional zzso were investigated as a dual zzso zzso zzso zzso Thirty seven patients presumably suffering from zzso zzso zzso grade III or zzso according to zzso appearance were zzso zzso experimental sequences showing complete zzso according to the zzso technique were confirmed by zzso Fourteen sequences showing complete zzso according to the zzso technique could not be confirmed by zzso which detected residual zzso Further analysis revealed that these sequences could be classified as functional grade II tumors zzso to eloquent brain zzso The combination of zzso guided zzso and zzso evaluation by high field zzso significantly increased the extent of tumor zzso in this zzso of zzso zzso located adjacent to eloquent areas from zzso to zzso zzso alone proved to be insufficient in attaining gross total zzso without the danger of incurring zzso neurological zzso Furthermore, in the case of functional grade III zzso zzso in combination with functional zzso was significantly superior to the zzso zzso zzso The extent of zzso could be increased from zzso to zzso without incurring zzso neurological zzso
