zzso outcomes involves rapidly and continuously adjusting behavior based on zzso While most behavioral studies focus on immediate task conditions, responses to events are also influenced by recent zzso We used zzso and a zzso paradigm to investigate the neural bases of 2 trial history effects that are well characterized in the behavioral eye movement zzso zzso and the zzso zzso We found that switched trials were associated with increased errors and transient increases in activity in the frontal eye field zzso and anterior zzso zzso early in the zzso zzso These activity changes are consistent with active reconfiguration of the task set, a zzso process that is triggered by the instructional zzso Following an zzso versus zzso there was increased activity in the zzso and prefrontal zzso that persisted into the zzso period of the subsequent trial, and zzso zzso were zzso We attribute these effects to persistent zzso of the zzso motor response system from the prior zzso These findings refine our understanding of how trial history interacts with current task demands to adjust zzso Such dynamic zzso of neural activity and behavior by recent experience are at the heart of zzso flexible zzso
