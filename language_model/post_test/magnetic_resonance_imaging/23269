zzso zzso results have suggested a progression in zzso in functional zzso from childhood to zzso The mechanisms underlying this process are thought to be an age-related decrease in zzso extent as well as an increased magnitude in zzso zzso The present study aimed to evaluate these notions while controlling for zzso that may bias towards zzso We used adolescent subjects in small age zzso In addition, head motion corrections were incorporated in statistical analyses and regions of interest were identified for each participant separately to overcome zzso zzso in anatomy and functional zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso and 21-year-old males were compared during the decision phase of a challenging and complex gambling zzso The zzso zzso enhanced with increasing age, modulated by task zzso First, response zzso during difficult, zzso relative to zzso decisions increased with zzso This decision difficulty effect was most pronounced in zzso both in areas associated with task execution and default mode zzso Second, deciding to pass as opposed to gamble exerted more effort in inferior frontal and zzso areas only by zzso and zzso There was neither an age-related decrease in zzso extent, nor any qualitative shifts in activated areas as suggested by the zzso zzso These results suggest that although different age groups throughout adolescence engage similar brain areas during decision making, the response magnitude in these areas increases with age particularly during difficult task conditions, providing that zzso factors are zzso
