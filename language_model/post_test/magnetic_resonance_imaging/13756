This study investigated the effect of zzso on zzso activity resulting from electrical stimulation of the median zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Nine volunteers underwent stimulation at 5 and 100 zzso while breathing zzso zzso zzso of inspired zzso or zzso zzso zzso data were correlated with a stimulus predictor curve, transformed into zzso space and averaged by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were compared using zzso zzso There were no significant differences between the primary zzso zzso area 40 zzso and secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes for zzso and zzso zzso There was no difference between zzso and zzso zzso at 5 and 100 zzso In contrast to results previously reported for primary visual zzso zzso zzso did not enhance zzso cortical zzso in area zzso or zzso These results indicate that there is regional zzso of the zzso response to zzso in the cerebral zzso
