The present study documents the use of an iron zzso zzso contrast agent in functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor zzso changes in cerebral blood volume zzso resulting from peripheral sensory stimulation and the application of this technique to generate high-resolution functional zzso zzso zzso with zzso were zzso during electrical stimulation (3 zzso 3 zzso 3 zzso of zzso or zzso zzso maps were generated by zzso of the measured signal response and a zzso function representative of the stimulus for each image zzso zzso imaging produced functional maps consistent with the known functional anatomy of rat primary zzso zzso zzso Imaging with improved zzso resolution demonstrated rapid zzso zzso zzso increases which were sustained and relatively stable zzso of variation zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso stimulation periods of up to 5 zzso zzso by this sustained response we generated high-resolution zzso 100 zzso zzso functional maps showing discrete zzso and zzso zzso This technique offers many advantages over other methods for the study of brain activity in the rat and has resolution sufficient to be useful in reorganization zzso
