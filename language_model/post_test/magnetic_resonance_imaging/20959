With advances in magnetic resonance imaging zzso technology, dynamic zzso zzso is approaching the capability to simultaneously deliver both high spatial and high zzso resolutions for clinical zzso However, zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso considerations and their impacts regarding zzso modeling of the zzso data continue to represent challenges in the design of zzso zzso Given that many acquisition parameters can affect the nature of zzso data, minimizing zzso data acquisition zzso (among sites and scanner zzso is as important as zzso zzso modeling zzso For zzso zzso studies where rapid contrast zzso zzso zzso is expected, current zzso protocols often adopt a three-dimensional fast zzso shot zzso sequence to achieve zzso resolution zzso Based on breast and prostate zzso data acquired with different zzso sequence zzso this paper zzso a number of zzso and zzso considerations for acquisition zzso and zzso modeling implications zzso zzso based on region of interest data further indicate that the effects of zzso water exchange often play an important role in zzso zzso data zzso especially for protocols zzso for zzso zzso
