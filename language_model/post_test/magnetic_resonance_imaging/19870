A recently discovered gene complex, zzso zzso zzso but now termed zzso was found to be associated with schizophrenia and with bipolar disorder, possibly because of an indirect effect on zzso zzso In principle, if zzso increases risk for psychosis by this zzso it might impact with greater zzso those zzso based cognitive and zzso functions associated with zzso zzso We performed two independent zzso association studies (one sample contained more than 200 families and the other more than zzso of multiple zzso in the zzso region and of multiple zzso in the gene for zzso acid zzso zzso which may be modulated by zzso We examined the relationship between select cognitive measures in attention, working memory, and episodic memory and a restricted set of zzso zzso in over 600 normal controls, schizophrenic patients, and their zzso siblings using mixed model zzso We also determined zzso effects on zzso measures in normal controls using the zzso zzso response obtained during zzso procedures involving either episodic memory or working zzso There were no significant single zzso zzso associations and clinical diagnosis in either sample, though one approached significance zzso Diagnosis by zzso interaction effects for zzso zzso 10 were significant for cognitive variables assessing working memory and attention zzso and at the trend level for episodic memory, such that in the schizophrenia group an exaggerated zzso load effect in the predicted directions was zzso In the zzso zzso a strong effect of zzso zzso 10 zzso was observed on zzso zzso in the zzso during the episodic memory zzso Tests of association with zzso were consistently zzso We present evidence that zzso variations in the zzso gene region increase risk of cognitive impairment in zzso zzso variations were not strongly associated with clinical diagnosis in zzso zzso
