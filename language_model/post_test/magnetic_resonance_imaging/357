To observe the cerebral zzso effects of needling at zzso zzso versus zzso plus zzso zzso points in young healthy volunteers based on the hypothesis of zzso effect of combined acupuncture points relates to the brain zzso 

Sixteen healthy volunteers were randomly divided into zzso group and zzso plus zzso group, and there were 8 volunteers in each zzso The volunteers in the two groups received needling at corresponding points on the right hand or foot zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso GE zzso was used for functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain before and during the zzso and the obtained experimental data in the regional brain were processed and analyzed by the method of region of interest zzso 

The zzso zzso induced by needling of zzso or zzso plus zzso was all relatively concentrated zzso rate more than 4 or zzso point more than 10) on bilateral frontal and zzso zzso There were no significant differences in zzso zzso rates of brain regions between the two zzso zzso zzso points showed that needling at zzso could activate the right zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso vs zzso plus zzso while needling at zzso plus zzso could activate the left zzso and zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso more effectively than activate the other brain regions zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso strength showed that needling at zzso plus zzso could more strongly activate the right zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso 

Based on zzso data, a kind of acupuncture point combination of zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso zzso could improve the motor and sensory zzso and equilibrium zzso The effect of combined acupuncture points was proved by cerebral activity zzso
