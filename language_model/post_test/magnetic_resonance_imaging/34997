zzso in the size of the anterior zzso have been described for both zzso zzso psychosis and established zzso but have not been examined in individuals at zzso risk for psychosis zzso We compared 100 zzso individuals (27 of whom later developed zzso with 38 zzso control subjects on measures of size and shape of the corpus zzso to determine if changes previously demonstrated in zzso and established schizophrenia are present in the zzso zzso Each zzso zzso was extracted from the zzso slice from zzso magnetic resonance images, and total area, length and zzso of the zzso was compared using one-way zzso and 39 regional thicknesses via a zzso zzso method to account for zzso of adjacent zzso Total area, length and zzso did not differ between the zzso Compared to both the zzso group and controls, the zzso group showed significant regional reductions in the region of the anterior zzso of the zzso The zzso group did not differ from zzso Positive and negative symptoms did not affect regional thickness in either of the patient zzso Cox zzso showed that mean anterior zzso thickness was highly zzso of a transition to zzso zzso in the thickness of the anterior zzso differentiate between high-risk individuals who transition to psychosis and those who do not, and is highly zzso of zzso These changes may reflect primary pathology of zzso and zzso frontal cortex, or deficits in anterior zzso zzso
