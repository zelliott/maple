Mechanical stresses are known to play important roles in zzso plaque zzso progression and zzso It has been zzso that zzso initiation and early progression correlate zzso with flow wall zzso stresses zzso However, mechanisms governing advanced plaque progression are not well zzso 

In zzso serial zzso data zzso zzso were acquired from 14 patients after informed zzso Each patient had 2-4 scans zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso scan pairs zzso and follow-up zzso were formed with slices matched for model construction and zzso Each scan pair had zzso matched slices which gave zzso data points for analysis zzso points per slice on zzso zzso plaque progression was defined as the wall thickness increase zzso at each data zzso zzso zzso models with zzso interactions were constructed based on in zzso serial zzso data to extract flow zzso stress and plaque wall stress zzso on all data points to zzso correlations between plaque progression and mechanical stresses zzso and zzso zzso and zzso data corresponding to both maximum and minimum flow rates in a cardiac cycle were used to investigate the impact of flow rates on those zzso 

Using follow-up scans and maximum flow rates, 19 out of 32 scan pairs showed a significant positive correlation between zzso and zzso zzso significance correlation ratio zzso zzso and 26 out of 32 scan pairs showed a significant negative correlation between zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso to minimum flow rates, the correlation ratio for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso Using baseline scans, the correlation ratios for zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso for maximum and minimum flow rates, zzso The correlation ratios for zzso zzso zzso were the same zzso corresponding to maximum and minimum flow zzso 

zzso zzso stress corresponding to the minimum flow rates in a cardiac cycle had slightly better correlation with zzso compared to zzso corresponding to maximum flow zzso Choice of maximum or minimum flow rates had no impact on zzso zzso Advanced plaque progression correlated positively with flow zzso stress and zzso with plaque wall stress using follow-up zzso zzso results using zzso at the baseline scan were zzso
