Spinal zzso zzso zzso comprise the majority of spinal vascular zzso The most common clinical presentation is that of progressive zzso probably related to zzso hypertension, which may lead to permanent disability and even zzso 

To report our clinical experience with spinal zzso zzso zzso 

Nine patients with spinal zzso zzso were managed at our center during a one year period zzso The patients, eight men and one woman ranging in age from 46 to 75 years, presented with initially fluctuating and eventually permanent and progressive zzso sensory disturbances and zzso zzso The neurological signs generally began zzso and progressed from the zzso to zzso limb zzso The duration of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from 6 to 36 months during which the patients underwent an extensive but zzso zzso and even unnecessary operations due to zzso All patients finally underwent magnetic resonance imaging and spinal zzso which demonstrated the pathological vascular zzso zzso of the zzso was achieved by zzso or by surgical zzso 

Following treatment, six patients experienced improvement of gait and zzso control, and the severe neurological deficits stabilized in the other three patients with long duration of zzso There was no further deterioration in any of the treated zzso 

The history, neurological findings and zzso changes on zzso scan should alert clinicians to the possibility of spinal zzso zzso leading to diagnostic spinal zzso Early diagnosis and treatment may significantly improve outcome and prevent permanent disability and even zzso
