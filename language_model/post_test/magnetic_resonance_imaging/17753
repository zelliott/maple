To review the impact of zzso breast magnetic resonance imaging on the management of planned surgery, and the appropriateness of any resulting zzso 

zzso zzso 

A private hospital in Hong zzso zzso For the 147 consecutive zzso breast cancer patients who underwent zzso magnetic resonance imaging to determine zzso extent undergoing operation by a single surgeon between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2009, the impact of magnetic resonance imaging findings was reviewed in terms of management zzso and their zzso 

The most common indication for breast magnetic resonance imaging was the presence of multiple indeterminate shadows on ultrasound scans zzso followed by zzso border of the main zzso on ultrasound scans zzso In zzso zzso out of zzso of the patients, the extent of the operation was zzso Upgrading zzso zzso to wider zzso zzso out of zzso zzso to mastectomy zzso out of zzso zzso to bilateral zzso (15 out of zzso and other (12 out of zzso Mostly, these management changes were because magnetic resonance imaging showed more extensive disease zzso additional cancer zzso zzso or zzso disease zzso In five instances, upgrading was due to patient zzso In zzso zzso out of zzso of the patients, there was no change in the planned zzso Regarding 97 of the patients having altered management, in 12 the changes were considered inappropriately extensive zzso to zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso In terms of magnetic resonance imaging detection of more extensive, zzso zzso or zzso disease, the zzso rate was zzso and zzso rate zzso zzso rates for sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso using the final pathology as the gold zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging had a clinically significant and mostly correct impact on management zzso zzso resonance imaging should be included as part of the zzso investigation in patients planned for zzso surgery, in whom there are doubts about the extent of the zzso based on conventional zzso
