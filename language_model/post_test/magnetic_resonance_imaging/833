Visual context influences our perception of target objects in natural zzso However, little is known about the analysis of context information and its role in shape perception in the human zzso We investigated whether the human lateral zzso complex zzso known to be involved in the visual analysis of shapes, also processes information about the context of shapes within cluttered zzso We employed an zzso adaptation paradigm in which zzso responses are lower for two identical than for two different stimuli presented zzso The stimuli consisted of closed target contours defined by aligned zzso elements embedded in a background of randomly oriented zzso We measured zzso adaptation in the zzso across changes in the context of the target shapes by manipulating the position and orientation of the background zzso No adaptation was observed across context changes when the background elements were presented in the same plane as the target zzso However, adaptation was observed when the grouping of the target elements was enhanced in a bottom-up zzso grouping by disparity or zzso or zzso zzso shape zzso manner and thus the zzso of the target shape zzso These findings suggest that the zzso processes information not only about shapes, but also about their zzso This processing of context information in the zzso is modulated by zzso zzso and grouping zzso That is, neural populations in the zzso zzso context information when relevant to the perception of target shapes, but represent salient targets independent of context zzso
