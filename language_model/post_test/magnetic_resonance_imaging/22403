The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso imaging by zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging could zzso delineate the area at risk in zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that the size of the area at risk during a transient zzso would be similar to the zzso zzso region observed 2 days later, that the zzso zzso zzso would show partial functional recovery after 2 months, and that the zzso zzso would resolve over 2 zzso 

zzso dogs underwent a 90-minute coronary artery zzso followed by zzso The area at risk, as measured with zzso (9 zzso was comparable to the size of the zzso zone on zzso images 2 days later zzso versus zzso of the left zzso zzso and the 2 measures correlated zzso The zzso zone was significantly smaller zzso both zzso To test whether the zzso zzso would exhibit partial functional recovery over time, 8 animals were zzso on day 2 and 2 months zzso zzso strain was mapped with displacement zzso with zzso zzso zzso as detected by a zzso zone on zzso images, zzso and regional zzso zzso strain partially improved from zzso to zzso zzso over 2 zzso 

These findings are consistent with the premise that the zzso zzso depicts the area at risk, a zone of zzso and zzso injured zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso The persistence of zzso zzso allows zzso zzso to delineate the area at risk 2 days after zzso zzso zzso
