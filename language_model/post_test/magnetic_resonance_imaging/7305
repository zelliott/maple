The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the most common treatments for attention deficit zzso disorder zzso This study compares the zzso zzso and zzso effects of acute doses of MPH and zzso within zzso zzso boys during working memory zzso 

A total of 20 zzso zzso boys underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a zzso zzso zzso task three times, under a single clinical dose of either zzso zzso or zzso in a randomized, zzso zzso zzso zzso To test for zzso effects, brain zzso in zzso under each drug condition were compared with that of 20 zzso healthy control zzso 

Relative to healthy boys, zzso boys under zzso showed impaired performance only under high zzso load together with significant zzso in the bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso zzso Both drugs zzso the performance deficits relative to zzso zzso significantly enhanced right zzso zzso relative to MPH within patients, and significantly zzso its zzso relative to zzso zzso by contrast, both relative to zzso and zzso as well as relative to controls, zzso the left inferior frontal zzso zzso but only during zzso Both drugs enhanced zzso zzso in zzso relative to control boys and zzso the zzso network, which were zzso associated with the reduced zzso zzso and performance deficits, suggesting compensation zzso 

The study shows both shared and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso right zzso zzso while MPH zzso left IFC zzso suggesting zzso zzso effects on prefrontal regions zzso zzso
