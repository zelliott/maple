zzso is an age-related cognitive decline which is indicated by an early zzso of cortical and zzso zzso zzso those zzso changes can help to understand the disease development and contribute to disease early prediction and zzso But modeling that can best capture brain structural zzso and can be valid in both disease zzso and interpretation is extremely zzso The current study aimed to establish a zzso approach for modeling the magnetic resonance imaging zzso structural complexity of the brain using the framework of hidden zzso models zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso dimension and zzso were used to extract structural features of the zzso and zzso zzso method was applied to convert extracted feature zzso to zzso zzso The output zzso zzso were then zzso to estimate parameters for zzso To validate its accuracy and zzso experiments were carried out on individuals who were characterized as zzso and mild Alzheimer's zzso Four zzso were constructed based on the cohort of zzso young, middle-aged, elder and zzso elder subjects zzso zzso was carried out using a data set including both zzso and zzso individuals with a wide age zzso 

The proposed zzso have succeeded in recognition of individual who has mild Alzheimer's disease and achieved a better zzso accuracy compared to other related works using different zzso zzso have shown the ability of the proposed modeling for recognition of early zzso 

The findings from this research will allow individual zzso to support the early diagnosis and prediction of zzso By using the brain zzso zzso developed in our proposed research, it will be more efficient, robust and can be easily used by clinicians as a zzso tool for zzso imaging zzso for early prediction of zzso
