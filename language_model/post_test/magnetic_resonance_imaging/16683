Although regional brain abnormalities underlying spatial working memory zzso deficits in schizophrenia have been identified, little is known about which brain circuits are functionally disrupted in the zzso network in zzso We investigated zzso zzso functional connectivity in schizophrenia using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data collected during a memory task that required analysis of spatial information in object zzso Twelve schizophrenia patients and 11 normal control subjects zzso Patients had zzso performance deficits and deficient neural zzso in various brain areas, especially in the high zzso load zzso zzso of the zzso of regional brain zzso zzso by the zzso task revealed evidence of functional zzso between prefrontal and zzso visual association areas in zzso Under low zzso load, we found reduced functional associations between zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso in the right zzso in zzso Under high zzso load, we found evidence for further functional zzso in patients, including additional reduced functional associations between left zzso and right visual areas, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as between right inferior frontal zzso and right zzso Greater zzso cortical functional connectivity was associated with better zzso performance in controls, but not in zzso These results suggest that zzso functional connectivity associated with the maintenance and control of visual information is central to zzso and that disruption of this functional network zzso zzso deficits in zzso
