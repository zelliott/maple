To zzso a methodology for ex zzso imaging of zzso vessel wall changes using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In phantom studies and studies on intact ex zzso zzso and human hearts, various filling zzso of zzso and zzso contrast agents have been zzso to enable filling and zzso of the coronary arteries for optimal zzso of zzso vessel wall changes with both zzso Various proportions of zzso zzso zzso CT contrast agent and zzso MR contrast agent containing zzso particles have been zzso Imaging parameters have been zzso for high resolution plaque imaging using a four zzso CT scanner and a zzso T MR zzso 

Phantom studies and studies on ex zzso zzso and human hearts demonstrated optimal proportion of zzso cellulose and CT contrast agent to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cellulose zzso MR contrast agent, zzso These proportions provided optimal zzso of the vessel zzso in the zzso images with 250 zzso zzso and good signal suppression within the vessel zzso in the MR images, resembling in zzso imaging zzso After retrospective matching with zzso zzso zzso of the human ex zzso specimens could be identified on zzso and zzso zzso 

Using an zzso mixture of zzso zzso zzso and zzso contrast agents, zzso of zzso vessel wall changes is zzso and zzso to various ex zzso zzso
