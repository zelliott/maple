Stem cell therapy is an emerging treatment zzso in cardiovascular zzso The best cell type and delivery method in different cardiovascular diseases remain to be zzso 

The zzso trial is a phase 2, zzso zzso randomized, zzso trial of zzso delivery of zzso bone-marrow derived zzso zzso cells zzso in patients with chronic zzso heart zzso A total of 60 patients will be zzso in a zzso pattern to receive zzso injections of either zzso or zzso Patients will be followed up for 12 zzso 

Bone zzso will be obtained by aspiration from the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells will be isolated, and culture will be expanded for 6 to 8 zzso A total of 12 to 15 zzso or zzso injections will be placed in an zzso viable region of the zzso using the zzso zzso system zzso zzso Systems Group, Johnson & Johnson, zzso zzso 

The primary zzso is change in left zzso zzso volume, measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Secondary zzso are left zzso ejection zzso zzso volumes, wall zzso and zzso wall zzso measured by zzso or CT in addition to measurement of zzso zzso tissue by zzso Other secondary zzso are safety of treatment, clinical symptoms and functional capacity, weekly angina attacks, use of short-term zzso and quality of zzso 

A randomized, zzso zzso clinical trial of zzso delivery of zzso in patients with zzso heart failure has been set up to confirm the positive findings in zzso clinical zzso
