Using both quantitative zzso analysis and visual zzso the MR imaging response of brain zzso to zzso zzso zzso was zzso studied in 49 zzso Compared to the zzso analysis, the precision of the visual zzso (by two readers in zzso of tumor response was zzso Also the zzso response was related to the clinical zzso Six weeks after zzso follow-up MR was performed in 27 of 49 zzso Of the remaining 22 patients without follow-up zzso 9 had died or deteriorated due to zzso zzso In four patients zzso tumor increase was demonstrated by zzso zzso in the other 23 patients tumor remained stable zzso or decreased zzso In 11 of the 27 patients, a second follow-up MR was obtained 26 zzso after zzso demonstrating tumor increase in seven patients zzso Complete zzso between both assessment methods was noticed in only 4 of 38 MR scans (27 scans 6 zzso after zzso and 11 scans 26 zzso after zzso with small quantitative changes in tumor zzso In 26 of 38 zzso observations 6 and 26 zzso after zzso there was a positive correlation between change in tumor volume and change in the zzso zzso Visual zzso analysis seems an appropriate method of routine therapy monitoring in individual patients with brain zzso The zzso analysis should be considered if precise response monitoring becomes zzso
