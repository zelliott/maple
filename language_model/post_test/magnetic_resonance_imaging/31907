The neural basis of human pitch perception is not fully zzso It has been argued that the auditory zzso in the two zzso are zzso such that certain right auditory cortical regions have a relatively finer resolution in the frequency domain than zzso regions in the left auditory cortex, but this concept has not been tested zzso Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to test this specific zzso Healthy volunteers were scanned while passively listening to zzso zzso sequences in which the pitch distance between consecutive tones was varied in a zzso zzso As predicted, brain zzso in a region of right lateral auditory cortex, corresponding to the zzso zzso was zzso responsive to increasing pitch distance, even across the fine changes in zzso In contrast, the zzso signal at the zzso left cortical region was relatively constant as a function of pitch distance, except at the largest pitch zzso The results support the model of relative zzso specialization and indicate that the right secondary auditory zzso has a finer pitch resolution than the zzso
