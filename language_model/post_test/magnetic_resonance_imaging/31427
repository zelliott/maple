To help guide future outcomes research regarding the use of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in patients with acute knee trauma in an emergency department setting, with use of prospective data from a zzso clinical trial and value of information zzso 

A total of 189 patients zzso male, 66 zzso mean age, zzso zzso were randomly assigned to undergo zzso alone zzso zzso zzso or zzso and MR imaging zzso zzso zzso Institutional review board approval and informed consent zzso consent for zzso were zzso During 6 months of zzso data on quality of life and 39 cost parameters were zzso zzso analysis was used to estimate the expected benefit of future research to eliminate the decision uncertainty that remained after trial zzso In addition, the parameters that were responsible for most of the decision uncertainty were identified, the expected benefits of various study designs were zzso and the optimal sample size was zzso 

Only three parameters were responsible for most of the decision zzso number of zzso zzso cost of an overnight hospital stay, and friction zzso A study in which data on these three parameters are gathered would have an optimal sample size of zzso patients per arm and would be expected to result in a zzso benefit of euro zzso million or 70 zzso zzso 

The optimal study design for use of MR imaging to evaluate acute knee trauma involves a trial in which there are zzso patients per trial arm, and data on the number of zzso zzso cost of an overnight hospital stay, and friction costs are zzso
