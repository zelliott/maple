Images reconstructed from zzso phased array coils and presented as the square root of the sum of the squares of the signals received by the individual elements have a distribution of signal and noise that zzso the relationship between the image intensity and the underlying zzso The distortion is zzso for long echo times for which the zzso ratio zzso may be zzso When measuring zzso or zzso this signal distortion leads to biased estimates of these zzso We demonstrate this effect and its dependence on the image zzso and the number of elements in a phased array zzso We evaluated the effects of four techniques for calculating zzso from data acquired in phased array coils zzso zzso least squares, zzso table zzso and maximum likelihood zzso zzso The zzso zzso gave the most accurate zzso in the presence of this zzso
