To explore the potential of zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso guided zzso of the prostate in a patient cohort with prior negative ultrasound guided zzso 

zzso men with suspected prostate cancer underwent zzso prostate zzso under real-time imaging control in zzso zzso 

zzso of the prostate was detected in 39 of 96 zzso For individual core zzso zzso yielded a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso When zzso patients according to the zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio, the prostate cancer discovery rate was significantly higher in the group with ratios less than zzso zzso 

zzso biopsy of the prostate is a diagnostic option for patients with suspected prostate cancer and a history of repeatedly negative zzso zzso zzso Combined with the zzso zzso ratio, it is a highly effective method for detecting prostate zzso
