This review explores the present status of contrast media available for zzso zzso studies, the magnetic resonance zzso sequences adapted to zzso zzso acquisitions, and the issue of zzso zzso zzso To date, only low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso have been used in clinical protocols for zzso zzso With the availability of fast MR acquisition techniques to follow the zzso distribution of the contrast agent in the zzso the zzso tracking technique represents the more widely used protocol in MR zzso zzso On zzso imaging, the zzso zone appears with a delayed and lower signal enhancement compared with normally zzso zzso Visual analysis of the image series can be greatly improved by image zzso to obtain relative zzso zzso zzso With an zzso zzso zzso zzso are in theory easier to analyze in terms of zzso In experimental studies, different zzso or blood pool MR contrast agents have been tested to measure quantitative zzso zzso If a simple zzso kinetic model is developed with MR contrast agents, one important clinical application will be the evaluation of the functional consequence of coronary zzso zzso zzso evaluation of the coronary zzso
