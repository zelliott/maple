zzso resonance zzso has matured to the point where clinically useful images can be acquired in half an hour or zzso In this paper, the role of zzso imaging techniques is primarily zzso Specifically, the optimal imaging zzso zzso and reconstruction techniques are evaluated for moving zzso A zzso of zzso known as zzso with low flip angles, short repeat times, and a thick slab has been found to yield the best zzso survey scan of the zzso vessels with roughly 1 X 1 X zzso resolution in each of the processed images zzso For the faster flowing zzso a zzso scout with as short a TE as possible is required to avoid spin zzso zzso is accomplished in both cases by acquiring thin slab zzso thin zzso larger flip angle, longer repeat time zzso zzso Different choices of zzso sequences and directions are also zzso These choices are discussed from a practical and theoretical zzso In particular, improvements in contrast and resolution are evaluated using zzso 512 zzso small fields of view and constrained reconstruction for both zzso zzso echo sequences and zzso thin slice long zzso zzso zzso A resolution of zzso zzso is recommended to obtain sufficient image quality for consistent clinical interpretation of zzso and vessel zzso
