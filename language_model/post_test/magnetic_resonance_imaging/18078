zzso evidence shows that alcohol exerts its effects on social behavior via zzso of zzso zzso to affective zzso Given that affective processing involves dynamic interactions between the zzso and the prefrontal zzso zzso zzso effects are likely to extend beyond regional changes in brain activity to changes that manifest on a broader functional circuit zzso 

The current study examines zzso effects on functional connectivity zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso during the processing of zzso stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In a randomized, double blind, zzso zzso zzso design, 12 heavy, social drinkers performed an zzso task designed to probe zzso response to zzso stimuli zzso fearful, and happy zzso following acute zzso of alcohol or zzso zzso connectivity between the zzso and zzso was examined and compared between alcohol and zzso sessions using a conventional generalized zzso interaction zzso zzso 

Relative to zzso alcohol reduced functional zzso between the zzso and the right zzso zzso zzso during processing of both angry and fearful zzso Alcohol also reduced functional zzso between the zzso and left zzso during processing of happy zzso 

These preliminary findings suggest that zzso effects on social behavior may be zzso by zzso in functional connectivity between the zzso and zzso during processing of emotional zzso
