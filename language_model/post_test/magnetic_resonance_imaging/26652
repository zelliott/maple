Human decision-making involving independent events is often biased and affected by prior zzso Using a controlled task that allows us to manipulate prior zzso the present study examined the effect of prior outcomes on subsequent decisions in a group of young zzso We found that participants were more zzso after losing a gamble zzso than after winning a gamble zzso a pattern resembling the zzso zzso zzso zzso data revealed that decisions after zzso were associated with increased zzso in the zzso network, but decreased zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso The increased zzso behavior after a loss showed a trend of positive correlation with zzso in the zzso network and the left lateral zzso zzso but a trend of negative correlation with zzso in the zzso and zzso In addition, there was a trend of positive correlation between zzso zzso in the left lateral frontal zzso and subsequent increased zzso zzso These results suggest that a strong cognitive control mechanism but a weak affective decision-making and reinforcement learning mechanism that usually contribute to flexible, zzso decisions can lead to decision biases involving random zzso This has significant implications for our understanding of the zzso fallacy and human decision making under zzso
