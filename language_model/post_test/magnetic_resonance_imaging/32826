The aim of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso study of anatomical brain data was to investigate linear and zzso age-related zzso of zzso matter volume in the human brain during the adult zzso To date, there are only a few structural brain studies investigating local zzso aspects at the zzso level, zzso without using anatomical zzso as a zzso zzso zzso we analyzed zzso zzso MR images of healthy adult brains with an age range of 19 to 86 years, including 161 scans of subjects with ages 60 and zzso We found that the gray matter volume in some regions did not zzso decrease over time, but rather exhibited a delayed zzso zzso age zzso were observed in the zzso zzso lobe regions, the zzso zzso and parts of the zzso Their zzso indicated a preservation of zzso matter volume during the early adult zzso Interestingly, we found zzso zzso matter structural dynamics specifically in parts of the brain that have been extensively discussed in the context of learning and zzso We propose a hypothesis in relation to the functional role of these brain regions that may explain these zzso
