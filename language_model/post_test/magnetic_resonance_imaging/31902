zzso blood volume zzso zzso functional contrast can be obtained by the vascular space occupancy zzso zzso zzso relies on zzso inversion for zzso blood signals, but the zzso of zzso at magnetic fields higher than 3 T is difficult due to zzso zzso values of tissue and blood water and a stronger zzso blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso To improve functional zzso sensitivity, we proposed to use zzso with zzso inversion zzso Computer simulations showed that the zzso approach significantly increases functional sensitivity compared to the original zzso in a stronger magnetic field with a shorter repetition zzso To examine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments were performed on zzso cats during visual stimulation at zzso zzso Unlike simultaneously acquired zzso zzso the zzso signal peaked at zzso zzso from the surface of the zzso and was localized to the middle cortical zzso The zzso at half zzso response across the zzso was zzso for zzso than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), suggesting that zzso is better localized to zzso active sites than zzso zzso The magnitude of the zzso change in the middle zzso was zzso with our experimental zzso corresponding to a relative zzso change of approximately zzso when baseline zzso was assumed to be zzso in a zzso zzso The signal response profile across the cortex, the calculated zzso change, and the time course of zzso zzso were similar to those of previously obtained zzso zzso with contrast agent in the same animal model, suggesting that zzso measures predominantly functional zzso zzso
