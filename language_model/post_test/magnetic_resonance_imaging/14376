zzso imaging of zzso zzso in the human brain has been carried out with two data acquisition zzso by observation of the free induction zzso zzso signal and by a short spin echo zzso The zzso spectral images and zzso resolved zzso are zzso Spin echo observation is found to provide zzso of superior quality, and by suitably selecting the sequence timing, no significant increase in zzso losses, as compared with the zzso method, is zzso zzso images with approximately zzso zzso spatial resolution are obtained within times of 37 zzso at zzso T field zzso
