A method is proposed for zzso the zzso rate, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso that influence the local temperature during high intensity focused ultrasound zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, zzso heating experiments (N zzso zzso were performed ex zzso on zzso zzso kidney (N zzso 5) under different flow zzso The resulting zzso temperature variations were measured zzso by rapid zzso zzso zzso The zzso transfer zzso model was adapted to describe the zzso evolution of tissue temperature in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by fitting the integrated zzso load zzso integration of the zzso zzso zzso in time with an zzso solution of the zzso equation proposed for single point zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined independently by analyzing the spatial spread of the temperature in time during the cooling zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be independent of flow, with mean and average values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso K zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A linear dependence of the calculated zzso rate with flow was observed with a slope of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was found to act as a zzso term with respect to temperature but with no effect on the spatial spread of temperature which only depends on the zzso zzso All results were in excellent agreement with the zzso model, indicating that this model is suitable to predict the evolution of temperature in zzso zzso This quantitative approach allows for determination of tissue zzso parameters with excellent precision zzso zzso and may thus help in zzso the influence of zzso during MR guided high intensity focused ultrasound zzso
