This work was done to compare the zzso of various imaging methods, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso retrograde zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, especially, magnetic resonance zzso zzso for zzso zzso duct zzso 

zzso such patients who were operated and confirmed by pathology were zzso Sixty patients had been examined by zzso 52 by CT; 20 by zzso 9 by zzso and 20 by zzso The results of these imaging methods were compared with those of operative and pathological zzso 

The diagnostic accuracy rates of site location were US zzso CT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The quality diagnostic accuracy rates were US zzso CT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is superior to zzso CT, zzso and zzso not only in demonstrating the position but also the nature of zzso zzso duct zzso
