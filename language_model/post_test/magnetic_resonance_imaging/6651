zzso visual stimuli evoke enhanced responses in the visual zzso To test whether this reflects zzso influences from the zzso on sensory processing, we used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in human patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso Twenty-six patients with zzso in the amygdala, the zzso or both, plus 13 matched healthy controls, were shown pictures of fearful or neutral faces in zzso or zzso positions on the zzso All subjects showed increased zzso zzso zzso when the faces were in zzso zzso Both healthy individuals and those with zzso damage showed increased zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso when they were shown fearful faces, but this was not the case for individuals with damage to the amygdala, even though visual areas were structurally zzso The distant influence of the zzso was also evidenced by the zzso relationship between zzso damage and the level of emotional zzso in the zzso zzso Our data show that combining the zzso and zzso approaches can help reveal the source of functional zzso influences between distant but interconnected brain zzso
