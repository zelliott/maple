zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso echo and zzso sequences was applied to healthy volunteers and neurological patients to evaluate the feasibility of detecting and zzso the motor zzso Time course of the change in signal intensity by an alternate repetition of motor task zzso hand) and rest periods was also zzso The motor zzso was localized as the area of signal increase in zzso of 45 healthy volunteers by zzso echo method, which mainly reflected the cortical zzso and zzso of 30 healthy volunteers by zzso method, which mainly reflected the cerebral zzso Among 21 volunteers who participated in the both studies, success rate in the zzso for the motor zzso was zzso (21 zzso by zzso echo method and zzso (17 zzso by zzso zzso It was also shown from the time course of the change in signal intensity that signal increase in the most significantly activated area generally corresponded with the periods of the motor task, and the zzso between the onset of signal increase and the onset of motor task was usually about 4 zzso In four of 6 patients with brain zzso the motor zzso was zzso although activated areas were displaced or zzso The results indicate that zzso either with zzso echo or zzso zzso is a useful method for zzso the primary motor area activated during the motor task and clinically available for zzso evaluation of the anatomical relation between brain tumors and the motor area before surgical zzso
