This report describes a young patient with a rapidly progressive zzso caused by collapse of a severely zzso zzso spine, which led to impairment of zzso zzso 

To highlight the treatment strategy, difficulty of diagnosis, operative stabilization, and zzso 

Little is known about natural history, treatment options, and results of this zzso 

The magnitude of bone loss was measured by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso Laboratory investigations also were performed before and during zzso in an attempt to establish a zzso These data constituted the zzso information required to assess later results of medical and surgical zzso 

An extensive evaluation of possible underlying zzso failed to identify a specific zzso Before and during zzso bone mineral zzso were given, partially correcting the bone mineral content as measured on repeated zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was partially corrected, from 100 degrees to 70 degrees zzso zzso zzso a combined anterior and zzso stabilization was performed from zzso to zzso using a zzso fibula zzso a double zzso rod system zzso Cleveland, zzso and a zzso zzso zzso bone cement to reinforce the zzso zzso At follow-up assessment 40 months surgery, the patient was zzso and fully zzso with zzso showing complete incorporation of the zzso and no loosening of the fixation zzso 

The diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties of progressive spine zzso caused by severe osteoporosis in young patients emphasizes the importance of a thoroughly planned treatment zzso zzso is recommended to stop progression of the zzso or even partially correct it, and to allow time to search for the diagnosis and bone mineral zzso zzso treatment using zzso zzso zzso zzso and a strong fixation device was zzso zzso carbonated zzso zzso bone cement was successfully used to reinforce zzso screw zzso
