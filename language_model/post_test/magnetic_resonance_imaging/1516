In evaluating the success of deep brain stimulation zzso the benefit for the patient is the most important zzso Nevertheless, correct placement of zzso should also be determined in terms of their zzso zzso zzso we propose a suite of different imaging zzso and further processing, which leads to an exact zzso and statistically comparable documentation of zzso zzso zzso consecutive patients with a total of 85 implanted zzso zzso were evaluated with respect to zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed in all patients, 34 patients received zzso in 18 patients zzso X-ray of the zzso was performed in zzso and lateral projections, whereas 6 patients were additionally evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso fusion between zzso sets and calculation of coordinates for zzso zzso In zzso the zzso of each zzso contact could be delineated in relation to zzso reference structures, whereas zzso allowed zzso for zzso of zzso zzso within zzso nucleus or zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso fusion it could be shown that the difference between planned target coordinates and coordinates of the active zzso contact ranged below 1 zzso except for the zzso zzso The comparison with values obtained from zzso X-ray confirmed these zzso The sequential and complementary use of the described imaging zzso and further image processing provide clinically reliable and statistically comparable results to prove the exact zzso zzso positioning in zzso in addition to the objective and zzso improvements of the patients' zzso
