Execution of higher cortical functions requires zzso control to restrain habitual responses and meet changing task zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to show the neural zzso of response zzso during a zzso zzso The task has a frequent zzso stimulus to set up a zzso response tendency and a less frequent zzso signal for subjects to withhold their zzso We contrasted brain zzso between successful and failed zzso for individual subjects and compared groups of subjects with short and long zzso reaction zzso The two groups of subjects did not differ in their zzso failure rates or the extent of signal monitoring, error monitoring, or zzso frustration zzso The results showed that short zzso reaction time or more efficient response zzso was associated with greater zzso in the superior zzso and zzso frontal zzso Moreover, zzso of these zzso motor areas correlated zzso with zzso reaction zzso These brain regions may represent the neural zzso of response zzso independent of other cognitive and affective zzso
