To characterize human zzso using zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso and directly compare three zzso analysis zzso a conventional established technique and two novel techniques that aim to reduce erroneous zzso of the volume transfer constant between plasma and the zzso zzso space zzso zzso in areas of high blood zzso 

zzso patients with high-grade zzso underwent zzso Three kinetic models were applied to estimate zzso and fractional blood plasma volume zzso We applied the zzso and zzso zzso model without zzso input function zzso zzso the zzso model modified to include zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso model zzso 

zzso values were considerably higher than zzso and zzso values zzso zzso zzso and zzso were more comparable and closely correlated zzso with zzso generally higher than zzso zzso zzso Estimates of zzso and zzso also showed a significant difference zzso zzso however, these values were very closely correlated zzso zzso zzso maps showed zzso effects displaying numerous zzso These were not zzso on zzso and zzso maps but appeared on the corresponding zzso zzso indicating a failure of the zzso model in commonly occurring vascular zzso 

Both of the methods that incorporate a measured zzso and an estimate of zzso provide similar zzso information and avoid erroneous zzso of zzso in areas of significant vessel density, and thus allow a more accurate zzso of zzso zzso
