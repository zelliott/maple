In people with zzso syndrome zzso zzso deletion syndrome zzso a single zzso deletion of zzso zzso causes a wide spectrum of cognitive deficits ranging from global learning difficulties to specific cognitive zzso People with zzso are also at high risk of developing zzso disorder and zzso spectrum disorders in childhood, and schizophrenia in adolescence or adult zzso However, the zzso of zzso and the relationship between abnormalities in brain anatomy and zzso is poorly zzso Thus, we studied the zzso of zzso children using fully automated zzso zzso zzso and manually traced single zzso zzso zzso Also, we investigated whether those brain regions that differed significantly between groups were related to zzso differences within children with zzso We compared the brain zzso of 39 children and adolescents with zzso zzso age: 11 years, zzso zzso zzso zzso 67, zzso zzso and 26 sibling controls zzso age: 11 years, zzso zzso zzso zzso 102, zzso zzso Using zzso we found, after correction for zzso that individuals with zzso compared with controls had a significant reduction in zzso zzso matter, and white matter reductions in the frontal zzso zzso and internal zzso Using single zzso analysis, we found that people with zzso had a significant zzso zzso zzso reduction in bulk volume zzso in the zzso zzso but a larger right zzso nucleus and lateral zzso Further, within people with zzso there was a significant positive correlation between severity of zzso zzso score and zzso matter volume of the zzso regions and the corpus zzso zzso emotional problems and zzso matter volume of zzso zzso and zzso social zzso difficulties and zzso matter in zzso zzso Thus, subjects with zzso have widespread changes in brain zzso particularly affecting white matter, zzso zzso and zzso Also, within zzso regionally specific differences in brain development may partially zzso zzso zzso We suggest that there is preliminary evidence for specific vulnerability of the zzso and zzso networks in zzso
