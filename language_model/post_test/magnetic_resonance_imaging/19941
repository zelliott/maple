zzso zzso is a type of task specific idiopathic focal zzso and has an incompletely understood zzso The present study zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate what type of brain activity zzso with writer's zzso and its zzso zzso 

Ten patients with writer's zzso were age and gender matched with ten healthy control subjects in a block zzso zzso were scanned by zzso while performing three zzso visually zzso tasks with MR Vision zzso zzso zzso writing, zzso writing with finger and zzso writing with a zzso Data was zzso using zzso software for groups of patients and zzso 

The patients with writer's zzso showed significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso (especially the zzso motor zzso zzso zzso cortex, supplementary motor cortex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in writing with a pencil compared with zzso whereas there was no obvious difference between patients and controls during writing with zzso Furthermore, these differences exist in the zzso activated maps for zzso with a zzso minus zzso with zzso of patients, when the zzso of zzso area and zzso in controls zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso motor zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the patients with writer's zzso suggest dysfunction of zzso zzso and zzso loop might play a zzso role in writer's zzso
