The Multi-Ethnic Study of zzso zzso is a zzso cohort study of individuals free of clinical cardiovascular disease designed to include a high proportion of ethnic zzso We selected MESA participants from the top 15th zzso of maximum carotid zzso media thickness by ultrasound and acquired high-resolution black blood zzso images through their carotid plaque before and after the intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and outer wall contours were defined using zzso analysis zzso We analyzed only plaques with a maximum thickness zzso zzso by zzso zzso and assessed zzso risk factor associations with zzso core presence by multivariable zzso zzso 

A zzso core was present in 151 zzso of the zzso After controlling for age, ethnicity, sex, maximum zzso wall zzso hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and zzso zzso compared with participants in the lowest zzso of total plasma cholesterol, the zzso of having a zzso core for participants in the middle and highest zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso None of the other risk factors was associated with zzso zzso 

In persons with thickened carotid walls, plasma total cholesterol, but not other established coronary heart disease risk factors, is strongly associated with zzso core presence by zzso High total cholesterol may be associated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the general zzso
