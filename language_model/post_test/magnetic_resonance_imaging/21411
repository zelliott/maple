zzso zzso zzso is a severe inflammatory zzso disease of the zzso in which a zzso role of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Although zzso is expressed in human cortex, recent zzso studies have failed to find any evidence of cortical zzso in zzso 

To zzso in zzso the occurrence of focal and diffuse cortical pathology in zzso 

We studied 30 patients with zzso 30 patients with zzso multiple sclerosis zzso and 30 normal controls zzso zzso and NC were zzso and zzso to zzso The presence of cortical zzso zzso was evaluated on double inversion recovery sequence and cortical thickness zzso by the application of zzso on 3 zzso fast field echo zzso zzso 

No zzso was observed in NC or in zzso while 83 zzso were identified in zzso zzso patients with zzso Although zzso did not differ from NC in the global zzso a mild thinning was observed in some cortical areas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Global and regional cortical thickness was significantly decreased in zzso compared to both zzso and zzso 

Our in zzso data further suggest that the zzso zzso process occurring in zzso spares most of the zzso zzso differs from multiple zzso where zzso and zzso are frequently found, even in early disease zzso Thus, zzso analysis of the zzso may be a potential diagnostic zzso especially in ambiguous zzso
