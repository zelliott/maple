The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the frequency of adverse events associated with supplemented and zzso zzso zzso sedation in a select group of children undergoing CT or MR imaging using the revised American Academy of zzso zzso monitoring and management guidelines for pediatric zzso The zzso guidelines do not recommend drug selection or zzso but define patient selection, discharge criteria, and monitoring standards for zzso zzso 

This prospective study included 410 children 4 years of age or younger who were scheduled for CT and MR imaging as zzso zzso children were physical status 1 or 2 as determined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status zzso and had no zzso to sedation per our institutional sedation zzso Children younger than 1 year old received only oral incremental doses of zzso zzso Children zzso years old received zzso plus incremental doses of zzso zzso Children between 2 and 4 years old who were not zzso zzso 30 zzso after zzso plus incremental zzso zzso were given 2 zzso zzso intramuscularly, with a maximum dose of 50 zzso All children were monitored according to the revised guidelines recommended by the committee on drugs of the zzso Vital signs and zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso were monitored continuously by registered nurses trained in pediatric advanced life support from the time of sedative drug administration until the recommended discharge criteria were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso that resolved spontaneously without any therapeutic intervention was seen in zzso of the zzso zzso group and in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso One child in the zzso zzso group had severe zzso zzso zzso and one child in the zzso zzso group had moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso Both required therapeutic zzso In both cases, the severity of the underlying medical disease was underestimated at the time of zzso medical zzso The success rate of sedation was zzso for all the children having zzso For those having MR imaging, success was zzso for children zzso years old and zzso for children less than 1 year zzso 

Use of supplemented and zzso zzso zzso sedation provides effective and safe sedation in children if the zzso guidelines for patient selection, monitoring, and management are zzso zzso medical screening and patient selection by knowledgeable medical personnel is important to exclude patients at high risk for life-threatening zzso Monitoring with zzso guidelines is essential for prompt detection and management of life-threatening zzso
