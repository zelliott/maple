zzso mapping of the activated brain, the location and extent of the activated area were determined, during motor tasks and sensory stimulation using zzso superimposed on 3 D anatomical zzso Twelve volunteers were zzso The zzso images were acquired using a 2 D zzso echo echo zzso imaging zzso The zzso anatomical MR images of the whole brain were acquired using a conventional zzso zzso echo zzso Motor tasks were sequential opposition of fingers, zzso a hand and elbow zzso zzso stimulation were administered by scrubbing the palm and sole with a washing zzso Visual stimulation consisted of full visual field zzso Data were analyzed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso images and anatomical images were reconstructed using both zzso zzso methods, and reconstructed for zzso and zzso zzso zzso areas were expressed using the three primary zzso Motor tasks activated the zzso primary motor area zzso the primary zzso area zzso and the supplementary motor area zzso zzso tasks activated the zzso S 1, zzso and secondary sensory area zzso zzso areas during full visual field stimulation was observed in the bilateral zzso zzso including both the primary zzso zzso brain mapping allowed zzso of the anatomical location and extent of the activated brain during both motor task and sensory zzso Using this method we could obtain a functional map similar to the zzso zzso
