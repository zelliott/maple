There is a great zzso in the amount of zzso brain zzso accompanying zzso In a previous study it was found that the degree of brain zzso in the white matter around zzso correlated with disruption of the layers (especially the cerebral zzso which separate the zzso from the white matter, as well as with the size and zzso zzso of the zzso In the present study zzso 9 zzso the volume of zzso was calculated by integration of the zzso zzso areas on serial zzso zzso The volume of zzso was zero in 3 cases and ranged from 11 to zzso zzso in the other 6 zzso The zzso also showed disruption of the zzso in all cases, ranging from slight to zzso zzso and zzso zzso were made at the level of maximum extension, using a mixed sequence at a field strength of zzso zzso From the zzso values tissue water content in % was calculated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso for cortex, and zzso zzso zzso + zzso for white zzso These had been obtained by zzso water content with relaxation rates, measured in zzso on human brain autopsy specimens which were subjected to zzso with distilled water or zzso by zzso zzso Mean water content amounted to zzso for normal cortex, zzso for normal white matter, and zzso for zzso white matter around the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
