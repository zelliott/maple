The objectives were to determine by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging zzso the target sites of zzso delivery in the eye during zzso compare zzso and zzso zzso zzso and monitor the distribution of a probe zzso in the anterior chamber and zzso after zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso constant current zzso and zzso zzso zzso density, 10 zzso was performed on three New Zealand White rabbits in zzso zzso injection and passive delivery were the zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments were conducted with the zzso device placed in the superior zzso away from the zzso and on the cornea adjacent to the zzso zzso During zzso the current delivered into the eye was monitored using a probe zzso zzso with zzso The zzso of the zzso in the zzso and zzso humor after zzso passive delivery, and zzso injection were also determined by zzso 

With the short application time, passive diffusion did not deliver a significant amount of the zzso into the zzso Whereas zzso zzso delivered the zzso into the zzso zzso zzso delivered the zzso into the anterior zzso The current pathways during zzso were mainly from the zzso into the eye, perpendicular to the zzso interface beneath the zzso Electric current along the surface of the globe was relatively zzso With the present zzso zzso zzso the zzso penetrated the zzso and traveled as far as zzso zzso from the zzso interface into the zzso For zzso zzso the zzso penetrated the cornea and filled the entire anterior zzso 

zzso can be a useful technique in the study of the penetration of probe compounds in the eye during and after zzso such as in zzso protocol and device zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso are zzso and provide real-time data without zzso and compound zzso that can occur during dissection and zzso in traditional zzso zzso With zzso it was shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso injection deliver zzso to different parts of the zzso
