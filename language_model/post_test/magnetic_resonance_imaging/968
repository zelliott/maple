Our aim was to evaluate adrenal zzso in patients who underwent both zzso CT and chemical shift zzso to determine if zzso can be characterized with zzso when the findings of CT are zzso 

Between January 1999 and June 2003, 40 patients zzso adrenal zzso underwent zzso CT and chemical shift zzso and were zzso zzso zzso units, zzso chemical shift ratio, and zzso index were obtained for each adrenal zzso zzso analysis for loss of signal in each adrenal mass on the zzso images was also performed by two zzso and compared with the quantitative zzso A zzso zzso was diagnosed if the mass measured equal to or less than 10 zzso had an zzso chemical shift ratio of less than zzso and had a zzso index of greater than zzso or if the mass fulfilled two of the preceding criteria and had follow-up imaging without zzso 

The sensitivities and zzso for diagnosing a zzso zzso using the zzso zzso chemical shift ratio, zzso index, and zzso CT zzso analyses were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured equal to or less than 10 zzso had an zzso chemical shift ratio of less than zzso and had a zzso index of greater than zzso Eight masses zzso measured greater than 10 H but had an zzso chemical shift ratio of less than zzso and a zzso index greater than zzso and were unchanged at zzso 

Eight zzso of 13 adrenal zzso measuring greater than 10 H on zzso CT were definitively characterized with chemical shift zzso
