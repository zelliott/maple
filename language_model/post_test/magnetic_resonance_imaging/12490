zzso of blood zzso zzso is critical for zzso zzso experiments such as zzso spin labeling and cerebral blood zzso zzso using vascular space zzso The dependence of blood zzso zzso on zzso fraction zzso and oxygen zzso fraction zzso was determined at 7 T using in zzso bovine blood in a circulating system under zzso zzso Blood zzso zzso values for different conditions could be readily fitted using a zzso zzso and zzso model, which are described by a zzso zzso relaxation rate constant zzso It was found that zzso zzso zzso zzso 39 zzso for Y zzso 1 zzso zzso and 2010 zzso 41 zzso for Y zzso zzso zzso zzso for a typical zzso of zzso The blood zzso zzso values in the normal zzso range zzso from zzso to zzso and Y from zzso to zzso were determined to range from zzso to zzso zzso The influence of oxygen partial pressure zzso and the effect of plasma zzso for different zzso were also zzso It is discussed why blood zzso zzso values measured in zzso for human blood may be about zzso larger than found in zzso for bovine blood at the same field zzso
