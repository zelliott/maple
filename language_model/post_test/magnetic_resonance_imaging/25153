We hypothesized that after zzso short-term zzso exercise, when zzso demand is still high and zzso supply is not fully zzso higher zzso capacity muscle may exhibit slower muscle zzso after the exercise than low zzso capacity zzso Seven healthy male subjects performed a zzso voluntary zzso zzso exercise for 10 zzso The zzso rate after the exercise zzso in the finger zzso muscle was determined by near infrared continuous wave zzso zzso while zzso zzso was measured simultaneously by zzso magnetic resonance zzso Muscle oxygen consumption zzso zzso and muscle zzso capacity were evaluated using the rate of zzso zzso zzso The zzso blood flow zzso index at the end of exercise was measured using zzso There was a significant positive correlation between the zzso which ranged between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the time constant for zzso zzso which ranged between zzso s and zzso s zzso zzso At the end of the exercise, muscle zzso exceeded the resting level by approximately zzso while the zzso index exceeded the resting level by only zzso on zzso The zzso closely correlated with muscle zzso zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso Also, the estimated zzso balance zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with the zzso zzso zzso These results support our hypothesis that higher zzso capacity muscle shows slower muscle zzso after zzso short-term zzso exercise because the zzso after this type of exercise may be influenced more by muscle zzso than by zzso zzso
