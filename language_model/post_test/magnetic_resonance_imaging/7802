There are limited treatment options for tissue restoration and the prevention of degenerative changes in the zzso Stem cells have been a focus of intense zzso research into tissue zzso but limited clinical zzso In a randomized, zzso controlled study, the safety of the zzso injection of human zzso stem cells into the knee, the ability of zzso stem cells to promote zzso zzso following partial zzso and the effects of zzso stem cells on zzso changes in the knee were zzso 

A total of zzso patients at seven institutions underwent a partial zzso zzso A single zzso knee injection was given within seven to ten days after the zzso Patients were zzso to one of three treatment groups: Group A, in which patients received an injection of 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso stem zzso Group B, 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso stem zzso and the control group, a sodium zzso zzso zzso vehicle zzso Patients were followed to evaluate safety, zzso zzso the overall condition of the knee joint, and clinical outcomes at intervals through two zzso zzso included sequential magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

No zzso tissue formation or clinically important safety issues were zzso There was significantly increased zzso volume zzso a zzso as a zzso zzso determined by quantitative zzso in zzso of patients in Group A and zzso in Group B at twelve months post zzso zzso zzso zzso No patients in the control group met the zzso threshold for increased zzso zzso Patients with zzso changes who received zzso stem cells experienced a significant reduction in pain compared with those who received the control, on the basis of visual analog scale zzso 

There was evidence of zzso zzso and improvement in knee pain following treatment with zzso human zzso stem zzso These results support the study of human zzso stem cells for the apparent zzso zzso and protective zzso
