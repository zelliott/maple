zzso zzso acquisition zzso a modular hybrid imaging concept, was introduced zzso In this article it is demonstrated that the zzso principles can be applied to form a versatile combination of spin and zzso echoes for abdominal zzso This zzso approach, which essentially zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a sequential fashion, was used to implement a set of segmented and zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso was used in in zzso studies to perform high-resolution abdominal imaging in five healthy zzso The results demonstrate the feasibility of abdominal imaging using the proposed zzso approach and the potential of this technique to reduce imaging time while preserving image zzso
