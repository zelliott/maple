zzso and zzso studies suggest that zzso disease zzso causes cerebrovascular dysfunction, and therefore may enhance zzso to cerebrovascular disease zzso The objective of this study was to investigate this association in a memory clinic zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso status have all been linked to increased zzso risk in zzso and therefore the first aim of this study was to analyze the association between these zzso and zzso In 92 memory clinic patients the zzso association between zzso zzso the severity of zzso was investigated with linear zzso zzso Additionally, we studied whether zzso zzso modified the relation between vascular risk factors and zzso zzso was assessed on zzso through a visual rating zzso were adjusted for zzso The second aim of this study was to investigate the association between clinical zzso and zzso where zzso zzso was defined as zzso impairment in episodic memory, zzso zzso and an zzso concentration of zzso fluid zzso zzso 47 of the 92 patients had zzso 

No association between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso status and zzso severity was found, nor did these zzso zzso modify the relation between vascular risk factors and zzso Clinical zzso was not associated with zzso severity zzso Patients with more vascular risk factors had more zzso but this relationship was not convincingly modified by zzso zzso 

In this memory clinic population, zzso in patients with zzso was related to vascular risk factors and age, comparable to patients without zzso zzso in our study, the zzso and zzso evidence that zzso would zzso to zzso could not be translated zzso Further work, including replication of this work in a different and larger sample, is zzso
