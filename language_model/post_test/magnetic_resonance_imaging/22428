To evaluate the influence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for target definition for zzso zzso zzso zzso as a complementary zzso to zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso Because zzso show a high expression of zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso such as zzso offer the possibility of zzso zzso 

Twenty-six patients received zzso CT, zzso and zzso as part of their treatment zzso zzso was: World Health Organization zzso Grade 1 zzso WHO Grade 2 zzso WHO Grade 3 zzso and zzso zzso Six patients received zzso as primary treatment, 2 after zzso zzso 17 patients were treated for zzso zzso Dynamic PET scans were acquired before zzso over 60 zzso after intravenous injection of 156 zzso 29 zzso zzso These PET images were imported in the planning software for zzso Planning target volume zzso outlined on CT and zzso zzso was compared with zzso outlined on zzso zzso was defined with CT, zzso and PET and was actually used for zzso zzso 

zzso was smaller than zzso in 9 patients, the same size in 7 patients, and larger in 10 zzso Median zzso was zzso zzso median zzso was zzso zzso In all patients zzso delivered additional information concerning tumor zzso zzso was significantly modified based on zzso data in 19 zzso In 1 patient no tumor was exactly identified on zzso but was visible on zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso improves target definition for zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso targeting with fused zzso CT, and zzso resulted in significant zzso in target definition in zzso
