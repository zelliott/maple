zzso patients are less active and have reduced functional capacity compared to individuals with normal zzso zzso Muscle zzso and weakness may contribute to these zzso This investigation was undertaken to zzso the extent of zzso in the lower zzso muscles, to determine whether defects in muscle specific strength zzso per unit zzso or central nervous system zzso zzso are present, and to assess the relationship between muscle size and physical performance in a group of patients on zzso 

zzso dialysis subjects zzso 55 zzso 15 zzso and zzso healthy sedentary controls zzso 55 zzso 13 zzso were zzso zzso resonance imaging of the lower leg was used to determine the total zzso area zzso and the area of zzso and zzso tissue of the ankle zzso zzso zzso zzso strength was measured during a zzso voluntary contraction with and without superimposed zzso stimulation (N zzso 22 for dialysis subjects, N zzso 12 for zzso Physical activity was measured by zzso and gait speed was recorded as a measure of physical zzso 

zzso subjects were weaker, less active, and walked more slowly than zzso Total muscle compartment zzso was not significantly different between dialysis subjects and controls, but the zzso zzso was smaller in the dialysis patients even after adjustment for age, zzso and physical zzso Central zzso and specific strength were zzso zzso speed was correlated with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and increased zzso tissue are present in the muscle of patients on zzso The relationship between zzso area and strength is intact in this zzso Muscle zzso is associated with poor physical zzso Thus, interventions to increase physical activity or otherwise address zzso may improve performance and quality of zzso
