The purpose of our study was to evaluate the factors related to zzso and zzso pain during zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

For this retrospective study, we included 145 patients with 160 zzso who underwent zzso zzso zzso under local and IV conscious sedation from January 2006 to December zzso zzso pain was scored using the visual analog scale zzso immediately after the zzso Medical records with CT images were reviewed for patient factors, tumor zzso and procedural zzso We determined factors correlated with the higher level of zzso pain and the difference in zzso zzso between a group requiring additional analgesics while hospitalized and a group not requiring more zzso zzso analysis was performed using the zzso zzso rank sum test, the zzso test, and partial zzso correlation zzso 

On zzso analysis, patients with large tumors, previously zzso tumors, tumors adjacent to the zzso zzso and those who had undergone multiple zzso and longer duration of zzso reported a higher zzso during the zzso A significant correlation was seen between the distance of a tumor from the zzso zzso and the zzso On zzso analysis, tumor location adjacent to the zzso zzso was an independent predictor for a higher level of zzso zzso A group requiring additional analgesics while hospitalized reported a higher zzso than patients not requiring more zzso 

The location of a tumor adjacent to the zzso zzso is an independent predictor of higher pain level during zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso should be considered in patients with risk factors for increased zzso
