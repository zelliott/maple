The recently introduced new class of contrast agents zzso based on chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso may have a huge potential for the development of novel applications in the field of zzso In this work we explored the zzso properties of a series of zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso Ho, zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso which is the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These complexes possess two pools of zzso zzso represented by the coordinated water and the zzso zzso zzso displays the most interesting zzso properties when its zzso zzso resonance (16 zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Up to zzso suppression of the water signal is obtained at pH zzso As the exchange rate of zzso zzso is zzso zzso results to be an efficient zzso probe in the zzso pH zzso Moreover, a zzso method has been set up in order to remove the dependence of the observed pH responsiveness from the absolute concentration of the zzso zzso In fact, the use of a mixture of zzso and zzso whose zzso zzso pools are represented by the coordinated water zzso 40 zzso downfield zzso signal at zzso and zzso zzso respectively, produces a zzso zzso effect which is the function of the concentration ratio of the two zzso
