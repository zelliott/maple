zzso social interaction requires zzso the intention of another person's zzso zzso At a neural level, this process may involve neural activity in different systems, such as the zzso system zzso and the mirror zzso system zzso The aim of the present study was to explore the neural zzso of zzso gestures during observation and execution of these zzso Twenty participants watched video clips of an actor executing social gestures zzso zzso gestures zzso and meaningless gestures zzso During zzso data zzso participants were asked to observe zzso and subsequently to execute zzso one of two tasks: imitate the gesture presented zzso or perform a motor control task zzso For the contrast zzso we found zzso in the core areas of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inferior frontal cortex, the zzso part of zzso zzso as well as in areas related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso For zzso we found zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso right superior frontal zzso and middle zzso zzso The interaction of stimulus condition zzso vs zzso and task zzso vs zzso revealed zzso in the right zzso For the interaction between observation vs execution zzso vs zzso task zzso vs zzso and stimulus condition zzso vs zzso we found zzso in the right zzso Our data suggest that zzso is zzso processed in the zzso as well as in the zzso The zzso in zzso is enhanced during the processing of social gestures most likely due to their zzso zzso The zzso of zzso together with zzso frontal areas may contribute to zzso zzso The interaction in the zzso suggests an involvement of self-referential processes in the processing of social zzso
