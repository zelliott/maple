We explored the relationship between the site of vascular zzso and the response to zzso treatment in patients with acute zzso stroke and also considered the impact of mismatch zzso 

zzso was a prospective cohort study of patients treated with zzso zzso Patients with internal carotid artery zzso and middle cerebral artery zzso involvement were included in this zzso zzso and zzso status was assessed on zzso zzso clinical response was defined as an improvement of at least 8 points on the zzso Stroke zzso 

zzso rates were comparable in both groups zzso for zzso and 59% for zzso In the setting of zzso percentages of favorable clinical response were similar between patients with stroke due to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso was not zzso favorable outcomes were less frequent with zzso of the zzso zzso than the zzso zzso Among target mismatch patients, the adjusted odds ratio for favorable clinical response associated with zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for zzso zzso vs zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with favorable clinical response regardless of the location of the zzso zzso This association is strongest for target mismatch patients with zzso zzso Target mismatch patients with either zzso or zzso zzso appear to be good candidates for zzso zzso zzso
