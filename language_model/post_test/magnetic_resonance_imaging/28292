MR imaging of the zzso zzso was performed in 36 patients with zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso and 7 patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso The zzso appearance was classified into five zzso 1) fatty zzso 2) faint zzso 3) zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso and 5) diffuse zzso The zzso patterns of the zzso zzso were compared among the zzso zzso of acute zzso and the zzso patterns were correlated with zzso All five zzso patterns were observed in the zzso zzso in adult acute zzso and diffuse zzso was most commonly seen zzso A completely fatty zzso was also depicted in two cases zzso and faint signal in four cases zzso in spite of zzso acute zzso The zzso zzso of zzso tended to be demonstrated as a minimally abnormal zzso finding, which was significantly different from the other types of zzso The patients who showed fatty zzso or faint signal were thought to have a good zzso while diffuse or zzso zzso was regarded as a poor zzso zzso However, there were some exceptions to these rules, and no significant differences were revealed in prognosis between minimally abnormal and advanced zzso zzso We concluded that zzso of the zzso zzso could be useful in the assessment of tumor volume of adult acute zzso and that there were limitations to predicting prognosis on the basis of the zzso zzso
