zzso resonance has assumed a zzso role in the imaging evaluation of the zzso zzso to its zzso capability and superior soft tissue contrast, magnetic resonance imaging is the procedure of choice for a host of spinal disorders including degenerative disc disease, tumor zzso zzso and spinal zzso It represents the most accurate means of distinguishing between zzso disc zzso and zzso fibrosis, and it excels at the assessment of many zzso abnormalities such as infection, adjacent segment disc zzso and zzso zzso resonance imaging is also helpful in the evaluation of numerous diagnostic challenges that are less well resolved by other zzso This includes the distinction between disc zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of a facet zzso and the evaluation of numerous other soft tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso continue to be useful for numerous specific disorders and in those patients with metal hardware or zzso to magnetic resonance zzso Overall, however, magnetic resonance is the imaging procedure preferred for many spinal zzso This article is the first installment of a zzso series discussing the role of magnetic resonance imaging of spinal zzso Section 1 will describe the varying imaging zzso available and their relative advantages and zzso A consideration of magnetic resonance imaging techniques will follow, followed by a discussion of the imaging manifestations of early degenerative disc zzso Section 2 will be devoted to an in depth discussion of specific zzso processes encountered in patients with degenerative disc zzso Section 3 will end the series with a consideration of zzso imaging followed by a discussion of spinal zzso zzso and zzso
