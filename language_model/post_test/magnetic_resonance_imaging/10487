The relationship between zzso zzso activity as measured with zzso and the blood zzso level dependent zzso signal as measured during zzso is not zzso This work investigates the relationship by combining zzso and zzso measures of the strong increase in beta frequency power following movement, the so-called zzso beta rebound zzso The time course of the zzso as measured by zzso was included as a zzso in the zzso analysis, allowing identification of a region of associated zzso signal increase in the zzso cortex, with the most significant region in the zzso zzso The increase in the zzso signal suggests that the number of active zzso and/or their synaptic rate is increased during the zzso The duration of the zzso response curve in the zzso region is significantly longer than in the activated motor region, and is well fitted by a model including both motor and zzso zzso An zzso correlation between the zzso signal zzso associated with the zzso zzso and the zzso strength as measured with zzso provides further evidence that this region is a source of the zzso There is a strong zzso correlation between the zzso signal zzso in the zzso zzso during movement and the zzso strength as measured by zzso suggesting either that the motor activity itself, or zzso zzso associated with the motor activity, influence the zzso This work provides further evidence for a zzso signal change associated with changes in zzso zzso so opening up the possibility of studying other zzso zzso changes using zzso
