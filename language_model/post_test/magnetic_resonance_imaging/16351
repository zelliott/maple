We zzso solve the zzso equation by zzso the differential operators in real space using finite zzso The differential equation is either solved directly in time domain as zzso problem or in frequency domain as zzso zzso Especially the solution in time domain is highly efficient and suitable for arbitrary zzso and zzso As examples, we calculate the average zzso and the frequency distribution for zzso and cells which are idealized as zzso and zzso zzso The solution is compared with the commonly used zzso approximation and the zzso zzso While these approximations become exact in limiting cases zzso or large diffusion zzso they strongly zzso from the zzso solution for intermediate values of the diffusion zzso
