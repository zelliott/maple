While structural abnormalities of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso may zzso and predict psychosis zzso the relationships between functional deficits, cognitive and zzso zzso has yet to be explored in the zzso zzso An established measure of cognitive control zzso was administered to demographically matched zzso zzso zzso zzso schizophrenia zzso zzso and healthy control zzso zzso participants during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate these zzso zzso and zzso individuals demonstrated impaired context processing and reduced zzso zzso relative to HC individuals during increased cognitive control zzso zzso and zzso zzso ability to increase zzso activity in response to cognitive control demands was associated with better task zzso Task performance was also associated with severity of disorganization and poverty symptoms in zzso zzso These findings support more extensive studies using zzso to examine the clinical significance of prefrontal cortical functioning in the earliest stages of zzso
