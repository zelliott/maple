In humans, light enhances both alertness and performance during nighttime and daytime zzso and influences regional brain function zzso These effects do not zzso to classical visual responses but involve a zzso forming zzso system, which elicits greater zzso zzso zzso and behavioral responses to shorter light zzso than to zzso geared toward the visual system zzso During zzso the neural changes induced by light exposure, and their time courses, are largely zzso With functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we characterized the neural zzso of the alerting effect of daytime light by assessing the responses to an auditory oddball task zzso before and after a short exposure to a bright white zzso zzso improvement in zzso alertness was zzso related to responses in the zzso zzso In addition, light enhanced responses in a set of cortical areas supporting zzso oddball effects, and it prevented decreases of activity otherwise observed during continuous zzso zzso to light were remarkably zzso They declined within minutes after the end of the light zzso following various zzso time zzso These findings suggest that light can zzso activity of zzso structures involved in zzso thereby zzso promoting cortical activity in networks involved in ongoing zzso cognitive zzso
