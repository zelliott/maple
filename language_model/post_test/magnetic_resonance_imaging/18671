Right zzso zzso weight increases dependent on time after zzso zzso zzso and on zzso zzso The sequential changes in RV volume and zzso and their relations to left zzso zzso zzso after zzso are zzso We therefore examined the time course of RV zzso in rats with zzso zzso zzso was produced by left coronary artery zzso zzso eight, and zzso weeks later, zzso and RV zzso zzso were performed and zzso zzso were zzso For serial measurement of RV volumes and performance, zzso was performed 2 and 8 zzso after zzso The ratios of zzso heavy chain zzso to zzso and skeletal to cardiac zzso were determined for the RV and zzso after large zzso or sham zzso RV weight increased in rats with zzso as did RV zzso RV zzso zzso were shifted toward larger volumes 16 zzso after large zzso RV zzso pressure increased gradually over time; however, the gain in RV weight was always in excess of RV zzso zzso The ratios of skeletal to cardiac zzso and zzso to zzso were increased after zzso in both zzso in a similar zzso Because RV wall stress was not increased after zzso mechanical factors may not zzso explain zzso which maintained balanced loading conditions for the RV even after large zzso zzso
