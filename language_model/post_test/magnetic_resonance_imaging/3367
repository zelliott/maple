zzso constraints for traditional neural critical structures zzso zzso zzso brain zzso are a standard component of planning radiation therapy to the central nervous zzso Increasingly, investigators are becoming interested in accounting for the dose delivered to other zzso neural structures zzso zzso which are not easily identified on zzso zzso In this pilot study, a commercially available digital zzso was used to identify cryptic neural structures zzso zzso zzso and visual zzso in 6 patients who received intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso as part of zzso management of zzso zzso zzso The patient's original zzso plans were zzso with avoidance parameters for the newly identified critical zzso zzso was able to reduce both mean and maximum dose to the volumes of interest, with a more pronounced effect for zzso zzso Mean dose was reduced by zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso structures, respectively, with comparable reduction in maximum dose of zzso and zzso zzso zzso target coverage was not compromised, with an average change in coverage of zzso Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating tools for cryptic critical structure identification into the treatment planning process for zzso
