This study aimed to determine the relationship between delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and preserved ejection fraction zzso 

One hundred seven patients with zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso greater than 50% underwent zzso and DE zzso zzso zzso was identified with DE zzso We assessed whether zzso background, zzso zzso findings, presence of zzso scar, or number of scarred zzso segments was related to the occurrence of zzso zzso 

zzso age, family history of zzso and number of scarred segments differed between the patients with and without the zzso A family history of zzso and number of scarred segments were significantly related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The number of scarred segments is the significant DE zzso zzso related to zzso zzso in zzso with zzso zzso zzso and preserved zzso
