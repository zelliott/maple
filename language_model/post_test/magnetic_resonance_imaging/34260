A simple zzso model was used to study the effects of water exchange on the signal produced by an inversion recovery prepared rapid zzso sequence during the first passage of a low dose of an zzso contrast zzso Water exchange at intermediate rates of exchange zzso zzso between the vascular and zzso spaces caused the form of the signal changes during the first pass to be dependent on both the fractional sizes of the vascular and zzso compartments and on the exchange zzso Unless the effects of exchange are minimized by using a very short inversion time, parameters such as the peak height and area under the curve will be affected by regional and/or pathological variations in the exchange rate and the size of the vascular zzso The mean transit time zzso is, however, less affected by water zzso Experimental zzso data produced by zzso zzso injections of iron oxide particles were studied in five pigs at zzso zzso The zzso as derived from the zzso curves, without zzso with the zzso input function, was well correlated with the zzso blood flow zzso as measured using radioactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 52, P zzso zzso Other zzso parameters such as the peak height or area under the curve exhibited either a poorer, or no, correlation with the zzso The data suggest that the zzso of the first pass of an zzso contrast agent may be a zzso quantitative method for assessing zzso blood flow in zzso
