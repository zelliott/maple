Stem cell therapy has emerged as a promising addition to traditional treatments for a number of zzso However, harnessing the therapeutic potential of stem cells requires an understanding of their fate in zzso zzso cell tracking can provide knowledge about mechanisms responsible for functional improvement of host zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso have been used to label and zzso various cell types with magnetic resonance imaging zzso In this study we performed experiments designed to investigate the biological properties, including zzso viability and differentiation capacity of zzso cells zzso labeled with clinically approved zzso 

zzso and mouse zzso were isolated, zzso and incubated with zzso zzso zzso alone or with zzso zzso or zzso zzso for 4 or 24 zzso zzso efficiency was evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso Cell proliferation and viability were evaluated in zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could be induced to differentiate to zzso zzso and zzso We analyzed zzso retention in zzso with or without zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso were labeled when incubated with zzso for 4 or 24 zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso whereas labeling of zzso incubated with zzso alone was zzso zzso capacity was maintained in zzso incubated with zzso and zzso for 4 zzso however, after 24 zzso it was zzso zzso incubated with zzso and zzso were efficiently zzso by zzso they maintained proliferation and viability for up to 7 days and remained competent to zzso After 21 days zzso zzso with zzso C still showed a large number of zzso zzso 

The efficient and long lasting zzso and retention of zzso by zzso using a protocol employing zzso and zzso may be zzso to patients, since both zzso and zzso are approved for human zzso
