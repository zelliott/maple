Our aim was to compare the zzso zzso flow zzso values obtained by zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso cell zzso zzso in the upper zzso tract in the same patient zzso zzso patients with zzso proven primary SCC of the upper zzso tract were zzso zzso The zzso CT studies were obtained using a zzso zzso CT scanner running a commercial software package with a zzso zzso while the zzso MR studies zzso zzso were zzso with zzso MR zzso software based also on a zzso zzso The mean zzso values of SCC assessed by zzso CT and MR imaging were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso graph showed a zzso error in the zzso values measured by zzso and zzso zzso however, the degree of agreement was acceptable zzso limits of zzso zzso to zzso zzso analysis of the zzso values demonstrated significant correlation between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso The zzso maps generated by both zzso provided insights into the zzso zzso while analysis of the obtained zzso values demonstrated that both zzso may be used zzso in SCC in the upper zzso zzso
