An international workshop on the zzso measurement of iron was conducted by the National Institute of Diabetes and zzso and zzso Diseases zzso on April 17, 2001, to assess the current state of the science and to identify areas needing further zzso The workshop concluded that a clear clinical need is evident for zzso zzso safe, accurate, and readily available means of measuring body storage iron to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with iron overload from such disorders as zzso zzso zzso major, zzso cell disease, zzso zzso and zzso among zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso potentially provides the best available technique for examining the zzso distribution of excess iron in the body, but further research is needed to develop means of making zzso zzso zzso zzso provides the only zzso method to measure tissue iron stores that has been zzso zzso and used in clinical studies, but the complexity, cost, and technical demands of the zzso zzso instruments required at present have restricted clinical access to the zzso The workshop identified basic and clinical research opportunities for deepening our understanding of the physical properties of iron and iron zzso for further investigation of zzso as a method for quantitative zzso of tissue iron, especially in liver, heart and brain, and for development of improved methods and more widely available zzso for zzso zzso
