In this study, our objective was to identify the characteristic zzso features of brain zzso associated with a positive zzso fluid zzso tap test in patients with idiopathic normal pressure zzso zzso Patients diagnosed with clinical suspected zzso were zzso All patients underwent a zzso state examination, a brain zzso and a zzso tap zzso The zzso of clinical symptoms were rated before and after the zzso tap zzso zzso brain zzso findings including frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso upward bowing of the corpus zzso empty zzso narrowing of the zzso space at the high zzso marked zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso between narrowing of the zzso space at the high zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso or zzso image were zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso with possible zzso participated in this zzso The presence versus absence of empty zzso zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso sign zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were associated with positive zzso tap test zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value of the presence of either of these two zzso features in the prediction of zzso tap response were zzso 81, 80, and zzso zzso zzso brain zzso features can be used as markers for the identification of potential zzso tap test zzso in zzso zzso These features may serve as supplemental evidence in the diagnosis of zzso zzso
