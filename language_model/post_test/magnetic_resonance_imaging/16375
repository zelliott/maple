The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and accuracy of real-time zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a head-to-head comparison with zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso grading of MR severity is crucial for appropriate patient management but remains zzso zzso with zzso zzso acquisition has been recently proposed as the reference zzso 

A total of 64 patients with functional MR were zzso A zzso acquisition was applied to zzso zzso zzso volume zzso Color zzso zzso zzso was applied for direct zzso in zzso zzso view, of zzso effective zzso orifice area zzso zzso was subsequently calculated as zzso multiplied by the zzso integral of the zzso jet on the zzso zzso To assess the relative potential error of the conventional approach, color zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured in the zzso view and zzso calculated as circular zzso zzso was also calculated as elliptical zzso measuring zzso zzso also in the zzso zzso From these zzso zzso of zzso the zzso were also zzso 

The zzso measured by zzso zzso was significantly higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with a significant bias between these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso showed excellent correlation with zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso without a significant difference between these techniques zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approach from the zzso view significantly underestimated zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso The zzso elliptical approach demonstrated a better agreement with zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso of functional MR with zzso zzso is feasible and accurate as compared with zzso the currently recommended zzso zzso approach significantly zzso both zzso and zzso
