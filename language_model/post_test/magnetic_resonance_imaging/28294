zzso zzso areas zzso of the zzso tunnel were measured with the fingers in both extension and full zzso in 12 healthy volunteers using magnetic resonance zzso During zzso zzso muscles could be observed to move into the zzso tunnel up to different levels in all zzso For each of the volunteers, the level of the hook of zzso was used as the reference zzso The mean zzso measured at this level was considerably larger in zzso than in zzso 191 zzso zzso zzso 26) and 169 zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso In three volunteers, no difference in zzso between extension and zzso was measured at the zzso level, despite the presence of zzso muscles, whereas in these same volunteers at levels more zzso the zzso clearly increased during zzso The mean zzso for extension and zzso zzso and just zzso to the smallest level differed significantly, but the absence of expansion was noticed only at the smallest zzso Other changes that were frequently observed during zzso were fat zzso zzso and displacement of the median zzso and pressure on the superficial and deep zzso zzso
