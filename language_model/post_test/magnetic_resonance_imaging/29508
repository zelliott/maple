To evaluate the safety and efficacy of zzso acid zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for the detection of focal liver zzso with results of zzso examination and/or zzso zzso used as a standard of zzso 

One hundred zzso patients who were known to have or suspected of having focal liver zzso and were scheduled for liver surgery were included in this zzso zzso in 131 patients could be included in the efficacy zzso MR imaging was performed before and immediately and 20 minutes after zzso injection of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso contrast agent zzso zzso zzso zzso (with and without fat zzso and including dynamic data zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso sequences were zzso All images were evaluated on site and by three independent and blinded off-site zzso zzso matching based on the zzso results was zzso zzso in zzso detection with zzso and with zzso MR images were assessed with the zzso zzso signed rank zzso 

zzso acid was well zzso In the on-site review, the number of patients in whom all zzso were correctly matched increased from 89 of 129 patients at zzso MR imaging to 103 of 129 patients at zzso MR zzso In the off-site zzso the number of patients in whom all zzso were correctly matched and the corresponding sensitivity values increased from 72 zzso 68 zzso and 66 zzso with the zzso images to 88 zzso 69 zzso and 76 zzso with the zzso images for readers 1, 2, and 3, zzso Two of the three blinded readers showed a statistically significant difference in zzso detection between zzso and zzso MR imaging zzso zzso and P zzso A large number of additionally correctly detected and localized zzso were smaller than 1 zzso 

MR imaging with zzso acid is safe and improves zzso detection and zzso
