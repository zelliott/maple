Recent theories of the neural basis of performance monitoring have emphasized a central role for the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso an earlier zzso potential zzso study, which showed an error feedback zzso that was modeled as having an zzso zzso we used zzso zzso to investigate whether the zzso would differentiate between correct and incorrect feedback stimuli in a time zzso zzso The design controlled for response conflict and frequency and expectancy zzso Although participants in the current study adjusted their performance following error feedback, we did not observe error zzso zzso zzso In contrast, we did observe zzso activity while the same subjects performed the zzso task, in which an area of the zzso activated during both conflict and error zzso These findings are inconsistent with previous zzso models of the error feedback zzso and suggest the zzso may not be involved in the generation of this zzso zzso These results question involvement of the zzso in the detection of errors per zzso when controlling for zzso
