To detect the zzso pattern of the zzso in human by the functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with the electrical stimulation of different zzso and to explore the mechanism of this area in pain zzso 

Ten healthy right-handed volunteers were given different electrical zzso of zzso zzso and 3- times pain threshold zzso The zzso was scanned simultaneously by GE zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso The data were zzso by analysis of functional zzso zzso to establish the regional activity maps of the zzso 

zzso of functional activity showed a positive linear relationship between the zzso signals and stimulation intensity in bilateral thalamus, whereas the zzso signal of bilateral zzso zzso demonstrated that the curve was similar to the exponential zzso Meanwhile, the zzso in the zzso lateral zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso was prominent compared with the corresponding zzso zzso and only the lateral zzso displayed a zzso biased representation while the zzso zzso lacked this zzso 

zzso is one of the vital components in the pain zzso network, which can present spatial segregation zzso with unique characteristics of stimulation zzso in each zzso All the results are helpful to understand the crucial role of zzso in processing the pain zzso
