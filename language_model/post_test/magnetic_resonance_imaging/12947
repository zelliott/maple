The aim of this study was to compare high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the evaluation of the entire knee cartilage obtained from zzso 

MR zzso and zzso zzso were performed on 16 zzso knees, and their findings were compared to those found during zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of MR zzso and zzso zzso for detecting cartilage zzso of grade zzso or zzso 2 and zzso correlation zzso between zzso and zzso grades were zzso In addition, cartilage surface zzso of the two techniques was measured using a zzso ranking zzso 

The sensitivity and zzso respectively, for the detection of cartilage disorder zzso zzso or zzso 2) were zzso and zzso on MR zzso and zzso and zzso on zzso zzso There was no statistically significant difference between the two techniques in sensitivity zzso zzso zzso or specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso between MR zzso or zzso zzso and zzso grading were zzso and zzso respectively, with no statistically difference zzso zzso zzso Both MR zzso and zzso zzso enabled the accurate depiction of cartilage zzso 

zzso MR zzso and zzso zzso were comparably accurate for the assessment of cartilage zzso of the entire zzso
