The study objective was to assess the impact of a zzso zzso zzso medical management program on zzso imaging zzso 

This study was performed in the ambulatory setting of an integrated zzso zzso After negotiating a risk contract with a major commercial zzso we created a zzso zzso medical management program to help address potentially inappropriate zzso imaging zzso The zzso medical management program was enabled by a computerized physician order entry system with integrated clinical decision support and accountability tools, including zzso mandatory peer-to-peer consultation with zzso before order completion when test utility was uncertain on the basis of order zzso zzso quarterly practice pattern variation reports to zzso and zzso academic detailing for targeted zzso The primary outcome measure was intensity of zzso imaging, defined as the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and nuclear zzso studies per 1000 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso test was used to assess zzso 

In zzso million zzso from January 2004 to December 2009, zzso eligible studies were performed zzso CT, zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso There was a zzso sustained reduction in zzso imaging intensity over the zzso period zzso zzso zzso The number of CT studies performed decreased from zzso per 1000 zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso examinations decreased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso per 1000 zzso The zzso rate remained unchanged at 11 studies per 1000 zzso 

A zzso zzso medical management program enabled through health information technology and accountability tools may produce a significant reduction in zzso imaging zzso
