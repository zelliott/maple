The internal structure of zzso zzso may be a useful predictor of which zzso will zzso and cause sudden events such as heart attack or zzso With zzso and flow suppression, we obtained zzso three-dimensional zzso images of zzso plaque in zzso that show the cap thickness and core size of the zzso zzso zzso was used because it provides flexible zzso contrast and good resistance to zzso zzso While zzso zzso has similar properties, its resolution in the zzso direction, which is important because of the irregular geometry of zzso zzso is limited by achievable zzso zzso Also, zzso imaging generally achieves lower zzso than zzso imaging because, for zzso purposes, zzso image data is averaged over all the slices of a corresponding zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso has many of the advantages of zzso zzso it requires a longer scan time because it uses more zzso zzso to acquire the same amount of zzso Finally, cardiac gating is an important part of our imaging zzso but can make the imaging time quite zzso To obtain reasonable scan times, a zzso zzso pulse was used to restrict the field of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
