Our aims were to investigate the zzso volume in patients with seasonal winter depression and healthy volunteers in winter and summer, and to assess the effects of zzso in these zzso 

The zzso volume of 12 patients with winter depression and 12 healthy controls, paired according zzso age and zzso cycle, were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging in winter and zzso Eight patients were submitted to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso crossover fashion during the winter, and zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso after zzso 

There were no significant differences in zzso volume between controls and patients in winter or zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso decreased the depressive symptoms zzso zzso zzso but the zzso volume did not change zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso volume in winter showed a positive correlation with the severity of depression in these patients zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The results suggest that neither winter depression nor the change of seasons is associated with significant change in the zzso zzso Despite the fact that this study was performed in a tropical area, zzso with zzso zzso showed to be an efficient treatment in this zzso patients zzso
