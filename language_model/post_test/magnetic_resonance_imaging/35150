To describe zzso zzso of the rotator zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso zzso images and to assess the relationship between increased dimensions of the zzso and instability conditions of the zzso 

Three groups of patients with clinical instability were treated zzso zzso zzso zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso and a group of 10 control patients without clinical instability were also zzso The zzso of all groups were randomized, and 5 blinded zzso recorded zzso zzso zzso of: zzso zzso measures of the distance between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso landmarks across the zzso and zzso the zzso position of the long head of the biceps zzso relative to the most anterior aspect of the zzso 

The rotator zzso distance between the SS and zzso zzso was nearly identical for all groups of instability, and was also not different from control zzso On the zzso zzso zzso the distance from the zzso zzso to the anterior edge of the SS zzso was significantly increased in zzso zzso zzso instability versus both the control group zzso zzso P zzso zzso and those with anterior instability zzso zzso P zzso zzso with the zzso in a consistent anterior zzso The remainder of the measures was not statistically different between the zzso 

The distance between the SS and zzso and the overall size of the zzso was well preserved in all instability patterns and control zzso The zzso zzso assumes a more anterior position relative to the zzso zzso in patients with zzso instability versus those patients with anterior instability or those without clinical zzso Additional work is necessary to further define objective zzso evidence of zzso zzso in patients with shoulder zzso
