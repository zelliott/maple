Working zzso simple maintenance of information as well as manipulation of maintained zzso been long associated with lateral prefrontal zzso zzso More recently, evidence has pointed to an important role for zzso zzso zzso zzso in supporting zzso processes as zzso While explanations have emerged as to the nature of zzso involvement in zzso zzso the apparent involvement of this region in zzso manipulation has not been fully accounted zzso We have hypothesized that zzso cortex, through its representation of spatial information, in conjunction with zzso zzso supports organization of information zzso and the maintenance of information in an organized zzso Through zzso zzso we have demonstrated how this might be zzso zzso we consider a pair of zzso experiments that were designed to test our zzso Both experiments involved simple zzso delay tasks with contrasts between maintenance of information in organized and zzso states, as well as contrasts between high and low zzso load zzso Two different kinds of organization, zzso zzso and zzso were employed in the two zzso Across both studies, superior zzso zzso zzso 7) demonstrated a significant increase in activity associated with maintenance of information in an organized state, over and above any increases associated with increased zzso zzso During the delay period, zzso zzso zzso 9) exhibited similar increases for both organization and zzso however, this region was particularly engaged by organization demand during the initial cue zzso zzso connectivity analysis indicates interaction between zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and superior zzso cortex, especially when organization is zzso
