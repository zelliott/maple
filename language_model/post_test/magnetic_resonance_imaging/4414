Upper airway zzso can be compromised when children (or zzso receive sedative zzso The study examines the effect of two different positioning techniques zzso of the zzso position zzso zzso and shoulder zzso zzso on maintenance of upper airway zzso using zzso in 21 children zzso with intravenous zzso zzso zzso Children positioned on the zzso had a significantly greater degree of zzso extension zzso zzso zzso and a significantly greater zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso than those with shoulder zzso The degree of zzso extension was not significantly correlated with zzso diameter (R zzso zzso No clinical signs of upper airway obstruction were noted and oxygen zzso did not zzso Both positioning techniques were consistently associated with upper airway zzso under the study conditions zzso In zzso nose zzso to whom sedative agents are zzso the zzso is more likely to maintain zzso zzso than shoulder zzso
