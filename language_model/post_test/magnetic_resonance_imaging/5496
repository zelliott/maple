zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso surgical treatments for zzso of the zzso head zzso It can prevent collapse of the zzso head as zzso zzso in the zzso portion can be moved sufficiently to a less zzso portion by anterior zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Patient selection and zzso planning are important to determine indications for zzso It has been reported that successful zzso requires at least zzso of the zzso area supported by the intact part of the zzso zzso However, this ratio is difficult to preoperatively zzso according to the rotation angle using conventional two-dimensional MR images or zzso zzso we developed a method of simulating zzso using three-dimensional zzso models reconstructed from zzso MR images and applied it to serial patients with types C1 and C2 zzso at stage 1 or zzso The simulation zzso zzso changes of the zzso zzso in the zzso area and enabled zzso of the zzso intact zzso Our surgical simulation is useful for evaluating the zzso intact ratio and for determining indications for zzso as well as the optimal angle of zzso head rotation and zzso zzso
