zzso zzso delivery zzso of zzso agents currently requires an zzso zzso and infusion system, which limits its duration because of the need for hospitalization and the risk of zzso To evaluate the feasibility of prolonged zzso administration by zzso in a large animal brain with the use of a subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso pumps were implanted zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso was infused at zzso zzso h for 3 or 10 zzso Pigs underwent magnetic resonance imaging before and at 6 times points after zzso Enhancement and zzso volumes were calculated in a zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso signature was also zzso Brain zzso was analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso and with zzso for a zzso zzso zzso of zzso was well tolerated in all cases zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement volume was reached at day 3 and remained stable if zzso was continued for 10 days, but it decreased if zzso was stopped at day zzso zzso resonance zzso revealed a decrease in zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Similarly, the combination of zzso and zzso infusion led to a zzso volume that tended to be larger than that seen after the infusion of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the brains showed an area of zzso zzso in the zzso white matter upon infusion with zzso zzso zzso zzso is well tolerated in a large animal brain for up to 10 zzso zzso long-term zzso can be achieved with a zzso implanted pump and provides a stable volume of zzso This work constitutes a proof of principle for the safety and feasibility for prolonged zzso providing a means of continuous local drug delivery that is accessible to the practicing zzso
