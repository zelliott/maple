To describe the paradoxical high signal intensity of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso phase on zzso zzso acid zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

A database search was performed to identify cases of zzso that showed unusual prolonged enhancement in the zzso phase of zzso zzso All patients received zzso liver zzso including zzso zzso images, zzso images and a post zzso dynamic zzso The signal intensity of zzso was measured at zzso zzso portal, delayed and zzso phase using regions of zzso zzso and zzso correlation was performed for the paradoxically prolonged enhancing portion of zzso in the zzso zzso 

Four patients (all male, age range zzso mean zzso zzso were included in this zzso All patients showed zzso zzso that were low signal intensity zzso on zzso high zzso on zzso enhanced in zzso phase, and zzso in delayed zzso All cases showed paradoxically high zzso in zzso phase, which was unusual for zzso zzso they were all diagnosed as zzso zzso with prominent zzso and a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may demonstrate the prolonged high signal intensity at the zzso phase on zzso enhanced zzso These zzso tended to be highly differentiated and to have prominent zzso zzso
