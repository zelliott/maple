For this zzso study, we aimed to zzso whether higher zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels exert a negative impact on memory performance and zzso volume and zzso in a cohort of healthy, older, zzso individuals without zzso 

In 141 individuals zzso women, mean age zzso years zzso zzso zzso memory was tested using the zzso zzso zzso Learning zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and insulin and zzso zzso scans were acquired to assess zzso volume and zzso as indicated by gray matter barrier zzso Linear zzso and simple mediation models were calculated to examine associations among memory, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Lower zzso and zzso levels were significantly associated with better scores in delayed recall, learning ability, and memory zzso In multiple zzso models, zzso remained strongly associated with memory zzso Moreover, mediation analyses indicated that beneficial effects of lower zzso on memory are in part zzso by zzso volume and zzso 

Our results indicate that even in the absence of manifest type 2 diabetes zzso or impaired zzso zzso chronically higher blood zzso levels exert a negative influence on zzso possibly zzso by structural changes in zzso brain zzso zzso strategies aimed at lowering zzso levels even in the normal range may zzso influence zzso in the older population, a hypothesis to be examined in future zzso zzso
