The mechanism of zzso fatigue in heart failure appears to be considerably more complex than was originally zzso Although it still seems likely that muscle zzso is the major culprit, the possibility that skeletal muscle changes contribute to the fatigue suggests that several new therapeutic zzso may improve exercise capacity in heart zzso If muscle zzso due to zzso or zzso is found to contribute to fatigue, exercise capacity in heart failure could be improved, at least in part, by exercise training or nutritional zzso zzso agents such as anabolic steroids or growth hormone could be used to stimulate muscle zzso and, zzso help to improve the zzso Heart failure is a common disorder, affecting over three million Americans and many more people throughout the zzso One of the most disabling problems experienced by these patients is zzso zzso Patients report that they are easily fatigued during normal daily zzso During zzso exercise testing, patients usually terminate exercise early due to fatigue of the legs associated with an early increase in the concentration of zzso in the zzso Traditionally, such zzso fatigue has been attributed to skeletal muscle zzso Over the past five years, however, there has been increasing evidence that heart failure is associated with intrinsic skeletal muscle changes which may also contribute to the zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance studies using zzso have demonstrated abnormal skeletal muscle zzso responses to exercise that do not appear to be due to muscle zzso zzso muscle biopsy studies have demonstrated a variety of changes in zzso zzso studies suggest that a generalized loss of muscle mass may occur in heart zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
