A prospective zzso zzso 

To evaluate the zzso muscle zzso zzso in patients with degenerative zzso zzso zzso using magnetic resonance zzso 

Several studies have described the zzso and zzso changes to the zzso in patients with chronic low back pain and zzso zzso However, there is little knowledge about the zzso changes in patients with zzso 

zzso patients with zzso spinal zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and 50 control patients with zzso without zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso area zzso and percentage of fat zzso area zzso of the bilateral zzso and zzso muscles at the zzso levels were measured using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and computer zzso A zzso muscle biopsy and zzso evaluation were performed in some zzso 

In the zzso group, the zzso of the zzso muscle was significantly smaller and the zzso of both muscles was significantly higher on the zzso side than on the convex side at all levels zzso zzso zzso for zzso These differences were also found in the zzso muscles at the zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso the zzso muscle exhibited reductions in the muscle fiber size and number of zzso on the zzso zzso In the zzso group, the total zzso and zzso did not differ significantly between the left and right zzso However, in patients with unilateral zzso the zzso of the zzso muscle was significantly smaller zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of both muscles was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso on the symptomatic side, especially at 1 level zzso 

This zzso study with magnetic resonance imaging and zzso showed that muscle zzso was more common on the zzso side in patients with zzso zzso and spinal zzso may contribute to the zzso zzso
