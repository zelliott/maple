zzso density in zzso is regarded as a zzso factor of zzso zzso independent of cell zzso In recent studies of zzso zzso correlation between the expression of zzso zzso and zzso density and zzso surface density has been zzso We studied the expression of zzso in different types of zzso zzso to determine the usefulness of zzso expression as a zzso factor of zzso progression or recurrence in patients with zzso zzso 

We zzso studied a group of 60 patients of mean age zzso zzso 18 to zzso years who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso as determined by zzso was analyzed in relation to zzso features of zzso clinical symptoms, MR imaging and zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso was expressed in zzso of zzso of patients, with a median index value of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in zzso inactive zzso and zzso and lowest in zzso We found no differences in zzso expression with respect to patient age, zzso zzso size, degree of zzso zzso or whether zzso were zzso or zzso for zzso hormones, nor have we found any relation between zzso expression and recurrence or progression of zzso zzso 

zzso does not appear to be a zzso factor for recurrence or progression of zzso zzso Nevertheless, due to the observed relatively high expression of zzso in zzso zzso further studies with zzso zzso are justified in these zzso
