We sought to evaluate regional zzso and function in patients in their first week after having a zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso using magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso 

The mechanism of zzso dysfunction in the remote, zzso regions is an unresolved issue to zzso 

Sixteen patients with a first zzso zzso anterior zzso were studied with MR tagging at 5 zzso 2 days after the event, and the results were compared with those of an zzso control group zzso The left zzso zzso was divided into zzso adjacent and remote zzso zzso resonance tagging provided information on the regional zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso an increase of the zzso radius of zzso was found in the remote zzso whereas the zzso radius of zzso was increased in all regions of the zzso A significant increase in zzso zzso was also zzso A significant reduction in strain and function was found not only in the zzso region, but also in the adjacent and remote zzso The loss in regional ejection fraction in the remote zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients zzso zzso zzso zzso in control subjects, p zzso zzso was related to a significant reduction of the zzso and zzso strain, whereas zzso wall zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso dysfunction contributes significantly to the loss in global zzso zzso This could be secondary to zzso changes in the zzso region, leading to an increased zzso zzso wall stress without loss of intrinsic zzso in the remote zzso
