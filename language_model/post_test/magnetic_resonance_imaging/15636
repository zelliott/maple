A comparative study of zzso zzso of the jaw and zzso bones was performed through a literature zzso 

In zzso zzso the cavities were always filled with fluid, and a high recurrence rate was shown through extensive zzso zzso bone zzso (ABC) was included in the differential diagnosis zzso to some zzso zzso zzso gas and blood were found in the cavity in zzso zzso and recurrence was believed to be zzso zzso diagnosis was rarely discussed in the zzso 

Based on reports, the cavity did not normally contain gas because no zzso level was observed on panoramic zzso and no zzso area indicating gas was seen on CT or zzso A zzso cavity should be examined carefully, and the possibility of an ABC should be zzso The recurrence rate needs to be zzso because an extensive survey has not been performed to clarify the treatment outcomes of zzso zzso
