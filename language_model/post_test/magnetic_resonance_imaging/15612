To assess whether zzso zzso is able to provide information relevant in changing the clinical management of patients with zzso zzso zzso where there is negative or zzso conventional zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso 

From January 2005 to October 2006, 84 patients with clinical and zzso suspicion of zzso zzso were investigated by US and CT scans, zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso both conventional zzso imaging and zzso zzso provided negative or zzso findings, and patients were referred for zzso zzso zzso Each patient received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 60 zzso later using a hybrid zzso zzso 

zzso zzso detected the primary zzso in all 13 patients zzso range, zzso zzso mean, 18 zzso zzso range, zzso mean, zzso and further 12 zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso mean zzso zzso range zzso mean zzso Confirmation of the zzso findings was obtained in all patients from zzso analysis of tissue obtained after surgery and/or zzso All the zzso primary zzso were confirmed as being the primary zzso at zzso whereas of the other 12 zzso zzso zzso 11 were found to be zzso deposits and one due to unspecific inflammation (one false positive zzso zzso the results of zzso zzso imaging changed the clinical management in zzso patients zzso 

Our preliminary results suggest that zzso zzso has a promising role in zzso patients with negative or zzso findings at conventional zzso imaging and zzso zzso The findings were helpful in biopsy guidance and played a major role in changing the management of those zzso
