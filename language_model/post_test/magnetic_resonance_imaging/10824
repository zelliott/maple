Evidence that face perception is zzso by special cognitive and neural mechanisms comes from zzso studies of the zzso face area zzso and behavioral studies of the face inversion zzso Here, we used these two methods to ask whether face perception mechanisms are stimulus specific, process specific, or zzso zzso zzso pairs of upright or zzso faces or house stimuli that differed in either the spatial distance among parts zzso or the shape of the zzso The zzso showed a much higher response to faces than to houses, but no preference for the zzso task over the part zzso Similarly, the behavioral inversion effect was as large in the part task as the zzso task for faces, but absent in both part and zzso tasks for zzso These findings indicate that face perception mechanisms are not process specific for parts or zzso but are domain specific for face stimuli per zzso
