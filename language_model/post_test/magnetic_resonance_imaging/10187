To assess the long-term mortality in patients with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

Between 1992 and 2000, 212 consecutive patients with acute pelvic vein zzso diagnosed by duplex zzso were examined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso to determine the most zzso extent of the zzso zzso revealed a zzso in the inferior zzso zzso in 46 patients zzso in the zzso vein in 142 patients zzso and in the zzso vein in 24 patients zzso 

The vital status of the patients was investigated in April 2004 using the Austrian National zzso and the zzso of Death zzso 

A total of 211 patients of the original 212 patients were monitored over a mean follow-up period of 91 zzso zzso of 211 patients zzso had zzso There was no significant difference in the long-term zzso the survival period or the occurrence of fatal pulmonary embolism zzso between previously diagnosed zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso vein zzso 

Extension of a zzso into the inferior zzso vein in patients considered to have a pelvic vein zzso has no impact on long-term mortality or the development of fatal zzso compared to those patients with zzso limited to more zzso zzso
