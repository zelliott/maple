During sleep deprivation zzso failures to respond zzso increase across a variety of zzso This is the first systematic investigation of neural zzso of zzso during zzso We use zzso analysis to model neural zzso separately for zzso and responses zzso at each trial zzso 

In two experiments a delayed letter recognition task was performed in a zzso scanner at 9:30 am after two nights of total zzso Participants were continuously monitored in the zzso 

Healthy young adults from two zzso experiments zzso zzso aged zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso linear modeling zzso was used to find networks of zzso that differed between zzso and zzso At each of three trial zzso zzso and zzso networks were zzso In the zzso phase, the second network was seen during zzso and was not seen during zzso This network constituted widespread zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso areas zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso In a multiple zzso including zzso during zzso and R from all networks and all trial zzso expression of this zzso network during zzso was the key predictor of zzso performance zzso zzso as greater zzso zzso lower d' and larger median zzso zzso 

zzso were most associated with neural disruptions occurring at the zzso phase when subjects must attend to and zzso zzso Further, expression of this zzso zzso network made the largest independent contribution to predicting vulnerability to overall zzso zzso
