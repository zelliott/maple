The aim of this study was to zzso imaging characteristics of fast zzso inversion recovery zzso sequence in brain tumors compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso fast spin echo zzso and zzso zzso zzso images of 74 patients with zzso zzso were zzso Four zzso rated signal intensity and zzso of the zzso rendering of zzso parts, zzso of the tumor vs brain, of the tumor vs zzso and of brain vs zzso as well as the presence of motion and of other zzso Data analysis was performed for zzso proven zzso zzso and zzso for tumors with poor contrast enhancement, and for all patients zzso Only for tumors with poor contrast enhancement zzso zzso zzso did fast zzso provide additional information about the zzso In these cases, signal intensity, zzso of the tumor vs brain, and differentiation of the tumor vs zzso were best using fast zzso In all cases, rendering of the zzso inner structure was zzso For all other tumor types, fast zzso did not give clinically relevant information, the only exception being a better zzso of the zzso from brain zzso zzso rarely zzso with evaluation of zzso zzso Thus, fast zzso cannot replace zzso zzso It provides additional information only in tumors with poor contrast zzso It is helpful for defining the exact extent of the zzso of any tumor but gives little information about their inner zzso
