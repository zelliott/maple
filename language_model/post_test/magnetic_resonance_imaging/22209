Previous studies have suggested that zzso zzso can interfere with normal zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso In the present studies, zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso was used to study the effect of the zzso zzso zzso on the equilibrium exchange of fluorinated zzso zzso in human zzso Studies of the equilibrium exchange of both zzso and zzso with either one-dimensional zzso transfer or two-dimensional exchange zzso were performed, and significant zzso was observed in all zzso From zzso studies, an zzso constant for the equilibrium exchange measured at 37 degrees C of 24 zzso was zzso
