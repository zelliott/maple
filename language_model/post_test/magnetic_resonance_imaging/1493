zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to estimate the apparent zzso relaxation time constant zzso of water and zzso in human brain at zzso and zzso A significant reduction in the zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed with increasing magnetic field strength and was attributed mainly to increased dynamic zzso due to increased local zzso zzso At high field, signal loss resulting from zzso zzso can be substantially reduced using a zzso zzso zzso
