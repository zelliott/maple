Our purpose was to define thresholds below which trained zzso cannot detect changes in the size of zzso brain zzso 

We generated zzso brain MR images zzso zzso with simulated zzso zzso derived from a real multiple sclerosis zzso The size of the original multiple sclerosis zzso was varied by zzso up or down the zzso using a zzso zzso zzso Three hundred zzso composite images, in which two zzso images containing zzso were zzso were presented to three equally trained zzso to define thresholds below which changes in original zzso size could not be zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the dependency of size thresholds on the original size of the zzso 

zzso ranged from a zzso to zzso increase in the original zzso zzso For increases greater than zzso all three zzso detected the change in zzso size irrespective of the diameter of the original zzso There was a dependency of the threshold on the diameter of the original zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Using an MR simulator, we can define thresholds below which changes in original zzso size cannot be reliably zzso These results may guide the design of clinical trials that rely on trained zzso to assess change in zzso zzso
