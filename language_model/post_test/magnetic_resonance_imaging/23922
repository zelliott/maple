We present the first simultaneous zzso of evoked zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses to visual zzso Visual evoked zzso zzso were recorded both inside and outside the zzso zzso magnetic field, and during zzso zzso We zzso constructed, and tested a zzso zzso zzso recording zzso By using a large number of zzso channels it is possible to design a spatial filter capable of removing the artifact noise present when recording zzso within a strong magnetic zzso We show that the designed spatial filter is capable of recovering the zzso original zzso zzso zzso plots of the zzso array recordings at the peak of the zzso response zzso zzso zzso well with simultaneous zzso observed activated areas of primary and secondary visual zzso
