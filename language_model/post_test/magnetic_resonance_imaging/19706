To evaluate the feasibility and to describe the acute toxicity of a real-time zzso magnetic resonance zzso guided zzso approach to treating zzso recurrence of zzso zzso 

From February 2004 to April 2005, 10 patients with zzso zzso cancer underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluated included needle placement, zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso guidance resulted in accurate needle zzso zzso zzso values included median volume, 47 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 71 zzso and zzso 60 zzso zzso of zzso at risk resulted in a median zzso of external beam and zzso dose zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All patients experienced either a Grade 1 or 2 acute toxicity related to the zzso only 1 patient had Grade 3 zzso No zzso were attributable to the use of MR zzso 

zzso MR guidance during the zzso of zzso needles reduces the likelihood of an zzso zzso of the needles into the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso allows zzso of the dose to zzso at zzso zzso are zzso
