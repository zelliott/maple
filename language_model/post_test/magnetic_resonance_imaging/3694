zzso functional zzso has been examined in several prior studies using resting zzso data and zzso procedures, as well as zzso independent component analysis zzso Here, we hypothesized that zzso applied to functional data from the zzso exclusively would provide increased sensitivity for detecting zzso networks compared to previous zzso zzso of zzso networks was assessed in two zzso and zzso groups of zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso was compared to the traditional zzso zzso procedure to examine the potential gain in sensitivity of the novel zzso In addition to replicating a number of previously identified zzso networks, the current approach revealed at least one network component that was not apparent with the application of whole brain zzso These results demonstrate the gain in sensitivity attained through specifying the zzso as a target structure with regard to the identification of robust and reliable zzso The use of similar procedures could be important in further expanding on previously defined patterns of zzso functional zzso as well as provide information about unique networks that have not been explored in prior zzso Such information may prove crucial for understanding the cognitive and behavioral importance of the zzso in health and zzso
