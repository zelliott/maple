A precise knowledge of the zzso fiber architecture is essential to accurately understand and interpret cardiac electrical and mechanical zzso zzso zzso imaging has been used to zzso and zzso characterize zzso fiber zzso However, because the approach zzso diffusion to be measured in multiple zzso directions and frequently at multiple weighting levels, the required data set size may present a limitation on its acquisition time zzso zzso the principles of reduced zzso imaging zzso four basic reconstruction schemes, zzso using direct zzso zzso with baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso reconstruction zzso and zzso zzso zzso are evaluated in terms of their accuracy in diffusion zzso orientation mapping of excised zzso zzso zzso show that the performances of all zzso schemes, at approximately 50% reduced zzso are at least comparable with that of a control experiment consisting of zzso reduced number of full zzso zzso Moreover, although performances of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso schemes are similar, both methods provide significant improvements over the control experiment and the zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate the potential of the general zzso methodology for diffusion zzso imaging and pave the way for modified schemes involving rapid imaging sequences or alternative zzso sampling strategies to achieve even better data acquisition time efficiency and zzso
