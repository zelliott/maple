This study investigates the zzso dynamics associated with conscious and zzso processing of naked and dressed human zzso To this effect, stimuli of naked men and women with visible primary sexual zzso as well as dressed bodies, were presented to 20 zzso male and female participants while acquiring high resolution zzso zzso The stimuli were either consciously zzso zzso zzso or were rendered zzso through backward masking zzso zzso The zzso zzso potential component was significantly enhanced in participants when they viewed naked compared to dressed bodies under zzso viewing zzso More importantly, naked bodies of the opposite sex produced a significantly greater zzso component compared to dressed bodies during subliminal presentations, when participants were not aware of the stimulus zzso A source zzso zzso zzso on the zzso showed that the response for naked bodies in the zzso viewing condition was stronger in body processing areas, primary visual areas and additional structures related to emotion zzso By contrast, in the subliminal viewing condition, only visual and body processing areas were found to be zzso These results suggest that naked bodies and primary sexual characteristics are processed early in time zzso zzso zzso and activate key brain structures even when they are not consciously zzso It appears that, similarly to what has been reported for emotional faces, sexual features benefit from automatic and rapid processing, most likely due to their high relevance for the individual and their importance for the species in terms of zzso zzso
