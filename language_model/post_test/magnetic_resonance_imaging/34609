We used zzso zzso zzso to study new learning and automatic performance in normal zzso zzso learned sequences of eight finger movements by trial and zzso In a previous experiment we showed that the prefrontal zzso was activated during new learning but not during during automatic zzso The aim of the present experiment was to see what areas could be zzso if the subjects performed the zzso sequence but were required to pay attention to what they were zzso zzso were carried out under four zzso In the first the subjects performed a zzso sequence of eight key zzso this sequence was learned before scanning and was practiced until it had become zzso so that the subjects were able to perform it zzso In the second condition the subjects learned a new sequence during zzso In a third condition the subjects performed the zzso zzso but they were required to attend to what they were zzso they were instructed to think about the next zzso The fourth condition was a baseline zzso As in the earlier study, the zzso prefrontal zzso and anterior zzso area 32 were activated during new learning, but not during automatic zzso The left zzso prefrontal zzso and the right anterior zzso zzso were zzso when subjects paid attention to the performance of the zzso sequence compared with automatic performance of the same zzso It is suggested that the critical feature was that the subjects were required to attend to the preparation of their zzso However, the zzso prefrontal zzso and the anterior zzso zzso were activated more when the subjects learned a new sequence than they were when subjects simply paid attention to a zzso zzso New learning differs from the attention condition in that the subjects generated moves, monitored the zzso and remembered the responses that had been zzso All these are zzso operations to which the subjects must zzso Further analysis is needed to specify which are the zzso operations that require the involvement of the zzso prefrontal and anterior zzso zzso
