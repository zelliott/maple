Little is known about how zzso zzso works within brain circuits to achieve its clinical zzso We wished to determine whether the new technique of zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso could be used to assess the effects of zzso on activated motor or zzso zzso We carried out a randomized, zzso crossover trial involving two visits 1 week apart with zzso measures of cortical zzso and blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso received either a single oral dose of 325 zzso of zzso or zzso on each zzso In all, 10 subjects provided a complete data set that included zzso zzso measures and resting motor threshold zzso zzso under both zzso and zzso zzso A further two subjects provided only zzso data under the two drug zzso zzso caused a zzso zzso increase in zzso 3 h after the drug, compared with a zzso increase 3 h after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans showed that zzso zzso inhibited cortical zzso induced by zzso applied over the motor zzso In contrast, when zzso was applied over the prefrontal cortex, zzso increased the zzso zzso of zzso regions, notably the zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso at clinically relevant serum zzso has a general zzso effect on cortical zzso zzso but may have a more complex effect on zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso technique may be a useful tool for investigating regional brain effects of psychoactive zzso
