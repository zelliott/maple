In the STOP II trial, zzso of zzso zzso in high risk children with zzso cell disease zzso resulted in a high rate of zzso to abnormal zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We analyzed data from STOP II to determine the effect of zzso zzso on the development or progression of silent brain zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso At study entry, 21 of 79 zzso patients had evidence of silent zzso There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients with normal brain zzso or silent zzso at study zzso At study end, 3 of 37 zzso patients in the zzso group developed new brain zzso zzso compared with 11 of 40 zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso The total number of zzso remained essentially unchanged decreasing from 25 to 24 in the zzso group while increasing from 27 to 45 in zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso in children with zzso and abnormal zzso who zzso to low-risk increases the risk of silent brain zzso Together with data from zzso these findings demonstrate that zzso prevent the development of silent zzso in patients with zzso and abnormal zzso but normal zzso
