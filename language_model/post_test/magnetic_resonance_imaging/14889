The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of zzso zzso of the lung in zzso patients and the agreement between the imaging appearance of pulmonary zzso on zzso and zzso 

zzso CT scans and dedicated pulmonary zzso scans (including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed within 90 days of each other in 29 zzso The scans were scored for gross zzso zzso zzso zzso and masses using a 3-point zzso zzso Total and subset scores for corresponding zzso and CT scans were compared using the zzso correlation test, zzso zzso and Cohen's zzso zzso zzso zzso scores were compared to CT by lobe and disease category, using percentage agreement, zzso rank zzso and Cohen's zzso zzso 

The mean zzso zzso time between zzso and CT scans was 33 zzso 32 zzso There was substantial correlation and agreement between total disease scoring on zzso and CT with a zzso correlation zzso of zzso zzso and a Cohen's weighted zzso score of zzso zzso and agreement were highest for gross zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and lowest in the setting of zzso zzso zzso zzso testing was not performed for mass scores due to low zzso Upper lobe scoring on zzso and CT demonstrated greater agreement compared to the lower zzso zzso difference in Cohen's weighted zzso score of zzso 

There is substantial correlation and agreement between zzso and CT in the scoring of pulmonary zzso though zzso evaluation in the upper zzso may be more accurate than in the lower zzso
