To evaluate the zzso safety and efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso facet joint injection therapy using a zzso open zzso 

One hundred and zzso facet joint blocks in 45 patients with lower back pain were performed under MR zzso guidance using a zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso wireless zzso for zzso zzso zzso a flexible surface zzso and zzso zzso needle were zzso Clinical outcome was evaluated by questionnaire before intervention and after 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months using a zzso visual analogue scale zzso 

All facet joint blocks were considered technically successful with distribution of the zzso within and/or around the targeted facet zzso No major complications zzso The final outcome analysis included 38 zzso An immediate effect was reported by 63 % of the zzso A positive zzso effect was seen in 13 patients zzso zzso after 6 months and in 9 patients (24 zzso after 12 zzso Mean zzso was reduced from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months zzso 

zzso facet joint injection therapy of the zzso spine is accurate, safe and efficient in the symptomatic treatment of lower back zzso
