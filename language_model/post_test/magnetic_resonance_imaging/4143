Using a model of the functional zzso zzso impulse response based on published data, we have demonstrated that the form of the zzso response to stimuli of freely varied timing can be modeled well by zzso of the impulse response with the behavioral zzso The zzso of the responses as a function of zzso varied behavioral conditions are fitted well using a zzso linear zzso Use of the combined model, in conjunction with correlation analysis, results in an increase in sensitivity for the zzso zzso This approach, based on the well-established methods of linear systems analysis, also allows a quantitative comparison of the response zzso across subjects to a broad range of behavioral zzso Fit zzso derived from the zzso data, are relatively insensitive to a variety of zzso artifacts and yield results that are compared readily across zzso
