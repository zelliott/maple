At magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso artifacts arising from metallic orthopedic hardware are an obstacle to obtaining optimal zzso Although various techniques for reducing such artifacts have been developed and zzso by previous researchers, a new era of more powerful MR imaging and zzso CT zzso has renewed the importance of a systematic consideration of methods for artifact zzso zzso of the factors that contribute to artifacts, of related theories, and of artifact reduction techniques has become mandatory for zzso zzso that affect artifacts on MR images include the composition of the metallic hardware, the orientation of the hardware in relation to the direction of the main magnetic field, the strength of the magnetic field, the pulse sequence type, and other MR imaging parameters zzso zzso size, which is determined by the field of view, image zzso section zzso and echo train zzso At zzso CT, the factors that affect artifacts include the composition of the hardware, orientation of the hardware, acquisition parameters zzso zzso tube charge, zzso and acquired section zzso and reconstruction parameters zzso section zzso reconstruction zzso used, and whether an extended CT scale was zzso A comparison of images obtained with different hardware and different acquisition and reconstruction parameters zzso an understanding of methods for reducing or overcoming artifacts related to metallic zzso
