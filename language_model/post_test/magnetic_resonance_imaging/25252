Imaging and zzso studies suggest that frontal lobe white matter zzso volume expands until about the age of zzso years and then zzso zzso evidence indicates that the structural integrity of zzso zzso zzso during normal aging, especially in late zzso regions such as the frontal zzso 

To assess the integrity of zzso by magnetic resonance imaging and, thus, to provide an important index of brain aging and its relationship to zzso disease zzso 

zzso zzso 

Two metropolitan university hospitals and zzso research zzso 

Two hundred zzso healthy adults zzso men and 125 zzso aged 19 to 82 years, and 34 subjects with zzso (16 men and 18 zzso aged 59 to 85 zzso 

zzso zzso relaxation rate zzso zzso of the zzso (an indirect measure of the structural integrity of white zzso 

As expected from prior imaging data on zzso volume, the zzso function best represented the relationship between age and the zzso zzso zzso In healthy individuals, the zzso zzso increased until the age of 38 years and then declined markedly with zzso The zzso 2) of subjects with zzso was significantly lower than that of a group of healthy control subjects who were of similar age and sex zzso 

The zzso changes in white matter suggest that the healthy adult brain is in a constant state of change, roughly defined as periods of maturation continuing into middle age followed by progressive loss of zzso zzso zzso diagnosed zzso is associated with more severe zzso zzso zzso measures, such as the determination of the zzso may have the potential to track zzso the trajectory of deteriorating white matter integrity during normal aging and the development of zzso and, thus, may be a useful marker for medication development aimed at the prevention of zzso
