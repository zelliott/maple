zzso may enhance fear zzso The effects of zzso on human brain function are not well zzso with findings suggesting that zzso could augment exposure therapy via its effects on the neural zzso of emotional learning and extinction or by acting upon different neural zzso The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate differences in neural response in patients receiving zzso or zzso in addition to exposure zzso 

Twenty adults with snake zzso zzso specific zzso received 50 zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso 1 hour prior to a single session of graded exposure therapy in an zzso specialty zzso One week before and after treatment, patients completed a clinical examination and zzso symptom provocation functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso task zzso outcome zzso 

The zzso and zzso groups responded equally well to treatment, although the zzso patients reached the top of the exposure hierarchy more quickly zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Only right zzso prefrontal zzso showed an equivalent decrease in zzso to snake stimuli in both zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso resulted in different zzso prefrontal brain zzso during processing of zzso zzso including enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso to zzso 

A single administration of zzso combined with exposure therapy can lead to lasting changes in zzso and other prefrontal zzso response to zzso zzso These changes are zzso different from those seen in patients receiving exposure therapy without zzso
