The statistical association between endurance exercise capacity and cardiovascular disease suggests that impaired zzso metabolism zzso the cardiovascular disease risk in men and zzso To explore this connection, we applied divergent artificial selection in rats to develop zzso runner zzso and zzso runner zzso rats and found that disease risks zzso strongly with low running zzso Here, we tested if zzso low zzso capacity promotes differential sex-related cardiovascular zzso Compared with zzso males zzso zzso males zzso were overweight by zzso and had heavier zzso zzso and zzso fat zzso zzso females zzso were zzso heavier than zzso females zzso and their zzso but not zzso or zzso fat pads were heavier as zzso Unlike zzso blood pressure was elevated in zzso and this was accompanied by left zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso exhibited normal blood pressure and zzso weight as well as increased spontaneous cage activity compared with zzso Despite normal blood pressures, zzso exhibited increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction, as indicated by increased zzso zzso a decrease in the initial filling rate, and an increase in zzso relaxation zzso Although females exhibited increased zzso zzso ejection fraction was zzso Increased zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction in zzso was accompanied by the lowest protein levels of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and silent information regulator zzso Thus, the combination of risk factors, including female sex, intrinsic low zzso capacity, and zzso promote zzso zzso sufficient to induce zzso dysfunction in the absence of hypertension and zzso zzso
