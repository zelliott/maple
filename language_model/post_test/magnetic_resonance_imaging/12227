The measurement of absorbed dose zzso using zzso gel and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in a standard geometry has been zzso zzso zzso zzso and profiles measured with this new technique show good agreement with corresponding zzso using zzso This was proven in a zzso beam as well as an electron zzso The zzso gel is made of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The dose response is linear zzso zzso zzso in the investigated dose zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity is a factor of about six higher compared to ordinary zzso zzso solution, known as zzso This is a true zzso dose measurement technique which will have a number of applications in radiation therapy, since it is possible to zzso the gel to arbitrary zzso mix different radiation qualities and integrate the absorbed dose from different kinds of zzso
