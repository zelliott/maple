One of three musculoskeletal zzso zzso interpreted 100 consecutive zzso zzso examinations of the zzso A prospective zzso report was generated for the referring orthopedic surgeon, and prospective zzso interpretations were correlated with zzso findings zzso zzso zzso zzso examinations on those patients who underwent zzso zzso were zzso reviewed by three musculoskeletal zzso who reached a consensus on the prevalence of new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso criteria for zzso tear diagnosis were used as outlined by Tuckman et zzso zzso abnormal zzso lack of zzso absence of the zzso or any combination of those criteria on one or more MR zzso An additional criterion used was abnormal increased signal in that area on zzso zzso 

zzso of the 100 patients had zzso zzso tears on prospective zzso zzso In 29 of these 32 patients, zzso zzso confirmed zzso zzso tears in the areas described on the zzso zzso Five additional zzso tears were shown on zzso zzso that were not seen on prospective zzso zzso Two of those additional five zzso tears were seen on consensus retrospective zzso zzso 

In this study, a zzso prevalence of zzso zzso tears in the zzso knee was present on prospective zzso interpretations as opposed to a reported zzso prevalence in the zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases the ability of the zzso to evenly distribute forces placed on zzso This circumstance may increase the prevalence of zzso zzso tears in the zzso zzso New zzso zzso tears are common in patients presenting with pain after knee zzso
