To describe the zzso characteristics of a series of high grade cortical zzso in the initial phase of development and their pattern of growth during a short time zzso 

This was a retrospective zzso study of the zzso findings in six patients diagnosed with high grade zzso All presented with a new onset zzso seizure and focal zzso cortical zzso The diagnosis was established after a short period of clinical and zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso detected a small cortical zzso that was zzso in zzso sequences in all six zzso This zzso showed slight or moderate enhancement after the administration of a contrast agent in five zzso All six patients underwent follow-up zzso within six months of the initial zzso examination zzso 79 zzso zzso zzso showed marked growth of the zzso in all cases, and the zzso diagnosis of high grade zzso zzso in five patients and zzso zzso in one) was established after surgical zzso 

High grade zzso originating in the zzso zzso can have an zzso zzso presentation in the early zzso High grade zzso should be included in the differential diagnosis of a cortical zzso that enhances slightly or moderately after the administration of contrast material in a patient with a new onset zzso zzso
