zzso zzso transient large deformation properties of biological tissue is becoming increasingly important in impact zzso and rehabilitation engineering, which includes devices zzso with the human body and virtual surgical guidance zzso Individual mechanical in zzso zzso specifically of human zzso zzso and passive skeletal muscle tissue compressed with finite strain, has, however, been sparsely zzso zzso a combined experimental and zzso approach, a method is presented to investigate the zzso properties of in zzso zzso zzso and passive skeletal muscle zzso Specifically, zzso zzso zzso relaxation tests were performed and documented with magnetic resonance zzso A time domain zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso series valid for finite strains was used in conjunction with a zzso model zzso for soft tissue zzso model zzso identification and zzso of the relaxation test zzso A finite element model of the zzso region was zzso Strong zzso elastic but linear zzso tissue material zzso at finite strains was apparent for both zzso and passive skeletal muscle mechanical properties with zzso skin and zzso muscle zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso the employed material model was well suited to fit the experimental data and derive zzso model parameters by inverse finite element zzso zzso An individual zzso of in zzso zzso zzso and muscle tissue could thus be zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated from the long-term parameters for human zzso zzso zzso Pa and for zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found at the employed ramp zzso zzso Pa and zzso zzso
