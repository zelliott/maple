There has been increasing emphasis in zzso research on the examination of how regions zzso in a distributed neural zzso zzso data designs present a unique challenge to modeling how zzso among regions change in the presence of experimental zzso The present paper presents the extended unified zzso zzso a novel approach for acquiring effective connectivity maps with zzso zzso The zzso adds to the unified zzso which models both lagged and zzso effects, by zzso the direct effects that experimental zzso have on zzso dependent activity as well as the modulating effects the zzso have on zzso among zzso zzso Carlos simulations included in this paper offer support for the zzso ability to recover zzso patterns used to estimate zzso Next, we apply the model to empirical data to demonstrate zzso Finally, the results of the empirical data are compared to those found using dynamic zzso zzso The zzso provides a flexible approach for modeling zzso data as it may be employed in an zzso partially zzso or entirely zzso zzso
