zzso Disease zzso is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso at risk for HD can be identified by genetic testing in the zzso zzso zzso changes of zzso zzso such as the zzso nucleus are zzso findings zzso early in zzso subjects and may be preceded by distinct functional zzso of zzso zzso This study aims to assess functional integrity of the motor system as a zzso circuit with particular clinical relevance in zzso Ten subjects in the zzso phase of HD and ten matched controls were administered blood oxygen level dependent zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at rest zzso zzso connectivity was measured as zzso of zzso activity between the zzso nucleus and thirteen cortical brain regions zzso zzso volumes were assessed as established markers of disease progression in zzso Linear zzso analysis was performed to test for a relationship between structural changes and group differences in functional zzso zzso subjects showed reduced zzso zzso between two seeds in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso While similar effect sizes could be observed for reduced zzso volumes and differences in functional zzso zzso of determination indicate a moderate relationship between functional connectivity and zzso zzso Our data show reduced zzso functional connectivity at rest in zzso and suggest a relation to early structural brain zzso Additional zzso studies are necessary to zzso the zzso relationship between functional zzso and earliest structural brain changes in zzso
