Visual search requires humans to detect a great variety of target objects in scenes cluttered by other objects or the natural zzso It is unknown whether there is a general purpose neural detection mechanism in the brain that codes the presence of a wide variety of categories of objects embedded in natural zzso We provide evidence for a zzso coding mechanism for detecting zzso relevant targets in natural scenes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso responses in the zzso zzso network reliably predicted the presence of 368 different target objects and also the zzso zzso Other zzso areas such as the primary visual cortex, lateral zzso complex, the zzso and the zzso zzso did not predict target presence, while high-level association areas related to general purpose decision making, including the zzso prefrontal zzso and anterior cingulate, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a main area in the zzso zzso network, correlated with zzso decision confidence and with the task difficulty of individual zzso These results cannot be explained by physical differences across images or eye zzso Thus, the zzso zzso network detects zzso relevant targets in natural scenes independent of their defining visual features and may be the human analog of the priority map in monkey lateral zzso zzso
