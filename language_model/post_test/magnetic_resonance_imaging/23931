To investigate the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging zzso high power focused ultrasound zzso to perform zzso zzso 

Five New Zealand white male rabbit knees with zzso induced arthritis underwent zzso zzso surgery by high power zzso zzso zzso zzso Evidence of tissue zzso was monitored during the procedure and confirmed by gross and microscopic evaluation and zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in five zzso zzso zzso tissue was observed on gross and microscopic zzso Visible signal intensity zzso including high signal intensity on zzso zzso images and lack of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso images were characteristic and zzso 

Our results demonstrate the ability of high power zzso to destroy zzso tissue in zzso
