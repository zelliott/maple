The objective of this study was to investigate total volume and spatial distribution of white matter zzso zzso in a large sample of newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease zzso patients with and without mild cognitive impairment zzso compared to normal controls zzso Furthermore, we aimed to examine the impact of the zzso on zzso performance in zzso zzso is regarded as a zzso zzso Studies on zzso have found zzso associated with reduced cognitive function, especially in the attention and executive zzso The present study included zzso incident, zzso zzso patients zzso years and disease duration zzso zzso and 102 zzso NC zzso zzso Thirty zzso subjects in the zzso sample presented zzso whereas 133 did zzso zzso was classified based on tests for memory, zzso and zzso function compared to the NC group, taking age, sex and education into zzso zzso were outlined on zzso scans using a zzso zzso Total zzso volumes were compared between the 3 study groups, and spatial distribution of zzso zzso masks in each group were compared using zzso probability zzso zzso analysis examined the possible impact of zzso on zzso scores in the zzso zzso Analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the 3 groups in total volume or spatial distribution of zzso In addition there was no significant relationship between total volume or spatial distribution of zzso and zzso functions in zzso We conclude that in this zzso zzso cognitive impairment seems to be independent of zzso zzso
