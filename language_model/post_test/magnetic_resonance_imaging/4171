We sought to determine whether nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation times of water in tissue would be useful to detect molecular damage in lung tissue within 2 weeks after zzso zzso samples were obtained from the lungs of rats at various times between 1 and 14 days after exposure of a zzso to 20 zzso zzso gamma zzso The zzso relaxation time, zzso was measured by the inversion recovery method, and the zzso relaxation time, zzso was measured by both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of lung tissue could be divided into two zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso slow zzso which reflected changes in the zzso and zzso water, zzso The zzso zzso increased significantly 3 days after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso increased significantly 1 day after zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso compared to 138 zzso 7 zzso prior to the observation of abnormalities upon examination of the lung by light zzso The zzso zzso values increased further up to 14 days after zzso when significant increases were observed in values for zzso zzso zzso and water zzso Our results indicate that the molecular zzso in zzso lung tissue was detected by the zzso zzso measurement in the very early stage, and that zzso may be superior to conventional zzso for detecting the early damage to lung tissue after zzso
