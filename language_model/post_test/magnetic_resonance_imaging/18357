zzso resonance imaging was performed in 400 patients with degenerative disc zzso Signal changes and their sites in the zzso body were classified and referred to narrowing of the zzso disc zzso MR findings were compared with those of plain zzso of the zzso zzso Signal changes in the zzso body were noted in 83 cases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso images zzso was the most common finding, and was most frequently seen at the end plate and/or the zzso These changes were correlated with narrowing of the disc space and zzso on the plain zzso of the zzso zzso Signal changes occasionally occurred in the inner region of the zzso body, and these zzso tended to show a high-intensity zzso on zzso We conclude that signal changes in degenerative disc disease are not specific, but are sometimes difficult to distinguish from the signal changes in other conditions such as spinal tumor or bone zzso zzso
