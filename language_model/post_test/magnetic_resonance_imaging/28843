Six patients with zzso involving zzso cerebral zzso were evaluated for their pain thresholds using contact heat (all zzso and sharp zzso that evoke zzso pain zzso Without knowledge of the sensory status of the individuals, two of the authors evaluated the zzso of these patients, and determined to what extent the following cerebral regions were involved in the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each patient's zzso zzso at least two of these zzso Three individuals demonstrated significant zzso differences in pain sensitivity, with elevated thresholds on the hand zzso to zzso zzso The common feature in these cases was the inclusion of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The three other cases showed no evidence of abnormal pain zzso The common feature of these cases was the apparent sparing of the zzso zzso Thus, this series of cases points to the significance of the zzso zzso either alone or with adjacent zzso zzso for normal pain zzso In comparison, extensive involvement of the anterior zzso in two cases was not associated with abnormal pain zzso Four of the six patients were also evaluated with a cold pain tolerance test, which presumably involves more zzso aspects of pain than threshold zzso Only two of these patients showed greater tolerance zzso versus zzso and theirs were the two zzso of the four with involvement of a large part of the zzso This result supports the theory that the zzso involvement in zzso processing is related to the zzso aspect of zzso
