To evaluate the zzso response after acute strength training in chronic Achilles zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Twenty-two patients (44 Achilles zzso 15 zzso 8 patients with bilateral zzso with a median age of 45 zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in the zzso In all patients, both Achilles zzso were examined with zzso before and immediately after a standardized training zzso The most painful side underwent 6 sets and 15 repetitions of zzso eccentric zzso The zzso zzso underwent only concentric loading during the training zzso The zzso volume and the zzso signal were evaluated and calculated by zzso using a zzso zzso 

The immediate response of eccentric loading on the symptomatic zzso resulted in a zzso increase of the zzso volume, evident on zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso increase of the zzso signal evident on zzso from 221 zzso 74 to zzso zzso 78 signal units zzso zzso zzso zzso The corresponding sequences on the zzso zzso loaded zzso showed an increase of zzso of zzso volume, from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increase of zzso of the zzso zzso from 170 zzso 55 to 211 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference of the mean of the increased zzso volume and the zzso signal between the eccentrically heavily loaded symptomatic zzso and the zzso loaded zzso zzso 

Both eccentric and concentric loading of the Achilles zzso resulted in increased total zzso volume and zzso zzso This increase may be explained by a higher water content and/or zzso in the Achilles zzso during and/or immediately after strength training of the zzso zzso
