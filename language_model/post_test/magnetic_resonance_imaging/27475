A new conceptual framework called zzso insensitive steady state imaging is proposed for fast generation of MR images with pure zzso zzso This is accomplished by imaging between zzso spaced inversion zzso with the zzso zzso alternatively residing in states parallel and zzso to zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso With zzso and zzso adequately zzso identical signal time evolution can be obtained for different zzso values, zzso zzso contrast can efficiently be removed from zzso zzso As a specific realization of this principle, zzso insensitive steady state imaging sequences are presented which use True free induction steady zzso zzso blocks between the inversion zzso While the conventional True free induction steady zzso signal time course would be determined by both zzso and zzso a pure zzso dependence is realized with successfully suppressed influence of zzso relaxation, and images with essentially zzso contrast alone are zzso zzso expressions are provided for the description of the ideal signal behavior, which help in creating pathways for sequence zzso zzso The performance of the technique is analyzed with Bloch equation zzso In zzso results obtained in healthy volunteers and brain tumor patients are zzso
