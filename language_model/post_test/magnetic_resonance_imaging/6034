zzso fat has been implicated in the zzso of zzso cardiovascular zzso Whether the associations of zzso fat and measures of cardiac structure and function are independent of the systemic effects of obesity and visceral zzso has not been fully zzso 

Participants from the zzso Heart Study zzso zzso zzso underwent chest and abdominal zzso zzso and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging between 2002 and zzso zzso fat, zzso fat, and visceral zzso tissue zzso from zzso zzso zzso along with body mass index and waist zzso were examined in relation to cardiovascular magnetic resonance measures of left zzso zzso mass, zzso zzso volume, and left zzso zzso In women, zzso fat zzso to zzso zzso zzso fat zzso to zzso zzso visceral zzso tissue zzso to zzso zzso body mass index zzso to zzso zzso and waist circumference zzso to zzso zzso were directly correlated with zzso mass, zzso zzso volume, and left zzso zzso In men, zzso fat zzso to zzso zzso zzso fat zzso to zzso zzso visceral zzso tissue zzso to zzso zzso body mass index zzso to zzso zzso and waist circumference zzso to zzso zzso were directly correlated with zzso mass and left zzso dimension, but zzso zzso volume was not consistently associated with zzso zzso zzso persisted after multivariable adjustment but not after additional adjustment for body weight and visceral zzso zzso except for zzso fat and left zzso dimension in zzso 

zzso fat is correlated with cardiovascular magnetic resonance measures, but the association is not independent of or stronger than other zzso fat stores or proxy measures of visceral zzso An important exception is left zzso dimension in zzso These results suggest that the systemic effects of obesity on cardiac structure and function may outweigh the local zzso effects of zzso zzso
