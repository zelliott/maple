To evaluate the role of bone zzso in diagnosing zzso to the skull base in cancer zzso 

Skull base zzso often causes characteristic clinical zzso zzso treatment ameliorates or zzso symptoms in most zzso Diagnosis may be difficult when zzso studies are negative (as occurs in about one-quarter of zzso Case reports have suggested a role for bone zzso in these zzso 

We reviewed the charts of all patients zzso at our institution who had skull base zzso and at least one zzso study zzso or zzso for clinically suspected zzso to the base of the zzso Bone zzso CT, and zzso were blindly zzso 

We studied 56 patients, of whom 36 had skull base zzso Twenty patients had other causes of the clinical syndrome, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso or benign zzso In 29 of 36 patients zzso with skull base zzso CT or zzso clearly demonstrated the zzso Bone zzso identified a hot spot in the appropriate region of the skull base in 28 of 36 patients zzso All seven patients with negative CT or zzso had positive zzso and four of these had a response to zzso zzso 

zzso of the skull base can demonstrate zzso not identifiable by CT or zzso In cancer patients suspected of having skull base zzso we recommend zzso of the skull base when CT or zzso studies are zzso
