The authors studied 32 patients to delineate the reliability of zzso but frequently extended indications to define the ideal patient who will benefit from convex growth zzso Mean age at the time of convex growth arrest was 29 zzso zzso months, and average follow-up was 40 zzso zzso Mean Cobb angle was 55 degrees zzso zzso before surgery and 50 degrees zzso zzso at final zzso Thirteen patients zzso had a true zzso effect, while 15 zzso had fusion and 4 zzso had zzso The age at surgery, zzso length and location of the curve, presence of zzso anomaly, and presence of zzso plane or rib zzso were investigated in terms of the outcome, but none of these parameters was found to have an effect on the zzso In conclusion, convex growth arrest is a safe and effective method in the management of the young patients with zzso spinal zzso It can be performed for the balanced and zzso acceptable zzso of patients younger than 5 years of age regardless of the type, zzso zzso and location of the curve, the existence of associated rib fusion, or the presence of zzso plane zzso
