This paper proposes a methodology to design a zzso realistic computer simulator of images of the left zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso The simulator takes a magnetic resonance image of a given patient at end zzso uses a manual zzso of that image to model the geometry of the zzso and sets the parameters of the zzso model used for zzso simulation according to a regional labeling of the zzso of the zzso for that zzso The simulated zzso are used to zzso the magnetic resonance zzso throughout the cardiac cycle to generate different image zzso The simulator is validated by zzso its ability to model actual zzso in a set of patients affected by an acute zzso zzso zzso a high correlation has been encountered between the ejection fraction derived from the simulated end zzso deformation of the zzso and the zzso segmented from actual zzso Additionally, most of the parameters that describe the simulated deformation compare well with reported zzso Overall, the simulator is intended as a zzso for extensive comparisons of zzso motion tracking methods due to its ability to relate the impaired zzso function with the associated zzso zzso a novel contribution in the literature of cardiac image zzso
