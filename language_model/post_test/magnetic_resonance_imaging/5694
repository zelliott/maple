This study investigated zzso changes in upper limb dynamic mechanical properties and magnetic resonance imaging zzso parameters following short-term power hand tool zzso Previous studies have found reduction in mechanical properties following short-term power tool usage at long zzso zzso This study advances that work by having participants operate a simulated pistol grip power hand tool and evaluating changes in mechanical properties, strength, discomfort level and zzso prior to tool operation and daily for 3 d after tool zzso zzso participants were randomly assigned to operate a simulated power hand tool for either a high peak reaction force of 123 N zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or at a low peak reaction force of 5 N zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso operated the tool for 60 zzso at the rate of six times per zzso A reduction in zzso zzso zzso was observed 24 h after tool operation for the high force group and this change persisted zzso zzso up to 72 h after tool zzso Similar changes were not observed for the low force zzso No changes were observed in mass moment of inertia, zzso zzso strength and zzso for either group zzso There was a signal intensity increase zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso muscle zzso for both groups 24 h after tool operation but only the high force group remained elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso 72 h after tool zzso zzso short-term changes in mechanical and zzso parameters at high force levels could indicate increased strain on the upper limb and may zzso affect ability to react during rapid forceful loading of the upper zzso This research can ultimately lead to better zzso interventions through quantitative power hand tool design guidelines and work practices based on understanding the damaging effects of exposure to specific levels of reaction force, zzso time and repetition, as well as providing new outcome measures for zzso zzso
