zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso receptors is vital for the cortical zzso underlying zzso and might be disrupted in severe zzso illnesses such as zzso Studies on this topic have been limited to processes in local zzso however, zzso involves large-scale brain systems with multiple interacting zzso A prominent feature of the human zzso global architecture is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that administration of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disrupted the zzso relationship between these systems in terms of zzso zzso and connectivity during performance of delayed working zzso Furthermore, the degree of this disruption predicted task performance and zzso evoked symptoms characteristic of zzso We offer a zzso hypothesis for this disruption via zzso realistic zzso zzso namely cortical zzso Together, the present findings establish links between zzso role in the organization of large-scale zzso neural systems, zzso and symptoms associated with schizophrenia in zzso
