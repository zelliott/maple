zzso transfer zzso technique is a promising method in differential diagnosis of diseases in zzso zzso Basic knowledge about circumstances and elementary factors that influence zzso and its parameters is still insufficient, zzso Having a meal before the magnetic resonance zzso examination could change liver zzso parameters compared to zzso state through zzso in liver zzso blood flow, and content of portal blood zzso and other zzso from a zzso If zzso parameters can be altered by a zzso then MR liver studies should always be performed after zzso Before zzso examinations we examined three healthy volunteers after a high-fat meal with zzso ultrasound technique to find out duration and magnitude of changes in portal blood zzso zzso of zzso or zzso 50% increased zzso value compared to zzso state in portal vein was zzso 90 zzso which is enough for our MR zzso With a zzso zzso MR zzso we examined 10 healthy volunteers after a short zzso from 3 h 45 zzso to 17 h 30 zzso fast and also immediately after a high-fat zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso transfer ratio zzso and zzso transfer rate zzso of liver tissue were zzso zzso changed significantly zzso paired zzso zzso p zzso zzso after a zzso but zzso did not zzso zzso zzso We recommend a 4 h fast before MR examination that aims to determine the zzso of liver zzso
