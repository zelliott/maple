In recent years a number of zzso models have gained prominence in the analysis of dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso However, there remains little evidence to support their use in zzso the absolute values of tissue zzso parameters such as zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso In an attempt to address this issue, data were simulated using a distributed zzso model of zzso zzso and three published models were fitted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso estimates obtained from these fits were compared with the parameters used for the zzso The results indicate that the use of commonly accepted models leads to systematic zzso of the transfer constant, zzso and potentially large zzso of the blood plasma volume zzso zzso In zzso proposals for a practical approach to zzso modeling using zzso data are zzso
