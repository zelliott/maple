The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sequential signal intensity changes in post-traumatic zzso zzso fractures of varying zzso zzso patients with 115 post-traumatic zzso zzso fractures underwent MR zzso The ages of fractures at the time of MR images ranged from 1 day to 6 zzso zzso follow-up MR zzso were obtained in 4 patients for 2 years after initial MR zzso The fracture sites in all 52 fractures with traumatic events less than 3 months prior were zzso on zzso images and zzso on zzso images zzso zzso A type I fracture could be subdivided into 3 patterns depending on its zzso zzso diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In 12 fractures of 3 to 5 months after zzso six showed focal zzso zzso zzso in all pulse zzso and six showed zzso zzso zzso Four of 51 fractures with trauma over 5 months showed focal zzso on zzso images and zzso on zzso images zzso zzso and the remaining 47 fractures showed zzso on all sequences zzso zzso In conclusion, MR imaging is useful in predicting the age of known traumatic zzso fractures, so familiarity with these sequential MR findings would be helpful in distinguishing benign from zzso zzso
