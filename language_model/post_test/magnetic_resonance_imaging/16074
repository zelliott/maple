To evaluate the spatial distribution of cerebral abnormalities in zzso subjects with and without zzso zzso zzso found with zzso transfer imaging zzso 

zzso zzso patients graded from zzso normal to HE grade 2 and 18 healthy control subjects underwent magnetic resonance zzso They gave zzso written zzso zzso transfer ratio zzso maps were generated from zzso We tested for significant differences compared to the control group using statistical zzso mapping zzso for a zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso and white matter was lower in subjects with more severe zzso Changes were found in patients with zzso without neurological deficits in the zzso zzso and bilateral white zzso The loss in zzso transfer increased in severity and spatial extent in patients with overt zzso Patients with HE grade 2 showed an zzso decrease in white and zzso zzso the maximum loss of zzso transfer effect was located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The distribution of zzso changes in HE points to an early involvement of zzso zzso and white matter in zzso
