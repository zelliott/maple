zzso and familiarity represent two processes involved in episodic memory zzso We investigated how zzso (an zzso of zzso zzso zzso influenced brain activity during memory zzso using a paradigm that separated recollection and zzso zzso healthy volunteers were recruited in a randomized, zzso zzso design using zzso zzso Participants were required to perform a verbal recognition memory task within the zzso either under zzso or zzso zzso Depending on the zzso participants were required to make a simple recognition decision zzso zzso or base their decision on more specific information related to prior experience zzso zzso We show a drug zzso in left prefrontal and zzso zzso during zzso Such an effect was specifically driven by novelty and showed an inverse correlation with accuracy zzso Additionally, we show a direct correlation between drug-related signal change in left prefrontal and zzso zzso We discuss the findings in terms of zzso mediation of the zzso signal through zzso zzso and the control of the relative signal strength through prefrontal zzso
