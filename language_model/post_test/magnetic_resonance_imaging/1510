zzso blood flow zzso can be zzso using dynamic zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a mathematical model of underlying zzso zzso of zzso by means of zzso weighted zzso requires knowledge of the zzso input function zzso The zzso can be estimated from the left zzso zzso zzso However, zzso may occur between the zzso and the tissue of interest because of the zzso blood flow profiles, branching of zzso and because of zzso To evaluate the influence of zzso on the results of zzso zzso a simulation study was zzso The zzso was described as a zzso of the zzso with an exponential zzso zzso zzso tissue and zzso zzso were analyzed and the derived parameters fit to the simulated zzso The results show that an zzso zzso may result in a systematic zzso of zzso up to approximately zzso zzso increases with increasing zzso and with increasing zzso Assuming equal zzso at rest and during zzso zzso zzso reserve zzso estimates are also susceptible to zzso of approximately zzso An zzso zzso therefore can lead to systematic zzso of both blood flow and zzso zzso
