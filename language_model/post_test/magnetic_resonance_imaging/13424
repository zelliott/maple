27 patients who underwent a contrast zzso in right anterior zzso at 30 degrees (for various zzso were studied by zzso with a mean delay of zzso zzso zzso zzso After location of the zzso area, a zzso horizontal section zzso of the R zzso and a zzso section zzso portion of the T zzso are carried out using the spin ultrasound zzso The same calculations are used for zzso au zzso contours zzso zzso zzso by two strictly independent zzso With zzso the zzso is under estimated zzso zzso zzso as compared zzso zzso zzso zzso The linear correlation is zzso and in half of the patients (13 in zzso the zzso of the zzso exceeds 10 zzso zzso The volumes also tend to be underestimated with zzso zzso zzso 50 and 64 zzso 51 zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso 66 and 73 zzso 62 zzso but the difference is only significant for the zzso and the linear correlation zzso are improved at zzso and zzso zzso of the parameters measured with zzso is the consequence of multiple factors including the imprecise determination of the true zzso the marked effect of the partial volume related to the thickness of the section, and especially the zzso of the plane studied on zzso compared with the long axis of the zzso The error made by using a calculation algorithm, conceived for zzso methods showing the long axis of the modeled zzso also explains the zzso of volumes obtained with zzso zzso zzso The simple technique used here seems especially interesting in the analysis of zzso zzso Finally, the development of zzso will undoubtedly be extremely beneficial in the study of zzso contraction and zzso
