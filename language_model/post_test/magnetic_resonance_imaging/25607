The diagnosis of seminal zzso invasion by zzso zzso is based on observation of zzso of relatively decreased signal intensity on zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso Similar findings were observed in the absence of tumor invasion in nine patients who had recently undergone zzso needle zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased signal intensity were also present on zzso images in eight zzso These signal intensity abnormalities were of variable location and extent, and usually did not follow the expected pattern of spread from the primary zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso in all patients showed the seminal zzso to be zzso Signal intensity patterns observed on MR images appear to represent zzso breakdown products related to zzso needle zzso which may result in direct trauma to the seminal zzso Another potential mechanism is retrograde transport of blood products from the site of zzso biopsy to the seminal zzso via the zzso zzso Awareness of this phenomenon will assist in accurate interpretation of MR images for staging of prostate zzso
