The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the assessment of zzso zzso 12 hours after onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This investigation included 13 patients who were examined 2 to 12 hours zzso by using an MR imaging protocol consisting of zzso and zzso zzso images, zzso images, fast zzso zzso images, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had been diagnosed using computerized zzso zzso scanning in all zzso In all 13 cases, zzso was reliably detected on both zzso and zzso zzso In contrast with zzso studies, the zzso images were free of zzso fluid flow zzso The zzso was detected on zzso images in only two cases and could not be detected on any zzso or zzso zzso 

Even zzso zzso can be diagnosed reliably from zzso MR images obtained using zzso or zzso zzso Use of these sequences in an emergency MR protocol may zzso the need for additional CT studies to rule out zzso
