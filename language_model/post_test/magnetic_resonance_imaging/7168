The recent advances in imaging of the zzso joint zzso especially the introduction of MR imaging and surface zzso allowing precise zzso of superficial structures led us to reconsider the different techniques used in this very complex anatomical region, due to both its zzso and zzso We also tried to determine their respective role, especially in the study of zzso dysfunction zzso that represent the most frequent pathology of this zzso Conventional zzso allows us to appreciate the overall zzso of the joint movements, and to study bone zzso but CT is much more precise in the study of cortical zzso In zzso dysfunction, the joint itself is studied by either zzso or zzso but both techniques have their limitations and remain complementary in some aspects, which are detailed here, so that the choice between them depends on availability and therapeutic zzso
