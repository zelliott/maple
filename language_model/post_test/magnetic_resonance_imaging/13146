In zzso smooth zzso maps of the visual field are formed along the visual processing zzso zzso the left visual field is represented in the right zzso and vice zzso The reorganization of zzso maps in the lateral zzso nucleus zzso of the zzso and early visual areas zzso is studied in a patient who was born with only one cerebral zzso Before the seventh week of embryonic zzso the development of the patient's right cerebral zzso zzso Despite the complete loss of her right zzso zzso and zzso at birth, the patient's remaining zzso has not only developed maps of the zzso (right) visual zzso but, surprisingly, also maps of the zzso (left) visual zzso zzso zzso changed their predetermined crossing pattern in the zzso zzso and grew to the zzso zzso In the visual cortex, islands of zzso visual field representations were located along the representations of the vertical zzso In zzso smooth and continuous maps from zzso and zzso zzso overlap each other, whereas in zzso V2 and zzso zzso quarter field representations invaded small distinct cortical zzso This reveals a surprising flexibility of the zzso zzso mechanisms responsible for map zzso
