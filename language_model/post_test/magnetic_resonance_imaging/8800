zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a technology used to detect brain zzso zzso of brain zzso have been zzso as zzso for various zzso zzso zzso deception based on the pattern of brain zzso characterized with zzso is getting attention - with machine learning zzso being applied to this field in recent zzso The high zzso of zzso data makes it a difficult task to directly zzso the original data as input for zzso zzso in detecting zzso In this paper, we investigated the procedures of feature selection to enhance zzso deception zzso 

We used the zzso map derived from the statistical zzso mapping analysis of zzso signals to construct features that reflect brain zzso zzso We subsequently investigated various feature selection methods including an ensemble method to identify zzso features to detect zzso Using 124 features selected from a set of zzso original features as zzso for a support zzso machine zzso our results indicate that feature selection significantly enhanced the zzso accuracy of the support zzso machine in comparison to the models trained using all features and dimension reduction based zzso Furthermore, the selected features are shown to form zzso clusters within brain regions, which supports the hypothesis that specific brain regions may play a role during deception zzso 

Feature selection not only enhances zzso accuracy in zzso deception detection but also provides support for the biological hypothesis that brain activities in certain regions of the brain are important for discrimination of zzso
