zzso expression of the zzso marker zzso 2 zzso or melanoma zzso on cancer cells and zzso zzso is associated with an aggressive disease course in several zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, we investigated the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso progression and its potential as a therapeutic target in clinically relevant zzso and melanoma animal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines resulted in increased growth rate, zzso and vascular zzso compared to control, zzso negative zzso The effect of zzso zzso function was investigated after zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso in patient zzso zzso as well as in established subcutaneous zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso reduced melanoma proliferation and increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso in two zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso growth and zzso levels, zzso and zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso invasion and decreased zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso promotes zzso progression by multiple mechanisms and represents an amenable target for cancer molecular zzso
