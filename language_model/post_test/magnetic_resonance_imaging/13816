Acute zzso zzso was assessed in zzso in rats using magnetic resonance zzso techniques, including MR imaging zzso MR zzso zzso and electron zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso Three hours following the zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso a region of zzso characterized by an increase in signal intensity, was observed zzso to the zzso zzso zzso region in zzso MR images of rat zzso Image analysis of these regions of apparent zzso indicated a statistically significant increase in signal intensity around the zzso region following zzso administration, in comparison with controls and regions peripheral to the zzso zzso An increase in signal intensity was also observed zzso to the zzso region in water chemical shift selective images zzso of zzso rat zzso indicating that the increased signal observed by zzso is an zzso response to the zzso zzso assessment zzso and electron zzso and serum liver zzso function tests zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso tissue injury observed by zzso In zzso and in zzso MRS was used to detect zzso in zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso during the zzso response zzso h zzso zzso assessment of zzso acid extracts of zzso rat zzso were used to confirm the MRS zzso In zzso zzso zzso was used to monitor decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso 2-3 h following zzso zzso In zzso MR techniques zzso MRS and zzso zzso are able to highlight effects that may not have been evident in single end point studies, and are ideal methods to follow tissue injury progression in zzso increasing the power of a study through repeated measures, and decreasing the number of animals to perform a similar study using zzso or zzso zzso
