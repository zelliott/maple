To estimate the zzso of zzso zzso to the brain and skeleton in patients suspected of having zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso higher than zzso with surgically zzso disease, to assess the accuracy of screening magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso bone scanning for help in identifying zzso zzso and to determine the effectiveness of a high dose of MR contrast zzso 

zzso patients suspected of having zzso localized to the lung or to the lung and regional zzso underwent zzso MR imaging with contrast material enhancement and zzso bone scanning for detection of brain or skeletal zzso Patients were followed up for 12 months to determine the zzso of clinical zzso zzso 

Eight zzso patients had zzso zzso disease to the brain or zzso Brain zzso were identified on MR images in five of six zzso Bone zzso were identified on MR images in four of five patients and on bone scans in three of five zzso MR imaging was no more accurate than bone scanning for skeletal zzso A high dose of MR contrast material allowed detection of more zzso and of small zzso 

zzso MR imaging of the brain is indicated for the exclusion of brain zzso in patients with clinically zzso known or possible zzso and a large zzso zzso lung zzso zzso imaging may be indicated if an isolated brain zzso is zzso
