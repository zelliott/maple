The aims of this study were to examine abnormalities in brain structure in adolescents and young adults with very low birth weight zzso zzso zzso and associations of these abnormalities with zzso zzso The sample of 108 participants from 14 to 19 years of age included 37 participants with zzso g birth weight, 35 with zzso g birth weight, and 36 normal birth weight zzso zzso One or both of the zzso groups had smaller brain volumes, larger lateral zzso and a small surface area of the corpus zzso than the zzso zzso Group differences in white matter zzso structures, zzso gray matter zzso and the zzso were found even when controlling for whole brain volume zzso and were most pronounced in the zzso g zzso zzso reductions in the two zzso groups relative to zzso controls were associated with more pervasive cognitive deficits than were reductions in zzso zzso zzso of cognitive outcomes with structural abnormalities remained when controlling for zzso or zzso zzso The results are consistent with previous findings of residual brain abnormalities in adolescents and young adults with zzso and provide new information on their cognitive zzso
