The occurrence of unexpectedly high numbers of horses with neurological signs during two outbreaks of zzso required prompt in-depth researching of these cases, including the exploration of magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a possible diagnostic zzso 

To describe the case series and assess the usefulness of zzso as an imaging zzso for cases suspected of zzso zzso in the cerebral zzso 

Four cases suspected of suffering from cerebral damage due to zzso zzso zzso zzso infection were examined zzso zzso zzso by clinical chemistry (3 zzso and zzso (2 zzso In one case, zzso findings were compared to images acquired using computer zzso zzso 

In all cases, cerebral zzso positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso were found, which explained the clinical zzso Although the zzso could be zzso with CT, zzso images were superior in representing the exact zzso reality of the soft tissue zzso 

The diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso by zzso brain zzso was zzso zzso appeared to be an excellent tool for the imaging of cerebral zzso in the zzso 

The high zzso of neurological complications could not be explained but possibly indicated a change in zzso of certain strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were very detailed, permitting zzso of much smaller zzso than demonstrated in this study and this could allow prompt clinical intervention in less advanced cases with a better zzso Further, zzso could assist in the surgical treatment of brain zzso as has been described earlier for zzso
