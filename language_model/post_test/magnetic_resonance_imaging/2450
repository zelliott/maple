A case of zzso zzso zzso and its appearance on zzso is zzso The tumor showed a zzso architecture on zzso with a large central core of very low signal intensity and a peripheral rim of intermediate to high signal intensity on zzso and zzso spin echo pulse zzso The core showed decreased zzso with dense collagen deposition on zzso examination, and the peripheral zone increased zzso with increased nuclear zzso The presence of a prominent region of very low signal intensity on zzso and zzso weighted images can be seen with neural tumors, giant cell tumor of the zzso zzso aggressive zzso and, in rare instances, with soft tissue zzso rich in zzso
