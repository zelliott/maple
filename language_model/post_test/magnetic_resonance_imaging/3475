The aim of this study was to identify potential risk factors for and determine the rate of zzso zzso fracture zzso after zzso zzso CT zzso zzso body zzso zzso for spinal zzso 

The study group consisted of 123 zzso bodies zzso in 93 patients enrolled in prospective protocols for zzso zzso Data from these patients were zzso zzso zzso body zzso consisted of 1, 3, or 5 zzso for overall median doses of 18, 27, and 30 zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging studies, obtained at baseline and at each zzso were evaluated for zzso tumor involvement, and zzso zzso zzso average pain levels were scored based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both at baseline and at zzso zzso was defined as a body mass index zzso zzso 

The median imaging follow-up was zzso months zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five new or progressing fractures zzso were identified, and the median time to progression was 3 months after zzso The most common zzso included zzso cancer zzso zzso 10 fractures, 10 tumor zzso breast cancer (20 zzso 0 fractures, 5 tumor zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso 1 zzso 2 tumor zzso zzso cell lung cancer (13 zzso 3 fractures, 3 tumor zzso and zzso (9 zzso 2 fractures, 2 tumor zzso Fifteen zzso were treated with zzso or zzso after zzso with 5 procedures done for zzso zzso zzso progression was noted in 32 locations zzso with 5 months' median time to zzso At the time of noted fracture progression there was a trend toward higher average pain scores but no significant change in the median zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that an age zzso 55 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso fracture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso baseline pain and narcotic use before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were statistically significant zzso of fracture zzso On zzso analysis an age zzso 55 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso fracture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and baseline pain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be significant risks, whereas obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso body zzso is associated with a significant risk zzso of zzso zzso factors for zzso include an age zzso 55 years, a zzso zzso and baseline zzso These risk factors may aid in the selection of which spinal zzso patients should be considered for zzso zzso stabilization or zzso zzso Clinical trial registration zzso zzso
