The perception of tactile stimuli on the face is modulated if subjects zzso observe a face being zzso this effect, termed visual zzso of touch zzso is maximum for observing one's own zzso In the present zzso study, we investigated the neural basis of the zzso zzso Participants in the scanner received tactile zzso near the zzso zzso on their right, left, or both zzso zzso they watched movies depicting their own face, another person's face, or a ball that could be touched or only approached by human zzso Participants were requested to distinguish between unilateral and bilateral tactile zzso zzso perception of tactile stimuli was modulated by viewing a tactile zzso with a stronger effect when viewing one's own face being zzso In terms of brain activity, viewing touch was related with an enhanced activity in the zzso zzso zzso The specific effect of viewing touch on oneself was instead related with a reduced activity in both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The present findings suggest that zzso is supported by a network of zzso zzso The zzso zzso area might zzso visual information about touch onto tactile zzso zzso zzso zzso might specifically zzso zzso interaction when sensory information is related to one's own zzso Then this activity might back project to the zzso zzso thus affecting tactile zzso
