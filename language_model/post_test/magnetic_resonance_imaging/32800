zzso iron oxide zzso zzso were zzso for use as a zzso contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging zzso The coated zzso were zzso in shape with an average diameter of 20 zzso The gold shell was about 2 zzso zzso The bonding status of the gold on the zzso surfaces was checked using a zzso transform infrared zzso zzso The zzso zzso confirmed the attachment of homocysteine, in the form of zzso to the zzso shell of the zzso zzso The zzso ratio, zzso for the coated zzso was zzso higher than that of a commercial contrast agent, zzso which showed the potential for their use as a zzso contrast agent with high zzso In animal experiments, the presence of the zzso in rat liver resulted in a zzso decrease in signal intensity in zzso MR images, indicating that our zzso iron oxide zzso are suitable for use as a zzso contrast agent in zzso
