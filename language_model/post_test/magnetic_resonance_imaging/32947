zzso progress has been made in small animal single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging in the field of Parkinson's zzso In zzso research, there is an increasing demand for in zzso imaging techniques to apply to animal zzso Here, we report the first protocol for zzso zzso zzso zzso in common zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained on an upgraded clinical scanner to determine the distribution zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso After intravenous injection of approximately 60 zzso of the zzso zzso stable and specific zzso zzso was observed for at least zzso Analysis of plasma samples showed rapid disappearance of the zzso from blood plasma within a few minutes after application, with activity declining to zzso of the administered zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso at 400 zzso resolution provided the details of the underlying zzso In a zzso model of Parkinson's disease, which was generated by unilateral injections of zzso zzso into the zzso projection pathway, complete loss of zzso zzso binding in combination with behavioral deficits was zzso The presented study demonstrates that zzso zzso is a suitable tool to investigate zzso integrity in zzso studies on common zzso
