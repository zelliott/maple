To perform true three-dimensional zzso experiments in the human brain, dedicated localized zzso imaging zzso methods were zzso zzso acquisition allows generation of zzso maps with minimal vascular enhancement related to inflow zzso The rapid acquisition of the zzso zzso 100 zzso reduces signal zzso caused by motion, zzso the detection of the small intensity changes expected with brain zzso zzso zzso was performed on normal volunteers at zzso zzso imaging a three-dimensional zzso volume zzso zzso 45 zzso 45 zzso in the superior portion of the brain with a spatial resolution of zzso zzso 5 zzso 5 zzso Increased brain coverage was achieved with a zzso imaging zzso version, which simultaneously achieved effective suppression of signals from zzso zzso In addition, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso versions of the technique were used to detect blood zzso level dependent zzso signal changes in the motor zzso with a zzso zzso Images obtained by the zzso sequence were zzso comparable to standard zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso functional zzso zzso experiments showed consistent zzso in the zzso primary zzso zzso Furthermore, significant differences in location and magnitude of zzso was observed between the two methods, confirming theoretical zzso
