Most current models of knowledge organization in the brain are based on zzso or zzso categories zzso zzso Another important organizational pattern is zzso zzso zzso categories held together by external relations, a unifying scene or event zzso and zzso We used zzso to examine neural zzso patterns as subjects performed a category construction task where these two category types were zzso zzso were visually presented with a target word followed by the presentation of two match words and had to choose by button press one match that goes best with the target zzso In the balanced or zzso condition zzso zzso both match words fit the zzso in the biased conditions only one match word fit the target either thematically zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso We found that in the biased conditions, zzso and zzso categories recruited very similar cortical zzso left inferior zzso middle zzso and zzso zzso In the balanced condition subjects showed no behavioral preference for either zzso or zzso zzso However, contrasting signal changes during a zzso zzso choice in the presence of a zzso alternative zzso a zzso zzso choice in the presence of a zzso alternative required the additional recruitment of right middle frontal zzso left zzso and left zzso Our results suggest that zzso relations between objects are processed similarly to zzso relations, but require less cerebral processing demand, providing validation for zzso categories as an alternative principle of conceptual zzso
