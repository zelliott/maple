zzso zzso was proven as a promising approach for experimental zzso zzso zzso Clinical data are, however, zzso so zzso A detailed characterization of specific EPO effects could facilitate the design of zzso The aim of the present investigation was, therefore, to characterize these effects on prevention of delayed zzso cerebral zzso zzso impaired zzso and cerebral blood flow zzso after experimental zzso 

27 male zzso rats were zzso in 3 groups: zzso zzso control, and zzso zzso zzso was induced by injection of zzso zzso blood into the zzso magna on days 1 and zzso Animals of the zzso EPO group received zzso zzso EPO zzso zzso after the 2nd zzso zzso Surviving animals were examined on day 5 by MR zzso weighted imaging zzso zzso blood flow zzso and volume zzso were determined by zzso zzso CVS by zzso artery zzso diameter, and zzso by zzso cell count zzso 

BA diameter was significantly reduced in both zzso groups, but improved significantly after EPO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso EPO zzso The zzso ratio was zzso zzso zzso zzso control, and zzso zzso zzso The improvement by EPO did not reach statistical zzso zzso ratio was also significantly reduced in both zzso groups, but was significantly improved by EPO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso EPO zzso Surviving zzso cells were significantly reduced in zzso controls in all areas, but in zzso EPO only in zzso 

The present data suggest that an EPO application in a timely distance to the zzso is sufficient to prevent delayed zzso CVS, but that the doses were insufficient to improve zzso or to be directly zzso
