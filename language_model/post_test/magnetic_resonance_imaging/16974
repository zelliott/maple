zzso studies in humans and animals suggest that zzso zzso methods such as zzso direct current stimulation zzso can elicit long-lasting zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso Application of zzso can have significant and selective behavioral consequences that are associated with the cortical location of the stimulation zzso and the task engaged during stimulation zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso affects human behavior is zzso Recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been used to determine the spatial topography of zzso effects zzso but no behavioral data were collected during zzso The present study is unique in this regard, in that both neural and behavioral responses were recorded using a novel combination of left frontal zzso zzso during an overt zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso had significant behavioral and regionally specific neural zzso zzso Furthermore, faster naming responses correlated with decreased blood oxygen zzso zzso signal in zzso zzso Our data support the importance of zzso area within the normal naming network and as such indicate that zzso area may be a suitable candidate site for zzso in zzso of zzso patients, whose brain damage spares this zzso
