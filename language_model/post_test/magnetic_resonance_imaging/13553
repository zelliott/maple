Controlled delivery of drugs to the small zzso in relation to zzso of an zzso meal is important in various zzso zzso We investigated the effects of different food zzso and the amount of zzso liquid on the zzso distribution of a contrast zzso 

Five healthy subjects received four meals (each 650 zzso A, mashed potato with 100 zzso zzso B, rice with 100 zzso zzso C, hamburger meal with 100 zzso zzso D, hamburger meal with 300 zzso zzso A capsule filled with zzso zzso zzso acid solution (as contrast zzso was zzso following meal zzso and its zzso distribution was assessed by magnetic resonance zzso 

Initially, marker distribution was confined to the zzso and subsequently extended along the inner zzso of the zzso The maximum distribution volume of the marker was lower in meal A than in meal B zzso zzso zzso No differences in marker distribution were observed when the hamburger meal was given with 100 or 300 zzso zzso 

The zzso distribution zzso of the marker zzso zzso zzso acid appeared to depend on meal consistency, but not on the amount of water zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging allows detailed analysis of the zzso distribution of a drug model in relation to meal zzso and zzso meal zzso
