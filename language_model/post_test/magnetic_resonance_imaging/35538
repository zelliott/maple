The zzso relaxation time, zzso can be estimated from two or more zzso zzso recalled echo images zzso acquired with different flip angles and/or repetition times zzso The function relating signal intensity to flip angle and zzso is zzso however, a linear form proposed 30 years ago is currently widely zzso Here we show that this linear method provides zzso estimates that have similar precision but lower accuracy than those obtained with a zzso zzso We also show that zzso estimated by the linear method is biased due to improper accounting for noise in the zzso This bias can be significant for clinical zzso zzso for example, zzso estimated in brain tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1600 zzso can be overestimated by zzso to zzso We propose a weighting scheme that correctly accounts for the noise contribution in the fitting zzso zzso Carlo simulations of zzso experiments are used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated zzso from the zzso zzso the proposed zzso zzso and the zzso zzso We show that the linear method with weighted uncertainties reduces the bias of the linear method, providing zzso estimates comparable in precision and accuracy to those of the zzso method while reducing zzso time zzso
