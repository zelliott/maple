The accurate assessment of zzso size is an important consideration during zzso evaluation of adrenal tumors, particularly zzso however the zzso zzso is still a controversial topic in some zzso size is a bad indicator of zzso there is still a confusion in the zzso zzso for tumors between 3 and 6 zzso and no universal consensus on the exact zzso value for zzso has been zzso Nowadays it is clearly accepted that the zzso zzso alone is extremely limited in the assessment of adrenal zzso zzso some studies suggested the relative inaccuracy of conventional CT in evaluating the size: zzso examination underestimated consistently adrenal tumor zzso The aim of this study was to confirm those suggested zzso 

Our study compared the zzso estimated size and the zzso size of 26 zzso operated on with a zzso zzso 

Our data confirm the inaccuracy of CT and zzso in predicting the size of zzso particularly for tumor measuring less than 3 zzso CT and zzso significantly underestimated size of adrenal tumors, zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso 

The decision to operate, even with the advent and safety of zzso zzso cannot only rely on the zzso zzso zzso have to perform multiple 1 zzso cuts until the very superior and inferior tip of this tumor in order to provide a better zzso of the zzso
