zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso using zzso spin labeling zzso methods has the potential to provide better zzso of the functional signal to the sites of neural activity compared to blood zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso At present, experiments using zzso have been limited to simple block and periodic zzso zzso We present here an adaptation of the general linear model to zzso zzso that enables the design and analysis of more complicated designs, such as random and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso estimate of the zzso response and the F statistic for the detection of a response are zzso zzso expressions and useful approximations for detection power and zzso efficiency are zzso and it is shown that the zzso between power and efficiency for zzso experiments is similar to that previously observed for zzso zzso The zzso estimate is compared with an estimate formed from the running zzso of tag and control zzso The running zzso estimate is shown to be approximately equal to a temporally zzso version of the zzso zzso zzso simulations and results from zzso experiments are used to support the theoretical zzso
