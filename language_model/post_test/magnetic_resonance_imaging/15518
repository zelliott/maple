Imaging of cerebral vein zzso is still zzso Currently, diagnosis is based on CT zzso and zzso including zzso and conventional digital zzso zzso However, especially in chronic cases, each method has shown its zzso Newer strategies for zzso are found on molecular imaging using targeted contrast zzso The aim of this study was to prove the feasibility of a novel zzso MR contrast agent zzso zzso zzso for selective imaging of zzso zzso zzso in an animal zzso 

zzso of the superior zzso zzso with human blood was induced in 6 pigs using a combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso was then performed before and up to 120 minutes after injection of 4 zzso body weight zzso zzso imaging was performed with a zzso high-resolution zzso zzso echo zzso Time courses of zzso ratio and zzso ratio were zzso zzso were then surgically removed and the zzso concentration was zzso 

In all cases the zzso could be successfully zzso the complete MR protocol could be performed in 5 zzso In these cases the zzso showed selective enhancement after injection of the molecular contrast zzso However, a continuous zzso ratio increase was seen up to 120 minutes after contrast administration, achieving a zzso ratio of zzso between zzso and the blood zzso 

The novel zzso molecular MR contrast zzso allows selective and zzso imaging of cerebral zzso vein zzso in an animal zzso
