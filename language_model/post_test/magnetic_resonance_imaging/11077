To identify objective features zzso zzso with isolated zzso pain and distinguishing this condition from zzso 

zzso patients presenting with zzso pain were studied zzso The diagnoses were zzso arthritis in six patients and zzso zzso in seven zzso among the 20 remaining patients, in whom zzso pain was the only zzso 11 responded to zzso zzso drugs zzso and were diagnosed with zzso zzso whereas the nine unresponsive patients were diagnosed with zzso A physical examination, laboratory tests, plain zzso and zzso scan and resonance imaging zzso scan of a painful zzso were done in each zzso 

Among the 11 patients with zzso zzso two experienced inflammatory joint symptoms during the zzso follow-up and three patients had zzso scanning and zzso evidence of zzso inflammation similar to that in nine patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The feature that best zzso between zzso zzso and zzso was responsiveness to zzso 

These preliminary data suggest that isolated zzso pain may indicate zzso in some zzso The imaging methods used in this study lacked sensitivity for zzso which may therefore have been missed in some zzso The development of bone and joint zzso may provide additional insights into the zzso abnormalities present in patients with isolated zzso zzso
