We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypothesis that the nature of the neural response to taste varies as a function of the task the subject is asked to zzso zzso received sweet, sour, salty and zzso solutions passively and while evaluating stimulus presence, zzso and zzso Within the zzso and zzso zzso the location of zzso response to taste zzso zzso varied as a function of zzso however, the primary taste zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a more zzso region of anterior zzso responded to taste zzso zzso irrespective of zzso Although the response here did not depend upon task, preferential connectivity between zzso and the zzso zzso was observed when subjects tasted passively compared with when they performed a zzso This suggests that information transfer between zzso and the zzso is zzso during implicit processing of zzso In contrast, a region of the left lateral zzso zzso zzso responded zzso to taste and to zzso when subjects evaluated zzso and was zzso connected to earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso when a taste was zzso This suggests that processing in the lateral zzso organizes the retrieval of zzso information from earlier zzso in the service of computing perceived zzso These findings show that neural zzso of taste varies as a function of task beyond that of the initial cortical zzso
