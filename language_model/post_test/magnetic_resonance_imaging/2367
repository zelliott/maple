MR zzso requires a zzso measurement that is accurate within zzso in zzso zzso methods are susceptible to signal loss and tend to underestimate zzso Current methods zzso zzso zzso or zzso cycling patterns that prevent signal loss at each data zzso However, using these methods with imperfect zzso zzso tends to be overestimated due to temporary storage of the zzso along the zzso axis where it zzso more slowly with a time constant zzso zzso zzso To reduce the zzso dependence while preventing signal loss, we zzso simple zzso composite zzso and good zzso cycling zzso These trains are critical for zzso accuracy over typical ranges of zzso and zzso field zzso and zzso zzso zzso signal zzso during each zzso pulse must be accounted for to yield accuracy within zzso when the zzso is zzso or more of the zzso zzso A simple correction scheme compensates for this zzso error zzso
