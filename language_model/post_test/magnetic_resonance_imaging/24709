During neck surgery the head of the patient is located in such a position that the zzso is zzso compared to the normal zzso The consideration of this tissue deformation of the neck during head rotation is the first step to using zzso image data for medical zzso 

The tissue shift was measured and analyzed based on zzso data of a subject group of 5 zzso 

The big vessels, lying zzso to the zzso demonstrated a larger shift than those vessels, lying zzso The shift was zzso to the head rotation and the shift of the zzso zzso zzso was less pronounced than the shift of the zzso zzso zzso even though they both run in the same zzso In the zzso neck section, the movement of the tissue was larger than in the zzso neck zzso 

The knowledge about tissue shifts in different head positions should promote zzso minimally invasive zzso The expectation is that such examinations facilitate the navigation in neck surgery with online calculation of tissue zzso
