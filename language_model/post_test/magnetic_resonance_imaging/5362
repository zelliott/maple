The presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a worse zzso Uniform guidelines on zzso dissection are missing, mainly because of the value of diagnostic techniques for the detection of zzso zzso are not zzso This study is performed to identify CT and zzso criteria for detection of zzso zzso 149 patients who underwent zzso and a zzso dissection between 1990 and 2010 were zzso zzso zzso treatment and follow up data were zzso On zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso different test criteria were zzso Considering zzso with a zzso zzso diameter of zzso zzso as positive predicts zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity zzso and zzso zzso and 50% and zzso zzso Other risk factors for zzso zzso were zzso extension of the zzso zzso is zzso and clinical positive neck status zzso is zzso When at least one of these risk factors was present and the status of zzso was considered positive, a high sensitivity zzso for CT and zzso for zzso and a lower specificity zzso for CT and zzso for zzso was zzso If at least one of the risk factors such as zzso extension, clinical positive neck and zzso with a zzso zzso diameter of zzso zzso is present, sensitivity and negative zzso value for the prediction of zzso zzso are high, but the specificity is zzso These risk factors can be used to select zzso patients for zzso zzso
