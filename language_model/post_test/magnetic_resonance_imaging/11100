Mental rotation tests traditionally show a male performance zzso Some zzso studies have reported zzso cortical zzso patterns during mental zzso However, these experiments used abstract stimuli and some studies did not systematically exclude performance as a zzso zzso The mental rotation of hands and zzso objects, compared to abstract objects, is known to evoke an zzso motor zzso In this study, we used zzso to explore potential zzso cortical zzso patterns for the mental rotation of hands and tools in a sample with an adequate and equal performance for men and zzso We found a common neural zzso for men and women zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso areas, compatible with an zzso motor strategy for the mental rotation of hands and zzso Sex differences were modest and limited to the mental rotation of zzso Women recruited more left zzso zzso cortex, which could imply that women rely more on zzso or use more zzso zzso Men, on the other hand, drafted more the zzso zzso possibly referring to more extensive semantic or early visual zzso We conclude that men and women use a very similar motor strategy during zzso mental rotation with a potential zzso zzso
