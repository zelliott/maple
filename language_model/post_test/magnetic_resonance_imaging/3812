During the first zzso years of life children undergo a period of major zzso zzso zzso cognitive functions such as executive control of attention, zzso and retrieving of stored information and zzso behavior are present but less developed compared to older zzso There is only very limited information from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies about the level of organization of functional networks in children in the early school zzso In this study we perform continuous zzso functional connectivity zzso in zzso to 8-year-old children in an awake state to identify and characterize zzso networks zzso zzso zzso independent component analysis zzso approach was applied to analyze the zzso We identified 14 components consisting of regions known to be involved in visual and auditory processing, motor function, attention control, memory, and the default mode network zzso Most networks, in particular those supporting basic motor function and sensory related processing, had a robust functional organization similar to mature adult zzso In contrast, the zzso and other zzso involved in zzso cognitive functions had immature zzso revealing incomplete and fragmented patterns indicating less developed functional zzso We therefore conclude that the zzso and other zzso involved in higher order cognitive functioning are zzso yet in an immature state, at an age when these cognitive abilities are zzso
