To measure the internal lung motion due to zzso using magnetic resonance images zzso to evaluate the correlation between lung motion and skin surface motion and the reliability of tracking lung motion with external zzso 

An zzso protocol using fast zzso sequences was developed to acquire dynamic zzso images of the zzso region along the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The subjects (3 healthy volunteers and 4 lung cancer zzso were instructed to perform normal or altered breathing during zzso Lung vessels identified on zzso were used as zzso landmarks for internal lung zzso From zzso zzso zzso scans, the positions of the lung vessels and skin surface were tracked and their movements zzso zzso between the movements of the external markers and internal structures was then calculated and zzso 

Lung vessel motion in the zzso zzso direction correlated best with zzso abdominal skin surface movement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for volunteers and patients, zzso The zzso (AP) vessel motion generally correlated poorly with the skin surface movement, with marker placement on the upper chest yielding the strongest results zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for volunteers and patients, zzso The strength of the correlation depended on the locations of the tracked vessels, locations of the skin surface, and subjects' breathing zzso The best correlation was seen between the motion of an abdominal zzso and zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso 

Movement of an external zzso may not correlate fully with, or zzso internal lung zzso zzso monitoring of zzso may have to rely on a combination of multiple zzso and other zzso zzso such as lung volume and/or air zzso
