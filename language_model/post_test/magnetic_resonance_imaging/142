The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess whether parameters derived from magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso provide incremental zzso value compared with International Federation of zzso and zzso zzso stage in zzso cancer patients treated with zzso intent using concurrent zzso 

This was a retrospective study of patients with zzso advanced cervical cancer staged by examination under zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Potential zzso factors examined were derived from either clinical evaluation zzso zzso stage, clinical diameter, zzso zzso zzso invasion, tumor zzso or PET zzso zzso zzso zzso measures examined were overall survival, zzso survival, time to failure, local failure, zzso failure, and distant zzso 

There were 206 eligible zzso The mean potential follow-up was zzso zzso At 5 years, for all patients, overall survival rate was zzso For all outcome measures apart from local failure, for which zzso zzso was the most powerful adverse zzso factor zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso status on PET was the dominant zzso and zzso zzso zzso Corpus involvement on zzso was significantly associated with zzso involvement on PET but of zzso parameters only tumor volume has zzso value, limited to time to failure and zzso zzso 

zzso status on PET was the major predictor of outcome in locally advanced zzso cancer treated with zzso and was superior to zzso zzso zzso volume measured from zzso appears to be an important predictor of zzso zzso
