To implement a high-resolution zzso zzso zzso imaging protocol zzso at 3 zzso and to evaluate the zzso image quality and accuracy of this approach zzso in patients with suspected zzso We hypothesized that utilizing the gain in zzso at 3 T to increase spatial resolution would reduce partial volume effects and zzso dark rim artifacts in comparison to zzso zzso zzso studies were performed on 60 patients using a segmented zzso zzso echo sequence (in plane resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assessment of dark rim artifacts was performed for the stress studies on a zzso zzso zzso visual analysis was compared to quantitative coronary zzso zzso results; zzso significant zzso was defined as zzso zzso at zzso Dark rim artifacts appeared in 108 of 180 slices zzso extent zzso zzso zzso zzso representing zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and test accuracy for the detection of significant zzso were zzso and zzso zzso studies at 3 T are feasible in a clinical setting, providing good image quality and high accuracy for detection of significant zzso The presence of dark rim artifacts does not appear to represent a diagnostic problem when using a zzso zzso
