In animal studies of tissue engineering of bone, zzso remains the standard for assessing bone zzso As zzso studies with this method are feasible only at the cost of large numbers of animals, we looked for an zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso and zzso zzso bone zzso zzso implants were zzso implanted in a zzso At 1, 3, 5, and 7 weeks zzso soft X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging zzso were done to monitor bone formation in the zzso At 7 weeks, the animal was killed and the implants were retrieved for zzso Our results showed that in zzso zzso is well suited to assess bone formation larger than zzso zzso in diameter and to monitor the complete three-dimensional shape of the newly formed bone zzso and zzso The zzso results matched well with the zzso results obtained at 7 zzso In contrast, X-ray imaging appeared inappropriate to monitor the bone formation process in zzso
