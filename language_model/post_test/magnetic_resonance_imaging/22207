To evaluate fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso sequences in zzso brain zzso 

zzso images from 32 patients with suspected zzso or white matter disease were independently evaluated by two zzso zzso The observer preferences for image quality and zzso detection were zzso for differences between fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso quality was compared with that of fast zzso zzso zzso 

Images of a diagnostic quality equivalent to that of fast zzso zzso images were achieved with both zzso zzso Grey and white matter differentiation and zzso fluid zzso zzso were significantly better on fast zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso was reduced on zzso zzso zzso There was no difference in zzso zzso Fast zzso zzso images were visually preferred at the expense of longer imaging zzso 

Fast zzso techniques are complementary to fast zzso zzso sequences in imaging of the zzso zzso We find that the fast zzso zzso sequence is preferable to the zzso zzso zzso
