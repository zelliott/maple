The use of functional brain imaging techniques offers the possibility of uncovering the cerebral processing of the human pain zzso In recent years, many imaging studies have focused on defining a network of brain structures involved in the processing of normal zzso Additionally, it has been shown that zzso pain, which is a frequent symptom of zzso pain, causes distinct patterns of brain zzso In the present study, we zzso analyzed the data of previous functional imaging zzso Studies were thus collected by means of a zzso zzso A zzso using the zzso zzso method was conducted to zzso the acquired zzso We then used this data to zzso and compare the cerebral zzso of zzso normal and zzso pain, zzso zzso and mechanical pain, zzso different types of zzso pain zzso zzso and zzso clinical zzso and experimental zzso The results suggest the existence of zzso although zzso zzso networks related to these different types of zzso
