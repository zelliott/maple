Human zzso studies suggest that zzso and identification of relevant auditory objects are accomplished via parallel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using combined zzso zzso zzso and electromagnetic zzso zzso we investigated whether such dual pathways exist already in the human zzso auditory cortex, as suggested by animal models, and whether selective attention zzso sound zzso and identification by modulating these pathways in a zzso zzso We found a double zzso in response adaptation to sound pairs with phonetic zzso spatial sound changes, demonstrating that the human zzso auditory zzso indeed processes zzso identity and location in parallel anterior zzso (in zzso zzso zzso anterior superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (in zzso zzso and zzso superior zzso zzso pathways as early as approximately zzso zzso from stimulus zzso Our data further show that the zzso zzso is activated approximately 30 zzso earlier than the zzso pathway, possibly enabling the brain to use zzso spatial information in auditory object zzso zzso selectively attending to phonetic content modulated response adaptation in the zzso pathway, whereas attending to sound location produced analogous effects in the zzso zzso This finding suggests that zzso effects are zzso in the human zzso auditory zzso and that they arise from enhanced tuning of receptive fields of zzso zzso zzso
