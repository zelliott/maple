Debate continues on the effect of disc zzso and aging on disc volume and zzso So far, no quantitative in zzso zzso data is available on the factors influencing disc volume and zzso The objective of this zzso study was to zzso investigate changes in disc zzso volume, and shape as a result of aging and/or zzso omitting zzso zzso zzso disc zzso zzso zzso volunteers zzso zzso were investigated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso encompassing the whole zzso zzso zzso height was determined by the zzso method and the zzso zzso zzso volume was calculated by the zzso zzso For the disc shape the zzso zzso zzso was calculated by the ratio of central disc height and mean zzso disc zzso zzso zzso disc volume, and the disc zzso index zzso were corrected for disc level and the individuals age, weight, zzso and sex in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that disc volume was zzso influenced by disc zzso zzso zzso zzso and positively correlated with body height zzso zzso zzso and age zzso zzso zzso Mean disc height and the disc zzso index were zzso influenced by disc zzso but not by zzso weight, and zzso zzso height was positively correlated with age zzso zzso zzso From the results of this study, it can be concluded that disc zzso generally results in a decrease of disc height and volume as well as a less convex disc zzso In the absence of disc zzso however, age tends to result in an inverse relationship on disc zzso volume, and zzso
