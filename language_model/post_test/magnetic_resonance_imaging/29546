zzso patients with cervical zzso tumors were analyzed zzso using a new three-dimensional zzso 

To establish optimal surgical strategies, we considered shapes and three-dimensional locations of cervical zzso tumors based on diagnostic images and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso for zzso tumors of the spine, long considered a zzso zzso no longer is sufficient to determine surgical strategy in view of recent advances in zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso cervical zzso tumors were characterized according to zzso images zzso zzso nine zzso and zzso extent of zzso and zzso zzso involvement zzso and zzso zzso three stages zzso 

Type zzso tumors, involving zzso plus an zzso zzso accounted for 50% of zzso A zzso approach was used in 35 zzso 7 others underwent a combined anterior and zzso zzso A zzso approach was used for all type zzso and zzso tumors, and for some type zzso zzso zzso IV, and VI zzso a combined zzso and anterior approach was used for type zzso and the remainder of type IV and zzso Reconstruction was performed using spinal zzso in 4 patients zzso zzso was zzso in 6 patients zzso and total in 36 zzso 

zzso zzso three-dimensional characterization of shape and location of cervical zzso tumors is essential for planning optimal zzso The zzso used here fulfills this zzso
