zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso To investigate the relation of the zzso transitional vertebra to signs of disc zzso in zzso and to low back pain zzso 

An association between the transitional vertebra and zzso in the disc above has been found in patients with zzso but knowledge of the relation to other degenerative disc changes detected in zzso and to zzso is zzso 

MR images of the zzso spine of 138 middle-aged working men and 25 healthy young men were zzso The presence and type of zzso transitional vertebra and of degenerative changes in zzso discs were zzso The history of low back symptoms was obtained with a questionnaire from the middle-aged zzso 

The prevalence of transitional vertebra was zzso Transitional vertebra was associated with an increased risk of degenerative changes in the disc above among the young men and with a decreased risk in the disc below among the middle-aged zzso Transitional vertebra, zzso or zzso was not associated with any type of zzso in the middle-aged zzso 

zzso transitional vertebra increases the risk of early zzso in the upper zzso This effect seems to be obscured by age-related changes in the middle zzso The degenerative process is slowed down in the lower zzso For these effects, the presence of a transitional vertebra should be noticed when zzso methods are used in research on zzso zzso Transitional vertebra is not associated with any type of zzso
