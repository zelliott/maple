The aim of this study was to determine the zzso zzso value of high resolution zzso in patients scheduled for cochlear zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with and without zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso findings of 54 patients and the zzso situation reported by the surgeon were compared zzso The surgical and functional success of the cochlear zzso was zzso 

We found a high degree of correlation between zzso and zzso findings concerning the zzso of the whole zzso and anomalies as well as in the diagnosis of pathology of the zzso zzso and facial nerves and in anomalies of the internal auditory zzso However, in four out of 54 patients there was a false negative prediction regarding the zzso of the zzso The sensitivity was 50% zzso the specificity zzso zzso zzso the surgical success the accuracy was zzso In all patients zzso gave sufficient anatomical information to the surgeon concerning the jugular bulb and the facial zzso 

A high-resolution zzso protocol consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plain and contrast enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso is recommended for the evaluation of candidates scheduled for cochlear zzso
