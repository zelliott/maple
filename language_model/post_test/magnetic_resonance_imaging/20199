The tactile sensitivity of the teeth, and associated zzso serves important sensory and motor zzso zzso recordings from human zzso ligament zzso zzso nerves, in response to tooth zzso reveal discharge patterns with sole slowly adapting zzso zzso zzso highlighting the unique role of zzso in oral sensory zzso Here we investigate these zzso properties, zzso and with zzso zzso in response to varying zzso of dynamic zzso zzso The finding of increased activity in primary zzso and secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at low zzso of stimulation (20 zzso as compared with higher zzso zzso and 100 zzso shows an increased zzso of the zzso at this lower frequency in line with expected zzso zzso response zzso At the highest frequency zzso zzso no significant activity was found in zzso or zzso suggesting this frequency is outside the range of activity of zzso An zzso zzso is mapped that includes zzso zzso insular, inferior frontal zzso inferior zzso lobe and supplementary motor area as well as middle frontal zzso and zzso We compared the responses to tooth stimulation with those produced by identical zzso stimulation of the zzso The results strongly suggest that the zzso play a significant role in the zzso of the forces used to hold and manipulate food between teeth, and in these respects, the zzso system appears analogous to fine zzso mechanisms used during precision manipulation of small zzso Because zzso reveals zzso in zzso insular cortex, we also speculate that zzso and zzso zzso receptors in general, may be involved in one aspect of the feeling of body zzso
