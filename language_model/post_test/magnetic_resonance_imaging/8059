The recently proposed method known as zzso sensitivity zzso zzso has emerged as an effective means of improving imaging speed for several dynamic imaging zzso However, zzso zzso uses temporally averaged data as a zzso term for image zzso This may not only compromise zzso resolution, it may also make some of the zzso frequency components zzso To address that issue, we present a new method called zzso zzso zzso employing sensitivity zzso and zzso zzso zzso Specifically, zzso provides an improvement over zzso zzso by generating zzso zzso zzso It also uses a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso space sampling pattern with reference frames for data zzso zzso based on experimental data were performed to compare zzso zzso zzso and several other related methods, and the results showed that zzso can provide higher zzso resolution with significantly reduced image zzso zzso zzso cardiac imaging experiments were also carried out to test the effectiveness of zzso and real-time zzso zzso images of the human heart were produced at zzso zzso zzso resolution and zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso spatial resolution with eight zzso
