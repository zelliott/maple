The generation of a zzso relevant cue to the speed of objects around us is critical to our ability to navigate safely within our zzso However, our perception of speed is often distorted by prevailing zzso For instance, as zzso is reduced, our perception of the speed of fast-moving patterns can be increased by as much as zzso To investigate how the cortical representation of speed may vary under such conditions, we have measured the functional zzso blood oxygen zzso zzso response of visual zzso to drifting sine zzso at two very different zzso The average zzso response in all areas was zzso with respect to speed (or zzso zzso zzso and thus contained no zzso speed zzso However, a zzso zzso was able to predict grating speed successfully in all cortical areas zzso Similarly, we find that a zzso zzso can predict stimulus zzso No differences in either the mean zzso response or the zzso zzso response with respect to speed were found as zzso zzso However, examination of the spatial distribution of speed preferences in the primary visual zzso revealed that zzso locations preferred slower speeds than peripheral locations at low but not high zzso We conclude that although an explicit representation of perceived speed has yet to be demonstrated in the human brain, multiple visual regions zzso both the zzso structure of moving stimuli and zzso zzso
