zzso positive zzso zzso oxygen zzso activity is employed extensively in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies as evidence for task or zzso neural zzso However, the presence of sustained negative zzso activity zzso sustained responses that are lower than the fixation zzso has remained more difficult to zzso Some studies suggest that it results from local zzso zzso wherein blood is diverted to zzso active regions without a zzso change of neural activity in the negative zzso zzso However, other evidence suggests that negative zzso is a result of local neural zzso In both cases, regions of negative zzso response are usually interpreted as carrying relatively little, if any, zzso information zzso the zzso reliance on positive zzso activity in zzso Here we show that the negative zzso response resulting from visual stimulation can carry high information content that is zzso Using a general linear model zzso we contrasted standard zzso stimuli to a fixation baseline and found regions of the visual zzso that displayed a sustained negative zzso response, consistent with several previous zzso Within these negative zzso regions, we compared patterns of zzso activity generated by zzso zzso that were systematically shifted in zzso As the zzso were shifted further from each other, the correlation in the spatial pattern of activity across a population of zzso (such as the population of zzso zzso that displayed a negative zzso zzso decreased zzso Despite the fact that the zzso signal was significantly negative zzso than fixation zzso these regions were able to discriminate objects separated by less than zzso zzso (at approximately 10 zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso processing occurs even in regions that display a strong negative zzso zzso
