zzso ethanol injection therapy zzso of the abnormal zzso zzso is an effective treatment in patients with chronic zzso failure with dialysis that tends to be unresponsive to zzso To evaluate the efficacy of zzso we investigated the correlation between serum intact zzso zzso and the findings of MR imaging and zzso zzso 

zzso was performed 32 times in 24 patients with secondary zzso Both MR imaging and zzso zzso were performed before and after zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso with reference to ultrasound zzso findings (as a zzso and the comparison of each treatment was done between imaging changes and serum zzso zzso 

In the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso MR images detected abnormal zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso was observed in zzso of the zzso zzso MR images and zzso showed similar zzso zzso zzso zzso to large zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso After zzso zzso in which ethanol was successfully injected showed decreased signal intensity on zzso images and decreased zzso of zzso MR imaging and zzso zzso showed almost equivalent high sensitivity in evaluating therapeutic changes zzso zzso zzso according to our evaluation category of more than zzso reduction of zzso as zzso However, the specificity of MR imaging was much higher zzso than that of zzso zzso in evaluating therapeutic zzso 

In conclusion, zzso provided better zzso of abnormal zzso zzso than zzso zzso The reduction of high signal intensity area after zzso on zzso MR images is considered an useful therapeutic evaluation zzso than the reduction of zzso zzso on zzso
