A key technical challenge in cartilage tissue engineering is the development of a zzso method for monitoring the zzso structure, and function of the tissue at different growth zzso Due to its zzso three-dimensional imaging capabilities and the breadth of available contrast mechanisms, magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques can be expected to play a leading role in assessing engineered zzso In this review, we describe the new zzso tools zzso imaging, and zzso that can provide quantitative zzso for cartilage tissue development both in zzso and in zzso zzso resonance zzso can identify the changing molecular structure and zzso in the zzso of major zzso zzso and zzso using parameters such as chemical shift, relaxation rates, and magnetic spin zzso zzso provides high-resolution images whose contrast reflects developing tissue zzso and zzso through changes in local relaxation times and the apparent diffusion zzso zzso resonance zzso uses zzso mechanical zzso in conjunction with zzso to measure soft tissue mechanical properties zzso zzso and zzso When combined, these three techniques provide a zzso zzso window for characterizing cartilage tissue growth at all stages of tissue development, from the initial cell seeding of scaffolds to the development of the zzso zzso during construct zzso and finally, to the zzso assessment of tissue integration in animals and zzso
