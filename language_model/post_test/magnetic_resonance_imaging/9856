Motor practice is an important component of zzso Imaging studies in healthy individuals show that dynamic brain zzso changes with zzso Defining patterns of functional brain plasticity associated with motor practice following stroke could guide zzso 

The authors aimed to test whether zzso changes in brain activity differ after stroke and to explore spatial relationships between activity changes and patterns of structural zzso 

They studied 10 patients at least 6 months after zzso zzso strokes and 18 healthy zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was acquired at zzso and functional zzso zzso was acquired during performance of a zzso tracking task before and after a 15-day period of practice of the same zzso 

Smaller short-term practice effects at baseline correlated with lower fractional zzso in the zzso limbs of the internal capsule zzso zzso in patients zzso zzso 3; cluster P zzso zzso After 15 days of motor practice a Group zzso Time interaction zzso zzso zzso cluster P zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso thalamus, inferior frontal zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso In these regions, healthy controls showed decreases and patients showed increases in activity with zzso Some regions of interest had a loss of white matter connectivity at zzso 

Performance gains with motor practice can be associated with increased activity in regions that have been either directly or indirectly impaired by loss of zzso These results suggest that zzso interventions may be associated with zzso adaptation of intact brain regions as well as enhanced activity in regions with impaired structural zzso
