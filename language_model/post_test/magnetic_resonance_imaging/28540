zzso of the clinical utility of enhancement of the spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso MR zzso 

The zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR images were evaluated in 188 patients whose MR findings were abnormal zzso group), in 223 patients with normal MR zzso group), and in 35 zzso The enhancement patterns of the zzso were graded 1 to 4 according to their degree of zzso These three groups were compared and zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso in the positive group showed higher grades of zzso vein enhancement compared with the negative group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso frequently showed moderate to marked zzso of the zzso zzso disk disease with zzso of the spinal canal exhibited more localized patterns of zzso Most zzso zzso with zzso swelling demonstrated zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso did not differ statistically between bone and soft tissue zzso in the positive group and the negative group zzso zzso zzso zzso of follow-up examinations showed that changes in zzso grades were indicative of changes in zzso 

zzso enhancement patterns assist in the evaluation of disease in the spinal canal and will help to differentiate normal from pathological zzso
