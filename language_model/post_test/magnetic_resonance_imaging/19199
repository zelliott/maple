Previous work has suggested that zzso of learned materials affects the zzso involved in memory, primarily in the size of zzso rather than the pattern of zzso Although this work has examined both recall and recognition, it has been limited to verbal zzso In this study, we set out to determine if the same result applies to zzso zzso We used the same experimental design, but used faces as the memory zzso Healthy volunteers thoroughly learned a set of 18 faces a week prior to the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiment zzso zzso and were asked to remember another set of 18 faces, to which they were exposed 1 zzso before the PET experiment zzso zzso During the PET session, their task was to recognize the faces learned a week before and the faces seen a minute before; the zzso zzso were zzso among entirely new zzso zzso We found that, unlike for verbal material, the retention zzso and the familiarity level of the faces affected both the pattern and the size of zzso Comparing the novel and zzso recognition tasks revealed that novel memory for faces is primarily a zzso task, while zzso recognition memory for faces zzso a more distributed neural circuit, including visual areas, which appear to serve as zzso zzso
