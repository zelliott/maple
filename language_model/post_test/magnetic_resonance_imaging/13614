zzso of focal liver zzso in patients with zzso continues to be a zzso challenge despite progressive advances in liver imaging in the past 2 zzso Patients with zzso zzso have a high predisposition to develop zzso zzso zzso and the early detection and diagnosis of this tumor is very important because the most effective treatment is surgical zzso zzso or local zzso therapy when the tumor is zzso zzso zzso are mainly composed of fibrosis, together with a broad spectrum of focal zzso zzso ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to overt zzso Awareness of such zzso and interpretation of imaging studies in these patients requires a critical review to detect subtle tumors, and a thorough understanding of the imaging appearance of the zzso and benign masses that can occur in the zzso zzso Although the recent advances in liver imaging techniques, especially zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso have facilitated the detection and characterization of focal liver zzso in zzso patients, discriminating between zzso and zzso zzso remains problematic with all available imaging zzso Nevertheless, MR imaging appears to have more potential than other imaging techniques in the study of zzso patients and MR may be more appropriate than the other imaging zzso for the detection of small zzso In this article we review the imaging characteristics of zzso focal zzso that arise in zzso zzso with special attention to MR imaging zzso
