The ease by which movements are combined into skilled actions depends on many factors, including the complexity of movement zzso zzso can be defined by the surface structure of a zzso including zzso properties such as the types of zzso and by the abstract or zzso structure, which is apparent in the relations amongst movements, such as zzso It is not known whether different neural systems support the cognitive and the zzso processes underlying different structural properties of sequential zzso We investigated this question using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in healthy adults as they performed sequences of five key presses involving up to three zzso The structure of sequences was defined by two factors that independently zzso the time to plan sequences before zzso the number of different fingers zzso surface zzso and the number of finger transitions zzso zzso zzso The results showed that systems involved in visual processing zzso zzso and the preparation of sensory aspects of movement zzso inferior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with both properties of sequence zzso The number of different fingers positively correlated with zzso intensity in the zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso systems associated with zzso and zzso representations of movement, zzso The number of finger transitions correlated with zzso in systems previously associated with zzso processing, including the inferior zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso superior zzso frontal zzso zzso Different patterns of zzso in the left and right inferior zzso zzso were associated with different zzso consistent with the speculation that sequences are zzso using different mnemonics, depending on the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso correlated positively with increases in the number of zzso consistent with the role of this area in the retrieval or preparation of abstract action zzso These findings suggest that the surface and the zzso structure of sequential movements can be distinguished by distinct distributed systems that support their underlying mental zzso
