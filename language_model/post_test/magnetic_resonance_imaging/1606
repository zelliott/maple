Because dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging with its zzso resolution allows evaluation of contrast zzso of soft tissue zzso its efficacy for defining viable tumor in these zzso was studied for three zzso biopsy zzso zzso response, and differentiation between recurrence and inflammation after zzso After conventional zzso and zzso magnetic resonance sequences to zzso the zzso patients had dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging with fast and zzso sequences and zzso techniques zzso zzso curves, and zzso zzso In 10 of 40 patients, dynamic imaging more precisely defined the most zzso zzso of tumor for biopsy than conventional magnetic resonance zzso After chemotherapy, dynamic imaging distinguished 11 good zzso from 21 poor zzso In followup of 196 patients, dynamic imaging detected 42 early enhancing zzso and excluded zzso tumor in six late enhancing zzso Dynamic imaging can differentiate viable tumor from zzso tumor and inflammation by showing two temporally different zzso of contrast zzso an early phase zzso with viable tumor at zzso examination, and a late phase when all zzso enhance simultaneously and may be zzso By showing tumor zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging can help define biopsy sites, zzso response, and presence or absence of zzso and therefore affect the initial zzso treatment, and followup of patients with soft tissue zzso
