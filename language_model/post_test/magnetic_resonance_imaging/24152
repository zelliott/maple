zzso syndrome is an zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormal respiratory patterns, and abnormal eye zzso The zzso and genetic basis of zzso syndrome is unknown and a specific zzso locus for this disorder has not been zzso Review of this disorder and related syndromes suggests that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso syndrome is frequently associated with a complex brain stem zzso represented as the zzso tooth zzso on magnetic resonance imaging, zzso the zzso tooth zzso could be present in association with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in conditions related to zzso syndrome such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and juvenile zzso due to zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso spectrum is probably caused by at least two and probably several genetic zzso We have zzso previously a cohort of 50 patients with a putative diagnosis of zzso syndrome in order to evaluate the presence of associated zzso and to initiate studies leading to the identification of genes causing zzso and related zzso Among the associated zzso found in patients zzso as having zzso syndrome, zzso of patients had zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso and zzso had zzso tumors of the zzso The zzso gene has been tested as a candidate gene for zzso syndrome based on its expression in the developing zzso and an associated zzso in the zzso zzso A search for zzso in zzso in a series of patients with zzso syndrome did not detect zzso at this zzso This analysis suggested that zzso in zzso might not have a significant role in zzso syndrome, and other functional candidate genes related to development of the zzso need to be zzso A zzso linkage analysis carried out in 10 zzso syndrome zzso did not identify a specific zzso locus for this zzso This zzso along with those from clinical studies, provides further evidence that zzso and related syndromes are genetically zzso
