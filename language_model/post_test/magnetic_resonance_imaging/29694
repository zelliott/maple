This study assessed the zzso value of zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging features in zzso zzso of the soft zzso 

CT and MR imaging studies were performed in 30 patients with zzso confirmed zzso zzso of the soft zzso CT and MR imaging findings obtained by 2 zzso with agreement by consensus were compared for zzso features including tumor zzso zzso analyses were conducted to clarify the impact of imaging findings on overall survival with a medium duration of 32 zzso zzso analysis was estimated using a Cox zzso hazards model with the relative risk of each zzso 

zzso significant imaging findings favoring a diagnosis of high-grade tumor included zzso distribution zzso zzso zzso large tumor size zzso zzso P zzso zzso the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor possessing zzso zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the presence of triple signal pattern zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso distribution zzso zzso zzso tumor size larger than 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the presence of triple signal pattern zzso zzso zzso had a significant association with the zzso survival zzso Multiple zzso zzso models revealed that tumor size larger than 10 zzso had a significant impact on the zzso with relative risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

CT and MR imaging studies allow prognosis prediction in patients with zzso zzso of the soft zzso
