A series of technical tips and devices designed to increase accuracy and safety in zzso surgery are zzso We use zzso magnetic resonance imaging with three-dimensional zzso rapid zzso zzso imaging to minimize image zzso and a three-dimensional zzso planning system for accurately registering three-dimensional zzso We also developed several technical devices useful for zzso zzso zzso an zzso system attached to the frame which simulates the zzso markers in order to keep the target at a suitable position in zzso space; a zzso wrench to set the zzso on the fixing pins to the frame zzso at 5 inch pounds in order to keep distortion of the frame to a minimum while maintaining secure zzso an entry point marker to maintain the calculated trajectory zzso a zzso zzso to prevent the zzso needle from zzso a zzso zzso and its holder to detect significant vessels and to know their precise depth in order to avoid vascular injury from zzso a zzso hole button device to secure depth zzso cables at the patient's zzso
