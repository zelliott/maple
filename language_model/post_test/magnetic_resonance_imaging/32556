We have previously reported a greater than 50% prevalence of structural brain abnormalities in children within 2 weeks of first complicated early childhood zzso including significant zzso asymmetry unrelated to zzso In a zzso follow-up study, 8 of the original 17 subjects were zzso to determine any developments in zzso zzso Three subjects zzso significantly greater zzso and two exhibited a modest increase in asymmetry at follow-up compared with that present at initial magnetic resonance zzso Two of the remaining three subjects zzso no change in the degree of zzso asymmetry that was already evident at initial zzso whereas in the final case, apparent resolution of previously identified zzso zzso asymmetry had zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation times did not consistently zzso with smaller zzso zzso These results suggest that complicated early childhood zzso may be less benign than often zzso
