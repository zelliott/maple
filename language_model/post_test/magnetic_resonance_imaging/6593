To compare zzso zzso during two visual stimulation zzso in Parkinson disease zzso subjects with chronic visual hallucinations vs zzso patients who had never zzso 

Twelve pairs of zzso subjects, matched for age, zzso zzso and zzso drug exposure zzso participated in this zzso The authors examined group differences in zzso during zzso zzso vs no visual stimulation and zzso zzso zzso vs stationary visual zzso 

During zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects showed significantly greater zzso in the zzso lobe and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso subjects showed significantly greater zzso in the inferior frontal zzso and the zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects showed significantly greater zzso in area zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects showed significantly greater zzso in the superior frontal zzso 

zzso patients with chronic visual hallucinations respond to visual stimuli with greater frontal and zzso zzso and less visual cortical zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso visual zzso from zzso to anterior regions associated primarily with attention processes suggests altered network organization may play a role in the zzso of visual hallucinations in zzso
