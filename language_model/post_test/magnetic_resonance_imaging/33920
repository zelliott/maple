zzso and tissue fluid dynamics in the zzso of space environments is commonly simulated by zzso tilt zzso Previous reports have indicated that zzso pressure and zzso vascular pressures increase during acute zzso and may cause cerebral zzso zzso water changes within the zzso are zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso We obtained zzso images of zzso slices from five subjects while they were zzso and during zzso degrees zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The analysis of difference images demonstrated that zzso leads to a zzso reduction of zzso in the zzso zzso fluid zzso compartment and a zzso reduction in the eyes, which implies a reduction of water zzso no increase in zzso was observed in other brain regions that have been associated with cerebral zzso These findings suggest that water leaves the zzso and zzso compartments by zzso as a result of increased zzso pressure causing water to leave the zzso via the spinal zzso compartment or the zzso zzso
