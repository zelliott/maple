In this study, we examine the neural zzso underlying zzso 3 zzso and tone sequencing in Mandarin Chinese using zzso zzso 3 zzso is traditionally described as the substitution of zzso 3 with zzso 2 when followed by another zzso 3 zzso zzso According to current speech production models, target substitution is expected to engage the zzso inferior frontal zzso Since zzso 3 zzso is, to some extent, independent of zzso which makes it more similar to singing, zzso zzso in this region was zzso As for tone sequencing, based on studies in sequencing, we expected the involvement of the supplementary motor zzso In the experiments, participants were asked to produce twelve zzso sequences with the same tone assignment (the repeated zzso or a different tone assignment (the mixed zzso We found zzso zzso inferior frontal zzso zzso for the sequence zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso in the supplementary motor area for the mixed sequences zzso zzso We proposed that tones and segments could be processed in parallel in the left and right zzso but their integration, or the product of their integration, is hosted in the left zzso
