Corpus zzso zzso is a zzso surgical procedure to control zzso zzso or generalized zzso seizure in zzso syndrome zzso Here, we report patients with zzso who underwent zzso surgery, following zzso better zzso the presumed seizure zzso localized in one zzso 

We zzso reviewed seven patients with zzso who underwent zzso and subsequent cortical zzso The median follow-up duration after zzso was 20 months zzso zzso zzso and three patients had follow-up periods over 24 zzso The findings of video zzso zzso monitoring, structural and functional zzso were compared between zzso and zzso 

Four patients had Engel class I and one patient had Engel class II outcomes following cortical zzso zzso compared to zzso showed better localized zzso zzso zzso in the unilateral frontal area in two patients, in the unilateral zzso areas in one patient and in the unilateral zzso areas in the remaining two zzso Two patients had Engel Class III outcome following cortical zzso zzso zzso continued to show zzso zzso zzso but predominantly arising from a unilateral frontal zzso Following zzso zzso zzso zzso showed localized zzso zzso of which location was zzso with zzso zzso abnormalities in all zzso Similarly, zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed localized abnormalities zzso with zzso zzso abnormalities in five of the six zzso zzso assessment revealed cortical zzso in six patients, whereas no pathological zzso was found in the remaining patient, who obtained Engel Class I outcome following cortical zzso 

zzso could change zzso findings, zzso zzso and cerebral blood flows, and it is sometimes helpful in zzso the primary seizure focus in patients with zzso
