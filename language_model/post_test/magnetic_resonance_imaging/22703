Local invasion is the hallmark of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a serious complication of zzso zzso has been increasingly zzso To correlate the zzso mechanisms and the magnetic resonance imaging patterns of zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso dissemination is proposed zzso de zzso de zzso zzso 

This zzso includes the following patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso satellite zzso zzso zzso and mixed zzso zzso combination of 2 or more previous zzso Of 138 patients with zzso confirmed zzso treated between 2000 and 2004, 10 presented zzso dissemination and were zzso 

The distribution of dissemination patterns was as zzso zzso 4 of 10; diffuse zzso 1 of 10; zzso zzso 1 of 10; and satellite, 4 of zzso Mean zzso between primary tumor and dissemination was 4 zzso The most frequent zzso dissemination risk factor was entering the zzso system during zzso 

zzso in our diagnostic imaging capabilities have contributed to a better understanding of the patterns of zzso zzso zzso Using this information, we present a useful zzso zzso zzso to patients with zzso zzso which will help zzso future discussions aimed at understanding these patterns of tumor zzso
