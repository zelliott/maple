zzso of human zzso stem cells zzso prepared from adult bone zzso has been reported to zzso functional deficits after cerebral artery zzso in zzso Although several hypotheses to account for these therapeutic effects have been suggested, current thinking is that both zzso and zzso are primarily zzso In this study, we compared the effects of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infused into rats 6 h after permanent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso resonance imaging and zzso analyses revealed that rats receiving zzso or zzso exhibited comparable reduction in gross zzso volume as compared with the control zzso Although both cell types indeed improved zzso near the border of the zzso zzso zzso and regional cerebral blood flow were greater in some border areas in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso rats showed greater improved functional recovery in the treadmill stress test than did control rats, but the zzso group was zzso These results indicate the intravenous administration of genetically modified zzso to express zzso has a similar effect on reducing zzso volume as zzso but the zzso group showed enhanced regions of increased zzso at the zzso border, and modest additional improvement in functional zzso
