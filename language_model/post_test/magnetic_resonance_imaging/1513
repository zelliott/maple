With current approaches, it is difficult to visually comprehend the complete information contained in a diffusion zzso zzso measured from a microscopically zzso biological zzso zzso in this work the zzso zzso is introduced to zzso display the key aspects of zzso and to interpret the underlying zzso both zzso and zzso Specifically, the mathematical basis for the construction of the zzso zzso from the elements of zzso is zzso the merits of the approach are illustrated with examples of zzso reported for various biological zzso and the results are discussed in the context of relating the diffusion zzso to the tissue zzso
