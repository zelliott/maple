zzso zzso zzso the left zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have both been presumed to relate to the typical zzso dominance for language zzso However, a direct link between structure and function has not been clearly zzso The present study investigates this issue by measuring the volume of the zzso and zzso on the zzso scans of zzso patients classified into three groups: left speech group zzso zzso zzso zzso right speech group zzso zzso zzso zzso and bilateral speech group zzso zzso zzso zzso as assessed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, an automatic zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to explore collateral structural zzso Although zzso structural zzso were found in the zzso consistent with the literature, they did not relate to language zzso For zzso we also zzso zzso zzso the left side; interestingly, three of the individuals within the zzso showed a strongly reversed zzso but as a whole the zzso relationship for zzso was not zzso The zzso analysis revealed a zzso concentration difference in the zzso part of the inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso corresponding functionally to zzso zzso which zzso the left zzso in the zzso and the right zzso in the zzso The findings suggest that this frontal cortical region bears a direct relationship to language zzso which may be related to zzso plasticity in patients with language zzso
