The investigation of memory function using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is an expanding field of zzso The aim of this study was to demonstrate zzso patterns related to a zzso association task employing a zzso zzso zzso Six zzso healthy male volunteers zzso age: zzso zzso took part in the zzso zzso was performed at a field strength of zzso 5 zzso with zzso slices parallel to the zzso line, depending on individual brain zzso zzso brain regions were activated in episodic zzso and retrieval with similarities, but also zzso differences in zzso zzso zzso prefrontal cortical areas were involved when comparing zzso as well as retrieval to the reference condition zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was observed in zzso areas during zzso and zzso in bilateral zzso areas zzso and inferior zzso zzso was zzso more pronounced during zzso The zzso of left zzso zzso during retrieval of high zzso zzso associates may point to the role of this structure in episodic zzso The direct cognitive zzso of zzso minus retrieval yielded a zzso larger left prefrontal zzso There was a zzso higher right prefrontal zzso during retrieval than during zzso underlining the proposed zzso asymmetry for episodic memory zzso
