The evaluation of zzso barrier zzso integrity with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso may prove valuable in the setting of certain brain zzso such as brain tumors and acute zzso zzso Various zzso protocols have been developed to explore the integrity of the zzso by monitoring the leakage of zzso administered contrast medium into the brain zzso In its simplest form, zzso integrity is assessed zzso by determining the presence or absence of zzso on a structural MR zzso When a dynamic zzso zzso zzso protocol is combined with a suitable zzso model, zzso can map the spatial distribution of zzso integrity throughout the brain and assist with evaluating the effects of zzso Several zzso surrogate measures of zzso zzso have been recently proposed, all of which can be readily zzso from standard dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso offers multiple strategies for evaluating zzso zzso
