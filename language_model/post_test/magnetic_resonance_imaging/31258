In this study, zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to further characterize the central action of zzso on zzso In both feeding and zzso magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we combined zzso zzso zzso zzso challenge with zzso with the selective zzso and zzso zzso antagonists, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso (3 zzso completely blocked zzso zzso in freely zzso zzso male rats, an effect that was not modified by the zzso zzso zzso but was partially reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso alone induced both positive and negative blood oxygen zzso zzso responses in the brains of zzso rats, including in the zzso system and zzso zzso Overall, the zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed the effects zzso by zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso had virtually no zzso zzso zzso eliminated zzso signal in zzso associated with the zzso system and diminished zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso signal was returned to baseline levels in the cortical regions and zzso These results suggest that zzso may reduce food intake by acting specifically on brain circuits that are modulated by zzso receptors in the zzso
