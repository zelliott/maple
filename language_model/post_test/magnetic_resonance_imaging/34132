zzso disease zzso is a zzso zzso entity, caused by occupational exposure to large pressure zzso zzso or zzso 90 zzso zzso and low frequency zzso or zzso 500 zzso zzso zzso The most common neurological finding in patients with zzso is the zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency and characteristics of this primitive zzso in a population of zzso zzso 

Sixty individuals, zzso exposed to zzso noise underwent a neurological zzso In each one, unilateral contraction of the chin muscles was triggered through the stimulation of the zzso zzso When a response zzso was observed, or when there was no response except previously existing skin zzso and small dimples, an zzso was zzso All these subjects also received brain zzso and measurement of zzso evoked zzso 

Thirty individuals presented unilateral or bilateral zzso 26 of these presented changes in the brain zzso zzso measurement evidenced continuous contraction of the chin muscles, without visible zzso triggered by the stimulation of the zzso zzso 

zzso is present in 50% of the patients with zzso In the zzso patients, the frequency of abnormal chin muscle activity is higher than the frequency of zzso and represents a loss of the cortical control over the zzso zzso
