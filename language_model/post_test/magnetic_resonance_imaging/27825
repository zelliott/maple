zzso zzso fluctuations zzso in the zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso signal have been shown to reflect cerebral spontaneous neural zzso The objective of this study was to explore brain functional changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment zzso by measuring the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients and 20 healthy elderly individuals underwent the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was calculated using zzso zzso zzso patients showed decreased zzso in the right zzso and zzso cortex, left lateral zzso zzso and right zzso zzso prefrontal zzso and increased zzso in the left zzso joint zzso and inferior zzso zzso The zzso value in the right zzso and zzso zzso was positively correlated with the scores of zzso State zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe activity may zzso the underlying memory impairment mechanisms in zzso Increased zzso and inferior zzso zzso activity may indicate the zzso mechanism in zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso analysis could provide a useful tool in the zzso study of zzso
