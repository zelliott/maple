Although the zzso caused by zzso stroke are well known, data of the literature are rather zzso The zzso recorded in a patient with a unilateral zzso zzso zzso are evaluated with special emphasis related to the effect of the dynamics caused by eye zzso 

Data recorded from a patient (54 years old male with a completed stroke involving the frontal and zzso zzso region in the left zzso were compared to those of a control group (12 healthy age matched zzso Absolute and relative frequency zzso zzso zzso the interaction index characterizing the effect of eyes opening and the symmetry index were calculated from the zzso recorded in eyes closed and eyes open zzso Data of the patient were compared to those recorded in the control group on the basis of zzso confidence zzso 

zzso of the recording conditions the predominance of slow activity and the increase of zzso zzso were found in the absolute frequency zzso The increase of beta and zzso frequency bands following eye opening on the side of the zzso were found to be less obvious than that seen on the intact side and that observed in the control zzso With respect to the interaction index related to the side differences caused by eye opening the change of the zzso frequency band was found to be the most zzso The symmetry index underscored the predominance of slow zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso side, and that of the fast zzso zzso zzso on the intact side in both recording zzso 

zzso zzso of the white matter without cortical damage can cause the predominance of slow activity and decrease of the fast frequency bands on the side of the zzso which can be shown by the absolute frequency zzso and is revealed by the symmetry zzso The lack of functional zzso of the fast zzso in the side of the zzso can clearly be seen in the change of relative zzso following eye opening and on the basis of the calculation of the interaction index reflecting the dynamics of side zzso
