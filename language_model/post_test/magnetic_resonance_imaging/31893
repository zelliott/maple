We present the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surface, a plot of the true zzso rates of tests based on levels of biological zzso for zzso discrimination, as an extension of the zzso curve, commonly used in zzso diagnostic zzso The volume under this surface zzso is a global accuracy measure of a test to zzso subjects in multiple groups and useful to detect trends in marker zzso We used three-dimensional zzso surfaces, and associated zzso to discriminate between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects and patients with AIDS zzso complex zzso using brain zzso measured by zzso zzso These were ratios of markers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and brain injury, zzso zzso zzso divided by zzso zzso measured in the zzso zzso and the frontal white zzso zzso significant trends were observed in the three groups with respect to zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the frontal white matter zzso zzso zzso suggesting a zzso of injury during the zzso zzso stage of zzso infection, particularly with respect to brain zzso zzso for age increased the combined zzso accuracy of age and zzso zzso zzso comparisons suggested that zzso damage associated with zzso decreases was mainly observed in individuals with zzso raising issues of zzso between zzso infection and age and possible acceleration of neurological deterioration in an aging zzso zzso The three-dimensional zzso surface and its associated zzso are useful for assessing marker zzso detecting data trends and offering insight in disease processes affecting multiple zzso
