A retrospective case zzso 

To demonstrate the zzso safety, and results of the zzso zzso approach for zzso zzso and zzso reconstruction of zzso spinal zzso 

Patients presenting with spinal tumor disease requiring zzso zzso stabilization are typically treated with a combined anterior and zzso surgical zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso stabilization may also be achieved through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Fifty consecutive patients (27 women and 23 zzso underwent surgery between 2003 and 2010 at a single institution by the senior zzso Mean age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and 12 zzso zzso spinal stabilization was achieved using zzso zzso screw fixation and zzso body zzso with a titanium cage introduced through the zzso zzso zzso The mean follow-up period was 17 months zzso zzso zzso 

The mean operating time was zzso zzso The mean estimated blood loss for a zzso of 9 patients with zzso tumor pathology was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean blood loss in the remaining 41 patients was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neurological status was maintained or improved in all zzso Mean zzso stay was zzso days zzso zzso zzso At last review, 14 patients were alive, with a mean survival of 36 months zzso zzso zzso The mean survival for the 36 patients who died was 19 months zzso 2 weeks to 54 zzso 

This is the largest reported series of patients with spinal tumor disease undergoing zzso zzso and zzso zzso stabilization through the zzso zzso zzso surgical approach provides sufficient access for safe and effective zzso zzso and stabilization, with reduced complications compared with zzso or combined anterior zzso and zzso zzso
