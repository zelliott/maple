To measure the range of rotation and determine the instantaneous axis of rotation of the zzso joint in healthy volunteers using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to highlight the appearances of the rotated zzso joint on zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers were examined using zzso during zzso head zzso In addition, an anatomical zzso of the zzso joint, fixed in varying degrees of zzso was zzso using zzso 

At the extremes of zzso rotation in healthy subjects there is striking but incomplete loss of contact between the zzso surfaces of the zzso zzso and the axis zzso The range of rotation to the right was zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees ) and to the left was zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso There was no significant difference between rotation to the right and left zzso zzso zzso Total rotation was zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso The instantaneous axis of rotation was located within the zzso zzso 

There is a wide range of zzso rotation in normal zzso The instantaneous axis of rotation lies within the zzso zzso The appearances of the rotated zzso joint are striking and may be zzso as zzso
