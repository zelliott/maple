We describe the occurrence of an inflammatory inclusion body zzso in siblings of a single generation in three separate zzso The disease in this total of seven patients was characterized by selective and early involvement of zzso and finger zzso confirmed by zzso and weakness of the zzso zzso and foot zzso Muscle zzso in at least two members from each family showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deposition and zzso zzso within the zzso muscle zzso zzso on serial muscle biopsy sections demonstrated an abundance of zzso cells invading zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso studies showed the presence of the zzso zzso zzso in all seven zzso The combination of the clinical, zzso zzso and zzso features indicate that these patients have a disease identical to sporadic inclusion body zzso zzso We conclude that the classic, zzso zzso can also occur in families zzso inclusion body zzso in a pattern analogous to the familial occurrence of other zzso neurological diseases such as zzso zzso and multiple zzso These observations strengthen the view that zzso behaves like other zzso diseases and has disease zzso linked to the zzso zzso
