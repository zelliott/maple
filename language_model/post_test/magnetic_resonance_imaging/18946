zzso details of nerve root zzso may explain the production of the signs and symptoms of zzso The authors of anatomical studies have offered many theories without clearly demonstrating the clinical relevance of the zzso zzso series are scarce and are affected to a great extent by selection zzso 

The authors created a zzso drawing of the zzso anatomy based on both the literature and in zzso anatomical zzso A diagnosis was then made with the aid of detailed and standardized clinical and magnetic resonance zzso imaging studies in primary-care patients who presented with pain that radiated into the zzso Clinical and MR imaging findings were zzso Finally, the anatomical drawing was compared with the clinical zzso The higher the zzso level of symptomatic disc zzso the more likely the zzso will be more zzso zzso Classic symptoms of zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in pain when zzso zzso or zzso and testing positive for pain during straight leg zzso were most likely to occur with zzso of the nerve root in the zzso and with zzso disc zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso and zzso nerve roots each tend to be compressed at different sites along the zzso course of the nerve zzso zzso zzso become symptomatic at different sites for each disc zzso The zzso drawing produced a zzso could well be used to explain these zzso Expectations of particular clinical findings can be predicted by specific zzso zzso
