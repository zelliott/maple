This study examined whether zzso tracking training could improve ankle function and brain zzso evidenced with functional magnetic resonance imagery zzso in a single subject with zzso Test zzso included zzso of functional activities, zzso m zzso zzso walk time, ankle range of motion, ankle tracking zzso and peak zzso movement during zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the frontal and zzso zzso was measured during zzso with an active zzso zzso Additionally, a signal intensity index was determined for the zzso zzso zzso Training consisted of 16 sessions of tracking zzso on a computer screen with ankle zzso Four zzso four zzso and two follow-up zzso zzso Data were analyzed by visual inspection and by statistical analysis that examined whether zzso zzso exceeded the zzso mean by at least two standard zzso on at least two consecutive zzso zzso zzso results showed that the zzso self report of zzso ankle zzso zzso of toes to clear floor during swing zzso during gait were eliminated and that peak zzso movement improved visually but not zzso Multiple cortical areas showed increased zzso count zzso as did the intensity index for zzso zzso results showed that the ankle zzso peak zzso movement, and the intensity index remained at the same levels as zzso zzso counts returned toward zzso zzso We concluded that tracking training produced training effects in both ankle function and brain zzso
