zzso zzso of the breast can resemble invasive zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to characterize zzso features of solitary zzso zzso and identify features that differentiate zzso zzso from small zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and 49 small zzso zzso zzso confirmed by zzso were zzso Analysis of MR findings included zzso signal intensity zzso zzso intensity curve zzso enhancement degree, and evolution of enhancement pattern on dynamic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso test and zzso Student zzso test were zzso 

Of 44 zzso zzso 27 zzso were round or oval and 17 zzso were irregular in shape, whereas 38 of 49 zzso zzso showed irregular or zzso shape zzso zzso margins were seen in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso Most zzso zzso and zzso showed slightly higher signal intensity on zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso showed an early homogeneous or zzso to delayed zzso enhancement pattern zzso The difference in zzso enhancement rates between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was significant zzso zzso in zzso and apparent diffusion zzso values between the two groups were not zzso 

A low zzso enhancement rate and evolution of the zzso enhancement pattern from homogeneous or zzso enhancement to rim enhancement is more likely to suggest zzso zzso than zzso
