To assess motor zzso plasticity after zzso movement therapy in patients with zzso zzso stroke, functional zzso and zzso magnetic stimulation were zzso Seven zzso patients with zzso zzso stroke of the middle cerebral artery and preserved crossed zzso projections to the zzso hand were studied before and after 12 days of zzso movement zzso After therapy, all patients demonstrated improved manual motor zzso zzso magnetic stimulation of the motor zzso of the affected zzso revealed a significant increase of zzso potential zzso recorded from the zzso hand, whereas no significant change was detected in the zzso hand after zzso magnetic stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed increased zzso of the zzso central region (including primary zzso zzso and supplementary motor area during active movement of the zzso zzso No change in functional zzso zzso was detected during passive movement of the zzso hand or during active and passive movement of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso stroke with crossed zzso projections, zzso movement therapy zzso zzso changes on the synaptic level, detected as increased zzso zzso magnetic zzso and increased zzso brain zzso zzso zzso in the primary motor zzso of the zzso zzso
