To examine the zzso zzso of late-life minor depression using magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso quantitative magnetic resonance imaging study of elderly patients with minor depression and zzso zzso 

Patients and controls were recruited from the community through advertisements to the Section of Geriatric Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, zzso 

Our sample included 18 subjects diagnosed as having minor depression using the modified zzso and zzso Manual of Mental zzso Fourth Edition, research criteria and 31 controls without zzso Patients were free of other central nervous system disease and both groups had comparable degrees of medical zzso 

All images were acquired on a zzso scanner and absolute and zzso quantitative measures of global and focal brain and zzso fluid volumes were compared between zzso 

zzso lobe volume was significantly smaller in the group with minor depression zzso zzso zzso compared with controls after controlling for age, sex, and age by sex zzso More global measures of brain and zzso fluid volumes were comparable in both zzso 

These data suggest that focal prefrontal zzso may provide an important zzso zzso in late-life minor zzso
