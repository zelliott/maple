zzso from zzso studies suggest reduced prefrontal cortical thickness in zzso however, cortical thickness in zzso schizophrenia has not been evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso cortical thickness was measured using zzso in zzso schizophrenia patients zzso zzso 17), zzso affective psychosis patients zzso zzso 17), and normal control subjects zzso zzso zzso subjects were zzso within 2 years and within a narrow age range zzso zzso A previous study using the same subjects reported reduced prefrontal gray matter volume in zzso zzso Manual editing was performed on those prefrontal zzso before cortical thickness was zzso 

zzso cortical thickness was not significantly different among zzso zzso gray matter volume and thickness were, however, positively correlated in both schizophrenia and control zzso The product of boundary complexity and zzso an alternative measure of volume, was positively correlated with volume for all three zzso Finally, age and age at first medication were zzso correlated with prefrontal cortical thickness only in zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of zzso for the study of cortical thickness abnormalities in zzso zzso between cortical thickness and age and between cortical thickness and age at first medication suggest that the longer the schizophrenic process has been zzso the thinner the prefrontal cortex, although this needs confirmation in a zzso zzso
