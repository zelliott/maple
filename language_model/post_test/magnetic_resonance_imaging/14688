To present the imaging features of post-traumatic zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso initially suspected to be a surface zzso 

A retrospective review was conducted of the presenting complaint and imaging features of patients with a final diagnosis of HO referred over an 8 year period to a specialist zzso zzso zzso 

Five patients with HO were zzso All were adult males with an age range of zzso zzso There was a history of prior ankle trauma in all cases but the significance was not recognized at the time of referral to the specialist zzso There was zzso evidence of HO arising from the inner aspects of the zzso zzso and fibula approximately 3 zzso zzso to the ankle zzso The HO was zzso in two cases and partially fused zzso in zzso The HO in the fifth case was arising on the inner zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso available in four cases, showed predominantly low signal intensity due to the dense bone zzso 

The history of prior ankle trauma with zzso arising from the inner aspects of both the zzso zzso and fibula is typical of post-traumatic HO and distinguish this benign condition from the rare surface zzso at this zzso
