In an zzso study, the zzso and reliability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the assessment of zzso zzso transplantation zzso in the knee joint was zzso Two years after zzso high-resolution zzso was used to analyze the repair tissue with nine pertinent zzso A complete filling of the zzso was found in zzso and a complete integration of the border zone to the adjacent cartilage in zzso An intact zzso zzso was present in zzso and an intact zzso bone was present in zzso zzso signal zzso of the repair tissue compared to the adjacent native cartilage were seen in zzso To evaluate zzso zzso a reliability analysis with the determination of the zzso correlation zzso zzso was zzso An zzso zzso agreement, with an zzso value zzso was calculated in 8 of 9 zzso The clinical outcome after 2 years showed the visual analog score zzso at zzso zzso zzso The values for the knee injury and zzso outcome score zzso zzso were zzso zzso for pain, zzso zzso for symptoms, zzso zzso for zzso function, zzso zzso for sport and zzso zzso for zzso quality of zzso The clinical scores were correlated with the zzso zzso A statistically significant correlation was found for the variables zzso of the zzso zzso of the repair zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the repair zzso High resolution zzso and zzso zzso variables are a reliable, zzso and accurate tool for assessing cartilage repair zzso
