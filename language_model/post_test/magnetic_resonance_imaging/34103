In this article we describe clinical applications of functional zzso zzso at zzso zzso All experiments were performed on a commercially available zzso system zzso Impact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso technique zzso 66 zzso 4 zzso slice zzso 210 zzso field of view, 64 zzso 64 acquisition zzso Different zzso for zzso of the motor zzso and for language zzso were tested in healthy subjects and zzso zzso considerations concerning the development of the zzso are also zzso In all healthy subjects, motor zzso zzso zzso signal changes in the zzso cortex, permitting identification of primary motor and sensory cortical zzso Furthermore, focal zzso of different cortical areas by a language task was possible in 6 of 10 zzso zzso motor studies were performed in 18 patients with zzso zzso in most cases prior to zzso zzso In 14 studies, zzso results demonstrated the zzso of the motor hand areas relative to the zzso The results proved valuable for zzso planning and contributed to zzso zzso We conclude that functional zzso for clinically relevant applications, such as zzso of motor and language function, is feasible even at a field strength of zzso T without dedicated zzso
