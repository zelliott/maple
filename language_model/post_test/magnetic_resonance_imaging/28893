The purpose of this work was to characterize zzso transfer zzso contrast of skeletal muscles in limb zzso muscular zzso zzso 

The calf muscles of five zzso patients and 10 normal volunteers were zzso with an zzso zzso suppression pulse applied to zzso zzso zzso suppression ratios were calculated for anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscles in the zzso and control zzso The relationship between zzso of individual muscles and the duration of zzso symptoms was zzso 

Strong zzso contrast was observed in normal calf muscles, with mean zzso suppression ratios ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso In diseased muscle, zzso signal suppression ranged from 11 to zzso demonstrating an inverse relationship between symptom duration and suppression zzso zzso contrast in the zzso patients, as a reflection of muscle tissue integrity, was preserved in zzso or anterior zzso zzso and zzso muscles, zzso zzso ratios were dramatically reduced in muscles with gross fatty zzso but also were reduced in muscle zzso without visual evidence of fatty zzso 

zzso imaging provides a quantitative measure of zzso changes occurring within the skeletal muscles of patients with zzso relative to normal and may be useful in evaluating disease extent, zzso and response to new therapies as they become zzso
