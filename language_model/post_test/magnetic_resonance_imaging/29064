The purpose of this study was to validate the Research zzso zzso for zzso Disorders zzso for the diagnostic zzso of disk displacement with reduction, with magnetic resonance imaging used as a gold zzso 

The diagnoses from the clinical examination of 78 zzso in 39 patients, each with disk displacement with reduction in at least one zzso were compared with magnetic resonance imaging zzso The readers of the magnetic resonance images were blinded to the clinical zzso The data analysis included zzso statistics and calculation of zzso zzso 

The zzso value of the zzso for disk displacement with reduction was zzso For disk displacement zzso movement of the disk on opening not being zzso zzso value was zzso The diagnostic agreement between zzso and magnetic resonance imaging diagnoses for all zzso examined was zzso Most of the disagreement was due to false negative clinical diagnoses for zzso zzso 

A positive zzso examination is zzso for internal zzso but not reliable with regard to the type of disk zzso such examination is therefore of limited value in determining the true disk position and its functional zzso
