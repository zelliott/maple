zzso related zzso motor deficits complicate zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso In zzso patients the zzso of the zzso zzso is often zzso In this context we developed a clinical zzso protocol dedicated to patients with motor deficits using the unaffected zzso zzso Based on the hypothesis that zzso finger movements recruit more and larger zzso populations with rising task complexity, different motor tasks were tested regarding zzso zzso in ten right handed zzso Complex finger opposition localized the zzso zzso zzso zzso area 6) robustly and was introduced to zzso zzso in zzso patients as functional landmark to identify the zzso zzso on the tumors zzso Additional zzso automated tactile stimulation localized the primary zzso zzso and completed the zzso
