Choosing between actions associated with uncertain rewards and punishments is zzso by neural zzso encompassing the zzso cortex, anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, the precise conditions under which these different components are activated during decision-making zzso remain zzso 

Fourteen healthy volunteers completed an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol to investigate zzso zzso responses during independently modeled zzso of choice zzso In the zzso zzso participants decided which of two simultaneous visually presented gambles they wished to play for monetary zzso The gambles differed in their magnitude of gains, magnitude of losses, and the probabilities with which these outcomes were zzso In the zzso zzso the result of each choice was indicated on the visual zzso 

In the decision phase, choices involving large gains were associated with increased zzso responses in the zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso compared with choices involving small zzso In the outcome phase, good outcomes were associated with increased zzso responses in the zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with negative zzso There was only limited overlap between zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso during the decision and outcome zzso 

zzso activity within the zzso and lateral zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso mediate distinct representations of zzso information that are deployed at different stages during a decision-making zzso
