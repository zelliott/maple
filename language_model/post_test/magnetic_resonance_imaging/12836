zzso iron zzso possess specific magnetic properties in the presence of an external magnetic field, which make them an attractive platform as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging zzso and as carriers for drug zzso In this study, we investigate the drug delivery and the zzso properties of zzso zzso iron oxide incorporated into zzso zzso zzso zzso which can be zzso into zzso upon increasing concentration or raising temperatures, is used to decorate zzso zzso zzso iron zzso zzso via a chemical zzso Next, the zzso dye Nile red is zzso into the zzso zzso zzso compartment of zzso as a model drug and as a fluorescent zzso Upon zzso zzso retains its zzso zzso and thus can be used for MR zzso A zzso targeting zzso zzso acid zzso is zzso onto zzso to produce a zzso zzso iron oxide, zzso zzso can be simultaneously applied as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent that specifically targets cancer cells that zzso folate receptors in their cell zzso zzso is used as a reference zzso Based on zzso and zzso zzso zzso the successful synthesis of zzso and zzso is zzso The magnetic zzso clusters of zzso and zzso are zzso by transmission electron microscope zzso zzso together with a targeting zzso displays a higher zzso zzso into zzso zzso This result is confirmed by laser zzso scanning zzso zzso flow zzso and atomic zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso curves, generated by using a zzso quantum interference device zzso zzso analysis, demonstrate that the magnetic zzso are zzso with insignificant zzso The zzso zzso explains the negligible cell zzso of zzso and zzso In zzso cells, the in zzso zzso study indicates the better zzso images in zzso than in zzso
