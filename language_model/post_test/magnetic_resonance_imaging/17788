zzso resonance frequency zzso MR zzso is a promising temperature monitoring approach for zzso but its accuracy is vulnerable to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to address this problem but phase zzso is usually needed before the model fitting zzso In this paper, a zzso MR zzso method using phase finite difference that avoids the time consuming phase zzso procedure is zzso Unlike the previously proposed phase zzso technique, the use of finite difference in the new method reduces the fitting error resulting from the ringing artifacts associated with phase zzso in the calculation of the phase zzso zzso The new method takes into account the values at the perimeter of the region of interest because of their direct relevance to the zzso baseline phase of the region of interest (where temperature increase takes zzso In simulation study, in zzso and ex zzso experiments, the new method has a zzso temperature error of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the phase zzso method, zzso The method also demonstrated a slightly higher, albeit small, temperature accuracy than the original zzso MR zzso zzso The proposed method is zzso efficient zzso s per zzso making it very suitable for the real time temperature zzso
