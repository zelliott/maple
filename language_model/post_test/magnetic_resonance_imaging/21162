This study was done to determine the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in patients with zzso zzso by comparing zzso MR imaging with pathological zzso 

We enrolled 39 patients with locally advanced zzso zzso All patients received zzso therapy before surgery and zzso zzso therapy followed by MR zzso MR images were zzso by a team of two expert zzso unaware of the clinical and zzso zzso 

Following zzso zzso therapy, the analysis of MR images showed 23 zzso patients with a zzso disease staged zzso and 16 zzso with a disease staged zzso zzso zzso staging zzso revealed 13 patients with a disease zzso and 26 patients with a disease zzso Cohen's zzso to measure zzso between zzso MR staging and zzso response showed zzso zzso for disease confined to the zzso zzso zzso was zzso for disease zzso and zzso for disease zzso 

MR imaging is critical for discovering zzso zzso moreover, zzso MR imaging does not always provide the opportunity to discern small residual cancer cells hidden in zzso tissue that could cause involvement of zzso zzso margin zzso on zzso
