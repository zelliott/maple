Imaging pain pathways in rats offers a tool to investigate zzso systems in acute and chronic zzso models of pain, neural plasticity associated with the latter, and the opportunity to evaluate pharmacological effects of analgesics on these zzso Furthermore, the evaluation of zzso circuits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso offers the potential for defining the complexity of zzso behaviors that are difficult to evaluate in current zzso behavioral models of zzso In these studies, we performed functional zzso in trained, zzso awake rats to define neural systems activated by noxious zzso zzso Analysis revealed zzso in response to a zzso stimuli in zzso zzso and zzso areas, known to be zzso of the pain zzso Our results demonstrate the ability to characterize zzso patterns of zzso in response to pain in zzso while avoiding the potential complicating effects of zzso
