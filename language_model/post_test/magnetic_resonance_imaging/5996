Clinical improvement after a surgical zzso restoration for zzso zzso is increasingly accepted by zzso but the mechanism is not completely zzso 

Ten patients with zzso zzso underwent detailed magnetic resonance imaging for zzso function before and 6 weeks after surgical zzso zzso zzso procedures included combinations of coronary artery bypass zzso restrictive zzso zzso and zzso patch zzso zzso resonance imaging analysis included zzso of global and regional zzso zzso zzso and zzso left zzso regions were divided by an imaginary plane zzso determined from anterior zzso point and both zzso zzso 

Global stroke volume index increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso after surgical zzso restoration zzso zzso zzso and seemed more related to increased zzso stroke volume index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than to changed anterior stroke volume index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso area decreased only a little in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but significantly in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This indicates functional recovery of border zone by restrictive zzso patch zzso 

Rebuilding geometric zzso by surgical zzso restoration improves zzso of zzso in zzso and remote regions, resulting in increased stroke volume index from the zzso left zzso
