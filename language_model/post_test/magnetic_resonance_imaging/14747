The purpose of the study was to compare the performance of late zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linear blending and selective zzso zzso mapping for the detection of chronic zzso zzso zzso with late zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

This study was approved by the institutional review board, and the patients gave informed zzso A total of 20 patients with a history of zzso underwent cardiac zzso and zzso Images of the zzso were reconstructed as 100 zzso zzso zzso 140 zzso and zzso zzso linear zzso images from low- and zzso peak data using 3 different weighting factors zzso zzso zzso Additional color-coded zzso zzso distribution maps were zzso The images were reviewed for the presence of late enhancement, zzso extent, signal zzso zzso volume, and zzso image zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso data from 100 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso showed identical results for the identification of zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and correctly identified all segments with zzso zzso detected through zzso zzso average of zzso received the best zzso image quality rating zzso votes) and average measured zzso size correlated best with zzso zzso zzso In comparison with zzso zzso distribution maps were susceptible to zzso and zzso findings zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso overestimating quantity of zzso scars by zzso while zzso zzso volume by zzso 

Late zzso enhancement cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso well with zzso for detecting zzso whereas zzso distribution analysis provides inferior zzso Linear blending further improves image quality and enables more precise zzso of zzso zzso
