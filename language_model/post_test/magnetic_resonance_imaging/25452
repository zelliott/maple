The zzso and adjacent zzso prefrontal zzso may play an important role in normal social functioning and affect zzso Recent anatomical studies of this area of the prefrontal zzso have demonstrated a striking correspondence of zzso zzso zzso schemes in humans and nonhuman zzso This finding allows zzso recording and anatomical connectivity data in animals to be considered together with functional imaging data and zzso studies in zzso In a functional zzso study, we show that individual differences in zzso a zzso trait assessed with a zzso personality model, may be linked to specific areas in the lateral zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso and the zzso zzso These areas are part of an anatomical circuit that has been defined in nonhuman primates and has been implicated in functions related to behavioral zzso These findings represent a fresh approach to linking normal individual differences in personality and behavior to specific zzso structures and zzso
