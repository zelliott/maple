To assess the clinical usefulness of magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Signal intensity ratios on zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were measured zzso in 37 patients with zzso zzso zzso women, four zzso mean age, 51 zzso and in 10 patients with zzso zzso (six women, four zzso mean age, 68 zzso Signal intensity ratios were correlated with zzso findings and zzso function test results with zzso zzso zzso Diagnosis of zzso with signal intensity ratios was compared with zzso diagnosis by using receiver operating characteristic zzso 

A zzso signal intensity ratio of zzso or higher indicated zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso of seven zzso A zzso signal intensity ratio of zzso or higher suggested advanced zzso destruction (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso Diagnosis by each observer was better than diagnosis with signal intensity zzso 

MR imaging results can reflect zzso function and zzso findings in the zzso zzso and help discriminate zzso zzso from zzso zzso
