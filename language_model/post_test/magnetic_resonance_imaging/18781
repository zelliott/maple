To evaluate the use of zzso in conjunction with zzso gas imaging for monitoring lung ventilation and gas zzso 

Images were taken at zzso T using single shot zzso with zzso zzso gas prepared by the zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was produced by two 90-degree zzso zzso separated by a zzso zzso The diffusion of zzso gas in the lungs was measured by monitoring the zzso of the zzso This study was conducted on a zzso male, healthy zzso 

Clear tags in zzso zzso gas both in zzso and in zzso were zzso The relative movement of the lung compared to a static, partial zzso was measured following inspiration or zzso The diffusion zzso of zzso in the lungs was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso in the lungs is possible, and allows regional lung movements to be measured following inspiration and zzso It also allows zzso of the diffusion of the zzso zzso
