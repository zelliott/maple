We reviewed our experience with knee zzso to determine if using the zzso rule increased our positive zzso value for diagnosing zzso zzso This rule zzso a zzso as torn if there are two or more MR images with abnormal findings and as possibly torn if there is only one MR image with an abnormal zzso We also compared our sensitivity and specificity using fast zzso imaging with previously reported zzso 

We reviewed the medical records of 174 patients who had knee MR examinations and zzso knee zzso to determine our accuracy when we diagnosed zzso as zzso possibly zzso or intact using knee zzso as the gold zzso 

Our positive zzso value increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso tears and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for lateral zzso tears when using the zzso rule compared with the standard criterion of diagnosing a zzso as torn if one or more images are zzso When using the standard zzso we had zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for diagnosing zzso zzso tears and zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for diagnosing lateral zzso zzso 

When using the zzso rule, we had an increased positive zzso value for diagnosing zzso as zzso which was statistically significant for the lateral zzso Our accuracy using the standard criterion with fast zzso imaging was comparable to that reported in previous studies with zzso zzso
