The objective of this work is to develop image processing methods for zzso the zzso of the joint cartilage with magnetic resonance zzso zzso data on the zzso distribution of the joint cartilage are of great interest for both research as well as for zzso The cartilage thickness provides information on the local cartilage zzso and may therefore be helpful in early and objective diagnosing degenerative cartilage changes, monitoring the zzso of zzso and controlling the success of zzso zzso In zzso the thickness distribution serves to zzso the functional adaptation or the zzso of the cartilage under loading and may be used for zzso simulation of load transmission in the zzso
