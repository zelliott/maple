zzso is a fundamental auditory sensation, underlying both music and speech zzso This study was designed to explore pitch coding in human auditory zzso by testing whether activity in zzso regions zzso as a function of pitch zzso zzso zzso A zzso paradigm was used to confirm three levels of pitch zzso for two different zzso zzso The location and magnitude of the response to these stimuli were measured using functional magnetic resonance zzso A pitch response was found in zzso zzso close to the zzso border of zzso zzso However, the response was not sensitive to pitch zzso One interpretation is that zzso regions are zzso responsive to the presence or absence of pitch and not to pitch zzso
