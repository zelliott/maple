The reported rate of zzso brain injury after carotid artery zzso zzso seen on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso varies from zzso to zzso Data from zzso zzso after zzso indicate that zzso may continue for several days, suggesting that that at least some zzso seen on zzso occur zzso Because zzso zzso appear zzso hour of zzso we used zzso to zzso study patients before zzso 1 hour after, and 48 hours after zzso to answer this zzso 

The study participants were 48 male patients aged 59 to zzso All patients were examined by a neurologist before and after the procedure and had zzso zzso and 48 hours zzso In addition, 23 patients had a zzso 1 hour zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso including zzso and zzso zzso and zzso inversion recovery images, were read by two zzso blinded to the study zzso The zzso protection device was obtained from all patients, washed, and the contents examined under a digital microscope for fragments zzso zzso 

There were two zzso strokes and one transient zzso attack zzso but no strokes or zzso occurred during zzso In the 23 patients zzso 1 hour zzso new zzso were found in two zzso and 18 zzso had new zzso at 48 hours zzso zzso zzso For the entire study group, the zzso of new zzso at 48 hours was zzso zzso The median number of zzso zzso was four zzso 1 to zzso Every protection device examined had zzso debris, with a mean of 135 zzso 73 fragments zzso 18 to zzso sized zzso zzso and a mean of eight fragments zzso 2 to zzso sized zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso did not correlate with the degree of zzso size of zzso zzso or number of zzso nor with the number or size of fragments retrieved from the protection zzso 

zzso can be performed with a very low zzso of clinically evident zzso zzso however, it is associated with zzso during and after the zzso Protection devices effectively prevent clinical and zzso events during the zzso zzso zzso continues for at least 48 hours zzso causing zzso on zzso when there is no mechanism for cerebral zzso These data correlate with zzso zzso reports of continued zzso after zzso and indicate that zzso should be done as late as possible to accurately assess the rate of zzso brain injury with zzso zzso
