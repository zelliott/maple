The aim of this study was to describe the normal pattern of development and maturation of the zzso brain with respect to zzso age as assessed with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to provide an overview of the possibilities of the zzso 

zzso cerebral zzso was performed on 56 pregnant women between 19 and 37 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso true fast imaging with steady zzso zzso zzso fast low angle shot zzso two-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso sequences with apparent diffusion zzso zzso were zzso zzso parameters and zzso areas of the cerebral zzso were correlated to zzso age by using the zzso rank correlation zzso 

We found a negative correlation between the zzso zzso diameter ratio and zzso age and a positive correlation between the zzso and cortical zzso when expressed as external zzso diameter ratio zzso zzso The cortical mantle was correlated with zzso zzso such as the zzso diameter and the zzso diameter, and with zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso by the 22nd zzso In the zzso matter, the mean zzso values varied from zzso zzso zzso zzso (at week zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso (at week zzso whereas in the white matter, the values varied from zzso zzso zzso zzso (at week zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso (at week zzso 

zzso provides a reliable valuation of brain maturation during zzso
