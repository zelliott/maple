To review our experience using zzso approaches for zzso of a zzso group of tumors, both benign and zzso involving the zzso inlet and adjacent zzso These included zzso type zzso zzso primary zzso tumors, zzso zzso and zzso from a variety of primary zzso 

Between October 1993 and January 1998 we undertook 22 operations on 21 patients using a variety of zzso zzso The anterior zzso approach was used in 11 operations, the zzso technique was used in five cases, the modification described by zzso in one patient and that described by zzso in five zzso 

21 of the 22 operations were considered to be complete zzso with negative zzso There were no zzso or zzso zzso Major complications occurred in five zzso acute respiratory distress syndrome zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso graft and acute respiratory distress syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso morbidity was observed in 12 zzso prolonged arm pain zzso zzso 1), arm zzso zzso zzso zzso motor and sensory deficits zzso zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso and instability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and disturbances in shoulder zzso function zzso zzso zzso 

The anterior zzso approach we previously described provides adequate exposure for the zzso of zzso tumors originating in the zzso zzso and sympathetic chain, and for zzso zzso disease at the base of the neck or in the superior zzso We have found it to be associated with little zzso the zzso stay has been short, and it has proven flexible enough to cope with the changed circumstances found at zzso For zzso type zzso zzso and other zzso with extensive invasion of major structures at the zzso zzso we believe the best present option is the zzso sparing zzso technique described by zzso as a modification of the zzso zzso When operating for lung cancer we presently feel that the zzso approach should be combined with a zzso zzso to accomplish complete zzso staging and undertake anatomical pulmonary zzso under optimal zzso
