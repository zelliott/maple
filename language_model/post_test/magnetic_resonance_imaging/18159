Our aim was to evaluate the surgical impact of zzso zzso in young zzso We reviewed a zzso database of 283 consecutive patients below zzso of age and who were treated for breast zzso zzso zzso patients who received zzso chemotherapy were zzso The remaining 246 patients included 124 zzso who preoperatively underwent conventional imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and 122 zzso who underwent zzso and dynamic zzso zzso zzso of surgical specimens served as a reference zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso statistics were zzso There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, tumor zzso zzso stage, zzso or zzso zzso The mastectomy rate was zzso zzso overall but was significantly different between groups zzso zzso for the zzso group and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso Of 122 zzso patients, 46 zzso would have undergone mastectomy due to zzso alone, while zzso determined 19 additional zzso increasing the mastectomy rate from zzso to zzso zzso The number of patients with zzso zzso zzso or bilateral zzso was significantly different between groups zzso zzso for the zzso group and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso zzso or zzso bilateral zzso were detected with zzso in zzso zzso patients, with zzso in zzso zzso patients, and with zzso in zzso zzso patients zzso Two zzso were due to false zzso at both conventional tests in the zzso group zzso zzso and two zzso were due to zzso false zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso In conclusion, breast cancer in young patients was treated with mastectomy in zzso of cases on the basis of zzso only and in these patients zzso was more sensitive than zzso for zzso zzso or zzso bilateral zzso resulting in an additional mastectomy rate of zzso A low probability of inappropriate zzso decision-making for mastectomy exists for both zzso alone and for zzso making zzso needle biopsy mandatory for findings that suggest a need for zzso
