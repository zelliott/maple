The authors investigated the links between depression, cardiac disease, and zzso cerebral blood flow zzso 

A magnetic resonance imaging technique based on zzso spin tagging was used to estimate zzso zzso in depressed (N zzso 5) and comparison (N zzso zzso elderly subjects with coronary artery zzso Signal intensity ratios corresponding to relative zzso zzso were calculated for four regions on two zzso images through the upper and lower halves of the lateral zzso 

On the superior image, estimates of zzso zzso were statistically significantly lower on the left side in the depressed subjects than in the zzso zzso When the ratios in the superior and inferior images were zzso the depressed subjects had lower values for both left zzso regions of interest and the zzso zzso 

Despite the small study group and indirect estimates of blood flow, these preliminary findings suggest that a relative cerebral zzso may zzso depression in elderly cardiac zzso
