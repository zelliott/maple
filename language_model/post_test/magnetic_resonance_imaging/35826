zzso resonance imaging zzso is an accepted zzso zzso for evaluation of soft tissue pathology without exposure to zzso zzso Current applications demonstrate excellent zzso of the anatomy and pathology of various zzso zzso studies in the knee reveal fine resolution of anatomy and pathology involving the zzso The purpose of this study is to determine a prospective correlation between zzso scans and actual zzso pathology as documented at the time of zzso zzso scans were obtained in 155 patients, on 156 knees (one patient with bilateral zzso with 86 patients zzso knees) eventually undergoing diagnostic and operative zzso performed by the same surgeon zzso All images were obtained on the same high-resolution zzso zzso GE zzso zzso zzso Scanner with the same zzso performing all readings zzso The knees were studied in the zzso and zzso plane using a spin echo sequence and 5 zzso slice zzso The zzso were described as having Grade 1, 2, or 3 changes, with Grade 3 reserved for complete zzso Using zzso as the diagnostic standard, the accuracy of zzso in diagnosing zzso and lateral zzso tears was zzso and zzso respectively with a Grade 3 zzso zzso For tears of the zzso the accuracy was zzso as confirmed at zzso Five tears of the zzso were also documented by zzso and correlated with clinical zzso Other abnormalities seen were zzso cartilage and zzso zzso bone tumors, zzso plateau fractures, Baker's zzso and zzso zzso The zzso scan is a highly accurate, zzso zzso for documentation of zzso pathology as well as cruciate ligament tears in the zzso
