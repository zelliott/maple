zzso leaflet zzso has been repaired traditionally by leaflet zzso with or without a sliding zzso However, substantial zzso zzso thin zzso or deficient zzso or zzso scallops can complicate this zzso zzso closure after large zzso leaflet zzso introduces substantial zzso stress even in the presence of a sliding zzso We describe a novel technique that zzso zzso leaflet zzso zzso leaflet zzso and preserves zzso zzso zzso This zzso technique can be applied in traditional zzso valve repairs but is suited particularly to the robotic approach, in which enhanced zzso and zzso make the zzso repair easy to zzso
