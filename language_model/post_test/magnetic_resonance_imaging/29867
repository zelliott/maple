A number of studies have found localized differences in the appearance and extent of cortical folding between the brains of schizophrenic patients and healthy control zzso This study aimed to determine whether there are differences in zzso folding in schizophrenia by conducting a detailed analysis of magnetic resonance zzso 

Thirty-four young adults in their first episode of schizophrenia and 36 zzso healthy control subjects were zzso The zzso index zzso the ratio of the inner and outer cortical surface zzso was measured zzso on every second zzso image slice in four specifically defined zzso zzso Independent zzso tests were conducted for each region, followed by post hoc analysis of zzso testing for the effects of zzso 

zzso index values between groups corresponded closely in the zzso and zzso regions but were significantly increased in the right zzso lobe of the schizophrenic zzso zzso the zzso by two different methods zzso in previous zzso notably affected zzso zzso index values were significantly zzso in the frontal and zzso regions, with no group zzso side zzso 

zzso in the zzso lobe zzso of zzso schizophrenic patients might reflect disturbed or abnormal zzso Further examination of specific sources of zzso difference in schizophrenia is required to clarify zzso
