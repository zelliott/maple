In dynamic zzso zzso zzso studies, an accurate knowledge of the zzso contrast agent concentration as a function of time is crucial for the zzso of kinetic zzso In this work, a novel method for zzso the zzso input function zzso based on the contrast agent zzso zzso in two different reference zzso is zzso It is assumed that the zzso of the two zzso have the same shape, and that simple models with two or more zzso and unknown kinetic zzso can describe their zzso zzso zzso Based on the principle of zzso one can relate the two zzso zzso zzso to estimate their common underlining zzso together with the kinetic parameters of the two zzso In practice, the measured zzso zzso have noise, and the zzso of the two zzso are not exactly the same due to different zzso zzso These factors will produce errors in the zzso zzso zzso studies show that despite the two error sources, the zzso method provides reliable estimates of the zzso
