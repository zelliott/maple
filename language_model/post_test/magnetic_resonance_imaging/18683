To investigate the relations between zzso and current mental ability, mood, and white matter signal abnormalities detected by zzso weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso and impairment of balance and mobility in older zzso 

97 subjects from the Aberdeen zzso birth cohort underwent brain zzso evaluation of balance, and measurement of gait zzso White matter zzso detected on zzso weighted zzso scans were rated by three independent zzso on three zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso and brain stem zzso 

zzso gait speed was correlated with impaired visual acuity zzso zzso zzso shorter stature zzso zzso zzso a lower childhood zzso zzso zzso zzso a lower current zzso progressive zzso score zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a higher hospital anxiety and depression scale zzso score zzso zzso zzso and an increased grade of brain stem zzso on zzso zzso to balance was correlated with Raven score zzso zzso zzso brain stem zzso zzso zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified brain stem zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and zzso depression score zzso zzso zzso to zzso as the only significant associations with zzso zzso equation zzso detected an association between two zzso traits representing white matter disease and an zzso function, zzso 

In this zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso and brain stem zzso were associated with impaired zzso Current mental ability was strongly related to gait zzso There appears to be a zzso between motor skills and intellect in old age, which is zzso by white matter zzso
