zzso cell zzso zzso is a recently zzso rare zzso of the anterior zzso zzso and zzso simulating a zzso zzso its eponymous zzso cells display a zzso zzso with conspicuous zzso zzso of zzso We report a case of zzso zzso identified in a biopsy zzso 16 years after zzso operation of a 48-year-old zzso zzso symptoms were zzso and transient decrease of visual zzso zzso showed an zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso in diameter without evidence of invasive zzso No zzso zzso therapy was zzso The patient was left with zzso yet no recurrence was seen during zzso zzso diagnosed as a zzso cell zzso of zzso type, repeat zzso showed the characteristic zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso stained intensely with zzso zzso zzso and were negative with the zzso marker zzso zzso zzso hormones tested negative, and there was no evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation using zzso to zzso and zzso Few cells stained for zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has been proposed to represent a zzso of zzso cells zzso While the dynamic properties of the latter are incompletely zzso and indeed no specific marker allows for their zzso overlapping features of zzso with look zzso in particular zzso point to zzso being a potential adult stem zzso The favorable outcome of the present case further argues for zzso to be considered a zzso zzso zzso tumor size, lack of zzso and low proliferation rate are likely zzso of benign zzso
