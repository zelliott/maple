zzso tasks are behavioral zzso in which subjects must remember stimulus attributes across a delay to subsequently perform the appropriate motor zzso zzso and zzso (1992), reported that there exist zzso of zzso in monkey lateral prefrontal zzso zzso whose firing rates during the delay are tuned to either zzso attributes of the stimulus zzso involved in sensory zzso or the direction of a zzso motor response associated with the stimulus zzso involved in motor zzso We studied human subjects with an zzso zzso method that would allow us to test the hypothesis that there are regions within the zzso that are recruited during both motor preparation and sensory zzso zzso performed a zzso task with two types of trials that either zzso allowed subjects to prepare during a delay period for a specific motor response or zzso required that subjects maintain a sensory attribute zzso zzso during a delay period for correct performance zzso It was assumed that during the delay zzso the zzso trials would engage motor preparation while zzso trials would engage sensory zzso zzso data supported this zzso Imaging results support the hypothesis that the zzso is involved in both motor preparation and sensory zzso Furthermore, no selectivity (in terms of intensity of neural representation on the spatial scale of the zzso size zzso zzso for motor preparation over sensory memory (or zzso was detected within the zzso This latter result fails to support a gross anatomical segregation within the zzso with respect to involvement in these two cognitive zzso
