zzso evidence about the central nervous representation of pain in the brain suggests that the zzso zzso is a crucial part of the pain zzso The zzso of a brain region may be tested by administering zzso stimuli while controlling for unspecific zzso by administering zzso zzso We applied this paradigm to zzso zzso delivering zzso or zzso zzso to verify the zzso of the zzso zzso In detail, brain zzso due to zzso stimulation induced by zzso zzso stimuli of hydrogen zzso (5 zzso or zzso zzso zzso were used to mask brain zzso due to zzso clearly zzso zzso zzso with gaseous carbon dioxide zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images were recorded from 12 healthy volunteers in a zzso head scanner during stimulus administration using an zzso zzso We found that significantly more zzso following zzso than zzso stimuli were localized zzso in two restricted clusters in the brain containing the primary and secondary zzso areas and the insular zzso consistent with the zzso zzso However, these zzso completely disappeared when eliminating zzso associated with the administration of zzso zzso which were small but zzso While the present experiments verify that the zzso zzso plays a role in the processing of zzso zzso they also show that it is not a zzso brain region and allow, in the experimental context, for the interpretation that the zzso zzso zzso a major role in the detection of and responding to salient events, whether or not these events are zzso or zzso
