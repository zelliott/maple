The objective of this study was to investigate zzso and zzso white matter zzso zzso changes in older subjects with clinically diagnosed zzso 

zzso inversion recovery images were acquired one year apart in subjects with zzso with zzso bodies zzso Parkinson disease zzso zzso zzso disease zzso and also healthy elderly comparison zzso zzso volume was zzso using an automated zzso 

zzso zzso (as a percent of brain zzso was significantly greater compared with healthy subjects zzso geometric mean zzso zzso in subjects with zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso post hoc p zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso volume (as a percent of brain zzso was not significantly different zzso zzso between groups zzso median change: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of baseline zzso rather than diagnosis or severity of zzso was a significant predictor of zzso zzso Rate of change of zzso had no association with change in global cognitive zzso 

zzso zzso progression occurs in degenerative zzso with rates influenced by severity of zzso at baseline rather than zzso type or cognitive zzso
