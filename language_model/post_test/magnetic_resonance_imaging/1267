A technique to zzso correlate zzso or serial imaging studies of the head is zzso Surface fitting of a well defined structure in different imaging studies is used to determine the optimal three zzso transformation between the coordinate zzso The transformation is then used to map volumes of interest between studies or to zzso the studies along comparable zzso The approach is feasible in the presence of variations in slice zzso zzso size, imaging plane, or head position, and for correlations between different zzso zzso have been performed between serial CT, zzso and zzso zzso Phantom studies and clinical cases are zzso zzso is typically on the order of the sum of the zzso sizes between zzso zzso in radiation therapy treatment planning are zzso
