To determine whether the extent of white matter high intensity zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso is an independent predictor of risk for stroke from zzso and whether serial evaluation of zzso can be used to identify patients who are at risk of zzso 

Prospective follow up with serial zzso scans was done in 89 patients who were either diagnosed as having symptomatic zzso zzso or were zzso zzso normal individuals with headache or zzso None had significant zzso of major cerebral arteries or zzso zzso zzso analysis with the Cox zzso hazards model was used to test the zzso value for subsequent stroke of risk factor status at entry and during follow up, zzso zzso and the extent of zzso zzso from 0 to zzso on the baseline zzso 

During follow up zzso zzso 51 zzso zzso seven strokes occurred (five zzso zzso and two zzso four in nine patients with severe zzso zzso zzso and three in 40 patients with mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso None of 40 patients without zzso experienced zzso The extent of zzso was an independent predictor of subsequent stroke zzso risk for a 1 point score increase, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso In three strokes among 80 patients without severe zzso two occurred in four patients with an increase in zzso score during follow up, and one occurred in the other 76 patients without an increased score zzso zzso zzso 

Severe zzso at baseline is an independent predictor of risk for stroke from zzso while progression of zzso during follow up may be associated with subsequent stroke in patients with initially mild zzso
