Many Crohn's disease patients require zzso zzso detection of new zzso may lead to change in planned zzso This study aimed to determine whether magnetic resonance zzso can zzso surgical planning and guide decision making in Crohn's zzso 

Seventy-five patients with complicated Crohn's disease were enrolled and underwent zzso magnetic resonance zzso Analysis included imaging accuracy and change in surgical strategy due to zzso with imaging zzso 

Surgery was performed zzso in zzso patients zzso with conversion to open surgery required in six zzso zzso between observers was excellent zzso value zzso zzso resonance zzso accuracy for zzso zzso and zzso were all above zzso in zzso zzso In zzso cases zzso surgery was correctly zzso zzso in zzso cases (three zzso and four zzso surgical strategy zzso of zzso or zzso zzso and/or surgical approach zzso from zzso to open surgery, zzso changed due to zzso with magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso strategy and approach are correctly predicted by magnetic resonance zzso in the majority of patients with complicated Crohn's zzso
