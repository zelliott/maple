We wanted to demonstrate the zzso changes of the magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in zzso intramuscular zzso in rats and to correlate these data with the concurrent zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was induced in 30 zzso The MR images were obtained at 1, 4, 7 and 10 days and at 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after muscle zzso The characteristic serial zzso findings were evaluated and the relative signal zzso were zzso zzso specimens were obtained at each time zzso 

On the zzso imaging zzso the intramuscular zzso exhibited zzso compared to that of muscle or the development of a high signal intensity zzso rim on day one after zzso The high zzso persisted until eight weeks after zzso On the zzso imaging zzso the zzso showed high zzso or centrally low zzso on day one after injury, and mainly high zzso after four zzso A dark signal rim was apparent after seven days, which was indicative of zzso on the zzso The zzso echo zzso imaging yielded dark signal zzso at all zzso 

Unlike brain zzso zzso intramuscular zzso show increased zzso on both the zzso and zzso from the acute stage zzso and this is zzso correlated with a rich blood supply and rapid healing response to injury in the zzso On the zzso and zzso imaging, high zzso with a peripheral dark signal rim is apparent from seven days to the chronic zzso
