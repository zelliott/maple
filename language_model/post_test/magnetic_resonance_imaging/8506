Complex zzso diseases may be zzso or poorly understood on conventional CT or MR zzso Although zzso CT zzso with zzso zzso contrast medium has been used, very few studies have dealt with the zzso use of zzso zzso zzso though it appears superior to zzso We report our experience with the zzso use of zzso for MR zzso and zzso in pediatric patients referred for study and treatment of complex zzso zzso 

Ten patients zzso 1 zzso years of zzso were selected after we obtained specific informed zzso zzso zzso injection was performed via zzso zzso zzso shunt zzso or zzso zzso Cases included spontaneous zzso leaks zzso complex traumatic zzso fractures with suspected zzso leak zzso zzso zzso or acquired zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso suspected zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso and acquired zzso zzso zzso 

No patient showed zzso zzso or zzso zzso In complex zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging helped to differentiate isolation of a zzso or zzso zzso in all 4 zzso In suspected zzso zzso zzso the procedure established with precision the place of the leak in 1 patient and excluded it in the zzso In 1 patient who underwent surgery for spinal zzso zzso the procedure excluded zzso In the other 3 patients with complex zzso diseases, the procedure showed distinctive zzso findings for the understanding and treatment of the zzso Altogether, in 8 patients, imaging findings influenced or changed clinical decisions and surgical zzso 

Our preliminary results showed no side effects and potential useful clinical applications in the evaluation of zzso diseases involving the zzso system or the zzso space in selected pediatric zzso
