The purpose of this study was to identify typical clinical characteristics to predict early motor worsening zzso of patients with penetrating artery zzso 

We reviewed 65 consecutive patients with pure motor zzso zzso stroke, and zzso zzso zzso was defined as deterioration by zzso point on the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso for motor function within 5 days of zzso 

zzso was observed in 22 patients zzso zzso levels were higher in patients with zzso than in those without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The percentage of zzso patients with zzso artery zzso zzso was greater than that of zzso patients with zzso zzso patients, 59% zzso zzso patients, zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso increased the risk of zzso and the combination of these factors increased the risk in an additive manner zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso levels zzso and/or zzso in patients with penetrating artery zzso are associated with zzso
