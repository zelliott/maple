zzso changes in the organization of the zzso in patients with facial zzso serving as a model of peripheral motor zzso were investigated by using zzso magnetic stimulation zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso With zzso the size of the area producing zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso muscle, the sum of zzso zzso within this area, and the volume over the mapping area were compared between both zzso in 8 zzso With zzso increases in regional cerebral blood flow, measured with the standard zzso zzso injection technique, were compared between 6 patients and 6 healthy volunteers during sequential finger zzso Patients moved the hand zzso to the facial zzso the control subjects the right zzso Of 9 patients in total, 5 participated in both zzso With both methods, an enlargement of the hand field zzso to the facial zzso was found, extending in a lateral direction, into the site of the presumed face zzso The PET data showed that the enlargement of the hand field in the zzso zzso zzso is part of a widespread cortical zzso including the zzso zzso and bilateral secondary motor and sensory zzso We report for the first time, using two different zzso methods, that zzso mere motor zzso is a sufficient stimulus for zzso changes in the healthy adult human zzso
