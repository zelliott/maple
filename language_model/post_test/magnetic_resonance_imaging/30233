To investigate the clinical value of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in assessing zzso responses in breast cancer treated with zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso confirmed breast zzso who finished last course of zzso chemotherapy underwent zzso breast zzso All the zzso slices were blindly reviewed by one zzso zzso response was assessed according Miller & zzso zzso zzso of which grade 5 defined as pathological complete response zzso , and grade 5 or 4 defined as major zzso response zzso zzso images were blindly reviewed by two zzso zzso on zzso with zzso zzso Any zzso enhancement in previous tumor bed in any phase of zzso acquisition was defined as residual zzso The diagnostic results of two zzso were correlated to pathological gold zzso zzso consistency was analyzed by Kappa zzso 

zzso for pathological invasive zzso residual disease detection in two zzso had sensitivities of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and accuracy of zzso and zzso respectively, while zzso evaluation had sensitivities of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso K values in determine zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, showing good zzso zzso 

zzso is sensitive in detecting residual breast cancer after zzso chemotherapy, and can be used to predict the zzso zzso zzso
