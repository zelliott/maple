Assessment of right zzso zzso function is clinically relevant in the follow-up of various forms of zzso heart zzso zzso on the value of different zzso approaches for this purpose is zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso provides zzso accurate RV volumes and ejection zzso zzso zzso zzso from 3 different views and zzso zzso zzso were performed in 16 children with zzso heart disease and 17 zzso healthy zzso RV volumes and ejection fraction were calculated with 5 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images could be obtained in all 33 zzso The best correlation between zzso and zzso volumes was with the zzso zzso approximation zzso zzso volume by zzso was 92 zzso 27 zzso systematic difference with zzso was zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume by zzso was 33 zzso 13 zzso systematic difference with zzso was zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction by zzso was 65 zzso zzso systematic difference with zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso For all zzso methods, significant effects of RV geometry were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso calculations demonstrated moderate correlation and significant systematic errors compared with zzso RV zzso zzso results were influenced by RV zzso The relatively simple zzso zzso method provides ejection fraction results acceptable for clinical practice; results are not improved by more complex zzso and/or zzso zzso
