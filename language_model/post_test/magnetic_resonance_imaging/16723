zzso information regarding the structure and dimensions of the left zzso zzso zzso is required to guide zzso of zzso zzso devices in patients with zzso zzso zzso Currently, this procedure is guided by zzso zzso zzso 

The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso in assessing zzso zzso 

The zzso anatomy was analyzed in 21 consecutive patients (age zzso five women, six zzso zzso who underwent zzso zzso for zzso All patients had zzso scans zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of the left atrium zzso An zzso zzso ICE zzso was used to obtain images of the zzso The zzso was zzso with the ICE probe placed zzso in the right atrium zzso zzso zzso in the coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the LA zzso zzso 

ICE imaging from the LA showed a zzso zzso diameter of zzso and a zzso depth of zzso There was strong correlation between the zzso by ICE and the values obtained by CT and zzso The zzso was zzso in all cases from all locations zzso zzso and zzso but complete zzso of the zzso could not be obtained from the zzso and the zzso in a significant number of cases, preventing accurate zzso 

Imaging of zzso using an ICE probe positioned in the LA results in accurate zzso of zzso zzso This imaging zzso could potentially be used during zzso of zzso zzso devices as an alternative to zzso
