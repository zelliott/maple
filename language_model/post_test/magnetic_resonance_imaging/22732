The functional organization of the zzso language network was examined using a functional zzso zzso adaptation paradigm with spoken zzso In zzso 1, a given sentence was presented every zzso s and repeated two, three, or four times in a zzso The study of the zzso properties of the zzso response revealed a zzso zzso along the zzso and zzso directions: From zzso zzso where the fastest responses were recorded, responses became increasingly slower toward the zzso part of the superior zzso zzso and toward the zzso poles and the left inferior frontal zzso where the zzso responses were zzso zzso induced a decrease in zzso and a speeding up of the zzso response in the superior zzso zzso zzso while the most superior zzso regions were not zzso In zzso 2, small blocks of six sentences were presented in which either the speaker voice or the linguistic content of the sentence, or both, were zzso Data analyses revealed a clear zzso While two clusters in the left superior zzso zzso showed identical repetition suppression whether the sentences were produced by the same speaker or different speakers, the zzso right regions were sensitive to sentence repetition only when the speaker voice remained zzso Thus, zzso left regions zzso linguistic content while zzso right regions zzso more details about zzso features like speaker zzso The results demonstrate the feasibility of using zzso adaptation to probe the functional organization of cortical language zzso
