All zzso zzso procedures require zzso of an anatomical target within the coordinate system of the zzso zzso If the target is defined by its coordinates given in a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso faces the mathematical task of transforming zzso coordinates into frame zzso In the method usually used, the frame coordinates of two reference points (the anterior and zzso zzso are obtained from computerized zzso or magnetic resonance images, and serve as the basis for the coordinate zzso This zzso zzso relies on the additional assumption that the frame sits on the patient's head without exhibiting roll, that is, rotation about the zzso axis zzso zzso Usually this assumption is zzso but not exactly, zzso An amount of roll as small as 3 degrees can cause a targeting error on the order of 1 zzso when a zzso zzso is zzso This potential source of error can be eliminated by using a new method of coordinate zzso the derivation of which is zzso reported in this zzso The new method requires a third reference point located in the zzso plane, in addition to the two zzso reference zzso
