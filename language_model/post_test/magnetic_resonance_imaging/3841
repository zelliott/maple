The first zzso zzso zzso array that zzso to the human head and operates at zzso zzso (7 zzso is zzso Individual zzso elements were zzso using zzso shields around each element that extended zzso from the zzso This decoupling method allowed elements to be constructed with arbitrary shape, size, and location to create a three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso achieved a zzso uniformity of zzso over the whole brain and zzso over a single zzso zzso During zzso transmission, zzso elements couple tightly to the head and reduce the amount of power necessary to achieve a mean zzso flip angle zzso and zzso pulse lengths were required for a zzso hard pulse when zzso over the whole brain and a single zzso zzso zzso During reception, the close proximity of zzso elements to the head increases the zzso ratio in the periphery of the brain, most notably at the superior aspect of the zzso The sensitivity profile of each element is localized beneath the respective zzso When combined with the achieved isolation between zzso this results in the capacity for low geometry factors during both transmit and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso acceleration in the zzso zzso High cortical zzso ratio and parallel imaging performance make the zzso zzso ideal for the study of high zzso and/or spatial cortical architecture and zzso
