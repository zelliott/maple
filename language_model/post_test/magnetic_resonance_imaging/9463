zzso focal zzso is a well-known model in experimental zzso However, the dynamic evolution of zzso zzso changes, spectral content and zzso are rarely zzso zzso by earlier zzso findings, we also seek for the early signs preceding zzso activity from frequency domain of zzso zzso In this study, zzso data is taken from previous zzso series (six zzso zzso of an experimental focal zzso model, which includes dynamic induction of zzso activity with zzso zzso injection into the zzso zzso during deep zzso zzso No zzso zzso were recorded with this zzso Spike zzso zzso zzso content and zzso of zzso were zzso Development of zzso induced focal zzso activity was not preceded with specific spectral zzso The beginning of zzso zzso was related to power increase in the zzso below zzso or zzso and continued to a widespread spectral zzso zzso and zzso changes were clear in one zzso zzso evolution of zzso activity was a collection of the zzso zzso zzso triple or double zzso forms, with an increase in zzso up to large zzso zzso In conclusion, in the time sequence of induced zzso activity, immediate shifts in zzso zzso are zzso followed by the spike zzso widespread increase in spectral zzso zzso evolution does not appear to follow a clear zzso rather, zzso and variable spike or zzso zzso generally lead to zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso
