This study presents a clinical and zzso evaluation of 50 consecutive patients with symptomatic zzso cervical zzso and zzso spinal zzso zzso who were managed with a single stage wide zzso zzso and lateral mass zzso zzso 

50 consecutive patients zzso male, 17 zzso over a 4 year period presenting with symptomatic cervical zzso due to zzso cervical zzso spinal zzso were evaluated and operated upon by a single surgeon and followed in a prospective zzso All patients underwent zzso and zzso clinical, zzso and zzso zzso
