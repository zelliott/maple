The blood zzso zzso zzso responses to visual zzso using both a zzso long single trial stimulus and a zzso long block zzso were measured in a zzso magnetic field both before and immediately after a zzso caffeine zzso In addition, resting levels of cerebral blood flow zzso were measured using zzso spin zzso For the single trial zzso the caffeine dose significantly zzso reduced the time to peak zzso the time after the peak at which the response returned to 50% of the peak zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso in all subjects zzso Other zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and the peak zzso also showed significant changes in the majority of zzso For the block zzso the zzso zzso and the time for the response to reach 50% of the peak zzso zzso were significantly zzso In some subjects, zzso were observed in the zzso portion of the response with median peak periods of zzso and zzso s for the single trial and block responses, zzso zzso zzso was reduced by an average of zzso The zzso of the results was verified in one subject who was scanned on 3 different zzso The dynamic changes are similar to those previously reported for baseline zzso reductions induced by zzso and zzso
