To determine whether microscopic cortical zzso defects in patients with infantile spasms, not initially identifiable on zzso may be zzso from evolving changes in the adjacent white zzso 

Three infants between 3 and 6 months of age presented with infantile zzso Based on negative zzso assessment and normal MR findings, they were classified as zzso Despite therapy the children deteriorated with seizure recurrence and the advent of zzso clinical and zzso zzso MR studies were repeated and zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

The second MR studies demonstrated abnormalities of zzso corresponding to localized clinical and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso findings did not show a strong zzso one was normal, one showed no zzso in the major area of MR zzso and one showed significantly less zzso than on zzso Two patients have undergone surgery, both with good zzso 

zzso zzso defects may be identifiable on zzso zzso zzso but are usually not zzso on zzso White matter zzso on MR images is usually attributable to primary zzso We suggest that in certain cases progressive white matter changes may be induced as a secondary phenomenon by zzso microscopic cortical zzso zzso zzso MR imaging may be beneficial in children with infantile spasms in whom signs of zzso zzso
