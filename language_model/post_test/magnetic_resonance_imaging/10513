zzso is an ideal method for identifying areas of muscle zzso and fatty zzso Studies comparing clinical and zzso features of foot and leg muscle zzso in zzso disease type zzso zzso zzso are zzso The aim of this study is to describe clinical and zzso patterns of lower limb zzso in zzso A total of 10 secondary zzso patients and 1 zzso patient with de zzso zzso were zzso zzso Ages of patients ranged from 8 to 61 years zzso zzso Disease severity in terms of ability to walk and run was established using a zzso functional disability scale zzso We administered the CMT zzso score zzso based on patient's symptoms, neurological examination and zzso zzso Muscle strength of zzso ankle and toe muscles was assessed manually with the standard Medical Research Council zzso In all 11 patients, leg zzso study included zzso and zzso zzso sequences in zzso and zzso planes, and a zzso zzso sequence with chemical zzso fat suppression before and after zzso contrast agent zzso In seven patients both feet were simultaneously studied in zzso and zzso zzso Six patients had zzso zzso an zzso score of 0 zzso mild zzso and normal muscle power of foot zzso In these six patients, zzso showed muscle fatty zzso of intrinsic foot muscles mainly involving the zzso all four leg muscle compartments being zzso The remaining five patients had zzso scores from 1 zzso or zzso to 3 zzso zzso mild to moderate zzso and variable weakness of zzso zzso In these five patients zzso zzso besides intrinsic foot muscle involvement, variable and zzso zzso fatty zzso of the zzso anterior and superficial zzso leg muscle compartments and, to a lesser degree, of the deep zzso zzso In four patients muscle zzso and zzso enhancement was zzso zzso demonstrated fatty zzso of clinically normal zzso We conclude that zzso patterns of lower limb muscle zzso vary with evolution of zzso Selective involvement of intrinsic foot muscles is the characteristic pattern of zzso cases with minimal disease zzso zzso this pattern usually combines variable involvement of leg zzso Our findings help to clarity the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso
