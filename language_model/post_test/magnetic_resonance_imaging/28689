The central one third of the zzso zzso zzso is popular because the zzso zzso construct provides several graft fixation options, robust graft zzso and a mechanically sufficient zzso zzso screw fixation is one method used to secure the zzso zzso interference screws may offer advantages over metal interference zzso zzso screws are made from zzso zzso acid zzso and are absorbed by the zzso This zzso zzso study compared the safety and efficacy of the zzso screw with that of the metal zzso interference screw for anterior cruciate ligament zzso There were 204 patients randomly assigned to the zzso zzso Largo, zzso zzso zzso zzso or the metal interference screw zzso zzso zzso groups at four zzso The mean age was 30 zzso There were 66 women and 138 zzso Mean follow-up was 30 months for zzso and 28 months for metal zzso the average follow-up zzso was zzso zzso The zzso mean scores at 4 years for the 32 patients seen at this zzso were zzso and zzso for the zzso and metal screw group, zzso zzso zzso comparisons made with an zzso zzso at manual maximum force resulted in zzso mean score differences of B zzso zzso and M zzso zzso The zzso activity level score means were B zzso zzso and M zzso zzso Other variables examined included pain, thigh size, zzso tests, zzso test, range of motion, anterior drawer, zzso shift, zzso zzso and zzso and joint zzso None of these variables showed a statistically significant difference between zzso No zzso evidence of zzso change or bone zzso around the zzso was zzso There were no complications related to loss of zzso zzso zzso or other evidence of zzso or inflammatory zzso In every assessment between groups there was no difference zzso There were 12 zzso screws that broke during zzso without any adverse zzso The zzso zzso zzso interference fit screws produce equal results to similarly designed metal zzso
