Identification of individuals in the community with left zzso zzso dysfunction zzso or left zzso zzso zzso may allow earlier initiation of zzso zzso We performed a comprehensive evaluation of the screening performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso or zzso 

In zzso subjects without a history of heart failure, zzso zzso zzso zzso or a serum zzso zzso zzso enrolled in the Dallas Heart zzso measurement of zzso and zzso and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were robustly associated with magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso zzso fraction zzso among men and women zzso zzso zzso for zzso In the overall population, neither test zzso well for zzso or zzso zzso under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso Among women, no differences in zzso were observed between zzso and zzso Among men, zzso were similar between zzso and zzso in the overall population, but among zzso age 50 or older, or with hypertension, the zzso for zzso zzso were higher than for zzso zzso P zzso zzso for each zzso Compared with subjects with isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso those with isolated zzso zzso had worse zzso function and more zzso and coronary calcium zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

Overall, neither zzso nor zzso accurately zzso subjects with zzso or zzso in this predominately young and healthy zzso zzso However, among high-risk men, zzso performed slightly better than zzso and comparably with other routinely used screening tests such as zzso zzso measurement for prostate zzso
