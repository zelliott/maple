Research has shown poor performance on verbal memory tasks in patients with major depressive disorder relative to healthy controls, as well as structural abnormalities in the zzso structures that form the zzso zzso Few studies, however, have attempted to link the zzso in learning and memory in depression with these structural zzso and of those which have done so, most have included patients zzso with zzso agents likely to influence cognitive zzso This study thus examines the relationship between zzso structural abnormalities and verbal memory using the California zzso Learning Test zzso in zzso depressed zzso A zzso weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan and the zzso were obtained on 45 subjects with major depressive disorder and 44 healthy zzso Using the zzso Integrated Registration and zzso zzso zzso volumes of selected zzso structures were segmented and correlated with zzso zzso zzso participants showed significantly smaller right zzso and right zzso volumes than healthy zzso zzso participants also showed impaired performance on global verbal learning ability, and appeared to depend upon an inferior memory strategy zzso zzso zzso of serial zzso were correlated significantly with right zzso volumes in depressed zzso Our findings indicate that depressed participants and healthy controls differ in the memory strategies they zzso and that while depressed participants had a smaller zzso volume, there was a positive correlation between volume and use of an inferior memory zzso This suggests that larger zzso volume is related to better memory recall in depression, but specifically with regard to utilizing an inferior memory zzso
