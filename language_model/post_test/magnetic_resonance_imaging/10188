To evaluate the value of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance zzso zzso for zzso of zzso after zzso aneurysm repair zzso 

zzso patients, between 2 days and 54 months after zzso were evaluated with zzso zzso and dynamic zzso The additional diagnostic value of the dynamic zzso zzso was evaluated by determining the ability of the dynamic series in zzso the site of inflow of an zzso 

An zzso was detected in 23 zzso zzso of the 23 dynamic series were technically successful (no disturbing artifacts limiting the diagnostic zzso Using zzso our findings were: 2 type I, 6 type II, 1 type III, no type IV zzso and in 14 cases zzso could not be zzso The zzso results for zzso plus the dynamic zzso were: 2 type I, 12 type II, 1 type III, no type IV zzso and in eight cases zzso could not be zzso In six cases the dynamic zzso allowed zzso of the zzso which was not possible with the zzso images alone zzso Fisher zzso 

This pilot study shows that dynamic zzso can have additional value in the zzso of zzso Dynamic zzso might zzso the need for diagnostic digital zzso zzso and aid planning for zzso
