While zzso stroke reflects focal damage determined by the affected vascular territory, clinical symptoms are often more complex and may be better explained by additional indirect effects of the focal zzso zzso to be structurally underpinned by anatomical connections, supporting evidence has been found using zzso in the functional connectivity of zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data in both zzso and attention zzso To assess the zzso of this phenomenon in a stroke population with zzso zzso we investigated the zzso effects of zzso on a global zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were acquired at three consecutive time points, beginning during the acute phase zzso 1, 7, and 90 zzso in 12 patients after zzso zzso We found a preferential functional change in affected networks zzso networks containing zzso changed more during recovery when compared with unaffected zzso This change in connectivity was significantly correlated with clinical changes assessed with the National Institute of Health Stroke zzso Our results provide evidence that the functional architecture of large-scale networks is critical to understanding the clinical effect and trajectory of zzso zzso
