The aim of this study was zzso to describe the spectrum of imaging findings seen in zzso zzso and zzso to compare zzso imaging techniques in the demonstration of the extent, size and appearance of the zzso zzso as referenced by zzso Imaging studies of 18 patients (13 women, 5 zzso mean age 53 zzso with surgically proven zzso zzso were zzso All patients received conventional zzso of the pelvis and hip, US and MR imaging of the zzso The CT was performed in 5 of the 18 zzso zzso CT and MR all demonstrated enlarged zzso zzso The zzso wall was thin and well defined in zzso and thickened in zzso of all zzso The two cases with zzso on US were not seen by CT and zzso A communication between the zzso and the hip joint was seen, and surgically verified, in all 18 patients by MR imaging, whereas US and CT failed to demonstrate it in 44 and zzso of the cases, zzso zzso joint zzso was seen and verified by surgery in 16 patients by zzso whereas CT (4 of 5) and US ( zzso underestimated the zzso The overall size of the zzso corresponded best between zzso and surgery, whereas CT and US tended to underestimate the zzso zzso enhancement of the zzso wall was seen in all zzso The imaging characteristics of zzso zzso are a zzso zzso zzso mass with a communication to the hip joint and peripheral contrast zzso The most accurate way to assess zzso zzso is with MR zzso thus, it should be used for accurate therapy planning and follow-up zzso In order to initially prove an zzso zzso US is the most zzso zzso and fast zzso
