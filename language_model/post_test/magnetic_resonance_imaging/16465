zzso resonance with diffusion zzso image zzso may be able to estimate zzso compatible with zzso tracts close to brain zzso A limit of zzso is brain shifting zzso of the brain after zzso opening and tumor zzso 

To calculate the brain shift of zzso compatible with the zzso tract zzso in patients undergoing zzso zzso and predict the shift directions of zzso 

zzso was acquired in 20 patients and carried out through 12 zzso zzso Dedicated software zzso all sequences acquired with zzso processing and the whole zzso was sent to the zzso zzso zzso after zzso opening (in zzso and tumor zzso (in all) zzso acquisitions were performed to evaluate zzso zzso The extent of shifting was considered as the maximum distance between the zzso and zzso contours of the zzso 

An outward shift of zzso was observed in 8 patients and an inward shift in 10 patients during zzso In the remaining 2 patients, no zzso displacement was zzso Only zzso zzso showed a statistically significant correlation with the amount of zzso In those patients in which zzso was acquired after zzso opening as well (11 zzso an outward shifting of zzso was evident in that zzso 

The use of zzso zzso demonstrated brain shifting of the zzso zzso evaluation of white matter tracts can be used during surgical procedures only if updated with zzso zzso
