To estimate the zzso sensitivity, and specificity of 3 zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging sequences zzso for the detection of zzso portal zzso zzso 

Thirty-nine zzso patients with liver zzso underwent zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso and MR imaging zzso zzso zzso recalled echo zzso zzso fast spin echo zzso and zzso zzso sequences with and without zzso zzso resonance images were reviewed by 4 blinded observers for rating based on the confidence zzso The zzso sensitivity, and specificity for each sequence were measured by receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso ratio zzso and relative zzso ratio changes were statistically zzso 

Thirty-nine zzso zzso defects were observed in 22 patients by zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis showed the accuracy was higher for zzso zzso zzso than for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging achieved the highest sensitivity zzso and the lowest specificity zzso zzso zzso imaging achieved the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso imaging was the most accurate and sensitive method for detecting portal zzso abnormalities compared with zzso or zzso imaging, whereas zzso or zzso imaging is superior in specificity to zzso imaging during zzso MR zzso
