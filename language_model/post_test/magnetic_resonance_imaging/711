This study was performed with the aim of evaluating the usefulness of 3 zzso zzso steady state sequences in examining the internal zzso of the zzso zzso was used as a referral zzso 

The study was performed in the zzso and zzso Departments of King's College Hospital, London, United zzso during a zzso period from January 1997 to June zzso All patients who had knee magnetic resonance imaging within 3 months of zzso were zzso zzso zzso patients fulfilled these criteria and were zzso 

Three zzso zzso steady state sequences produced sensitivity for detecting zzso tears of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso for lateral zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso positive zzso value zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso and negative zzso value zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The sensitivity for the anterior cruciate ligament was zzso specificity was zzso zzso was zzso and zzso was zzso 

Three zzso zzso steady state sequences are useful in evaluating internal zzso of the knee, especially in advanced cartilage zzso
