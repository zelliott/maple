The authors describe a case of spontaneous zzso zzso in which the leakage site was determined by using magnetic resonance zzso zzso This technique demonstrated the route of zzso fluid zzso zzso whereas other methods failed to show direct evidence of zzso zzso resonance zzso is a zzso method that is highly sensitive in detecting zzso zzso This is the first report in which a site of zzso leakage was detected using MR zzso
