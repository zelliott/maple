To describe an zzso zzso 3-D acquisition technique for MR zzso of the zzso carotid zzso an approach chosen to minimize zzso effects when the body zzso is used as zzso as is often the situation when a dedicated neck zzso is used as zzso 

Five healthy subjects and 17 patients in whom carotid artery disease was suspected underwent MR zzso using the above zzso 

zzso contrast was much better than in direct zzso zzso Comparisons between zzso zzso 3-D acquisition and the zzso approach showed that a greater length of the carotid arteries was depicted and scan time was less for zzso zzso 

Use of zzso imaging is a simple and effective solution to the problem of zzso zzso zzso
