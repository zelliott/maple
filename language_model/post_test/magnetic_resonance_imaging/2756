The objective of the study was to compare hybrid zzso fat suppressed sequences using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Eight normal volunteers had abdominal imaging at zzso T using both an zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso and an opposed phase zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso with zzso fat zzso Signal to noise ratios zzso and contrast to noise ratios zzso relative to fat of zzso liver and zzso muscle were calculated for each zzso The zzso sequence with zzso of 150 zzso s zzso significantly outperformed the corresponding 3 zzso zzso sequence for zzso and zzso for all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences can be performed with zzso in less overall imaging time than zzso zzso and can achieve superior fat suppression and zzso if sufficient zzso is zzso
