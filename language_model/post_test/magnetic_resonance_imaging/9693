zzso of the zzso zzso has been implicated in right zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the relationship between zzso zzso and RV function in patients without clinical cardiovascular zzso We hypothesized that better zzso function would be associated with higher RV ejection fraction and lower RV mass and volume by cardiac zzso 

In the Multi-Ethnic Study of zzso zzso cardiac zzso was performed on community-based participants without clinical cardiovascular zzso Images were analyzed by the harmonic phase method to measure peak zzso zzso zzso strain for each wall zzso zzso inferior, and zzso zzso linear zzso and generalized additive models were used to assess the relationship between zzso strain and RV zzso 

There were zzso participants zzso zzso with a mean age of zzso zzso Better zzso function was associated with higher RV ejection fraction in a zzso fashion after adjustment for all zzso zzso zzso zzso There appeared to be a threshold effect for the contribution of zzso strain to RV zzso function, with an almost linear zzso in RV ejection fraction with zzso strain from zzso to zzso zzso function was not related to RV mass or zzso 

zzso zzso function was linked to RV zzso function independent of other left zzso regions, even in individuals without clinical cardiovascular zzso This finding confirms animal and human research suggesting the importance of zzso function to the right zzso and implies that changes in zzso function could herald RV zzso
