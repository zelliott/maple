A growing body of evidence demonstrates that persistent positive symptoms, particularly zzso can be improved by cognitive zzso therapy for zzso zzso perception and processing of threat are believed to constitute the genesis of zzso The present study aimed to examine functional brain changes following cognitive zzso therapy for zzso The study involved 56 zzso with one or more persistent positive zzso symptoms of zzso zzso patients receiving cognitive zzso therapy for psychosis for zzso months in addition to their usual treatment were matched with 28 patients receiving treatment as zzso zzso symptoms were assessed by a zzso blind to treatment group, and they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during an affect processing task at baseline and end of treatment zzso The two groups were comparable at baseline in terms of clinical and demographic parameters and neural and zzso responses to facial and control zzso The cognitive zzso therapy for psychosis with zzso group zzso subjects) showed significant clinical improvement compared with the zzso group (16 zzso which showed no change at zzso The cognitive zzso therapy for psychosis with zzso group, but not the zzso group, showed decreased zzso of the inferior zzso zzso thalamus, zzso and zzso areas to fearful and angry expressions at treatment follow-up compared with zzso Reduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging response during angry expressions correlated directly with symptom zzso This study provides the first evidence that cognitive zzso therapy for psychosis zzso brain responses to threatening stimuli and suggests that cognitive zzso therapy for psychosis may mediate symptom reduction by promoting processing of threats in a less zzso zzso
