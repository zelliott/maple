The zzso transfer ratio zzso is a zzso zzso procedure aiming at the zzso of the structural integrity of brain zzso Its contribution to the differential diagnosis of zzso was examined and discussed in relation to the zzso of age-related zzso 

zzso patients from a memory clinic were diagnosed by general physical and zzso examination, and underwent zzso testing and zzso using zzso Their clinical diagnoses were based on standard operational research zzso Additionally, the zzso in 10 defined regions of interest zzso was zzso This investigation was performed using a zzso zzso zzso Average zzso values were determined in the individual zzso and their combinations and correlated with the age, zzso cognitive impairment and clinical zzso zzso zzso positive and negative zzso value were determined, as well as the rate of correct zzso 

For cognitive healthy subjects, the zzso values correlate only zzso though significantly, with age in the zzso and with gender in the zzso corpus zzso In contrast, the zzso in the frontal white matter zzso strongly and highly significantly with cognitive impairment in patients with zzso The differential diagnostic assignment of Alzheimer's disease versus vascular zzso by zzso provides a correct zzso of approximately 50 % to 70 zzso zzso for no zzso zzso vascular zzso or the zzso for vascular zzso Alzheimer's disease are considerably higher exceeding 80 zzso For no zzso zzso Alzheimer's disease, the zzso was over 90 zzso 

zzso values indicate functional changes in the brain tissue between cognitive healthy and zzso patients, and correlate with the cognitive loss, but not with age and zzso In principle, the zzso is suitable for the diagnosis of age-related zzso but does not contribute substantially to the differential diagnosis of vascular zzso zzso Alzheimer's zzso The present results support the assumption of a zzso between vascular and degenerative components of age-related zzso
