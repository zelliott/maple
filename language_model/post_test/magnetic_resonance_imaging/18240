Recent advances have enabled delivery of high-intensity focused ultrasound through the intact human zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso This preliminary study investigates the use of zzso zzso focused ultrasound zzso for the treatment of essential zzso 

From February 2011 through December 2011, in an zzso uncontrolled study, we used zzso zzso focused ultrasound to target the unilateral zzso intermediate nucleus of the zzso in 15 patients with zzso zzso essential zzso We recorded all safety data and measured the effectiveness of zzso suppression using the Clinical zzso zzso for zzso to calculate the total score zzso from 0 to zzso hand zzso zzso outcome, ranging from 0 to zzso and disability zzso zzso from 0 to zzso with higher scores indicating worse zzso We assessed the patients' perceptions of treatment efficacy with the Quality of Life in Essential zzso zzso zzso from 0 to zzso with higher scores indicating greater perceived zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso target occurred in all zzso zzso effects of the procedure included transient zzso zzso zzso and speech zzso with persistent zzso in four zzso Scores for hand zzso improved from zzso at baseline to zzso at 12 months zzso Total zzso scores improved from zzso to zzso zzso zzso scores improved from zzso to zzso zzso zzso scores improved from 37% to zzso zzso 

In this pilot study, essential zzso improved in 15 patients treated with zzso focused ultrasound zzso zzso randomized, controlled trials will be required to assess the zzso efficacy and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Surgery zzso zzso number, zzso
