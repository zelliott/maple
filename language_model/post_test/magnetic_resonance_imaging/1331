zzso zzso scanning is an excellent zzso for evaluation of most zzso and zzso tumors and zzso However, MR scanning is definitely superior to CT when evaluating for multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of gaze zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or when assessing an area where zzso scanning is important zzso zzso zzso resonance has increased specificity when the CT is zzso Although MR and CT may be complementary in the information they zzso many clinical studies have shown MR to be superior to CT in evaluating cerebral zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the cavernous zzso zzso resonance generally has replaced zzso CT zzso as the procedure of choice for evaluating the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is still preferable for major zzso especially involving acute fractures and zzso although MR is more sensitive to the more subtle zzso zzso such as zzso injuries and zzso zzso that may provide zzso zzso zzso zzso also is preferred in situations where detecting small amounts of zzso is important for the differential zzso As the development of MR imaging continues with faster scan times, finer spatial resolution, the use of zzso contrast agents, and with increased availability and decreased cost, MR imaging may become preferable to CT as the imaging zzso of choice for the zzso and zzso
