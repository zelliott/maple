zzso machine learning has been proposed as a revolutionary approach for identifying sensitive medical image zzso (or combination of them) allowing for automatic diagnosis of individual zzso The aim of this work was to assess the feasibility of a supervised machine learning zzso for the assisted diagnosis of patients with clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease zzso and Progressive zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso Images zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso patients zzso and healthy control subjects zzso were used by a supervised machine learning zzso based on the combination of Principal zzso Analysis as feature extraction technique and on Support zzso Machines as zzso zzso The zzso was able to obtain zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso 

The zzso allowed individual diagnosis of zzso versus controls, zzso versus controls and zzso versus zzso with an zzso zzso and zzso zzso influencing zzso between zzso and zzso patients involved zzso zzso corpus zzso and thalamus, four critical regions known to be strongly involved in the zzso mechanisms of zzso 

zzso accuracy of individual zzso patients was consistent with previous manual zzso metrics and with other supervised machine learning application to zzso data, whereas accuracy in the detection of individual zzso patients was significantly higher with our zzso zzso 

The zzso provides excellent discrimination of zzso patients from zzso patients at an individual level, thus encouraging the application of computer-based diagnosis in clinical zzso
