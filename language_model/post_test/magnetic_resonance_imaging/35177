To study the cortical mechanism of zzso categorization in the human brain, we employed zzso and the zzso zzso This paradigm is able to eliminate any differential zzso for local stimulus features, and thus to identify only global zzso zzso Strong zzso of the image into different spatial zzso was generated solely from zzso zzso between zones of homogeneous dynamic zzso The zzso zzso was a single geometric figure enclosed in a larger surround zzso In a control condition, the zzso organization was eliminated by zzso the noise field into many identical zzso zzso The manipulation of the type of zzso organization triggered dramatic reorganization in the cortical zzso zzso The zzso zzso generated suppression of the ground representation zzso to early zzso visual cortex, zzso and zzso and strong zzso in the motion complex zzso conversely, both responses were abolished when the zzso organization was zzso These results suggest that zzso processing is zzso by zzso suppression of the ground representation in the earliest visual areas zzso through a signal arising in the motion zzso We propose a model of a zzso cortical architecture incorporating zzso feedback that operates in a zzso manner, forming a zzso categorization network distinct from that for zzso scene zzso and thus underlying the zzso organization of dynamic scenes into cognitively relevant zzso
