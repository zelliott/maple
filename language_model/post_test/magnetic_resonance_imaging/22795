To assess whether, by applying a zzso set of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso it is possible to detect and zzso the following zzso which represent key features of abnormalities of the zzso and zzso zzso 1) upward rotation of the zzso 2) upward displacement of the zzso 3) underdevelopment of the zzso Also to zzso in a small subset of cases, the correlation between ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the measurement of these three zzso 

This was a prospective zzso zzso The study population included 51 normal fetuses and 20 abnormal fetuses with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) or zzso magna zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ultrasound volumes of the fetal head were acquired from the zzso zzso or the zzso part of the zzso zzso and processed zzso with dedicated zzso The following parameters were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter zzso 100 ratio zzso zzso In seven cases, zzso performed on the same day as zzso was available for zzso zzso statistics were used to assess differences in means and zzso 

The zzso angle was increased only in fetuses with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rotation of the zzso was demonstrated both by the zzso and the zzso angles in fetuses with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while in those with zzso zzso the difference was not statistically zzso probably due to the small number of zzso Finally, the zzso ratio demonstrated that the degree of zzso zzso was higher in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso we have demonstrated in the fetus the key elements characterizing most anomalies of the zzso zzso namely the upward displacement of the zzso the zzso rotation and the significant zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, our observations in a small number of cases indicate that there is a good correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso
