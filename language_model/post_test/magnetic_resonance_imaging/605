To zzso evaluate the role of the various imaging techniques in the study of the zzso joint, in patients with zzso and other rheumatic conditions and to assess potential pitfalls in the zzso zzso 

Thirty patients, 11 male and 19 female, mean age 45 years, with involvement of the zzso joint as part of zzso disorders zzso arthritis, zzso zzso zzso syndrome, zzso syndrome, and condensing zzso of the zzso were zzso Conventional zzso CT, zzso and bone zzso were zzso The following imaging findings were zzso soft tissue zzso bone zzso cortical bone zzso joint space zzso zzso zzso zzso new bone formation, zzso reaction and zzso zzso All the images were independently reviewed by two musculoskeletal zzso 

Conventional zzso demonstrated only sclerosis of the zzso in 8 zzso zzso and the zzso in 3 zzso zzso cortical bone zzso in 7 zzso zzso joint space narrowing in 6 zzso zzso and zzso bone formation in 2 zzso zzso At the CT examination sclerosis of the zzso and the zzso was observed in 13 zzso zzso cortical bone zzso in 22 zzso zzso joint space narrowing in 10 zzso zzso ligament zzso in 12 zzso zzso zzso sclerosis in 9 zzso zzso and zzso bone formation in 10 zzso zzso The zzso was the most sensitive technique in the evaluation of the soft tissue swelling in 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso in 13 zzso zzso and zzso reaction in 13 zzso zzso Finally, bone zzso showed an increased zzso at the zzso joint in all patients who underwent the zzso 

The zzso evaluation of the anterior chest wall in patients with different rheumatic disorders represents a problem of difficult diagnostic evaluation both for the zzso region complexity and for the zzso of the zzso zzso The integrated use of zzso CT, zzso and nuclear medicine is suggested to avoid zzso
