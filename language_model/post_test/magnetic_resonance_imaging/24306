zzso of cerebral zzso metabolism are well anticipated during cerebral zzso However, detailed zzso characteristics of disturbed cerebral zzso metabolism during acute zzso remain largely zzso This study aims to delineate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso imaging, particularly at the zzso zone, and its correlation with tissue zzso 

The zzso zzso middle cerebral artery zzso model was used to induce focal cerebral zzso in rats zzso All animals underwent sequential zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging at different times zzso minutes) after middle cerebral artery zzso MR and zzso zzso zzso images were zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zone was assessed in relation to middle cerebral artery zzso zzso cerebral blood flow, apparent diffusion zzso and 24-hour zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was consistently observed at the zzso zone surrounding the presumed zzso core with low zzso zzso Both the spatial volume and the zzso level of the zzso region were zzso correlated with the duration of middle cerebral artery zzso The zzso regions exhibited a mild reduction of cerebral blood flow zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso when compared with that in the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that, with zzso an average of zzso of the zzso volume was recruited into final zzso 

zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zone is consistently observed during acute cerebral zzso The region with elevated zzso zzso likely reflects viable zzso that can be salvaged with zzso zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging might hold promise in the management of patients with acute zzso
