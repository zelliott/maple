The gold standard of tumor diagnosis is zzso examination of a zzso however, there is concern that tumor cell dissemination along the needle track during zzso biopsy can cause local tumor zzso We aimed to evaluate the value of an zzso zzso gelatin sponge in preventing tumor cell contamination along the biopsy needle zzso 

Data were obtained from 40 patients who were diagnosed by core needle biopsy as having zzso and who were followed up at our hospital between 2008 and zzso Of the 40 patients, 20 had the needle biopsy tracks filled with zzso zzso gelatin sponge immediately after the biopsy zzso was zzso while the other 20 did zzso All 40 patients underwent zzso surgery, and specimens were obtained from the biopsy track for zzso examination of multiple zzso 

On zzso examination, there was less tumor cell contamination along the biopsy tracks in the zzso zzso 

Use of zzso zzso gelatin sponge may prevent tumor cell contamination of a biopsy track, and reduce the possibility of zzso tumor zzso
