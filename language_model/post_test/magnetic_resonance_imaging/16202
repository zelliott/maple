The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of a zzso zzso traction pin subjected to a zzso magnetic resonance image zzso with regard to pin migration and implant heating in a zzso zzso 

zzso angles of various traction pins as well as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso wire bow subjected to a zzso clinical zzso were zzso zzso pins were placed into a zzso zzso and the tractor bow was attached to the most zzso pin to simulate zzso zzso zzso zzso and migration were measured after subjecting the zzso leg to a zzso zzso zzso sequence for 30 zzso 

All traction pins and bows showed zzso The zzso wire bow showed a hazardous level of zzso and was immediately removed from further zzso The pin temperature changes were not significantly different than the changes in the zzso room temperature and a zzso loop was not seen in the combination pin and tractor zzso There was no significant migration of any pin nor was there objective loosening from pin zzso 

zzso stainless steel traction pins show no signs of adverse heating or pin migration when subjected to zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso bows are highly zzso and should not be used unless individually tested for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that show weak zzso preliminarily appear safe to use during a zzso zzso and do not produce a zzso loop with excessive heating in a zzso model, although further testing is zzso
