The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso has been shown to play a pivotal role in zzso It positively controls zzso by regulating zzso as well as the zzso regulator zzso and its target zzso In line with these findings, it has been demonstrated that tumor zzso zzso promotes tumor growth and zzso In contrast to zzso function in tumor cells, the role of zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso so zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso in zzso cells including zzso cells zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and zzso does not affect tumor growth in two different zzso mouse models, the zzso melanoma and the Lewis lung zzso zzso zzso analyses of the tumors revealed that tumor zzso remains unaffected as assessed by zzso of the zzso density and relative blood volume in the zzso Furthermore, we could show that the maturation status of the tumor zzso analyzed by the zzso marker zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso as well as the attachment of zzso to the zzso is not changed upon zzso of zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the zzso functions of zzso zzso are well compensated with regard to tumor zzso and tumor zzso
