After zzso stroke zzso left zzso zzso zzso is detected by zzso zzso zzso in some cases but not in zzso We propose that there are 2 types of zzso in zzso zzso and massive zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso of acute zzso or transient zzso attack zzso were zzso enrolled in the study between May 2009 and July zzso zzso was performed within 7 days of zzso The patients were classified into 2 groups: those with zzso of the main trunk zzso carotid artery, zzso and zzso zzso group zzso and those with zzso of other zzso arteries zzso zzso Clinical features were compared between patients who did and did not have a zzso on zzso 

Of the 41 patients in the study, 21 were in group M and 20 were in group zzso Age, sex, and treatment with tissue zzso zzso did not differ significantly between the 2 zzso The rate of detection of zzso was significantly higher in group D zzso v zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso artery zzso had a significantly higher rate of zzso compared to those with main trunk zzso zzso artery zzso zzso therefore tends to result from zzso zzso and is associated with a remnant zzso with which there may be a concern of a risk of early zzso
