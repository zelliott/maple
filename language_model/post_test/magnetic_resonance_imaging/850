zzso zzso zzso sedation for magnetic resonance imaging zzso is associated with significant failure rates, adverse events and delayed zzso zzso zzso reportedly produces successful sedation in zzso of children undergoing diagnostic zzso This study compared the zzso adverse events and recovery characteristics of zzso vs zzso in children undergoing zzso 

With Institutional Review Board approval and written zzso children were randomly assigned to receive intravenous zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso in incremental zzso or oral zzso (75 zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso effects, including zzso failed zzso paradoxical reactions and zzso changes, the return of baseline activity, and parental satisfaction were zzso The quality of zzso scans was evaluated by a zzso blinded to the sedation zzso 

zzso facilitated an earlier onset of sedation zzso zzso zzso higher sedation scores zzso zzso zzso and less need for supplemental zzso compared with zzso Severe zzso occurred in two children zzso in the zzso zzso Fourteen per cent of the zzso group experienced a paradoxical reaction, zzso sedation failure and zzso major motion zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were both associated with a high zzso of motor zzso and zzso However, children who received zzso had a slower return to baseline activity zzso zzso zzso 

Although zzso facilitated a quicker sedation onset and reduced the requirement for supplemental zzso it produced a higher zzso of paradoxical reaction and prolonged recovery with a similar failure rate compared with zzso
