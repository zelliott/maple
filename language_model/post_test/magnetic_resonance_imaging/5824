To test the hypothesis that the extent of outer zzso zzso of zzso measured zzso with zzso zzso zzso is a quantitative zzso of zzso zzso channel regulation by visual cycle zzso 

Four groups of animals were zzso control rats adapted to three different background light zzso zzso control mice zzso zzso with zzso and zzso mice with a nonsense zzso in zzso 3 of the zzso gene zzso with and without systemic zzso zzso In all cases, zzso were zzso and studied with zzso 4 hours after zzso administration zzso Central retinal thickness and zzso zzso channel regulation were measured from the zzso zzso 

No differences zzso in retinal thickness were noted within any arm of this zzso In rats, zzso zzso was zzso zzso to the background light intensity in the outer zzso but not in the inner zzso zzso zzso at the level of zzso activity, either acutely with zzso or chronically in zzso mice, similarly reduced zzso outer retinal zzso zzso compared with that in control zzso In zzso mice, outer retinal zzso zzso returned to normal zzso after zzso retinal zzso Inner retinal zzso was zzso zzso in zzso mice but normal in zzso or zzso treated zzso zzso 

The present data support measuring the extent of zzso zzso in the outer zzso as an zzso zzso metric of visual cycle regulation of zzso zzso channel activity in zzso
