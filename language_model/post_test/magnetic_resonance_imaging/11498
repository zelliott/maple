To determine the ability of MR imaging to detect the pathological changes occurring in zzso zzso zzso zzso and to assess its accuracy in revealing the extent of tissue zzso 

Using an zzso zzso zzso zzso were created in the zzso of 18 zzso The procedure involved three zzso In the acute phase, six animals were killed the day after performing zzso zzso with zzso energy, and two on day zzso In the zzso and chronic zzso eight rabbits underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso After performing MR imaging, two animals were sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, and 7 weeks after the zzso and zzso correlation was zzso 

In the acute phase, the zzso zzso zzso appeared at gross examination as zzso zzso areas, representing early change in the zzso necrosis seen at microscopic zzso They were zzso on zzso images, and zzso on zzso zzso zzso MR imaging showed that a thin zzso rim surrounded the central zzso zzso In the zzso phase, zzso zzso also showed extensive zzso necrosis and marked inflammation at microscopic zzso Beyond two weeks, the zzso showed gradual zzso of the zzso area, with a peripheral zzso zzso The size of zzso measured by MR imaging correlated well with the findings at gross zzso zzso 

MR imaging effectively demonstrates the zzso tissue change occurring after zzso zzso and accurately determines the extent of the target zzso
