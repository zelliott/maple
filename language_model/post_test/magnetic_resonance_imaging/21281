One important goal of cognitive zzso is to discover and explain properties common to all human zzso The traditional solution for comparing functional zzso across brains in zzso is to align each individual brain to a template brain in a Cartesian coordinate system zzso the Montreal Neurological Institute zzso However, zzso anatomical zzso leads to decreases in sensitivity zzso to detect a significant zzso when it is zzso and functional resolution zzso to discriminate zzso adjacent but functionally different neural zzso in group zzso zzso functional zzso have been previously argued to increase the sensitivity and functional resolution of zzso analyses in the presence of zzso zzso in the locations of functional zzso zzso Brett et zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2009, zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso In the current paper we zzso this dependence of sensitivity and functional resolution on functional zzso across subjects in order to illustrate the highly zzso effects of this zzso on traditional group zzso We show that analyses that use zzso functional zzso usually outperform traditional zzso methods in both sensitivity and functional resolution, even when the same total amount of data is used for each zzso We further discuss how the zzso functional zzso approach, which has traditionally only been considered in the context of zzso zzso can be extended to zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso functional zzso are particularly well suited for investigating questions of functional specialization in the zzso An zzso zzso that can perform all of the analyses described in this paper is publicly available, and the analyses can be applied retroactively to any zzso provided that multiple runs were acquired per subject, even if no explicit zzso task was zzso
