The aim of this study was to use diffusion zzso zzso zzso to define the zzso relationships of the zzso zzso anterior zzso inferior zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso and zzso radiation and to determine the positioning landmarks of these white matter zzso 

The anatomy was studied in 10 adult human brain zzso Brain zzso was performed in 10 healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso images of the white matter tracts in the zzso stem were obtained using the simple single region of interest zzso and zzso based on the anatomical zzso 

The zzso insular point is the anterior zzso of intersection of the zzso zzso and the inferior limiting zzso On the inferior limiting zzso this point is the zzso limit of the zzso radiation, and the zzso stem begins at the zzso zzso and ends at the zzso insular zzso The distance from the zzso zzso to the tip of the zzso horn is just one third the length of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso comprises the core of the anterior zzso zzso behind which the anterior zzso and the inferior zzso zzso are located, and they occupy the anterior third of the zzso zzso The inferior zzso zzso passes through the entire zzso zzso The most anterior extent of the Meyer loop is located between the anterior tip of the zzso horn and the zzso zzso Most of the zzso radiation crosses the zzso two thirds of the zzso zzso 

On the inferior limiting zzso the zzso insular point is a reliable landmark of the zzso limit of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso anterior tip of the zzso horn, and zzso insular point may be used to zzso the white matter fibers of the zzso stem in analyzing magnetic resonance imaging or during zzso
