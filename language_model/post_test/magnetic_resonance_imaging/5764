Normally, the zzso fuel is zzso but during zzso it increasingly relies on zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced in liver zzso from fatty acid zzso Although moderately raised blood zzso produced on a very high fat zzso diet have important clinical effects on the brain, including reducing seizures, zzso metabolism by the brain is still poorly zzso The aim of the present work was to assess brain zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging in the intact, living zzso To vary plasma zzso we used three dietary conditions: high zzso control diet zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso diet zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso metabolism was measured in the brain, heart, and tissue in the mouth zzso Using zzso and small animal PET imaging, we have zzso zzso an approximately zzso to zzso enhanced brain zzso of zzso on a zzso diet or during zzso This opens up an opportunity to study brain zzso metabolism in zzso
