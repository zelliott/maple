Progressive zzso zzso zzso is an early stage of zzso zzso We identified a novel zzso zzso gene zzso in a zzso family that potentially zzso zzso bridging causing protein zzso To identify early zzso changes, we performed zzso and zzso studies in 6 family members zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso including 4 zzso carriers, and in 9 unrelated zzso zzso zzso zzso of the carriers compared with controls showed significant cortical zzso in language zzso Grey matter loss was distributed mainly in frontal zzso being more prominent on the zzso zzso were located in the superior frontal zzso left inferior frontal zzso left middle frontal zzso left middle zzso zzso and left zzso zzso areas, zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso during semantic and zzso covert word generation zzso and word listening tasks zzso showed recruitment of zzso and working memory networks in the carriers indicative of functional zzso During zzso zzso in left prefrontal zzso and bilateral anterior zzso was present whereas zzso recruited zzso prefrontal and anterior zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso could be associated with early brain impairment not limited to language areas and compensated by recruitment of bilateral auxiliary cortical zzso
