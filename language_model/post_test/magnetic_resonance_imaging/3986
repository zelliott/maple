The characterization of the zzso contrast agent zzso zzso 3, 6, zzso 6, zzso zzso in various media zzso solution, protein containing solution, zzso zzso solution, and excised and zzso zzso was performed using different zzso zzso water zzso nuclear magnetic relaxation zzso profiles, zzso zzso zzso and zzso relaxation rates of labeled complex, water zzso zzso relaxation rates and chemical shifts, zzso relaxation rates and peak area of zzso zzso The higher zzso zzso of zzso in water compared with zzso is related to a shorter distance zzso between the water zzso and the zzso zzso and to a longer zzso correlation time zzso of the hydrated zzso Although the zzso stability of zzso is identical to the one of zzso its kinetic stability in solutions containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as measured by zzso relaxation rates analysis is higher than for the parent zzso zzso binds zzso to serum zzso Its interaction with human serum zzso is characterized by a zzso constant of zzso zzso as calculated from zzso and zzso relaxation rates and equilibrium zzso This zzso interaction involves the zzso zzso of human serum zzso zzso zzso of the excised and zzso rat zzso was used to monitor the zzso of zzso by the zzso where it enhances the nuclear relaxation of the zzso zzso without zzso the zzso zzso metabolism of the zzso
