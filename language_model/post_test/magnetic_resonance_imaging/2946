To correlate magnetic resonance zzso signal enhancement with zzso changes occurring during zzso and zzso in evaluation of zzso zzso in zzso 

Seven cats were subjected to 150 minutes of zzso of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 90 minutes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso weight zzso zzso 40 to 50 zzso zzso zzso MR images were acquired with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 to 50 zzso zzso as a fluorescent zzso zzso of the contrast zzso Signal zzso on the MR images and zzso activities on the zzso cardiac specimens were zzso zzso examinations by electron and light zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed on the zzso 

zzso resonance signal intensity was lower in the center zzso zzso zzso than in the periphery zzso zzso zzso of the enhanced zzso Fluorescence activities were absent in the normal zzso they were scant as zzso discrete dots in the center and numerous as specific zzso distribution in the periphery of the zzso zzso zzso and light microscopic examinations showed severely damaged zzso of the center and moderately distorted zzso of the zzso 

The center of the MR zzso area is the zzso center with severe zzso damages, which also might be an area of little or absent of blood zzso zzso the zzso area is the zzso periphery with moderate zzso zzso
