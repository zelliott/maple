To determine whether liver function zzso with zzso green zzso clearance could be estimated zzso from zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was zzso zzso consecutive patients who underwent an zzso clearance test and zzso zzso MR imaging with the same parameters as were used for a zzso examination were zzso The zzso zzso index zzso from liver volume zzso mean signal intensity of the liver on zzso zzso images with fat suppression zzso and mean signal intensity of the zzso on zzso zzso images with fat suppression zzso on zzso zzso zzso images with fat suppression obtained at 20 minutes after zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso of body zzso administration was determined with the following zzso zzso - zzso The correlation of the plasma disappearance rate of zzso zzso and various factors derived from MR imaging, including zzso iron and fat deposition in the liver and zzso and zzso volume zzso were evaluated with zzso multiple zzso zzso The difference between the ratio of the remnant zzso to the zzso of the total liver zzso and ratio of the liver remnant zzso to the total zzso zzso was evaluated in four patients who had zzso zzso of liver zzso 

zzso and zzso were the factors significantly correlated with zzso (R zzso zzso The mean value and its zzso confidence zzso were zzso and zzso to zzso respectively, for the following zzso zzso - zzso 

The liver function zzso with zzso can be estimated zzso from the signal zzso and the volumes of the liver and zzso on zzso zzso MR images, which may improve the zzso of zzso liver zzso
