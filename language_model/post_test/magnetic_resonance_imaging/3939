To analyze the association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We reviewed five cases of zzso zzso that zzso producing acute zzso zzso The surgical management and diagnostic methods used are zzso 

Five male patients ranging in age from 6 to 25 years sustained the zzso of zzso zzso which produced acute zzso zzso Four of the patients had incurred blunt head zzso All patients presented with symptoms zzso to zzso zzso The zzso features of a middle zzso zzso zzso zzso were noted on the zzso zzso scans and/or magnetic resonance images of each zzso The zzso exerted mass effect on the zzso zzso and was noted to be under significant pressure at the time of surgical intervention in each zzso Two of the five cases are unique in the zzso In one, a zzso zzso zzso zzso producing a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso the zzso zzso In the other, the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso as well as into the zzso zzso The zzso in each of the remaining three patients zzso into the zzso space zzso All patients were treated with drainage of the zzso zzso In the two patients in whom the zzso zzso were involved, both the zzso and the zzso failed to change significantly in zzso The zzso resolved completely and the zzso decreased in size considerably in the three patients without zzso zzso 

The zzso of an zzso zzso can produce a zzso zzso and zzso zzso The latter mandates emergent drainage of the zzso zzso In patients in whom the zzso zzso are not zzso by zzso zzso both the zzso and zzso resolve after zzso zzso
