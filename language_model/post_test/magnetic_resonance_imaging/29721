We developed a novel zzso technique to image immune cell location and zzso in zzso to the central nervous system zzso zzso zzso specific for cell surface markers allowed imaging of zzso T cells, zzso T cells, and zzso cells in the zzso of mice infected with zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and in mice with experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have excellent zzso zzso and good zzso relaxation properties, which makes them ideal zzso contrast zzso zzso of corresponding sections confirmed the specificity of the technique to detect immune cell types in the zzso This powerful technique has potential to image any cell with unique surface zzso Because zzso zzso similar to those used in the study are approved for human use, the in zzso zzso technique we have described could be developed for human zzso
