zzso resonance imaging zzso of the brain of fragile X patients, the most frequent form of inherited mental zzso has revealed abnormalities in the size of specific brain structures, including the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso We intended to zzso the differences observed in the patient studies in the fragile X knockout mouse model, which is a good model for the disease, zzso the human disorder in having cognitive deficits, zzso and immature zzso zzso Therefore we set up zzso of the mouse brain which allowed us to measure the size of the brain structures reported to be abnormal in human fragile X patients in the mouse zzso We did not find evidence for size zzso in various brain regions of the fragile X mouse model, but the method described may find a wide application in the study of zzso mouse models with neurological zzso
