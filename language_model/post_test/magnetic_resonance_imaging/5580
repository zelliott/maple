The aim of this study was to investigate dynamic zzso zzso zzso for the zzso measurement of zzso cancer zzso by correlation with zzso density, zzso grade, and tumor staging, and to predict the outcome of local zzso 

zzso patients with zzso cancer were examined using zzso zzso parameters obtained by zzso included peak time enhancement in the first minute zzso after contrast administration, second minute zzso third minute zzso fourth minute zzso and fifth minute zzso and the zzso zzso zzso density was identified by zzso of zzso cells using zzso zzso The zzso U test, zzso zzso analysis, zzso correlation zzso and analysis of zzso were used for statistical zzso 

zzso was seen between zzso parameters zzso and zzso slope) and zzso density zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso slope were found to have a statistically significant correlation with zzso grade zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso A significant difference was seen between groups of patients with and without local recurrence with regard to two of the zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso 

The contrast enhancement patterns on zzso are influenced by tumor zzso as reflected by elevated zzso density zzso zzso they are valuable indicators for assessing tumor zzso activity and tumor zzso in zzso zzso
