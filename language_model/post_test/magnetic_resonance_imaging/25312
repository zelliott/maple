Children with zzso SS zzso cell disease are known to suffer cognitive impairment if they have silent zzso but recent evidence suggests that patients with zzso SS zzso cell disease may be impaired even if they are free of zzso We test a hypothesis that cognitive impairment in children with zzso SS zzso cell disease is associated with low zzso and MR imaging zzso 

A cohort of 49 patients was zzso all of whom had zzso SS zzso cell disease but no history of clinical zzso The zzso zzso which are standardized and zzso were used to assess cognitive zzso Patients also underwent MR imaging examination of the brain, and zzso was measured in a subset of 45 zzso MR images were evaluated by at least two readers, and abnormal imaging findings were evaluated by at least three zzso Any zzso was sufficient to be classified as zzso with zzso defined to include zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso data were used if obtained within 3 months of zzso testing and if there were no zzso events in the patients' zzso zzso test scores were then evaluated in relation to imaging findings and zzso zzso 

Patients with imaging abnormalities had more cognitive impairment than did patients with normal imaging findings in verbal intelligence zzso zzso zzso and verbal comprehension zzso zzso Patients with low zzso had cognitive impairment shown by many performance measures, including zzso intelligence zzso zzso zzso verbal comprehension zzso zzso and freedom from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that MR imaging and zzso were independent zzso of zzso intelligence zzso 

zzso brain injury, revealed by MR imaging, is associated with cognitive zzso but our data suggest that diffuse brain injury may also contribute to zzso These findings show that impairment is zzso and suggest that chronic brain zzso is part of the zzso of zzso cell zzso
