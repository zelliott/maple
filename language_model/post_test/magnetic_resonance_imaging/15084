To explore whether zzso dynamic zzso zzso findings correlate with clinical outcome in patients who undergo surgical treatment for zzso zzso zzso 

A retrospective study of zzso in patients with zzso zzso cancer was performed after obtaining an zzso zzso We zzso our zzso from 1998 to 2012 for examinations performed for zzso zzso Two zzso in consensus outlined zzso regions of interest on zzso zzso We explored the correlation between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with time to zzso of zzso overall survival and zzso margin zzso zzso Cox zzso models were used for survival, while zzso zzso zzso was used for margin zzso 

Among 58 patients with zzso zzso who underwent zzso 36 went directly to surgery and 18 had positive zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso correlated with positive zzso No significant correlations were noted between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and overall survival or time to zzso of zzso 

zzso and zzso were significantly associated with clear zzso zzso however overall survival and time to zzso were not zzso Such information might be helpful for treatment zzso and deserves further zzso
