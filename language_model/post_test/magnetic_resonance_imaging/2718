zzso theory of attention proposes that the processing load in a relevant task determines the extent to which irrelevant zzso are zzso This theory was tested by asking participants in a study to perform linguistic tasks of low or high load while ignoring irrelevant visual motion in the periphery of the zzso Although task and zzso were zzso both functional imaging of zzso activity in cortical area zzso and zzso measures of the motion zzso showed reduced motion processing during high load in the linguistic zzso These findings fulfill the prediction that perception of irrelevant zzso depends on the relevant processing zzso
