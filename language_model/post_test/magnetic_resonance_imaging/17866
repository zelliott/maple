To evaluate the feasibility of using zzso zzso image registration software to enable three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso information on zzso location and extent, to inform the planning and conduct of focal high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso zzso 

A zzso pilot study of 26 consecutive men with a visible discrete focus on zzso zzso with positive zzso on zzso template mapping zzso who underwent focal zzso zzso zzso within a zzso Ethics zzso zzso trial zzso zzso image registration software developed in our institution was used to transfer data on the location and limits of the index zzso as defined by zzso Manual zzso of the prostate capsule and zzso confirmed zzso zzso was performed preoperatively by a zzso and zzso A zzso zzso computer model, which captures the location of the target zzso was automatically generated for each patient and registered to a zzso zzso zzso zzso volume using a small number zzso of manually defined capsule zzso During the focal zzso the zzso could add additional zzso after zzso if it was felt that the original treatment plan did not cover the zzso sufficiently with a zzso 

zzso capsule and zzso zzso was achieved in zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso time taken to register images was 6 zzso zzso Additional treatment zzso were added in 13 of 26 cases leading to a mean zzso additional treatment time of 45 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso registration is zzso efficient and can locate zzso on zzso The process has potential for improved accuracy of focal treatments, and improved diagnostic sampling strategies for prostate zzso Further work on whether zzso zzso registration impacts on efficacy is zzso
