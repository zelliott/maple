The visual world consists of zzso pictures as well as of coherent visual zzso The present study investigated neural zzso underlying the perception of zzso of visual events that zzso over zzso We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while adults watched briefly presented zzso images that were extracted from movie clips depicting coherent visual zzso The images were presented either in the coherent order as they were displayed in the movie clips or in a random zzso Relative to the random order presentation condition, zzso images presented in the coherent order generated stronger zzso in the right middle zzso cortex, the right zzso superior zzso cortex, and the right inferior zzso zzso The results provide zzso evidence for the dominance of the right zzso in zzso coherent visual zzso
