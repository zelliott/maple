Complete zzso biceps zzso zzso require prompt surgical management for optimal functional and aesthetic zzso The need exists for a valid and reliable diagnostic tool to zzso surgical zzso We hypothesized complete zzso biceps zzso zzso result in an zzso measurable zzso landmark (the distance between the zzso zzso of the elbow and the cusp of zzso descent of the biceps muscle, or the biceps zzso zzso as a result of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We established normal biceps zzso zzso values and biceps zzso ratios between dominant and zzso arms in 80 men with no history of biceps injury zzso age, 43 zzso The mean zzso standard zzso biceps zzso zzso for dominant and zzso arms was zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean biceps zzso ratio was zzso zzso zzso We measured the biceps zzso zzso and biceps zzso ratio on 29 consecutive patients presenting with a possible complete zzso biceps zzso zzso Using a diagnostic threshold of a biceps zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso or biceps zzso ratio greater than zzso the biceps zzso zzso test had a sensitivity of zzso and a diagnostic accuracy of zzso for identifying complete zzso biceps zzso zzso making it a valid and reliable tool for clinicians to identify cases requiring urgent surgical zzso
