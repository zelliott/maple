In this study, magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to define in zzso the effect of experimental functional obstruction of the zzso tube zzso on vascular zzso and the development of middle ear zzso zzso After collection of baseline data for ME pressure and zzso the right zzso zzso zzso muscle of 10 zzso monkeys was injected with zzso toxin A to induce zzso zzso The left zzso zzso zzso muscle was injected with saline in 4 zzso Right and left ME pressures and zzso were measured twice daily over a follow-up period of 36 days, and zzso scanning sessions including administration of a contrast agent, zzso zzso were repeated on days 3, 6, 11, 15, 21, 29, and 36 in 6 animals and on days 15, 21, 29, and 36 in 4 zzso Two right ears did not develop zzso 5 developed persistent zzso and 3 developed zzso that zzso No changes in zzso parameters were noted for the ears that did not develop zzso but a progressive brightening of the ME on zzso images, indicative of the development of inflammation and zzso was noted for the zzso Also, an increasing rate of transfer of the contrast agent between the vascular and ME zzso indicative of increasing vascular zzso was observed to track the zzso changes in ME zzso These results support a zzso relationship between zzso dysfunction, ME zzso increased vascular zzso and zzso media with zzso
