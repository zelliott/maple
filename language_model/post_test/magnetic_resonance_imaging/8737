Brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies on Wilson's disease zzso show lack of correlations between neurological and zzso zzso zzso follow-up reports with sequential brain zzso in patients with neurological zzso comparing different zzso of treatment are zzso 

zzso patients with neurological zzso underwent zzso and zzso brain zzso scans to evaluate the range of abnormalities and the evolution along these different zzso All patients underwent at least two zzso scans at different zzso up to 11 years after the beginning of zzso zzso findings were correlated with clinical picture, clinical severity, duration of neurological symptoms, and treatment with two different zzso Patients were divided into two groups according to zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso and zzso after the onset of severe intolerance to zzso 

zzso scans before treatment zzso in all patients, zzso intensity zzso on zzso and zzso images zzso and zzso at zzso zzso thalamus, brain zzso zzso brain cortex, and brain white zzso The most common neurological symptoms were: zzso zzso zzso zzso psychiatric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chorea, and zzso 

From the neurological point of view, there was no difference on the evolution between the group treated exclusively with zzso and the one treated with zzso Analysis of zzso scans with longer intervals after the beginning of treatment depicted a trend for zzso zzso without neurological correspondence, among patients treated with zzso zzso pattern of evolution was more favorable for the group that received exclusively zzso
