The zzso shoulder may be evaluated with various imaging zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging, each of which has advantages and zzso For optimal zzso zzso MR imaging and MR zzso are widely zzso Several factors, however, may decrease the accuracy of MR imaging in the evaluation of the zzso zzso These factors include surgical zzso of native zzso changes in the signal intensity of zzso and image degradation caused by metallic zzso To maximize the accuracy of MR imaging, the zzso must select the most appropriate pulse sequences and techniques for the given zzso structure and the suspected zzso zzso To avoid magnetic zzso artifacts at MR imaging, inversion recovery may be used instead of fat zzso and fast zzso sequences may be used instead of conventional zzso sequences or zzso zzso MR zzso is most useful for optimal zzso of the rotator zzso zzso structures, and zzso zzso To achieve accurate image zzso the zzso must be familiar with the zzso and the open surgical techniques currently used to repair internal zzso of the zzso joint, as well as with the typical imaging findings in each zzso zzso
