Recently, there has been evidence for considerable plasticity in primary sensory areas of adult zzso In this study, we asked to what extent topographical maps in human zzso areas reorganize after damage to a portion of primary visual zzso cortex, zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging signals were measured in a subject zzso with a large zzso zzso that includes most of primary visual zzso but spares the zzso zzso When zzso stimulation was present, intact zzso in the zzso zzso lobe exhibited conventional zzso zzso Several visual areas could be identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, when stimuli were restricted to the blind portion of the visual field, responses were found primarily in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso that had formerly shown normal topography now represented only the visual field around the lower vertical zzso Several possible sources for this reorganized activity are considered, including zzso connections, direct zzso projections to zzso cortex, and residual zzso from zzso near the margin of the zzso A scheme is described to explain how the reorganized signals could occur based on changes in the local neural zzso
