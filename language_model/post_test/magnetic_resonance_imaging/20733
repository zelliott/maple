zzso zzso studies of regional brain volume require reliable zzso using automated zzso and zzso However, repeated MR scanning of the same subject, even if using the same scanner and acquisition zzso does not result in identical images due to small changes in image orientation, changes in zzso zzso and magnetic field zzso These differences may lead to appreciable changes in estimates of volume for different zzso This study examined zzso reliability of automated zzso zzso for measuring several zzso regions, using both zzso and zzso comparison sessions in a group of 23 normal zzso We found that the reliability of volume measures including percent volume difference, percent volume overlap zzso zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso varied substantially across brain zzso Low reliability was observed in some structures such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso with higher reliability zzso zzso zzso for other structures such as the zzso and zzso zzso of reliability across regions were similar for automated zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with the volume of the structure, the ratio of volume to surface area for the structure, the magnitude of the zzso zzso and the method of zzso Sample size estimates for detecting changes in brain volume for a range of likely effect sizes also differed by zzso Thus, zzso research requires a careful analysis of sample size and choice of zzso method combined with a consideration of the brain zzso of interest and the magnitude of the anticipated zzso
