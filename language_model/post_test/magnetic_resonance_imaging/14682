To identify zzso and zzso anatomical landmarks on dedicated zzso spine magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to assess their zzso zzso and accuracy in predicting specific zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred dedicated zzso zzso studies were zzso zzso by two zzso zzso Ten bone and zzso landmarks were localized to the adjacent zzso zzso The true zzso zzso zzso level was subsequently determined and recorded by cross zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Six landmarks were defined in zzso zzso however, there was a low zzso percentage agreement for the defined zzso levels zzso for only one zzso The most useful landmark for defining a specific zzso level was the most superior rib zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement, zzso at a single zzso level, zzso zzso Eight landmarks localized to a specific zzso segment in only zzso of cases, with a standard zzso of zzso zzso levels and with a range which was greater than four zzso zzso 

The C2 vertebra must be identified and cross referenced to the dedicated zzso spine zzso as other zzso anatomical landmarks are unreliable in determining the correct zzso zzso zzso
