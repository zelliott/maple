A new technique, based on zzso delays alternating with zzso for tailored zzso zzso inversion zzso is presented for generating uniform contrast tags across the zzso wall even in the presence of B1 zzso The utility of this pulse was demonstrated using a surface zzso for both transmission and signal reception in phantom and animal heart tagging zzso The experimental data demonstrated uniform grid contrast over a zzso variation of B1 zzso sharp tagging profiles, and the ability to follow the cardiac wall motion through the deformation of the fine zzso tagging grid at different zzso throughout the cardiac zzso
