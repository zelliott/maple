To correlate MR exams showing zzso zzso zzso zzso beyond the zzso margin with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso extension beyond the zzso zzso has been described on previous studies as having a high index of association with zzso root zzso These previous studies were limited by a lack of exact zzso zzso We also assessed the prevalence of zzso root tears on MR examinations without zzso zzso 

A retrospective review was performed of 300 consecutive knee MR exams of patients who went on to zzso All patients had a complete MR exam performed on a zzso GE MR zzso MR exams were reviewed for zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso from the zzso zzso The exams with zzso zzso zzso were reviewed for zzso tears on MR zzso The exams without zzso zzso were reviewed for zzso root zzso zzso were subsequently correlated with zzso 

Of the 300 MR zzso 42 demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Of these 42 patients, 34 had zzso zzso complex zzso or a large zzso tear near to or involving the zzso root on MR zzso A total of 33 of these tears described on MR exam were seen at zzso A total of 24 of these tears were root tears, seven were complex tears, and two had severe zzso zzso There was one root tear described on MR exam that was not seen on zzso Eight of the 42 patients had no zzso tear demonstrated on MR examination or zzso All eight of these patients were zzso or zzso 50 years zzso There were two zzso root tears on both MR exam and at zzso in the 258 patients without zzso zzso on MR zzso 

There is a high prevalence of zzso root tears in patients with zzso zzso on MR zzso zzso root tears are uncommon in patients without zzso zzso on MR zzso There may be a subset of patients in which the zzso root is stretched rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients zzso 50 years old may be associated with a zzso zzso injury due to zzso of the zzso without a zzso tear zzso on zzso These zzso may have increased zzso due to compromised zzso collagen zzso This may zzso the patient to premature zzso
