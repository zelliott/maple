Two patients developed zzso sign after cervical spine zzso The patients were otherwise without evidence of spinal zzso zzso Both patients were studied with magnetic resonance scans of the cervical zzso The magnetic resonance scans were zzso The possible zzso of zzso sign in these patients is zzso The differential diagnosis including cervical zzso combined systems zzso multiple zzso zzso and radiation zzso is zzso These patients should be carefully evaluated zzso and zzso lateral cervical spine films as well as a complete blood count and peripheral zzso should be zzso zzso resonance scanning may have an important role in evaluating these zzso zzso resonance is exquisitely sensitive in detecting zzso therefore, we speculate that zzso zzso may be responsible for this zzso zzso magnetic resonance scanning may confirm the presence of such zzso in the zzso
