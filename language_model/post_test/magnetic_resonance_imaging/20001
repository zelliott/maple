In patients with zzso disease and zzso vertigo attacks after zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso nerve can identify residual zzso nerve zzso that could be responsible for the vertigo zzso 

To test if zzso of the zzso nerve can corroborate the presence of residual zzso nerve zzso in patients with zzso vertigo attacks and residual zzso function after zzso 

zzso nerve zzso of seven zzso unilateral zzso patients were zzso using zzso zzso zzso with steady state free zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images zzso to the zzso nerve axis in internal auditory canal were compared on the zzso and intact zzso zzso function was assessed with caloric tests, three-dimensional head impulse tests and zzso evoked zzso zzso Of the seven patients only one was zzso zzso free of zzso six had continued to experience vertigo attacks, albeit not as long or as severe as before zzso 

On the zzso side, zzso showed intact facial and cochlear nerves in all seven zzso In the six symptomatic patients, although superior and inferior zzso nerve bulk and signal were reduced, residual bulk suggestive of inferior zzso nerve was zzso zzso with evidence of residual zzso canal function on impulsive testing in all six symptomatic zzso In the zzso patient, superior and inferior zzso nerves were absent on zzso and impulsive testing revealed no residual zzso canal zzso
