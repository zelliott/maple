zzso protein zzso 8 and zzso two members of the zzso family expressed in zzso cells, have been ascribed some zzso functions, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso proteins lack structural requirements for zzso via the classical zzso zzso route, the process of zzso is zzso We now demonstrate the specific, zzso release of zzso and zzso by human zzso after zzso of protein zzso zzso This zzso process is not blocked by zzso of zzso traffic through the zzso zzso and zzso and comparative studies on tumor necrosis zzso and zzso indicate that zzso and zzso follow neither the classical nor the zzso alternative route of zzso zzso by zzso agents revealed that zzso zzso requires an intact zzso zzso zzso upon initiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso of both proteins with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is associated with zzso of their de zzso zzso suggesting that zzso signaling via zzso is restricted to distinct differentiation stages of zzso Our data provide evidence that the zzso proteins zzso and zzso are zzso after zzso of protein zzso C via a novel zzso requiring an intact zzso zzso
