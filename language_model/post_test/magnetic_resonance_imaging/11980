We describe methods for simultaneously acquiring and subsequently combining data from a multitude of closely positioned zzso receiving zzso The approach is zzso similar to phased array radar and ultrasound and hence we call our techniques the zzso phased zzso The zzso phased array offers the zzso ratio zzso and resolution of a small surface zzso over zzso zzso normally associated with body imaging with no increase in imaging zzso The zzso phased array can be applied to both imaging and zzso for all pulse zzso The problematic interactions among nearby surface coils is eliminated zzso by overlapping adjacent coils to give zero mutual zzso hence zero interaction, and zzso by attaching low input zzso zzso to all zzso thus eliminating interference among next nearest and more distant zzso We derive an zzso for combining the data from the phased array elements to yield an image with optimum zzso Other techniques which are easier to implement at the cost of lower zzso are zzso zzso array imaging is demonstrated with high resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images of the zzso and zzso zzso Data were acquired from zzso linear spine zzso the first made of zzso square coils and the second made of zzso square zzso When compared with images from a single 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso and identical imaging zzso the phased array yields a zzso and zzso higher zzso at the depth of the spine zzso 7 zzso
