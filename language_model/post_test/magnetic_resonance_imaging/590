A conservative treatment strategy is often proposed as a primary treatment option in the management of zzso zzso zzso In this zzso and zzso policy, zzso symptoms are monitored regularly, and VS growth is measured on consecutive magnetic resonance images zzso The aim of this study is validation of two-dimensional versus volume zzso assessment in the zzso follow-up of VS and to define tumor growth beyond measurement zzso 

zzso scans of 68 consecutive patients with VS were analyzed zzso zzso and volume zzso on contrast enhanced zzso zzso and zzso images were performed independently by two zzso zzso zzso differences zzso were zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso were determined for both assessment zzso 

zzso and volume zzso both showed best zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso for differences relative to baseline zzso zzso zzso for two-dimensional zzso had a higher zzso error compared to volume zzso zzso versus zzso which decreases when tumor size zzso The zzso for two-dimensional zzso in three directions was zzso zzso and zzso and for volume zzso zzso 

Volume zzso are more accurate compared to two-dimensional zzso for the evaluation of VS zzso These zzso are assessed preferably on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly depends on VS zzso zzso between consecutive scans exceeds the common clinical applied criterion of 1 or 2 zzso growth to define zzso
