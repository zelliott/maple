Four studies have found a smaller zzso volume in patients with borderline personality disorder zzso relative to controls, whereas four other studies have found similar zzso volume in zzso patients relative to zzso This study aims to compare zzso volumes of zzso patients with controls, and also to compare zzso patients with and without post-traumatic stress disorder zzso with controls in order to determine whether zzso can explain the zzso of zzso 

zzso review and zzso of magnetic resonance imaging studies that measured zzso volumes in zzso patients and healthy zzso 

A significant reduction of zzso volumes in zzso patients was confirmed zzso zzso zzso However, data from the studies that zzso zzso patients with and without zzso indicated that zzso volumes were significantly smaller in zzso patients without zzso relative to controls zzso p zzso zzso right: p zzso zzso but not in zzso patients with zzso relative to controls zzso p zzso zzso right: p zzso zzso 

This zzso suggests that zzso volumes are reduced in patients with zzso This pattern is confirmed in zzso patients without zzso but not in zzso patients with zzso raising the possibility that reduced zzso volume in zzso patients cannot be explained by zzso zzso
