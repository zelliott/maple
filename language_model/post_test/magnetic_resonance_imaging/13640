We frequently observed a zzso zzso at the inferior zzso margin of Hoffa's fat pad of the knee and sought to establish the zzso and differential diagnostic criteria of this zzso In total, 133 zzso studies and 35 zzso specimens were analyzed for the location, size, and shape of zzso at the inferior zzso margin of Hoffa's fat zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso zzso on MR images was zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso was located just below the zzso of the zzso zzso fold zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso More zzso zzso at the zzso margin were visible in all patients and zzso due to the horizontal course of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso within the inferior zzso margin of Hoffa's fat pad has to be expected in more than zzso of knee studies and should not be confused with tumors like zzso zzso We term this zzso the zzso zzso One hypothesis of its origin concerns the zzso zzso process of the zzso membrane into the zzso zzso zzso It should not be confused with linear zzso due to the zzso zzso
