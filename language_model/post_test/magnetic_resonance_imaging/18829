To assess the efficacy and safety of zzso zzso in children during magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The patients were 105 zzso children, mean weight 13 zzso 10 zzso and mean age zzso years zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of whom were under 3 months zzso zzso was gradual with zzso zzso in a mixture of nitrous oxide and zzso followed by maintenance with zzso zzso in the same mixture through a face mask or zzso tubes while the patient zzso zzso All procedures were performed zzso Ten minutes after zzso zzso of the patients were fully zzso None suffered prolonged sedation and no serious complications occurred during the study zzso The most common side effects were transient decreases in oxygen zzso in 15 patients zzso although none reached the critical level zzso zzso zzso Six of those patients were under 3 months zzso After recovering from zzso 13 patients zzso suffered transient episodes of excessive zzso usually 5 minutes after zzso Five patients zzso zzso in the recovery zzso 

This study indicates that zzso is safe and effective for zzso children, including newborn zzso who must undergo magnetic resonance zzso
