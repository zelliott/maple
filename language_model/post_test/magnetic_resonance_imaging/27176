To determine the ability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso to characterize the stability of zzso zzso zzso fragments in zzso 

zzso consecutive patients underwent surgery for zzso between 2004 and zzso Of these, 23 patients had adequate zzso zzso There were 14 boys and 9 girls with a mean age of zzso zzso Of the 23 zzso 21 were located in the knee and 2 were located in the zzso On the basis of zzso a single zzso zzso indicated the presence or absence of 4 established magnetic resonance signs of instability, zzso classified each zzso according to a staging system for zzso stability, and zzso described the zzso as stable or zzso These findings were compared with the zzso zzso zzso was considered the gold standard for diagnosing zzso zzso 

Of the zzso zzso 13 were found to be stable and 10 were found to be zzso The final zzso impression was unstable in 21 patients and stable in 2 zzso This yielded a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for diagnosing zzso zzso When 2 or more criteria were present, the specificity of zzso to zzso zzso instability improved to zzso The sensitivity, however, dropped to zzso zzso between zzso stage and zzso stage was zzso (7 of zzso 

zzso predicted 21 of 23 zzso to be zzso whereas zzso found only 10 of these 23 zzso to be zzso The most common pattern of zzso findings involved zzso with an area of high signal intensity at the zzso zzso zzso should not be used in isolation to determine zzso instability in young patients with juvenile zzso
