To estimate cerebral blood zzso in areas of strong magnetic zzso changes with high spatial and zzso resolution using a zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso zzso spin labeling zzso zzso 

We implemented an zzso method that is capable of imaging zzso in areas of high magnetic zzso changes by combining a FAIR spin preparation with a true fast imaging in steady zzso zzso data acquisition zzso A zzso zzso sequence was applied especially in regions with magnetic field zzso and compared with corresponding FAIR zzso obtained with a standard zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained at zzso zzso zzso from eight healthy volunteers zzso years old) and one patient zzso years zzso zzso zzso images were compared with FAIR zzso zzso zzso zzso which are necessary for quantitative zzso zzso were obtained with inversion recovery zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, high-resolution zzso zzso were performed on four volunteers at zzso 

The two zzso zzso imaging zzso yielded comparable diagnostic image quality in brain areas with low zzso differences at zzso zzso zzso of gray matter zzso areas was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso at zzso Higher zzso values at zzso were due to more pronounced zzso effects from fast moving spins at lower spatial zzso The zzso sequence showed no significant zzso and markedly reduced signal void artifacts in areas of high zzso changes zzso near zzso transitions and close to metallic zzso compared to zzso At zzso highly resolved zzso zzso images were acquired with an zzso resolution of up to zzso zzso 

zzso allows for assessment of cerebral zzso in areas of critically high zzso changes with conventional zzso zzso
