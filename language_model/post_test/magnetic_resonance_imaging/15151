Studies of patients with acute zzso zzso zzso suggest that anterior zzso zzso are associated with greater left zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso It is unclear whether this relation also exists in long-term survivors of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore the relation between zzso zzso size, zzso zzso and degree of long-term zzso zzso in patients with healed zzso zzso were recruited from a registry of patients with healed zzso who participated in the zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess zzso mass, volumes, zzso ejection zzso and zzso zzso adjusting for zzso zzso zzso patients zzso age 69 zzso 10 years mean ejection fraction 49 zzso zzso were studied zzso zzso zzso years after zzso zzso zzso was found in 19 patients and zzso zzso in 33, whereas 5 patients did not show zzso zzso zzso zzso was evident in 36 zzso In the 52 patients with scar, average total zzso size was 13 zzso zzso of total zzso zzso There was a strong linear relation between zzso size and zzso zzso volume index zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso volume index zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso p zzso In zzso analysis, zzso size was the strongest independent predictor of ejection fraction and zzso volumes independently of zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, in the studied zzso there was a linear relation between zzso size and ejection fraction and zzso zzso This relation was independent of zzso location and zzso
