zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causing a zzso zzso of the oxygen zzso curve zzso and tissue zzso The activity of zzso C zzso is enhanced by zzso In this phase II study, 17 patients with zzso zzso cancer resistant to zzso zzso received zzso and zzso zzso was given as a zzso loading dose of 45 zzso zzso over 1 zzso followed by a maintenance infusion of 4 zzso zzso zzso for 5 zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso was administered over 15 zzso immediately after the zzso zzso The 15 zzso patients had progressive disease after a median of 2 zzso zzso cycles of zzso zzso zzso 3 and 5 h after the zzso zzso dose showed a fast moving band consistent with the zzso complex, accounting for approximately 50% of total zzso The zzso zzso and vein zzso mild and did not exceed zzso grade zzso Liver zzso magnetic resonance zzso of patients with zzso zzso showed no changes consistent with tissue zzso The principle of combining a zzso activated drug with an agent that increases tissue zzso is clinically zzso producing an effect equivalent to reducing zzso oxygen delivery by at least zzso However, zzso in combination with zzso for zzso zzso cancer is not an effective zzso This could be related to drug resistance rather than a failure to enhance zzso
