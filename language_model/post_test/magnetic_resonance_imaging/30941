This paper presents our experience in the evaluation of 23 potential living liver donors examined from January 2001 to December zzso 

Between January 2001 and December 2002, a total of 23 potential living liver donors were evaluated (20 men, 3 zzso mean age 30 zzso with zzso and zzso zzso reconstructions zzso and Thin zzso and zzso evaluation of liver zzso zzso and of the right zzso lobe to be harvested were obtained with zzso MR was performed with zzso and zzso GE acquisitions in order to detect liver zzso and with zzso zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisitions to obtain MR zzso MR zzso was also obtained with zzso zzso 90 zzso zzso GE thin zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten potential living liver donors also underwent zzso 

The zzso examinations demonstrated abnormalities of the portal vein zzso in zzso potential living liver donors, zzso of the zzso anatomy in zzso and abnormalities of the zzso anatomy in zzso One case showed gallbladder zzso The MR examinations led to the exclusion from the transplantation of one potential living liver donor zzso to the detection of liver zzso that was subsequently confirmed by zzso zzso potential living liver donors were considered eligible for the surgical procedure and underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The diagnostic protocols used at our zzso provide the zzso with important information and an exhaustive picture of the zzso anatomy to evaluate the inclusion of potential living liver donors in the transplantation zzso
