The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of pulmonary zzso inequality on differential zzso of the lungs in zzso of zzso zzso after zzso 

zzso of lung zzso is one of the best zzso of outcome in zzso after zzso A recent zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso study found prominent zzso inequality between the bilateral pulmonary arteries in zzso after zzso 

zzso zzso zzso patients zzso age zzso 51 months, 31 zzso received zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same zzso We took zzso zzso of forward flow volume zzso backward flow volume zzso and net flow volume zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso and zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso at the left and right pulmonary arteries zzso and zzso The differential zzso of the left lung zzso zzso zzso left zzso + right zzso as calculated by zzso ratio, by zzso ratio of zzso and by zzso were zzso 

The zzso between zzso by zzso versus zzso by zzso was affected by the severity of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso agreement between zzso by zzso versus zzso by zzso was good zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso if zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso and underestimated the zzso zzso of error zzso zzso range zzso zzso to zzso if zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, agreement between zzso by zzso versus zzso by zzso was high and unaffected by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

While zzso zzso of pulmonary artery as a comprehensive zzso evaluation of zzso after repair, conventional zzso ratio method tended to underestimate the left lung zzso and may lead to unnecessary zzso The zzso ratio method should be used for precise assessment of differential lung zzso
