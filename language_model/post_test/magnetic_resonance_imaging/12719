The purpose of this study was to correlate total zzso volume zzso calculations, obtained through the zzso method and zzso formula with various physical zzso 

zzso reports and physical examination from 210 healthy kidney donors zzso zzso on whom zzso volumes were obtained using the zzso method, were zzso zzso These values along with ones obtained through a more traditional method zzso zzso were correlated with subject zzso body weight, body mass index zzso and zzso 

zzso correlated strongly with body weight zzso and to a lesser degree with zzso age, or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The left kidney volume was greater than the right, on average zzso The zzso formula method zzso zzso volume by zzso on average which was significant zzso 

Body weight was the physical characteristic which demonstrated the strongest correlation with zzso volume in healthy zzso Given this finding, a formula was derived for zzso the zzso for a given patient based on the his or her zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso weight zzso + zzso
