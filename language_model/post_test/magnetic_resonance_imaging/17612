The present study was aimed to evaluate the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in characterization of solid zzso masses zzso by zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso in patients with suspected or known zzso 

zzso solid zzso masses (20 unilateral and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated in 24 zzso The results were correlated with zzso in 15 patients, and clinical follow-up and conventional imaging in all zzso 

Of the 28 solid zzso masses, 10 were primary zzso zzso one zzso and 18 were zzso zzso zzso zzso accurately depicted 23 of 27 zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the 10 primary zzso tumors, zzso was true positive in eight of nine zzso true negative in one and false negative in zzso The maximum and average standardized zzso values zzso for zzso positive primary zzso zzso tumors were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to the characterization of primary tumors, zzso was valuable in primary staging and altered treatment in zzso of patients (three of zzso Of the 18 zzso zzso masses, zzso was positive in 15 zzso zzso The maximum and average zzso of zzso zzso masses were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in maximum and average zzso between primary and zzso zzso masses zzso and zzso 

Despite the zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso can be employed effectively in characterization of solid zzso masses in patients with suspected or known zzso We propose that zzso could be useful as a complimentary zzso to conventional imaging in these zzso
