Early diagnosis of cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is difficult because of zzso and variable clinical zzso zzso we evaluated the diagnostic value of zzso color-coded duplex zzso zzso after administration of an zzso agent zzso in clinically suspected zzso 

We examined 14 patients (6 men, 8 zzso mean age, 48 years; range, 18 to 70 zzso with signs and symptoms suggestive of cerebral zzso zzso signals from the zzso zzso zzso were displayed zzso before and after injections of an zzso agent by zzso zzso findings were correlated with zzso and MR zzso zzso 

Before zzso enhancement, zzso displayed color zzso signals in 7 of 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained sufficient color signals in 27 of 28 zzso zzso Thus, diagnostic confidence was achieved in all but 1 zzso In 13 patients, zzso identified 3 cases with symmetrical blood flow in the zzso zzso which was confirmed by zzso zzso asymmetry of zzso blood flow was correctly assessed by zzso in the other 10 zzso In 6 of these 10 patients, zzso demonstrated residual color flow signals, which on zzso corresponded to partial zzso (4 zzso and to zzso (1 zzso of the zzso zzso One case of complete zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was missed by zzso because of color zzso signals originating from an adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso of a zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso in all cases zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1; complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peak flow zzso were significantly decreased in zzso or partially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with respect to patients with symmetrical appearance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso examination of the cerebral zzso system is difficult without contrast media application and almost useless for the study of zzso However, zzso is of practical value in the initial zzso of patients with clinically suspected zzso and may provide further insight for follow-up studies in view of monitoring the zzso
