Patients with Alzheimer's disease have higher plasma homocysteine levels than controls, but it is uncertain whether higher plasma homocysteine levels are involved in the early zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and global brain zzso on brain zzso have been proposed as early markers of Alzheimer's zzso In the Rotterdam zzso zzso a zzso study of age-related brain changes in zzso zzso people aged zzso years, we investigated the association between plasma homocysteine levels and severity of zzso zzso and global brain zzso on zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to zzso global cortical brain zzso zzso zzso range zzso and a zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso zzso spin zzso sequence in zzso participants to measure zzso and zzso zzso We had zzso plasma homocysteine levels in zzso of the participants and in zzso of the participants with zzso and zzso zzso zzso with higher plasma homocysteine levels had, on average, more cortical zzso zzso units zzso zzso zzso zzso per standard zzso increase in plasma homocysteine zzso and more zzso zzso zzso in left zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and in right zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso per standard zzso increase in plasma homocysteine zzso No association was observed between plasma homocysteine levels and zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that higher plasma homocysteine levels are associated with more zzso of the zzso and cortical regions in elderly at risk of Alzheimer's zzso
