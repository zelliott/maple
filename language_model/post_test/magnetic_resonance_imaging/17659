The aim of the present study was to zzso compare provocative zzso and zzso zzso zzso of idiopathic zzso discs zzso results to each other, to clinical zzso and to zzso zzso By this the value of both diagnostic features should be critically zzso 

31 zzso zzso zzso zzso of 26 patients were analyzed for surgery decision making by combined zzso procedure in an open zzso at zzso A correlation analysis was performed between the Dallas zzso zzso pain discrimination score zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction by zzso 3, 60 zzso after zzso presence of zzso changes or high intensity zones zzso patient sex and age, intervention level, injection pressure and zzso zzso analysis zzso 

zzso pain could be evoked in zzso of the zzso whereas zzso was positive in zzso zzso age, sex, Dallas I, Dallas II, and zzso scores, as well as the presence of zzso did not correlate to zzso or zzso zzso zzso correlated positively to zzso zzso Further positive correlation was found between zzso and intervention zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as between zzso and zzso zzso 

We suggest zzso to be an additional tool for surgery decision making in patients with zzso because it zzso to zzso pain evoked by provocative zzso as well as to presence of zzso zzso Additionally, assessment of a release instead of provocation of pain can be of zzso
