The developing brain responds to the environment by using statistical correlations in input to guide functional and structural zzso is, the brain displays zzso Experience shapes brain development throughout life, but zzso is variable from one brain system to zzso How does the early loss of a sensory zzso affect this complex zzso We examined zzso zzso in zzso defined zzso of zzso zzso the site of human primary auditory cortex, in zzso deaf humans by measuring the zzso signal change in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the deaf zzso zzso signal change was greater for zzso and zzso stimuli than that of hearing zzso Visual responses in zzso zzso larger in deaf than hearing, were smaller than those zzso by zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso visual signal was comparable to zzso zzso In addition, deaf adults perceived zzso stimuli zzso in contrast to hearing adults, they were susceptible to a zzso visual illusion induced by two touches to the zzso zzso and zzso signal change in zzso zzso zzso predicted the strength of the visual illusion in the deaf adults in line with the interpretation that the illusion is a functional consequence of the altered zzso organization observed in deaf auditory zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso and profound deafness alters how vision and zzso are processed in primary auditory zzso
