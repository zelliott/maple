zzso is associated with subtle eye movement and brain structural zzso but the extent to which these abnormalities occur in the same individuals is zzso The relationship between quantitative measures of eye movement task performance zzso pursuit and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso brain volume, prefrontal region, lateral zzso third zzso zzso and zzso was assessed in 70 patients with schizophrenia or zzso disorder, 105 of their unaffected first-degree relatives and 68 zzso There was a lack of correlation between eye movement and zzso abnormalities suggesting largely zzso zzso pathways underlying the zzso and the eye movement zzso that have previously been identified in these zzso However, in the total sample, smaller prefrontal lobe volume was significantly associated with longer zzso of correct zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso in line with previous studies demonstrating the importance of frontal lobe structures in performance of the zzso zzso Also larger third zzso volume was associated with larger mean zzso of intrusive zzso during smooth pursuit zzso zzso There were no significant zzso differences in the relationship between measures of eye movement and zzso
