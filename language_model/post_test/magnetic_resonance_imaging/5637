To assess the value of magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso in evaluating the zzso viability in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso was performed in 51 patients with zzso zzso using a zzso T MR zzso All the patients were examined using zzso zzso sequence during the zzso and delayed phase zzso zzso after injection of zzso zzso zzso at the rate of 4 zzso The short axis images were acquired during the zzso and both the short axis and long axis images were obtained during the delayed zzso The left zzso wall on the zzso slice was divided into 8 zzso A zzso study of the results of the rest and stress zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out in 21 zzso 

In the 51 patients with zzso zzso zzso showed zzso during the zzso imaging and zzso had delayed zzso In the 21 patients receiving zzso 48 zzso segments was detected among the zzso segments scanned by zzso and zzso showed delayed zzso in all the zzso zzso Of the 120 viable segments detected by rest and stress zzso zzso 97 segments zzso were found to be free of delayed zzso by zzso With the rest and stress zzso zzso as the reference, the sensitivity and the specificity of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso allows effective identification of the zzso viability and zzso as well as the severity and extent of the zzso zzso
