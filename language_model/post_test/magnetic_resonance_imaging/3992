Studies using magnetic resonance zzso imaging have provided strong evidence that patients with schizophrenia as a group have structural brain zzso including enlarged zzso and zzso as well as smaller cortical gray matter zzso This study was undertaken to investigate whether the brain abnormalities found in schizophrenia could be distinguished from those seen in bipolar zzso The MR scans of 23 patients with schizophrenia were compared to those of 17 healthy community volunteers and 14 patients with bipolar zzso Images were processed using computer-based image processing techniques to generate quantitative measures of zzso fluid zzso gray matter and white matter zzso Compared to the community volunteers, the schizophrenia group had larger total zzso volumes while the bipolar group had larger zzso Smaller cortical gray matter volumes were found in the schizophrenia group, but not in the bipolar zzso The schizophrenia group had regional deficits in gray matter volumes in comparison with both the community volunteers and the bipolar zzso These findings suggest that the brain tissue abnormalities found in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may be distinguishable using MR zzso
