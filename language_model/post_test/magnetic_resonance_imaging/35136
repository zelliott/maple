Many patients report feeling functional ankle instability, despite having no clinically zzso lateral zzso 

Some patients who experience functional instability of the ankle have substantial abnormalities of the anterior zzso ligament despite having apparently normal lateral zzso in clinical zzso 

Case series; Level of evidence, zzso 

Fourteen patients who had functional ankle instability after zzso despite having no clinically zzso lateral instability, were included in this zzso All subjects underwent standard stress zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and ankle zzso These patients were treated with anatomical reconstruction of the anterior zzso zzso 

zzso assessment revealed 3 cases with no zzso structure with zzso zzso 9 cases with partial ligament tears and zzso tissue on the disrupted anterior zzso ligament zzso and 2 cases of abnormal course of the ligament at the zzso or zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed the zzso 5 cases of zzso of the anterior zzso zzso 2 cases of narrowing of the anterior zzso zzso 4 cases of high-intensity zzso in the anterior zzso zzso and 3 normal zzso The mean American zzso Foot and zzso Society zzso zzso scale score was zzso zzso zzso points at zzso and zzso zzso zzso points 2 years after zzso
