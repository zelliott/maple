Reduction of zzso signal fluctuations and imaging artifacts is important for zzso zzso The imaging artifacts caused by zzso cardiac zzso and gross head motion and the suppression of these artifacts have been studied for many zzso However, the artifacts caused by eye movement and their effects on zzso mapping are not well zzso It is demonstrated in this report that zzso eye movements during resting conditions can cause substantial signal fluctuations in the zzso direction even for a fast zzso imaging zzso An zzso slab zzso technique is proposed for zzso the zzso of eyes and suppressing the artifacts from eye movements with minimal signal loss of other brain zzso The results show that the technique significantly reduces signal fluctuations and improves zzso reliability for mapping functional zzso in the human zzso
