zzso zzso of zzso zzso by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso are made in a model porous system before and after a biologically zzso zzso zzso Traditional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was unable to detect the small scale changes in pore structure zzso during light zzso analysis after destructive sampling of the porous zzso However, pulse zzso spin echo nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso clearly indicated a change in zzso including increased pore scale zzso These changes were detected through zzso measurement of the zzso by zzso zzso The dynamics indicate an increased pore scale mixing which alters the zzso approach to zzso zzso dynamics governed by the zzso diffusion zzso The methods described here can be used in the future to directly measure the transport of zzso in zzso porous media and contribute towards zzso transport models, which take into account the influence of pore scale changes in zzso
