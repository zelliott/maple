zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso disorder characterized by absence of skin and adjacent tissue that usually affects the zzso but any part of the body may be zzso Although zzso is more often superficial and small, it can be large and involve the underlying structures such as skull and zzso thus increasing the risk of zzso infection, and zzso zzso exists regarding zzso versus surgical intervention for this zzso This study reviews indications and zzso for treatment of this rare zzso zzso 

Management of this anomaly depends on size, location, and structures at zzso Small zzso with intact underlying structures and zzso affecting zzso are treated in a conservative fashion with zzso and zzso followed by delayed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso often requires complex tissue zzso tissue expansion, or skin zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso with exposure of vital structures require early surgical zzso Initially, exposed vital structures and zzso zzso can be protected using conservative zzso Delayed definitive repair can then be performed using scalp zzso split- and zzso skin zzso cultured zzso zzso delayed split rib zzso tissue expansion, and composite zzso 

zzso zzso zzso should be individually evaluated based on size, depth, location, and zzso zzso Using conservative and surgical zzso one can achieve complete closure of the zzso thus avoiding risks of infection, zzso and further zzso
