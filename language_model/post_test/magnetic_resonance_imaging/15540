While zzso is used most frequently to assess right zzso zzso function in clinical practice, zzso is limited in its ability to provide an accurate measure of RV ejection fraction zzso zzso quantitative zzso of RV function has proven difficult in clinical zzso 

We sought to determine which commonly used zzso measures of RV function were most accurate in comparison with an zzso estimate of zzso 

We analyzed RV function in 36 patients who had cardiac zzso studies and zzso within a 24 hour zzso zzso parameters of RV zzso zzso fractional area change zzso zzso zzso motion zzso and zzso fractional zzso zzso were obtained from the zzso zzso RV volumes and zzso were derived from zzso reconstruction based on zzso tracing of the RV chamber from the short axis zzso zzso assessment of RV function was correlated with zzso zzso 

zzso measured by zzso correlated best with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly correlated with zzso 

zzso is the best of commonly zzso zzso zzso measure of RV function and correlated best with zzso RV ejection zzso 

While zzso is used most frequently to assess RV function in clinical practice, zzso is limited in its ability to provide an accurate measure of RV ejection fraction zzso Using cardiac zzso RV fractional area change zzso determined either by zzso or zzso was found to correlate best with zzso zzso
