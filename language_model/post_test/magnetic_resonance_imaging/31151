Despite the fact that classic studies on zzso of the hip have shown the periphery of the hip to be prone to zzso it was not until recently that an abnormal zzso zzso has been associated with zzso This study was designed to determine whether magnetic resonance zzso can show differences in disorders of the zzso zzso size, zzso zzso expected in symptomatic patients with zzso zzso of the hip and anterior zzso zzso Fourteen patients in each group were evaluated preoperatively not only clinically but also with conventional zzso and magnetic resonance zzso In both conditions, disorders of the zzso localized zzso with a zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tears were observed in nine hips of each zzso The zzso was enlarged in 12 hips with zzso but in none of the hips with zzso zzso formation in the zzso area was seen in 10 hips with zzso and three hips with zzso These findings provide evidence that the zzso zzso represents the initial fatiguing site of the hip under both zzso Based on these data, the size of the zzso and the presence of soft tissue zzso seem to be good zzso for the presence of zzso zzso whereas the presence of tears did not differentiate between zzso The capability of magnetic resonance zzso to show these differences in zzso disorders suggests this method is a helpful diagnostic tool that can aid in defining the most appropriate treatment zzso
