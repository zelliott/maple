A novel linear zzso for the variable flip angle method for zzso relaxation time zzso zzso from zzso steady state zzso is derived from the half angle zzso zzso zzso of the flip zzso zzso the signal S at coordinates zzso and zzso respectively, establishes a line that renders signal zzso and relaxation term separately as zzso and zzso This representation allows for zzso of the respective zzso from the experimental zzso A comprehensive analysis of noise propagation is zzso zzso results for efficient zzso of zzso relaxation time and zzso density mapping experiments are zzso zzso zzso allows for a linear presentation of data that are acquired at different short pulse repetition times, zzso zzso zzso thus increasing flexibility in the data acquisition by removing the limitation of a single pulse repetition zzso Signal bias, like due to zzso zzso or imperfect zzso can be readily identified by systematic zzso from the linear zzso The method is illustrated and validated by zzso experiments on zzso and human zzso
