zzso zzso zzso is a zzso contrast agent that provides zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Using this contrast medium combined with a zzso zzso echo enhanced sequence provides functional imaging of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained after the usual zzso study of the zzso ducts using heavily zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso long and SS zzso zzso zzso zzso This method can detect many zzso duct zzso zzso leakage in the zzso context, mapping of zzso ducts and the gallbladder in the search for anatomical zzso analysis of zzso or zzso zzso or a dynamic study of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso ducts has only been possible until now with invasive tests aggravated by a certain zzso rate and their functional study using zzso zzso limited by mediocre spatial zzso This new possibility provides access not only to zzso imaging, but also to functional imaging with excellent spatial zzso
