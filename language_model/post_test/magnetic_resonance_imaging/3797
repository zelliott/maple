The goal of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of whole body X-ray zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in staging and response assessment of multiple zzso 

We performed a systematic review of studies comparing zzso zzso PET with zzso and/or magnetic resonance imaging in terms of sensitivity for zzso bone disease at staging and during zzso 

zzso studies involving zzso patients met the inclusion zzso The mean Quality Assessment of zzso zzso Studies zzso score, expressed as a percentage of the maximum score, was zzso In 7 studies zzso zzso 242 zzso zzso assessment between zzso and zzso zzso PET scan was possible, showing a higher sensitivity of the zzso zzso PET in the detection of myeloma bone zzso in 6 zzso The only study reporting on the zzso value of zzso zzso PET at staging found that the number of zzso focal zzso was an independent zzso zzso In addition, the limited studies on response monitoring showed that zzso of zzso zzso PET during treatment correlated with a superior clinical zzso 

In general, zzso zzso PET has a superior sensitivity for myeloma bone zzso compared with zzso Future studies have to validate the additive value of zzso bone disease detected on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in predicting zzso Response monitoring with the use of zzso zzso zzso during treatment is promising, allowing more precise prediction of prognosis compared with the standard response zzso In view of the expanding treatment options for multiple zzso this may provide important information for treatment decisions in the zzso
