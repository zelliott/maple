The chemical shift phenomenon refers to the signal intensity zzso seen in magnetic resonance zzso imaging that result from the inherent differences in the resonant zzso of zzso zzso Chemical shift was first recognized as a zzso artifact of image zzso More recently, however, chemical shift has been recognized as a useful diagnostic zzso By exploiting inherent differences in resonant zzso of zzso and water, fatty elements within tissue can be confirmed with dedicated chemical shift MR pulse zzso zzso the recognition of chemical shift on images obtained with standard MR pulse sequences may corroborate the diagnosis of zzso with substantial fatty zzso Chemical shift can aid in the diagnosis of zzso zzso of the brain zzso zzso and zzso or the body zzso zzso focal fat within the liver, and zzso In addition, chemical shift can be implemented to accentuate visceral margins zzso kidney and zzso
