The zzso of zzso cells zzso from peripheral zzso is critical for the establishment of T zzso immune responses or zzso because the physical interaction of zzso with zzso T cells takes place in the T cell areas of zzso zzso The zzso release of the high mobility group box 1 zzso nuclear protein by zzso controls the outcome of the zzso cell interaction, influencing the zzso polarization of zzso T zzso We zzso present evidence that the zzso for advanced zzso end products zzso a zzso member of the zzso zzso of zzso molecules that acts as a zzso for zzso plays a zzso role in DC zzso to zzso zzso We used zzso imaging by magnetic resonance and zzso to track zzso after zzso injection in the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso effectively migrated in both zzso In contrast, zzso zzso failed to reach the draining zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso mice, indicating that the integrity of zzso is required for DC zzso Thus the zzso zzso is a checkpoint in DC maturation and function and a candidate for targeted zzso
