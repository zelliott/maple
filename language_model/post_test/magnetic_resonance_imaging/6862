zzso syndrome is associated with zzso deletions of zzso zzso mild to borderline learning zzso characteristic zzso and a high prevalence of zzso The biological basis for this increased risk for schizophrenia is unknown, but people with zzso syndrome may have genetically determined differences in brain anatomy that zzso to the development of zzso 

To determine whether there are differences in brain structure between subjects with zzso syndrome with and without zzso 

A zzso quantitative structural magnetic resonance imaging study in 39 adult zzso 

zzso were made through medical zzso clinics and psychiatric services throughout the United zzso 

Thirteen subjects with zzso syndrome and zzso 12 with zzso syndrome without history of a zzso and 14 healthy controls volunteered to participate after screening for zzso 

Total and regional brain volumes were analyzed by means of manual zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were obtained by computerized zzso zzso 

People with zzso syndrome and zzso compared with both controls and zzso patients with zzso syndrome, had a significant zzso reduction in volume of zzso zzso + zzso matter and zzso white matter, and an increase in total and zzso zzso fluid zzso Both zzso syndrome groups had a reduced zzso volume compared with zzso 

Within zzso syndrome, schizophrenia is associated with generalized differences in brain zzso but white matter may be particularly zzso Studies with larger samples are needed to replicate our zzso
