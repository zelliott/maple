The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although initially designed for reversal of zzso zzso in fetuses with zzso zzso zzso zzso has been adapted to treat a variety of fetal zzso 

A retrospective chart review of all consecutive zzso procedures since 1996 was zzso 

Thirty-one women underwent the zzso zzso with an average maternal age of 29 years zzso 20 to zzso and average zzso age of 34 weeks zzso 29 to zzso The indication was airway obstruction from fetal neck mass in 13, and reversal of zzso zzso from in zzso clipping in zzso zzso indications included an zzso zzso membrane zzso procedure for a fetus with zzso and a cardiac zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso high airway obstruction syndrome zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso of a very large zzso zzso zzso zzso of the lung zzso on zzso bypass zzso zzso 1), unilateral pulmonary zzso zzso zzso 1), and zzso zzso zzso The mean duration on zzso bypass (from zzso incision to zzso zzso zzso was zzso plus minus zzso minutes zzso 8 to zzso No fetus experienced zzso instability during zzso bypass as recorded by fetal heart rate zzso pulse zzso and fetal zzso except for one instance of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso and fetal zzso were zzso plus minus zzso beats per minute and zzso plus minus zzso zzso Five fetuses required a zzso Only 1 death occurred during an zzso procedure because of inability to secure the airway secondary to extensive involvement by a zzso The average zzso pH and zzso were, respectively, zzso plus minus zzso and zzso plus minus zzso Two maternal complications zzso bleeding from a zzso site and zzso of an old zzso zzso noticed at a subsequent zzso zzso The average maternal blood loss was zzso plus minus zzso zzso
