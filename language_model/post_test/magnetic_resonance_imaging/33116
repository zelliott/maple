Women with zzso breast cancer treated by a single surgeon between January 1, 2006, and December 31, zzso 

Selective zzso MR imaging based on breast density and zzso zzso

Of 313 patients in the study, 120 underwent zzso MR zzso Patients undergoing MR imaging were younger zzso age, zzso vs zzso years; P zzso zzso were more often of zzso white zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and more likely had zzso dense or very dense breasts zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the MR imaging group vs zzso in the no MR imaging group, P zzso zzso and the type of surgery performed zzso vs partial mastectomy, P zzso zzso were similar in both zzso The mean pathological size of the index tumor in the MR imaging group was larger than that in the no MR imaging group zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso but the extent of disease was comparable zzso in the MR imaging group vs zzso in the no MR imaging group had zzso localized disease, P zzso zzso The zzso rate was similar between the 2 groups zzso in the MR imaging group vs zzso in the no MR imaging group, P zzso zzso even when zzso by breast density zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor size zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso findings zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mastectomy zzso or zzso MR imaging and zzso zzso zzso was observed in 12 of 47 patients zzso with zzso MR imaging who underwent zzso 

The selective use of zzso MR imaging to decrease zzso in women with breast cancer is not supported by these zzso In a considerable number of patients, MR imaging zzso the extent of zzso
