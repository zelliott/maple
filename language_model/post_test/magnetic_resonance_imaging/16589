The management of spinal multiple myeloma zzso is a complex process, including zzso treatment zzso efforts to suppress the tumor zzso as well as supportive therapy, including zzso The aim of this article is to present retrospective evaluation of surgical indications in patients with zzso or solitary spinal zzso 

A total of 10 patients (8 males and 2 zzso aged from 32 to 74 years (the mean age of zzso were included in the zzso The zzso criteria were the zzso patients operated for zzso or solitary spinal zzso during the past zzso period, with the minimum follow up period of 6 zzso The procedures were indicated for progressing neurological deficit zzso zzso and for zzso spinal pain zzso zzso not responding to conservative zzso The extent of the disease was assessed based on plain zzso zzso and zzso body zzso zzso zzso zzso was indicated in patients with no neurological deficit to control pain, zzso zzso without stabilization in subjects with partial neurological zzso with zzso fixation in zzso pathological fractures or zzso More radical approach, zzso the procedure included zzso was indicated in patients with solitary zzso and in procedures on cervical or zzso zzso Control clinical and zzso examinations were performed at 6 weeks, at 6 months and then at yearly zzso At the end of the study, the authors evaluated zzso of the employed surgical procedures, based on all control findings, and the data were compared with zzso scoring systems in surgery for spinal zzso zzso score, zzso modified score and Bauer zzso 

No local relapses of the tumor or stabilization failure were zzso The effect of surgery on pain control and on prevention of neurological dysfunction was maintained over the follow up zzso The authors concluded that all surgical procedures and their zzso were adequate in all zzso The agreement between the authors approach (the zzso zzso and the zzso score, the zzso modified score and the Bauer score were recorded in 50% of patients, zzso of patients and in 50% of patients, zzso 

zzso is characterized by increased zzso which is not followed by new bone zzso Despite successful conservative therapy of zzso the bone defects fail to zzso cause spinal pain and may result in spinal zzso These specific zzso signs represent the principal factor in the zzso making process concerning indication for zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with survival times usually exceeding the required expected minimum survival time of 3-6 months, is yet another reason for indication for surgical therapy in patients with spinal zzso Due to advances in chemotherapy and the use of zzso zzso of peripheral stem cells and zzso the prognosis of patients have significantly improved in last 10 zzso The mean survival time has increased from zzso years to zzso zzso 

zzso Prevention or improvement of neurological zzso and pain control are the main indication criteria for surgery in zzso zzso Surgery should be considered in zzso with zzso spinal disorder and because of zzso prognosis of the disease when surgery is zzso zzso zzso procedures, including zzso methods resulted in sufficient control of spinal stability in all the study zzso zzso Using all scoring systems for spinal zzso could result in indications for unnecessary more radical zzso However, zzso score appeared to be the most suitable existing zzso scoring zzso
