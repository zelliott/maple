The purpose of this study was to compare the relative results from conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dedicated zzso zzso and zzso to detect and grade bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the hands and zzso of patients with zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso arthritis underwent conventional zzso zzso zzso dedicated zzso zzso and conventional zzso of both hands and zzso Two independent zzso searched for the presence and extent of bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso narrowing zzso zzso were evaluated at 14 and 13 sites, respectively, on conventional zzso zzso zzso dedicated zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso scoring zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated at 13 sites on conventional zzso zzso and zzso dedicated zzso zzso 

For the detection of bone zzso we found no significant difference zzso zzso zzso between conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso E score, zzso zzso zzso and zzso dedicated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but a significant difference zzso zzso zzso appeared between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso J scores derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dedicated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher than those derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso although the difference was not significant zzso zzso zzso Conventional zzso zzso zzso score, zzso zzso zzso and zzso dedicated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were equivalent zzso zzso zzso for the evaluation of zzso The zzso agreement for zzso scores was good to excellent zzso correlation zzso zzso 

Conventional zzso zzso and zzso dedicated zzso zzso showed similar results in terms of zzso grading of bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the hands and zzso of patients with zzso zzso
