To zzso document changes in contrast agent zzso in patients with primary breast cancer treated with systemic chemotherapy after one or two cycles and to determine whether kinetic measures can be used to predict final zzso zzso 

Institutional committees on clinical research and ethics approval and patient consent were zzso Dynamic magnetic resonance zzso examinations were performed in 25 women with primary breast cancer before treatment and after the first zzso zzso zzso and second zzso zzso zzso cycle of zzso zzso zzso parameters zzso constant, leakage space, and rate zzso were derived for whole tumor regions of zzso Changes in zzso zzso of zzso data zzso value and zzso and MR zzso size were correlated with final clinical and zzso response by using zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analysis of tumor size and transfer constant changes were used to identify patients in whom no benefit was gained from zzso 

After the first cycle of treatment, 12 of 14 clinical zzso showed decreases in tumor size, and six of seven zzso showed increases or no change in tumor size zzso zzso zzso Transfer constant changes did not differ between zzso and zzso for either clinical or zzso zzso After two cycles of treatment, there were tumor size increases in five of six zzso compared with decreases in eight of nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in transfer constant range were also observed in zzso for both clinical and zzso assessments zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No other kinetic zzso change predicted zzso zzso and transfer constant range were equally accurate for predicting the absence of zzso response after two cycles of treatment zzso zzso and area under zzso curve were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for size and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for transfer constant zzso 

zzso in MR zzso size of the primary tumor best predict zzso response of breast cancer after one cycle of zzso zzso Transfer constant and size changes are equally sensitive in the identification of patients who would gain no clinical or zzso benefit after two cycles of zzso
