The purpose of the present study was to compare the results of functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging with those of zzso cortical stimulation in patients who zzso tumors close to or involving the primary motor area and to assess the usefulness of zzso imaging in the objective evaluation of motor function as part of the surgical strategy in the treatment of these zzso 

A total of 11 consecutive patients, whose tumors were close to or involving the central region, underwent zzso blood oxygen zzso zzso imaging while performing a motor paradigm that required them to zzso and spread their hands zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso functional maps covering the primary and secondary motor cortical areas were generated and zzso onto high-resolution anatomical MR zzso zzso electrical cortical stimulation was performed to validate the zzso zzso imaging zzso In nine zzso of 11 patients, the anatomical zzso imaging zzso of motor areas could be verified by zzso electrical cortical zzso In seven patients two or more zzso sites were demonstrated on zzso imaging, which were considered a consequence of reorganization phenomena of the motor zzso zzso primary motor area zzso zzso zzso zzso area (four zzso zzso primary motor area zzso zzso and zzso zzso area (four zzso 

zzso MR imaging can be used to perform objective evaluation of motor function and surgical planning in patients who harbor zzso near or involving the primary motor zzso zzso between zzso imaging findings and the results of direct electrical brain stimulation is high, although not zzso Based on their study, the authors believe that cortical reorganization patterns of motor areas might explain the differences in motor function and the diversity of zzso motor function among patients with central zzso
