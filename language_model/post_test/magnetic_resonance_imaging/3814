In addition to memory deficits, zzso impairment is a common manifestation of Alzheimer's disease zzso The present study examines the abnormalities of zzso functional networks in zzso using resting functional zzso zzso technique and evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of these networks as potential zzso compared with the default mode network zzso Group independent component analysis zzso zzso was applied to zzso data from 15 zzso patients and 16 normal healthy elderly controls zzso to derive the zzso attention network zzso and the zzso attention network zzso which are respectively responsible for the zzso attention zzso zzso process and the zzso attention zzso zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso curve analysis was performed for activity in core regions within each of these zzso zzso connectivity analysis revealed disrupted DAN and preserved (less zzso VAN in zzso patients compared with NC, which might indicate impairment of a zzso and intact zzso zzso processing mechanisms in zzso zzso curve analysis suggested that activity in the left zzso zzso and left frontal eye field from DAN as well as the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso could serve as sensitive and specific zzso distinguishing zzso from zzso
