To propose a comprehensive imaging zzso of living donors for liver transplantation allowing virtual zzso zzso 

Prospective CT and zzso evaluation of 20 patients selected as potential living donors for liver zzso between June 2001 and March zzso For each patient, a virtual zzso according to anatomical zzso and vascular variations, total liver Volume and residual liver zzso were zzso The imaging results were correlated to the surgical zzso 

CT and zzso demonstrated zzso vascular and zzso anatomical variations in 17 zzso zzso of these variations resulted in modification of the surgical planning in 6 zzso Four additional variations were described at zzso The virtual graft Volumes correlated well to the surgical ones zzso 

CT and zzso are useful for the zzso evaluation of living donors prior to liver zzso zzso of the residual liver Volume allows a good prediction of the zzso zzso
