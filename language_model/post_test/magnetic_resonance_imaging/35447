Bone zzso has been advocated as a useful diagnostic tool for patients with suspected zzso or in screening for zzso zzso We evaluated the sensitivity of bone scanning relative to magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnosis of zzso 

Forty-eight patients presented with suspected zzso of the shoulder, hip, knee, or zzso All patients underwent simultaneous zzso 3 months apart) bone scans and zzso studies as part of diagnostic zzso zzso confirmation of zzso was obtained for all suspected zzso The diagnostic result for each imaging zzso was then assessed and zzso 

All zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso were identified by zzso while only 91 zzso zzso were identified by bone zzso There was complete zzso of bone scans with MR images in only 38% of patients zzso Bone scanning identified zzso of zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso or zzso 2 zzso zzso compared with zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso of zzso was highest for the knee and hip and lower for the shoulder and zzso zzso and zzso zzso had a higher bone scan zzso 

Our results demonstrated the low sensitivity of bone zzso for diagnosing symptomatic zzso It is least sensitive for zzso zzso where it might be most useful to diagnose the zzso Our study also confirms that this test is less sensitive for zzso other than the hip and is also not useful as a screening zzso Our study does not support the use of bone scans as a diagnostic or screening tool for zzso
