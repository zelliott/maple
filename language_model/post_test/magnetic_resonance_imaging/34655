The aim of this study was to show the zzso and spatial evolution of zzso over time using zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and to correlate the extent of zzso with the zzso zzso size after 24 zzso 

In 8 rats focal cerebral zzso was induced by zzso zzso of the middle cerebral zzso The evolution of the zzso zzso was examined over 180 zzso with an experimental MR zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging displayed a zzso area in the lateral part of the zzso as early as 5 zzso after the onset of zzso The mean volume of zzso on diffusion mapping after 5 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso after 180 zzso This correlated well with the corrected zzso volume at zzso examination zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso using the zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging is a reliable tool in the early diagnosis of cerebral zzso Due to the zzso this method can be used for therapy monitoring and might help to develop new therapeutic zzso
