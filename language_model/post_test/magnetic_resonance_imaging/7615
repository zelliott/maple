zzso frequency zzso motion zzso are visual stimuli that consist of a difference of zzso moving along a closed trajectory defined by a zzso variation of the radius relative to a circular zzso In the current study, zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that spatial patterns of activity in visual regions zzso zzso and zzso can predict zzso motion trajectory shape regardless of whether an observer can zzso identify the shape or zzso This result suggests that processing in these regions is concerned with local properties of the zzso and not directly linked with a conscious zzso of global trajectory zzso zzso analyses show that zzso motion zzso also evoke zzso and zzso zzso cortical activity that may be a neural correlate of shape zzso Further, comparisons with activity evoked by zzso versions of the zzso shapes reveal zzso processing in regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso motion zzso evoke patterns of zzso visual stream cortical activity typical of visually guided movement preparation or action zzso suggesting that these stimuli may be processed as potential motor actions rather than as purely visual zzso
