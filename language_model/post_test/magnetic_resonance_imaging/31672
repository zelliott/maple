This study is a retrospective analysis of 60 surgically treated patients with 64 peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso at the second cervical zzso nerve zzso The anatomical subtleties of these tumors and their implications for surgical strategy when compared with other spinal zzso and other tumors in the zzso zzso region are zzso 

Sixty patients with zzso zzso treated surgically in the Department of zzso at King Edward zzso Memorial Hospital and Seth zzso zzso Medical College between 1992 and 2006 were zzso All patients underwent magnetic resonance zzso zzso were divided into 3 groups depending on their anatomical location identified during zzso Those tumors located within or extending into the spinal zzso tube were called Type A, those located within the zzso tube of the zzso zzso were labeled as Type B, and tumors extending zzso into the zzso region were labeled as Type zzso zzso zzso ranged from 6 months to 15 years zzso 64 zzso 

There were 38 male and 22 female patients in the study, who ranged in age from 6 to 62 years zzso 28 zzso Nine patients had clinical features indicative of zzso zzso The mean duration of symptoms at the time of presentation was 27 months zzso 4 zzso zzso Two patients had no specific symptoms related to the zzso zzso 6 patients had only local symptoms such as neck pain or zzso and 52 patients had symptoms of varying degrees of zzso There were 5 solely Type A tumors, 7 Type A + B tumors, 31 Type B tumors, and 21 Type B + C zzso All Type A, A + B, and B tumors were totally zzso Seven of 21 Type B + C tumors were partially zzso and the remainder were completely zzso All patients zzso reported varying improvement in their zzso zzso Except for patients with zzso who were disabled by other tumors, the rest of the patients resumed their normal life zzso There have been no cases of symptomatic tumor zzso 

The majority of zzso located at the zzso level in these patients probably arose from the large zzso zzso and are limited within the zzso confines or are zzso in zzso In contrast to other spinal zzso the location of zzso zzso is in most cases zzso to the lateral mass of the zzso and axis and the zzso joint and is exposed to the zzso without any bone zzso zzso tumor zzso is safe, resolution of clinical symptoms is zzso and recurrence rates are extremely zzso In a selected number of cases, bone work for tumor exposure and zzso can be entirely zzso
