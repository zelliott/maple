To evaluate zzso MR imaging for differentiation between zzso intact and zzso tumor tissue in a tumor zzso 

A human colon zzso was transplanted zzso into 9 nude zzso zzso MR imaging was performed before and after injection of the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were zzso The tumors were zzso zzso sections were prepared, and compared with corresponding MR zzso 

In intact zzso the MR signal intensity in the zzso and zzso images decreased after zzso injection and the zzso of the intact regions were sharp and corresponded well to the gross zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging facilitated the differentiation between intact and zzso tumor zzso
