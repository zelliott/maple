Many studies have shown that juvenile salmon imprint zzso memory of zzso stream zzso during downstream migration, and adults recall this zzso odor information to discriminate their zzso stream during upstream migration for zzso The odor information processing of the zzso stream in the salmon brain, however, has not been zzso We applied blood zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the odor information processing of the zzso stream in the zzso bulb and zzso of zzso zzso salmon zzso zzso The strong responses to the zzso stream water were mainly observed in the lateral area of zzso zzso zzso which are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Although the concentration of zzso (1 zzso in the control water was zzso higher than that of total zzso acid in the zzso stream water zzso zzso the zzso signals resulting from the zzso stream water were stronger than those by zzso in the zzso We concluded that zzso salmon could process the odor information of the zzso stream by zzso information in the zzso area of the zzso
