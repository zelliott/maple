Current evidence suggests cardiac involvement and zzso changes of increasing frequency with age in patients with zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso with concurrent zzso seems to be the anatomical zzso Moreover, zzso and functional changes indicative of zzso zzso have been demonstrated by means of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso in patients with no overt cardiac zzso We present a zzso woman with genetically established zzso and no clinical, zzso or zzso signs indicative of cardiac zzso zzso revealed delayed contrast enhancement of the anterior portion of the zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso zzso might be a useful diagnostic tool in assessing cardiac involvement in cases of zzso The role of delayed contrast enhancement should be further investigated in order to zzso the cardiac features of this fascinating zzso zzso
