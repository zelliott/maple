zzso ability exists on a spectrum, with a high zzso style meaning proficiency in zzso the rules of a system, to predict how that system zzso This study uses zzso to investigate a spectrum of low to high zzso to assess whether individuals with a high zzso style exhibit an zzso bias towards local zzso This is the first study to test for the neural zzso of zzso Participants with a range of scores on the zzso zzso zzso were given a version of the Navon task during zzso which elicits zzso conflict between local and global levels of visual zzso zzso score was correlated with a focus on local detail in the zzso zzso During conditions zzso zzso conflict zzso score was associated with increased zzso in the lateral zzso zzso and zzso visual zzso However, neural investigations did not imply a neural correlate of zzso during local processing per zzso zzso are discussed in terms of a heightened ability to maintain an zzso set in those with a high zzso cognitive zzso
