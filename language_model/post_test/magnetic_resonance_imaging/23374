In individuals with zzso potential central nervous system changes can occur as a consequence of their asthma or zzso Clinical trials of zzso therapies might benefit from using magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess potential brain zzso 

As part of the clinical safety evaluation of a zzso zzso directed against zzso for the treatment of zzso we assessed whether brain zzso is an appropriate screening tool to evaluate potential zzso 

Brain zzso were conducted as part of a zzso safety evaluation in adults aged 19 to 47 years with mild to moderate asthma treated with either the zzso zzso zzso or zzso An independent zzso performed a blinded review of brain zzso scans obtained at baseline before dosing and day 28 after dosing from two separate clinical zzso 

Fifteen brain zzso abnormalities were noted in 13 of 21 subjects with asthma zzso zzso deep white matter zzso zzso zzso space zzso and abnormal zzso findings zzso were noted either at baseline or zzso Only 8 of 21 subjects zzso with asthma had normal brain zzso zzso 

The high rate of incidental brain zzso findings suggests that these abnormalities are relatively common in patients with zzso Thus, brain zzso may not be an appropriate screening tool to evaluate potential zzso in subjects during routine clinical studies without a baseline zzso Due to artifacts simulating zzso an experienced zzso should interpret all brain zzso zzso
