To compare zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging with contrast material administered orally and zzso for evaluating patients with zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso disease received zzso zzso zzso and water zzso The abdomen and pelvis were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR zzso Two zzso reviewed the two types of images for zzso zzso The extent, severity, and zzso of the disease were zzso Proof of zzso disease at MR imaging was compared with that at zzso zzso study, and zzso zzso analysis was performed with the zzso zzso 

Twenty-five of 28 patients had proven abnormal zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso MR imaging for the two zzso was zzso and zzso versus zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso fast zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images depicted more segments (54 and 52 of 61 zzso sensitivity, zzso and zzso zzso of the diseased zzso than did zzso fast zzso MR images zzso and 32 of 61 zzso sensitivity, 51% and zzso zzso P zzso zzso of zzso disease was correctly depicted at zzso zzso zzso imaging in zzso of patients versus in zzso of patients at zzso fast zzso zzso 

In patients with zzso disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging better depicted the extent and severity of zzso disease compared with zzso fast zzso zzso
