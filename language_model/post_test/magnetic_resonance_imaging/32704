The study of brain function using zzso relies on acquisition techniques that are sensitive to different aspects of the zzso response zzso to areas of zzso zzso For this purpose different contrasts such as zzso spin labeling zzso and blood zzso level dependent zzso functional zzso techniques have been developed to investigate cerebral blood flow zzso and blood zzso zzso Analysis of such data typically proceeds by separate, linear modeling of the appropriate zzso or zzso time zzso In this work an approach is developed that provides simultaneous zzso on zzso changes via a zzso zzso model of zzso data acquired at multiple echo zzso zzso this includes a significant contribution by changes in the zzso zzso M, to the zzso zzso zzso is carried out in a zzso zzso This is able to zzso from zzso zzso data, zzso estimates of percentage changes of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso This approach provides increased sensitivity in zzso zzso changes and reduced contamination in zzso zzso changes when compared with general linear model approaches on zzso zzso zzso We also consider how the zzso zzso M, might be related to changes in zzso by assuming the same mechanism for water exchange as in vascular space zzso
