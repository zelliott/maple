Patients frequently undergo cardiac zzso before the zzso operation because of the limited zzso windows in the region of the superior zzso connection and branch pulmonary zzso Patients with obstruction to pulmonary blood flow are at increased risk for prolonged length of hospital stay after the zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance has unlimited imaging windows and can zzso both the branch pulmonary artery size and net flow distribution and thereby serve as a method for identifying patients at increased risk for prolonged length of zzso 

We zzso reviewed 24 cardiac magnetic resonance studies of patients zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso referred before the zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance measured the zzso area and flow to each branch pulmonary zzso zzso hospital course data were acquired from the medical zzso 

zzso length of stay after the zzso operation is observed among patients with one branch that is less than zzso of the total zzso area zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso days, P zzso zzso or with less than zzso flow to one branch zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso days, P zzso zzso There is moderate correlation between the total branch pulmonary area and length of stay zzso zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso the branch pulmonary area size and flow before the zzso zzso These data predict which patients are more likely to experience a prolonged hospital zzso
