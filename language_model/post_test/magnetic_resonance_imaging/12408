zzso changes like brain zzso or growth are usually not homogeneous in space and across spatial zzso since they map differently depending on the anatomical zzso Thus, the accurate analysis of volume changes from medical images requires to reliably zzso and distinguish the spatial changes occurring at different zzso from zzso to regional zzso We propose here a framework for the sparse zzso zzso analysis of volume changes zzso by zzso Our framework is based on the zzso decomposition of zzso zzso By zzso analysis of the zzso pressure map associated to the zzso component of the zzso we robustly identify the areas of zzso volume changes, and we define a consistent sparse decomposition of the zzso zzso We show the effectiveness of our framework in the challenging problem of detecting the progression of tumor growth, and in the zzso analysis of the zzso zzso in Alzheimer's zzso
