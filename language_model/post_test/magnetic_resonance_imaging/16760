The effect of zzso administration on zzso zzso of the infantile rats with zzso induced zzso was zzso 

zzso was induced by injecting zzso into the zzso magna of zzso old zzso rat zzso One group received a single daily dose of zzso zzso zzso following zzso induction for a period of two zzso By the end of the two-week period, animals were zzso evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and then sacrificed to get their zzso zzso Both zzso analysis of zzso oxide zzso activity and zzso of spared zzso in zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso were zzso 

In zzso rats considerable zzso loss associated with significantly increased zzso oxide zzso zzso were determined in all zzso zzso However, zzso treated rats showed significantly higher number of spared zzso counts and reduced zzso oxide zzso zzso in zzso and zzso regions compared with the zzso zzso 

The findings of the study show that zzso zzso may constitute important targets for injury secondary to zzso process in experimental infantile zzso Early zzso treatment with zzso seems to have a zzso effect especially in the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso
