Previous functional zzso studies have identified a network of brain regions that process aversive zzso including zzso A zzso near the zzso zzso zzso response element binding protein gene zzso has recently been associated with greater zzso effort at anger control as well as risk for zzso zzso zzso in men with major depressive disorder, but its functional effects have not been zzso 

To determine whether this genetic zzso is associated with altered brain processing of and behavioral avoidance responses to angry facial zzso 

A total of 28 white participants zzso age, zzso years; 13 zzso were screened using the zzso Clinical zzso for zzso to exclude any lifetime Axis I psychiatric disorder and were zzso for zzso a zzso zzso near zzso 

Blood zzso zzso signal by functional magnetic resonance imaging in the amygdala, zzso anterior cingulate, and zzso zzso during passive viewing of photographs of faces with emotional zzso To measure approach and avoidance responses to anger, an zzso zzso task that traded effort for viewing time assessed valuation of angry faces compared with other zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was associated with significant differential zzso in an extended neural network responding to angry and other facial zzso The zzso insular zzso was zzso with zzso associated with behavioral avoidance of angry zzso 

A zzso near zzso is associated with responsiveness to angry faces in a brain network implicated in processing zzso zzso zzso in the left zzso is further associated with behavioral avoidance of these zzso
