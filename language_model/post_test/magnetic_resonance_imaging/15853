To our knowledge no zzso data have so far been reported for zzso zzso in the zzso setting of zzso cervical zzso We assessed zzso parameters and clinical outcome using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty-nine patients with primary early cervical zzso zzso 37, zzso 1 and zzso 1) were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso to a total dose of 60 zzso to the zzso zzso followed 6 weeks later by bilateral zzso and zzso zzso plus pelvic zzso zzso zzso zzso was delivered to patients with pelvic zzso zzso zzso 

With a median follow-up of zzso years zzso zzso zzso local recurrence occurred in 1 patient (a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso overall survival and zzso survival were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso local zzso survival were 94 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso median zzso and zzso were 43 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 75 zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso For high-risk zzso the median zzso and zzso were 69 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 109 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty grade 1-2 late complications were observed in 13 patients zzso 10 zzso 3 zzso 1 zzso 1 small zzso 1 zzso 1 pelvic fibrosis, 1 peripheral zzso and 2 zzso No grade 3 or 4 complication zzso 

zzso zzso with adaptation of the time duration and/or the length of each radioactive source allows both high local control and low toxicity in the zzso settings of zzso cervical zzso
