Recently, there has been greater awareness that combination radiation and zzso used to treat zzso may cause increased contrast enhancement on the first post radiation zzso zzso However, this increased enhancement may stabilize or decrease over time and represent zzso zzso rather than true progressive zzso It has never been shown that this phenomenon is greater with combination therapy than radiation zzso To address this question, we reviewed zzso scans in zzso patients treated with radiation alone versus patients treated with radiation and zzso zzso and compared the frequency of zzso in the two zzso zzso of 47 patients zzso treated with radiation alone demonstrated enlargement on their first zzso zzso scan and 11 of these 18 zzso proved to have zzso as defined by no further enlargement on stable therapy for 3 months following zzso zzso of 45 patients zzso treated with radiation and zzso had enlargement on their first zzso zzso scan and 13 of these 24 zzso had zzso Median overall survival zzso in patients with zzso treated with radiation alone was zzso versus zzso months in those without zzso Median zzso in patients treated with radiation and zzso zzso who had zzso was zzso versus zzso months in those who did not have zzso We were unable to detect a difference in zzso between the four zzso zzso of zzso independent of treatment, was associated with prolonged zzso survival zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso may be more common in combination therapy but most likely by a small zzso
