The relationship between functional recovery after brain injury and zzso zzso changes is emphasized in recent zzso In the present study we aimed to delineate brain regions essential for language performance in zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging and acquisition in a zzso sparse sampling zzso which allows monitoring of overt verbal responses during zzso 

An 80-year old patient with chronic zzso (2 years zzso was investigated before and after intensive language training using an overt picture naming zzso zzso brain zzso in the right inferior frontal zzso for correct word retrieval and errors was zzso zzso language performance following therapy was mirrored by increased zzso zzso while stability in more general measures of zzso and working memory was zzso Three healthy zzso control subjects did not show behavioral changes or increased zzso when tested repeatedly within the same zzso time zzso 

The results bear significance in that the changes in brain zzso reported can unequivocally be attributed to the short-term training program and a language zzso plasticity zzso Moreover, it further challenges the claim of a limited recovery potential in chronic zzso even at very old zzso zzso of brain regions essential for performance on a single case basis might have major implications for treatment using zzso magnetic zzso
