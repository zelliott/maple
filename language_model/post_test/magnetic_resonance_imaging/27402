zzso exposure increases cancer risk in children with zzso disease zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso can image the gastrointestinal tract without exposure to zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether our zzso protocol could diagnose terminal zzso and the degree of inflammatory activity in children with zzso 

zzso review of patients 18 years of age or younger who underwent zzso for known or suspected CD from June 15, 2007 to April 1, zzso zzso was performed with zzso and water as oral contrast and zzso intravenous zzso No zzso agent was zzso Each zzso was compared with zzso zzso obtained within 90 zzso zzso of inflammation on zzso was scored and compared with the zzso zzso Disease zzso Index zzso 

zzso patients underwent 80 zzso during the study zzso zzso of the 72 patients zzso underwent zzso within 90 days of zzso and the terminal zzso was zzso in zzso Compared with zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for terminal zzso The positive and negative zzso values were zzso and zzso zzso zzso was calculated in 39 of the 72 patients zzso and had a statistically significant positive correlation with zzso score of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In children with known or suspected CD, our zzso protocol has a high specificity and positive zzso value for terminal zzso zzso of inflammation on zzso had a statistically significant positive correlation with zzso
