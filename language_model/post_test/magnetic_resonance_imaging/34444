To define a method for measurement of the cross zzso area and volume of the zzso zzso muscle using magnetic resonance imaging zzso in conjunction with zzso and to compare the results of zzso obtained by the zzso method with those obtained by the conventional method of zzso zzso ultrasound in order to evaluate whether zzso is a reliable alternative to zzso 

A preliminary zzso study was undertaken on a single female volunteer in order to zzso the scanning technique and sampling design for zzso the muscle volume using the zzso zzso Ten healthy volunteers participated in the method comparison zzso Each volunteer underwent zzso zzso zzso immediately followed by zzso The cross zzso area of the zzso zzso was estimated at the junction of the zzso one third and zzso two thirds of the zzso and seven systematic sections of the thigh were obtained in order to estimate muscle volume by both zzso 

Seven sections through the muscle are required to achieve a zzso of error of zzso There was no significant difference in the cross zzso area estimates or volume estimates when ultrasound and zzso were zzso 

Muscle cross zzso area and volume can be measured without bias by zzso in conjunction with zzso methods and the method is a reliable alternative to zzso zzso ultrasound for this zzso
