To investigate cortical auditory and motor zzso in professional musicians, we compared the functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso activity of seven pianists to seven zzso utilizing a passive task paradigm established in a previous learning zzso The tasks involved either passively listening to short piano melodies or pressing keys on a mute zzso piano zzso Both groups were matched with respect to age and zzso and did not exhibit any overt performance differences in the zzso zzso The professional pianists showed increased activity compared to the zzso in a distributed cortical network during both the acoustic and the mute zzso zzso A conjunction analysis revealed a distinct zzso network being zzso during either task type, indicating areas involved in zzso zzso This network is comprised of zzso and inferior frontal zzso (including zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and supplementary motor and zzso zzso
