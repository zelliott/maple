zzso connectivity zzso as measured by correlation between zzso zzso time courses of distinct brain regions has revealed meaningful organization of spontaneous fluctuations in the resting zzso However, an increasing amount of evidence points to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso changes over time reflecting additional and rich information about brain organization, but representing new challenges for analysis and zzso Here, we propose a zzso approach based on principal component analysis zzso to reveal hidden patterns of coherent zzso dynamics across multiple zzso We demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of this new approach by examining the differences in dynamic zzso between 13 healthy control subjects and 15 minimally disabled zzso multiple sclerosis zzso We estimated zzso dynamic zzso of zzso zzso activity using sliding time zzso We then used zzso to identify zzso patterns, termed zzso that reflect meaningful patterns in zzso zzso We then assessed the contributions of these patterns to the dynamic zzso at any given time point and identified a network of connections centered on the zzso network with altered contribution in zzso Our results complement traditional stationary zzso and reveal novel insights into brain connectivity dynamics and their zzso in a neurodegenerative zzso
