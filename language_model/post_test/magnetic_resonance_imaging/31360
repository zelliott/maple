zzso deficits occur even in the earliest stages of Parkinson's zzso Some such deficits are known to relate to dysfunction in zzso zzso networks, and may be influenced by a common functional zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shifting zzso is an important and zzso cognitive problem in zzso but nonetheless its precise cognitive and neural basis remains zzso Here we explored this impairment in an zzso study employing a recently developed cognitive task designed to zzso components of zzso zzso We investigated the impact of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso medication on both patterns of zzso and associated brain zzso in 29 zzso patients with early zzso zzso had a critical impact on task zzso whilst patients with high activity zzso zzso zzso adopted a typical approach of zzso shifting attention within rather than between dimensions, those with low activity zzso zzso failed to adopt such a strategy, suggesting an inability to form an zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso was associated with significant zzso across the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated an interactive effect of zzso zzso and zzso medication on task performance and zzso zzso Hence we have shown for the first time that zzso control in zzso is critically determined by genetic and pharmacological influences on zzso activity in zzso zzso This has important implications for understanding the zzso basis of zzso control, and highlights the risk of zzso cognitive dysfunction in certain zzso groups of zzso patients, which may ultimately impact on clinical zzso
