The neural zzso that increases attention to zzso stimuli when we are in danger of becoming distracted is a matter of active zzso To address several long-standing zzso we asked participants to identify a letter presented either visually or zzso while we varied the amount of zzso distraction from an irrelevant letter in the opposite zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging revealed three novel zzso First, activity in sensory zzso that processed the relevant letter increased as the irrelevant letter became more zzso consistent with a selective increase of attention to the relevant zzso In line with this view, an zzso correlation indicated that the larger the increase of activity in sensory zzso that processed the relevant letter, the less behavioral interference there was from the irrelevant zzso Second, regions of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso involved in zzso attention to the relevant letter also participated in increasing attention to the relevant letter when conflicting stimuli were zzso Third, we observed a novel pattern of regional specialization within the cognitive division of the anterior zzso zzso zzso for focusing attention on the relevant letter zzso zzso versus detecting conflict from the irrelevant letter zzso zzso These findings indicate novel roles for sensory zzso the zzso and the zzso in increasing attention to zzso stimulus representations when distracting stimuli conflict with behavioral zzso Furthermore, they potentially resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the key contribution of the zzso to cognitive zzso
