Current theories suggest that zzso cortical information integration may account for the mechanism of general zzso in suppressing zzso Human cognitive operations take place in zzso structured neural organizations in the zzso The process of zzso neural representation of sensory stimuli becoming integrated in zzso zzso is also known as cognitive zzso Combining zzso cognitive zzso and zzso zzso we examined how cognitive networks involved in auditory verbal memory are maintained in zzso disrupted in zzso deep zzso and zzso in zzso Inspired by the notion of cognitive zzso an functional magnetic resonance zzso connectivity analysis was zzso to assess the integrity of functional interactions within and between different levels of the zzso brain zzso zzso responses persisted in the primary auditory zzso zzso but vanished in the inferior frontal zzso zzso and zzso areas in deep zzso For connectivity analysis, seed regions representing sensory and zzso processing of the memory task were identified in the zzso and zzso zzso disrupted connections from the zzso seed to the frontal regions and thalamus, but not the connections from the zzso seed to a set of widely distributed brain regions in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso (with exception of the zzso These later regions have been implicated in zzso verbal comprehension and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso by blocking the projection of sensory information to zzso processing networks and thus preventing information zzso Such findings contribute to our understanding of zzso mechanisms as related to information and integration in the zzso
