zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is an imaging technique for determining which regions of the brain are activated in response to a stimulus or zzso Early zzso experiment zzso were based upon those used in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso employing a block design consisting of extended periods of zzso against zzso zzso More recent experiments were based on zzso zzso harnessing the fact that very short stimuli trains or single events can generate robust zzso zzso data suffer from low zzso ratios, and typical zzso experiment zzso employ selective averaging over many trials before using statistical methods for determining active brain zzso The paper reports a pattern recognition approach to the detection of zzso zzso responses without recourse to averaging and at modest field strengths zzso Linear zzso analysis zzso was applied in conjunction with different feature extraction zzso Use of the zzso data samples as features resulted in zzso events being classified with an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso over five zzso To improve zzso zzso knowledge of the ideal template zzso response was used in the feature extraction zzso A novel application of zzso zzso yielded an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso and a matched filtering approach yielded an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso may yield new ways of examining the brain by zzso new zzso experiment designs and enabling tight integration with other zzso zzso zzso
