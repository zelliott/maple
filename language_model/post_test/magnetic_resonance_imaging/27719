The objective of this research was to study the characteristics of fatty liver zzso in acute zzso (AP) in zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Fifty patients with zzso zzso men, 27 zzso mean age, 44 zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso were included in this retrospective zzso zzso informed consent was zzso All of them performed abdominal zzso within 72 hours of symptom onset and zzso zzso The severity of the zzso was graded according to the magnetic resonance severity index zzso The zzso zzso was zzso points between the mild and the severe zzso zzso liver in zzso was determined by the zzso signal intensity difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso between the severity of FL and zzso or serum zzso levels were zzso 

Of the 50 patients with zzso FL was found in zzso of patients' zzso A close correlation can be seen between the difference of liver signal zzso on zzso images and the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Close correlations were found between FL appearance on zzso and serum zzso levels in both mild zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso During follow-up zzso the appearance of FL decreased following the decrease in zzso scores and serum zzso levels in both mild and severe zzso 

zzso liver in zzso is frequently observed in zzso The appearance of FL in zzso may decrease after subsidence of zzso
