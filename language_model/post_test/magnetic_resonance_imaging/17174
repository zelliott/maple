The ability to zzso from drinking, despite incentives to zzso is essential to recovery from zzso 

We used an incentive conflict task to investigate ability to zzso from responding during presentations of incentive zzso Both alcoholic zzso zzso zzso and healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso were required to withhold responding during the simultaneous presentation of two visual stimuli in which the individual presentation allowed responding for monetary zzso Brain structures activated during performance of the task were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso and changes in gray matter volume were studied in a separate group of patients zzso zzso 29) compared with control subjects zzso zzso 31) in regions of interest identified on functional magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso alcoholic patients were severely impaired on the incentive conflict zzso The impairment was greater in patients with experience of several versus a single zzso Healthy volunteers, during the same incentive conflict task, showed distinct patterns of brain zzso (including zzso zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, and superior frontal zzso Reduction of gray matter volume in zzso prefrontal zzso and superior frontal zzso of patients was more extensive in those with multiple zzso 

Performance deficits in zzso are associated with zzso zzso in prefrontal zzso which are exacerbated following repeated episodes of zzso zzso thus compromises functional and structural integrity of prefrontal zzso and may thus impair the ability to control future zzso Performance in the incentive conflict task is a sensitive zzso for such zzso
