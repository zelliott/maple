Acute zzso necrosis is a devastating consequence of zzso crisis in patients with zzso zzso type I zzso but the mechanisms underlying brain injury are not completely zzso 

To approach zzso aspects of brain injury in zzso by means of functional techniques in magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Four patients during an acute zzso crisis and three zzso siblings with zzso underwent zzso hydrogen magnetic resonance zzso zzso and brain zzso including zzso echo zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The study was performed between three and eight days after the onset of acute zzso zzso zzso diffusion images showed high signal changes with corresponding low apparent diffusion zzso values within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (four zzso and the cerebral zzso including the zzso zzso (one zzso The study disclosed normal findings in zzso zzso MRS showed decreased zzso ratio at the zzso zzso in zzso patients when compared to a group of zzso and zzso zzso 

Brain injury in zzso is characterized by the presence of zzso zzso and reduced zzso integrity by functional imaging zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may be zzso in patients with unilateral motor disorder and may extent to the cerebral zzso and zzso zzso which may be responsible for the acute onset zzso in some zzso zzso techniques failed to demonstrate any abnormalities in zzso patients, which is in agreement with the integrity of zzso zzso structures observed by conventional zzso zzso
