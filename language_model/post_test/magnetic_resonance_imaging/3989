zzso of the extent and location of viable tissue is important to clinical zzso In principle, sodium zzso and zzso zzso zzso could zzso provide information about tissue zzso In practice, imaging of these zzso is difficult because, compared with water zzso zzso zzso and zzso have lower MR sensitivities zzso and zzso respectively), and lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the relatively short zzso relaxation times of zzso and zzso zzso 30 and 10 zzso zzso suggest that zzso imaging pulse sequences may in part alleviate the weak signal of these zzso In this study, zzso simulations of high-speed imaging sequences were developed and used to maximize zzso and zzso image zzso ratio zzso per unit time within the constraints of existing zzso zzso The simulation demonstrated that decreasing receiver bandwidth at the expense of echo time zzso results in a substantial increase in zzso and zzso image zzso despite the short zzso and zzso of these zzso zzso to the available zzso signal on existing zzso T zzso the simulation suggested that it should be possible to acquire three-dimensional zzso images of the human heart with 7 zzso 7 zzso 7 zzso resolution and zzso images with 26 zzso 26 zzso 26 zzso resolution in 30 zzso zzso in humans at zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso images of the heart were acquired in 15 zzso with 6 zzso 6 zzso 12 zzso resolution and zzso ratios of 11 and 7 in the left zzso cavity and zzso respectively, which is very similar to the predicted zzso The results demonstrate that by choosing imaging pulse sequence parameters that fully exploit the short relaxation times of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is improved but remains zzso whereas sodium zzso improves to the point where zzso imaging of the human heart may be clinically feasible on existing zzso T zzso
