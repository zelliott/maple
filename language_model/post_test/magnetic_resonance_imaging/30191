zzso is a neurodegenerative disease of the visual zzso While elevated zzso pressure is considered to be a major risk factor, the primary cause and zzso of the disease are still zzso This study aims to employ in zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to evaluate zzso the zzso enhancements in the visual components following an induction of zzso hypertension in a rat model of chronic zzso The zzso and zzso veins were zzso unilaterally in the right eye using an zzso laser to maintain a consistent zzso of zzso pressure by about zzso times above the normal zzso Two and six weeks after glaucoma zzso zzso solution zzso zzso 3 zzso was injected zzso into both eyes, and zzso was performed 2 to 5 h after zzso zzso showed a delayed increase in zzso signal intensity in the zzso zzso nerve at 6 weeks but not 2 weeks after glaucoma zzso In addition, there was an zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso eye, with a high concentration of zzso zzso at the zzso nerve head and the zzso These zzso findings may help understand the disease mechanisms, monitor the effect of drug interventions in glaucoma models and complement the conventional techniques in examining the zzso visual zzso
