Previous functional zzso studies of zzso memory have investigated memory for laboratory stimuli that are zzso unrelated and poor in sensory zzso In contrast, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study investigated zzso memory for autobiographical events that were zzso interconnected and rich in sensory zzso Participants took photographs at many campus locations over a period of several hours, and the following day they were scanned while making zzso judgments to pairs of photographs from different zzso By manipulating the zzso lag between the two locations in each trial, we compared the neural zzso associated with reconstruction zzso which we hypothesized depended on recollection and contribute mainly to short zzso and distance zzso which we hypothesized to depend on familiarity and contribute mainly to longer zzso zzso with our zzso zzso zzso analyses linked shorter lags to zzso in regions previously associated with recollection zzso zzso zzso zzso and visual zzso and longer lags with regions previously associated with familiarity zzso prefrontal zzso The zzso asymmetry in prefrontal zzso activity fits very well with evidence and theories regarding the contributions of the left versus right prefrontal zzso to memory zzso zzso familiarity zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In sum, using a novel zzso this study provided the first evidence regarding the neural zzso of zzso for autobiographical zzso
