zzso arises from the zzso ducts and is the most common primary zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is classified according to its growth zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The majority of zzso occur at the common zzso duct zzso and its zzso also referred to as zzso zzso but they also can occur in more peripheral branches within the zzso zzso zzso zzso represents an zzso with a zzso appearance arising from the zzso of the zzso zzso On magnetic resonance zzso images, zzso appear zzso on zzso images, and zzso on zzso zzso Central zzso can be seen on zzso images and zzso to zzso On dynamic MR images, zzso show moderate peripheral enhancement followed by progressive and concentric filling in the tumor with contrast zzso zzso of contrast within the tumor on delayed MR images is suggestive of peripheral zzso The role of MR imaging in zzso zzso is to zzso a diagnosis and to assess zzso zzso zzso shows the same signal intensity pattern of peripheral tumors both on zzso and zzso zzso On magnetic resonance zzso zzso images, zzso zzso appears as a moderately irregular zzso of the zzso duct wall zzso zzso with zzso upstream zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The aim of zzso investigation in zzso tumors typically requires the evaluation of the level of zzso zzso the zzso tumor spread, and the vascular zzso it also needs to show any zzso zzso Because of its intrinsic high tissue contrast and zzso zzso MR imaging and zzso are able to detect and preoperatively assess patients with zzso investigating all involved structures such as zzso zzso vessels and zzso zzso The main reason for zzso zzso is represented by the microscopic diffusion along the zzso and in the zzso zzso
