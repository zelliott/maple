zzso temperature mapping was used to determine the heat field within the prostate by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso were used to determine the extent and pattern of zzso necrosis following zzso The cell kill assessment feature of the device was compared with zzso and zzso 

A total of 12 patients were treated, including 5 with zzso of the prostate and 7 with benign zzso zzso zzso sensors were inserted from the zzso to map the temperature zzso The 5 patients with zzso underwent zzso and subsequent zzso 3 to 6 weeks after zzso zzso and cell kill calculations were performed in all zzso 

zzso temperatures were found in a zzso shape with a wide circumference of highest temperatures at the base of the zzso and decreasing temperature and circumference toward the zzso zzso necrosis assessed by zzso zzso and cell kill calculations overlapped reasonably well in shape and zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso was destroyed by zzso 

zzso zzso treatment causes significant tissue necrosis of the zzso zzso neck and zzso zzso The cell kill calculation provides an zzso estimate of the amount of necrosis caused during zzso
