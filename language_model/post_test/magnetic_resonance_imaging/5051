It has been recognized that primary blast waves may result in zzso in soldiers in zzso A new type of contrast used in magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso imaging zzso has been developed that is based on the different zzso levels in diverse zzso and can detect decreases in cerebral blood flow zzso using zzso oxygen zzso changes in zzso In addition, a continuous zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was used as a direct measure of regional zzso within the brain zzso Animals were subjected to zzso blast zzso of various zzso within a zzso shock zzso When exposed to low levels of zzso most rats demonstrated no obvious changes between zzso and zzso in the conventional MR zzso zzso changes measured by zzso and zzso were significantly higher for the zzso exposed groups as compared to the sham group and tended to increase with pressure increases at the highest two zzso In the zzso all blast animals had a reduction in the zzso consistently in the range of zzso In zzso low levels of primary blast pressure exposure demonstrated a significant zzso effect to the brain up to 72 h zzso
