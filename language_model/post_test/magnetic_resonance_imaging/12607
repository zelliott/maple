In this study, an implicit reference zzso zzso registration with a small zzso linear elastic model was used to jointly estimate zzso between a set of zzso zzso The performance of zzso and zzso registration zzso was evaluated for spatial zzso of structural and functional zzso zzso Traditional spatial zzso is accomplished by zzso zzso registration in which a group of images are registered zzso to a reference zzso zzso registration is limited due to bias associated with selecting a reference zzso In contrast, implicit reference zzso zzso registration estimates zzso between a group of images by jointly registering the images to an implicit reference corresponding to the group zzso The implicit reference is estimated during zzso registration eliminating the bias associated with selecting a specific reference zzso Registration performance was evaluated using segmented zzso magnetic resonance images from the zzso Image Registration zzso Project zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reference zzso zzso zzso special case of zzso registration for two zzso shown to produce better relative overlap than zzso for zzso registration using the same small zzso linear elastic registration zzso However, zzso registration is shown to have significant zzso error, zzso significant inconsistencies between zzso defined by different zzso zzso In contrast, zzso registration produces consistent correspondence between images in a group at the cost of slightly reduced zzso zzso accuracy compared to zzso zzso spatial zzso of the fractional zzso zzso maps of zzso is shown to have smaller zzso zzso compared with zzso methods using the same elastic registration zzso zzso of zzso data sets with zzso and visual tasks show that zzso zzso on average, increases the statistical zzso of brain zzso compared to zzso zzso
