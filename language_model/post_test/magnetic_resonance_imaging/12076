Advances in imaging techniques and computer software over the past decade now define brain abnormalities such as tumors in precise, three-dimensional zzso We have taken advantage of these technological improvements in designing a system capable of performing magnetic manipulation of an object in a zzso trajectory and able to deliver zzso to highly specific targets within the zzso This device relies on external magnets to pull a small metal zzso zzso through the brain, and on zzso zzso to zzso the zzso with respect to previously obtained magnetic resonance zzso A zzso tuned circuit serves as the zzso zzso and selectively zzso the zzso This paper describes experiments conducted in a series of dogs showing that all three components of the system zzso drive, zzso real time imaging, and zzso can be zzso zzso of the system was accomplished in one zzso These encouraging results need further detailed zzso in each of the zzso yet demonstrate the feasibility of such a zzso
