zzso iron oxide zzso particles are as MR contrast media composed of iron oxide zzso coated with zzso or zzso These particles are zzso by zzso zzso cells in normal zzso system zzso but are not retained in tumor zzso zzso there are significant differences in zzso relaxation between normal zzso tissue and tumors, which result in increased zzso zzso and zzso The introduction of zzso has been expected to substantially increase the zzso of zzso zzso For focal zzso zzso it has been documented that zzso MR imaging exhibits slightly better diagnostic performance than dynamic zzso CT in the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso A combination of dynamic and zzso MR imaging technique using zzso and zzso imaging criteria appears to provide clinically more useful patterns of zzso zzso MR imaging also provides information useful for differential diagnosis, via enhancement of zzso zzso With the exploitation of rapid zzso zzso zzso dynamic MR imaging may become comparable to zzso dynamic MR imaging and dynamic studies with zzso zzso zzso MR imaging plays an important role in therapeutic decision-making for patients with zzso
