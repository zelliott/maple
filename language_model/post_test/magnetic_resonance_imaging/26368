The clinical course of bilateral acoustic tumors associated with zzso zzso is generally zzso and no zzso treatment strategy has been zzso zzso results of bilateral acoustic tumors after zzso are reported zzso 

The current indications for zzso are 1) a growing tumor less than 30 zzso in mean diameter, 2) the zzso ear has no serviceable hearing, and 3) there is risk of brain stem zzso or brain stem zzso Twenty cases of bilateral acoustic tumors were treated with the gamma knife, including 7 males and 13 zzso The mean age was zzso years and the mean tumor size zzso zzso The tumors were treated with mean maximum and marginal doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among them, 12 patients had profound hearing loss in the zzso zzso ear, but the other 8 had serviceable zzso 

zzso treated with zzso showed central necrosis in zzso of the cases at 6 months and in zzso at 9 months after zzso zzso the tumors often demonstrated slow zzso The rate of tumor shrinkage was zzso at 12 months, zzso at 24 months, and almost zzso at 36 zzso At the last follow-up zzso zzso zzso the tumors demonstrated shrinkage in 50% and tumor control in zzso The zzso tumors were stable in 12 zzso and enlarged in 8 zzso Preservation of serviceable hearing zzso was obtained in zzso zzso of zzso facial nerve function, either in the natural course or as a complication, occurred in zzso 

Because of good tumor control and tumor shrinkage as well as an acceptable complication rate, zzso should be incorporated in the treatment strategy for bilateral acoustic tumors associated with zzso
