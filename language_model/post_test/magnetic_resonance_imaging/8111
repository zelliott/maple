In patients with zzso results, zzso zzso or zzso seizure zzso zzso monitoring is done to confirm the seizure zzso Our aim was to assess the yield of zzso recordings in patients with different clinical zzso 

The records of all patients who underwent prolonged zzso zzso monitoring zzso at the London Health Sciences Centre, University of Western Ontario, Canada, between 1993 and 1999, identified using our zzso patient database in continuous use since December 1972, were zzso Patients were analyzed in the following groups according to perceived increasing degrees of uncertainty of zzso zone zzso 1: zzso on zzso zzso with focal zzso and zzso scalp zzso but findings are subtle and of low level of certainty zzso group zzso focal zzso focal zzso and zzso zzso scalp zzso zzso group zzso focal zzso zzso or zzso scalp zzso zzso group zzso normal of zzso zzso focal zzso scalp zzso zzso group 5: zzso zzso zzso scalp zzso zzso and group zzso normal zzso zzso scalp zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso one patients underwent zzso at the London Health Sciences Centre between 1993 and zzso All patients had zzso zzso plus or minus secondary zzso zzso was helpful overall in zzso of patients, in zzso of group 1, zzso of group 2, zzso of group 3, zzso of group 4, 100 of group 5 and zzso of group zzso 

Our study shows that the yield of the zzso was higher in the groups of patients with lack of zzso between the zzso and the scalp zzso The yield was lower in patients with zzso but subtle or uncertain scalp zzso and zzso zzso
