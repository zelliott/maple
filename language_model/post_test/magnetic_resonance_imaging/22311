The present study provides a demonstration of zzso in two zzso patients who showed a visual spatial zzso effect across the vertical zzso despite their lack of visual awareness in one zzso Such an effect cannot be related to light diffusion onto the sighted zzso because it was not present when one of the stimuli fell into the retinal blind spot of control zzso We conclude that zzso phenomena of the simple type described in the present study can be zzso by zzso mechanisms and do not necessarily require cortical zzso
