The neural mechanisms underlying the process of understanding novel and conventional metaphoric expressions remain unclear largely because the specific brain regions that support the formation of novel semantic relations are still zzso A well established way to study distinct cognitive processes specifically associated with an event of interest is to repeatedly present the same zzso The aim of the current study is to examine the neural signatures associated with forming new metaphoric concepts by repeatedly presenting novel as well as conventional zzso In an zzso study, 11 subjects read novel and conventional zzso metaphoric expressions and decided whether the expressions were zzso Prior to the study, participants were presented with half of the conventional metaphors and half of the novel metaphoric zzso The present results revealed that whereas repeated exposure to conventional metaphors zzso repetition suppression within the left zzso zzso no brain areas showed repetition suppression effects during the repeated exposure of novel zzso However, repetition enhancement effects for novel metaphors were found in several brain areas including the bilateral inferior zzso zzso These findings suggest that the left and right zzso zzso are both involved in the zzso and the storage of novel semantic zzso This study is important to develop theoretical accounts of the formation of conceptual knowledge for both familiar and novel zzso
