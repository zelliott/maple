The purpose of this work was to compare the zzso profiles of volume flow in the left anterior descending artery zzso and the right coronary artery zzso and to assess the effect of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In eight healthy volunteers, MR zzso zzso zzso was applied with prospective zzso zzso zzso size of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity of 40 zzso and data acquisition time window of 64 zzso for zzso (3 zzso lines per zzso and 24 zzso for zzso zzso motion was measured from the magnitude zzso 

In the zzso zzso peak and mean flow values were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peak and mean flows were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso to zzso ratio was zzso for peak flow and zzso for mean zzso Mean flow through the cardiac cycle was zzso zzso In the zzso zzso peak and mean flow values were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso peak and mean flows were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso to zzso ratio was zzso for peak flow and zzso for mean zzso Mean flow through the cardiac cycle was zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the coronary artery zzso was zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the RCA zzso by peak values in zzso 

It is confirmed zzso with MR that the zzso shows a predominantly zzso flow, whereas the RCA shows about equal flow values in zzso and zzso zzso motion correction is required for assessing the true flow zzso The zzso zzso of the coronary artery zzso imply a maximum data acquisition time window, estimated at 58 zzso for the zzso and at 23 zzso for the zzso
