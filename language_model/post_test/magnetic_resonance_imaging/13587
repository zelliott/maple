zzso or stabilization of zzso plaques has been proposed as the mechanism responsible for the beneficial clinical effect of zzso zzso An imaging zzso able to zzso zzso plaque composition could potentially allow not only the identification of these vulnerable zzso zzso but also monitoring of the effects of therapeutic interventions on plaque zzso Our aim was to monitor changes in burden and composition of zzso plaques in a rabbit model of complex zzso using serial zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were induced in rabbits and the animals zzso to continue an zzso diet zzso zzso or resume normal zzso zzso zzso for 6 zzso zzso of the zzso was performed at 3 time points in each zzso as zzso zzso after zzso induction (9 months zzso and after zzso zzso or progression (15 months zzso zzso correlation with zzso was zzso There was a significant zzso reduction in zzso burden in the zzso group, and an increase in the progression zzso There was a significant zzso reduction in the zzso component of plaques in the zzso group, and an increase in the progression zzso A small, zzso increase in the zzso plaque components was noted in the zzso group, but a significant decrease in the zzso composition of zzso in the progression zzso A significant correlation zzso was found between zzso and zzso for zzso burden and plaque zzso 

These findings indicate that serial zzso zzso can monitor changes in zzso plaque composition under conditions of zzso progression and zzso
