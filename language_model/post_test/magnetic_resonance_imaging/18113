zzso refers to zzso disc swelling resulting from high zzso pressure zzso The precise mechanism by which zzso occurs remains zzso Although zzso zzso features associated with zzso are zzso it is unclear whether these findings correlate with visual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a condition in which the zzso pressure is elevated with no obvious cause, causing zzso and visual zzso The utility of zzso and zzso zzso findings as a surrogate marker for visual loss, or a predictor of visual loss, is zzso This retrospective zzso review aims to correlate parameters of visual function with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

Patients meeting criteria for zzso who had received zzso imaging within 4 weeks of examination were zzso Visual parameters of zzso grade, visual field mean zzso and visual acuity were correlated with zzso features, including zzso nerve zzso and zzso nerve sheath zzso among zzso All zzso scans were reviewed by a zzso blinded to clinical zzso zzso rank correlations and zzso were generated with zzso zzso 

Thirty five patients were zzso No significant relationships were found between the main visual parameters of zzso grade and visual field mean zzso and zzso zzso 

We found no significant correlation between visual parameters and imaging features of zzso This might indicate that zzso features may provide insight into the structural changes that occur in zzso but may not be helpful when making clinical management decisions for patients with zzso in particular, and zzso in zzso
