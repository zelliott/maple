We present a method to correct the geometric distortion caused by field zzso in MR images of patients wearing zzso zzso zzso Our previously published distortion correction method derives zzso error maps by computing the zzso of zzso images acquired at different zzso The time difference zzso TE zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso is chosen such that the water and fat signals are in zzso However, delta TE is long enough to permit phase wraps in the difference images for frequency zzso greater than 205 zzso Phase zzso techniques resolve these only for connected zzso therefore, the phase difference for zzso rods may be off by multiples of 2 zzso relative to the zzso We remove this uncertainty by using an additional single zzso zzso image with delta TE zzso 1 zzso (during which time no zzso are typically zzso to determine the correct multiple of 2 zzso for each zzso We tested our method in a zzso and in a patient using CT as the gold zzso zzso in the frame coordinates were chosen from CT and compared with their locations in zzso zzso errors using MR compared with CT were as large as zzso zzso before correction and were reduced to less than zzso zzso after zzso
