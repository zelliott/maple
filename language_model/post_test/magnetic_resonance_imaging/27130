Chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso and zzso transfer techniques provide unique and potentially quantitative contrast mechanisms in multiple zzso zzso However, the in zzso zzso of these techniques has been limited by the relatively slow zzso acquisition techniques, especially on zzso zzso zzso A new, rapid zzso imaging with zzso free zzso technique was developed to provide sensitive zzso contrast in zzso zzso In this study at 7 T with in zzso bovine zzso samples and initial in zzso results in a rat liver, the zzso imaging with zzso free zzso technique was shown to provide equivalent zzso sensitivity in comparison to a conventional zzso echo acquisition with a zzso reduction in acquisition zzso The sensitivity of the zzso imaging with zzso free zzso technique was also shown to be dependent on zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso providing a zzso increase in zzso sensitivity relative to linear zzso for 256 or more zzso zzso Overall, the zzso imaging with zzso free zzso acquisition technique provides a rapid and sensitive imaging platform with the potential to provide quantitative zzso and zzso transfer imaging zzso
