To analyze the relationship between lung motion and skin surface motion during zzso determine the uncertainties and zzso of such a relationship, and assess the potential of reducing internal target margin for gated zzso 

Three healthy volunteers and four lung cancer patients were recruited in a prospective imaging study using zzso to track the internal lung and external skin motion during zzso The relationship between the lung and skin motion was modeled using linear zzso zzso The slope of the linear fit and its confidence zzso were analyzed for different lung locations, skin surface locations, and breathing patterns from separate imaging zzso The margins of the internal target volume were calculated based on the residual lung motion during gating and its uncertainties from multiple treatment zzso for the gated zzso 

The slope and confidence zzso of the linear zzso from the motion analysis were uniquely defined by the locations of the zzso skin surface, and breathing zzso zzso significant differences were observed among individuals and between different times of zzso The normal zzso motion averaged from all volunteer and patient data was zzso zzso zzso zzso along the zzso zzso direction and zzso zzso zzso zzso along the zzso (AP) zzso With simulated respiratory zzso the average margin reduction was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, along the zzso and zzso directions (or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, relative to zzso zzso 

Because respiratory movement is rather complex, the relationship between the lung and skin surface motion is affected by many zzso and zzso zzso The reduction of internal target margin and efficacy of the zzso gating technique should be assessed for individual zzso
