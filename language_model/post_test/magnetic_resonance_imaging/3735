Depression has been associated with higher conversion rates from mild cognitive impairment zzso to Alzheimer's disease zzso and may be a marker of zzso zzso that can be used to identify individuals with zzso who are most likely to progress to zzso Thus, we examined the zzso changes associated with depressive symptoms in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative who had brain magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline and zzso follow-up were classified into depressed zzso zzso zzso zzso with other zzso symptoms zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groups based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to create individual three-dimensional maps of zzso brain changes that were compared between zzso 

zzso subjects had more frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso white matter zzso than zzso zzso Those whose depressive symptoms persisted over 2 years also had higher conversion to zzso and more decline on measures of global zzso language, and executive functioning compared with stable zzso zzso zzso with other zzso symptoms and zzso groups exhibited no differences in rates of zzso 

zzso symptoms were associated with greater zzso in zzso regions, increased cognitive decline, and higher rates of conversion to zzso Depression in individuals with zzso may be associated with underlying zzso changes, including zzso zzso and may be a potentially useful clinical marker in identifying zzso patients who are most likely to progress to zzso
