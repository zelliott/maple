To date, zzso has been the reference technique in the diagnosis of pancreatic duct zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso zzso a relatively new, zzso diagnostic method, in studying the pancreatic zzso 

A prospective zzso study was done of 78 patients with suspected zzso pathology and indications for zzso In all cases, zzso was performed zzso h before zzso Both techniques were used to assess the size of the pancreatic tract zzso or zzso the presence or absence of zzso the level of obstruction where present, and its zzso 

Both techniques found the pancreatic tract to be normal and zzso in 60 zzso The specificity and sensitivity of zzso in evaluating the normal pancreatic duct were zzso and zzso zzso In nine cases, a zzso duct of zzso was detected zzso at the head of the zzso and two in the zzso with the same correlation being shown by zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso relating to diffuse irregular and zzso zzso of the entire pancreatic duct was zzso and zzso zzso Nine patients were diagnosed with pancreatic zzso by both techniques, with an accuracy of zzso Four patients presented chronic zzso which was correctly diagnosed by zzso in each zzso 

zzso is an effective technique for evaluating both the normal and diseased duct of zzso and for establishing the underlying zzso
