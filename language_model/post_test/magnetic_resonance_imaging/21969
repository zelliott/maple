zzso infection often results in zzso brain zzso and white matter signal zzso zzso zzso resonance images were obtained from 31 zzso male patients and 10 high-risk zzso Variation within the zzso group on zzso zzso impairment and stage of systemic disease were relatively independent, allowing examination of the relative association of zzso measures with zzso impairment versus with systemic stage of zzso zzso patients compared to high-risk controls evidenced global zzso reduced zzso zzso volume, and a trend to gray matter volume loss but no difference in white matter volume or in zzso These effects were progressive with zzso clinical stage such that patients at zzso stage A had values very close to those of controls, while patients at zzso stage C had the most abnormal zzso In contrast, the relationship between these zzso variables and severity of zzso impairment was much less dramatic, with the mildly to moderately impaired zzso subjects showing zzso volume effects greater than or equal to those of the severely impaired zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso brain zzso secondary to zzso infection is not the primary zzso underlying the progressive zzso impairment in zzso zzso
