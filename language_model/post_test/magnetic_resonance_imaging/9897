: Total tissue sodium zzso content is associated with the viability of cells and can be assessed by Na magnetic resonance zzso However, the resulting total sodium signal zzso represents a zzso average of different sodium compartments assigned to the zzso and zzso zzso In addition to the zzso weighted contrast of zzso imaging, zzso zzso sequences were zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of zzso imaging for tissue characterization and putative additional benefits to zzso zzso 

: For zzso and zzso imaging, novel magnetic resonance imaging sequences were established and applied in 16 patients suffering from brain tumors zzso WHO grade zzso and 2 zzso All Na sequences were based on zzso three-dimensional zzso projection reconstruction to obtain short echo times and high zzso ratio zzso 

: zzso imaging revealed increased signal zzso in 15 of 16 brain tumors before zzso In addition, zzso imaging enabled further differentiation of these zzso all zzso demonstrated higher zzso signal zzso as compared with WHO grade zzso zzso Thus, zzso imaging allowed for correct separation between WHO grade zzso and WHO grade IV zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso the zzso signal correlated with the zzso proliferation rate of tumor zzso 

: These results serve as a proof of concept that zzso imaging reveals important zzso tissue characteristics different from zzso zzso Furthermore, they indicate that the combined use of zzso and zzso imaging might add valuable information for the functional in zzso characterization of brain zzso
