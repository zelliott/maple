zzso involving the jugular zzso are rare zzso with approximately 34 cases reported in the English zzso zzso these tumors mimic the more common zzso zzso zzso After surgical zzso zzso have worse zzso nerve outcomes and higher recurrence rates than zzso zzso There is controversy regarding the selection of surgical approach, particularly with regard to management of the facial zzso A reliable means of accurate zzso diagnosis would help surgical planning and patient zzso 

We present a series of six consecutive large jugular zzso zzso zzso by a single surgeon from 1996 to zzso 

zzso case series zzso zzso 

The zzso diagnosis was correct in nearly all zzso cases on the basis of the characteristic imaging findings seen with a combination of zzso bone dedicated zzso zzso and high-resolution enhanced magnetic resonance zzso Five of six patients had lateral facial nerve zzso zzso zzso Fisch type zzso and three patients also had zzso zzso zzso approach with division of greater superficial zzso zzso Total tumor removal was accomplished in zzso One patient suffered recurrence over a mean follow-up period of zzso zzso New zzso vocal zzso zzso occurred in 50% of patients, and all required vocal zzso zzso At 1 year, 50% of patients had normal or near normal zzso I or zzso facial zzso zzso zzso fluid leaks occurred in two patients, and both eventually required zzso zzso 

zzso involving the jugular zzso are surgically challenging tumors that pose unique diagnostic zzso The majority of these zzso can be completely zzso A relatively high zzso complication rate, which can be controlled with appropriate intervention, is seen with these zzso
