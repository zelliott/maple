zzso zzso for low cognitive performance and depression, common long-term central nervous zzso changes in patients with type 1 diabetes zzso have not yet been zzso 

To investigate whether prefrontal zzso levels are higher in patients with type 1 diabetes and whether an zzso is related to lower cognitive performance and zzso 

zzso zzso 

General clinical research zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with adult type 1 diabetes with varying degrees of lifetime zzso control and 38 healthy zzso 

With the use of zzso magnetic resonance zzso prefrontal zzso acid zzso levels were compared between patients and control zzso zzso between prefrontal zzso levels and cognitive function and between zzso levels and mild depressive symptoms were assessed in patients with type 1 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso higher in adult patients with type 1 diabetes than in healthy control zzso There were positive linear trends for the effects of lifetime zzso control on prefrontal zzso levels zzso for trend zzso zzso zzso performances in memory, executive function, and zzso speed were lower in patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than in control zzso Higher prefrontal zzso zzso in patients were associated with lower performance in assessment of global cognitive function zzso change in zzso score per zzso increase in zzso as well as with mild zzso 

The high prefrontal zzso levels documented in this study may play an important role in the genesis of the low cognitive performance and mild depression frequently observed in patients with type 1 zzso zzso options that alter zzso zzso may be of benefit in treating central nervous zzso changes in patients with adult type 1 zzso
