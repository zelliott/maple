The aim of this study was to assess zzso function at school age in children who had cerebral zzso on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Twenty-two children with evidence of cerebral zzso on zzso brain zzso (18 with zzso zzso and 4 with zzso zzso were assessed at school age with a structured zzso examination and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, a battery of tests designed to assess motor zzso 

Of the 22 children, 6 zzso had zzso and a further 7 zzso showed some zzso zzso such as asymmetry on the zzso examination zzso zzso 4) or poor scores on the zzso test without any sign of asymmetry zzso zzso zzso The remaining 9 children had a normal motor zzso zzso was found only in children who had zzso involvement of hemisphere, internal zzso and zzso zzso on brain zzso Children with involvement of the internal zzso associated either with zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not show zzso but still had motor zzso 

Our results suggest that although zzso occurs in a relatively small proportion of children with zzso cerebral zzso other signs of zzso impairment can be present, and these become more obvious at school age when a more specific assessment can be zzso These results also suggest that the involvement of the internal capsule on zzso zzso can predict the presence of these zzso
