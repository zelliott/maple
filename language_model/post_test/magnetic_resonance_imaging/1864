The representations that mediate the coding of spatial position were examined by comparing the behavior of patients with left zzso neglect with that of zzso control zzso To determine the spatial coordinate zzso used to define zzso and zzso eye movements were measured for targets that appeared at 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees to the relative left or right defined with respect to the zzso of the eyes, head, or zzso plane of the zzso In the baseline condition, in which the various zzso zzso were all aligned with the environmental zzso patients were disproportionately slower at initiating zzso to left than right targets, relative to the zzso When either the trunk or the head was rotated and the zzso aligned with the most peripheral position while the eyes remained aligned with the zzso of the environment, the results did not differ from the baseline zzso However, when the eyes were rotated and the zzso aligned with the peripheral position, zzso reaction time zzso differed significantly from the zzso especially when the eyes were rotated to the zzso These findings suggest that target position is coded relative to the current position of gaze zzso and that this zzso coding is modulated by zzso position zzso zzso The findings dovetail well with results from existing zzso studies and shed further light on the spatial representations zzso by the human zzso zzso
