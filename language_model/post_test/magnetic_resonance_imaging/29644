zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been used to investigate zzso of the auditory zzso however, assessment of zzso in the zzso auditory zzso has been zzso The aim of this study was to examine neural zzso of cortical and zzso auditory zzso evoked by zzso stimulus using silent zzso 

Prospective zzso 

zzso zzso volunteers (7 male, 10 zzso age range, zzso zzso underwent silent zzso An zzso was used to deliver pure tones of 1000 zzso to the left zzso zzso tones were presented at hearing thresholds determined in the zzso Brain regions showing increased zzso during zzso stimulus presentation were mapped and auditory zzso exceeding P zzso were included in the zzso 

zzso stimuli evoked bilateral zzso in cortical regions of the zzso and superior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso structures included the zzso zzso body, inferior zzso lateral zzso superior zzso complex, and cochlear zzso 

Silent functional magnetic resonance imaging findings documented the feasibility of detecting zzso zzso by pure tone along the cortical and zzso auditory zzso The use of this technique in the assessment of disorders with auditory dysfunction merits further zzso
