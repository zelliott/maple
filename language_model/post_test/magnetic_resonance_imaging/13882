zzso for the presence and severity of zzso of the zzso zzso by two-dimensional zzso alone can be zzso The purpose of this study was to use zzso zzso and pressure zzso zzso in zzso and zzso to estimate zzso zzso zzso zzso of children with suspected zzso and either an zzso zzso or zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso performed within 1 month of the zzso were zzso Patients with patent zzso zzso significant zzso zzso long zzso zzso or zzso outside the zzso were zzso Measured zzso zzso zzso for heart rate, included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso and zzso pressure zzso zzso For each of these zzso sensitivity and specificity to detect a significant zzso were zzso A significant zzso was defined as a ratio of the zzso diameter to the zzso zzso diameter of zzso zzso as zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and pressure zzso were found not to be significant zzso for zzso For the zzso zzso zzso using a critical value of zzso 200 zzso zzso we found a positive zzso value of zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso The zzso zzso using a critical value of zzso 75 zzso zzso demonstrated positive and negative zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso is a useful predictor for significant zzso but the zzso zzso has an improved positive zzso value for detection of significant zzso zzso zzso of zzso or pressure zzso are not adequate to assess severity of zzso
