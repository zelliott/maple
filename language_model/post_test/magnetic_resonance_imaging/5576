The objective of this study was to investigate the usefulness of virtual MR zzso as an adjunct to conventional MR zzso in detecting various zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The study group was composed of 28 patients zzso men and six zzso mean age, 25 zzso who underwent direct MR zzso of the shoulder as well as zzso due to zzso shoulder zzso MR zzso examinations were reviewed zzso with zzso blinded to the zzso zzso zzso MR zzso was produced from zzso zzso zzso echo MR zzso using zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for diagnosis were zzso The diagnostic performances were validated by receiver operating characteristic curve zzso 

The structure of the zzso zzso was well zzso in a zzso perspective, and characterization of the injured anterior zzso zzso was aided by adjunct use of virtual MR zzso The accuracy for detecting classic zzso anterior zzso zzso sleeve zzso and Perthes zzso improved to zzso zzso and zzso respectively, with adjunct virtual MR zzso with MR zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso respectively, with MR zzso zzso A statistically significant improvement of the diagnostic capability of MR zzso with adjunct virtual MR zzso was proven for the detection of a classic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Having a zzso perspective to validate chronic zzso zzso zzso injuries of the shoulder facilitated understanding of the zzso relationships and helped zzso zzso virtual MR zzso is potentially useful for detecting and characterizing chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso to improve zzso
