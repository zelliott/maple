With the increasing popularity of zzso treatment for zzso zzso zzso in children, zzso acid zzso zzso implants are more frequently detected by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Such findings on zzso may be zzso and lead to unnecessary zzso The objective of this study was to characterize the appearance of zzso implants on zzso 

Between July 2001 and November 2007, hospital charts of patients with a history of zzso injection for zzso were evaluated to identify those who had subsequent zzso zzso The indications were determined, and the appearance of zzso implants analyzed and compared to findings on zzso zzso zzso and kidney zzso zzso zzso 

Of zzso patients who underwent zzso treatment for zzso subsequently 16 patients zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso implants were identified on zzso as bright structures on zzso sequences zzso Neither zzso images nor zzso MR zzso zzso the zzso zzso which did not enhance with zzso zzso was not detected by kidney zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso and more reliably ultrasound could identify zzso 

zzso implants appear on zzso as bright structures on zzso zzso History of zzso treatment and the presence of a single urinary system should provide reassurance and prevent inappropriate intervention for zzso zzso
