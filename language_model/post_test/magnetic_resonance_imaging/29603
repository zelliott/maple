zzso for radiation ports in zzso radiation therapy for zzso cancer are mainly based on analysis of recurrence zzso To evaluate whether changes in surgical technique have influenced this pattern of zzso a zzso retrospective analysis was carried out on a patient population treated zzso 

123 patients were evaluated with the help of a zzso zzso 3-D data file system and an extensive zzso Major inclusion criteria (one zzso for eligibility were: zzso confirmation, clear bone destruction, and a positive PET zzso or at least three minor criteria: progressive soft tissue mass, invasion of adjacent zzso on follow-up CT or zzso rising tumor zzso and typical appearance in zzso zzso Clinical or zzso signs of inflammation were exclusion zzso 

Initially, zzso of the evaluated patients were zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso were distributed zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and T4 in zzso the zzso ratio was zzso zzso tumors were mainly situated in the zzso part of the zzso pelvis as displayed in the zzso When zzso zzso was compared to low anterior zzso as primary operation, there was a significant difference in extension of zzso tumors in the inferior parts of the pelvis zzso in all statistical tests zzso whereas no significant difference was found in the superior parts of the zzso 

Based on these results, a modest field size reduction in zzso zzso for zzso cancer seems zzso offering the perspective of a reduction in acute and late side zzso
