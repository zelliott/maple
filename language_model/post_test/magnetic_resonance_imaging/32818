The human zzso visual stream contains regions that respond selectively to faces over zzso However, it is unknown whether responses in these regions correlate with how zzso stimuli zzso Here, we use zzso face zzso to manipulate the perceived zzso of stimuli and measure responses in zzso and zzso zzso regions with high-resolution zzso We first use zzso zzso zzso sampling to define face zzso at different distances from the zzso zzso zzso rate the stimuli as progressively more zzso the closer they are to the zzso zzso Paradoxically, responses in both zzso and zzso regions decrease as zzso ratings zzso Because zzso sampling produces blocks of stimuli whose zzso is zzso correlated with zzso this effect may be driven by more adaptation during high zzso zzso blocks than during low zzso zzso zzso We tested this hypothesis by measuring responses to zzso zzso blocks of stimuli with similar zzso ratings as with zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso we find a zzso effect: responses in zzso regions gradually increase with perceived zzso but responses in zzso regions are zzso Our studies provide novel evidence that zzso responses correlate with the perceived zzso of zzso but this effect is revealed only when image zzso is controlled across zzso Finally, our data show that zzso is a powerful factor that drives responses across the zzso zzso This indicates that controlling zzso across conditions should be a critical tool in future zzso studies of face and object zzso
