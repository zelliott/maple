zzso is a major complication of different diseases affecting both the central and peripheral nervous zzso zzso sensory impairment is one of the main features of zzso zzso Therefore an objective technique to examine the cortical processing of zzso sensory input would be a helpful diagnostic tool in this zzso We developed a simple paradigm to perform zzso stimulation to both sides of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to study changes in cortical zzso during this zzso stimulation in nine healthy zzso Data were analyzed by means of synthetic zzso zzso zzso and the group analysis of individual SAM data was performed using a zzso zzso 

Our results revealed bilateral zzso of the zzso primary zzso zzso following sensory zzso stimulation with a slight zzso to the side of zzso 

The method introduced here is simple and easy to perform and might be zzso in the clinical zzso The results are in keeping with previous findings showing zzso involvement in the complex task of sensory zzso zzso They might also explain changes in zzso after zzso zzso The zzso zzso processing is surprising and needs further zzso
