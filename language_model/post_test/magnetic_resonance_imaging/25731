To study the parameters of the zzso fat zzso pulse zzso pulse flip angle zzso and zzso delay zzso in order to identify values that provide optimal vessel zzso 

zzso zzso of three healthy subjects were zzso 

The optimal values for the zzso and zzso were 60 degrees zzso degrees, zzso degrees, zzso degrees, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso At these values there was a zzso increase zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso in the zzso ratio between the left internal carotid artery and fat compared to the study without fat zzso A zzso increase was noted for the smaller left zzso zzso Additionally, there was no statistically significant reduction in the zzso zzso ratio nor in the absolute vessel zzso ratio at these zzso 

Implementation of fat zzso into carotid MR zzso markedly improves zzso of vascular anatomy without increasing imaging zzso
