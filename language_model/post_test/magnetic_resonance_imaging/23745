The purpose of this work was to study the efficacy of zzso zzso as a salvage treatment in patients with locally persistent and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Between March 1996 and August 1997, 10 patients with locally persistent or zzso zzso were treated by zzso zzso zzso Four patients had zzso for persistent disease after a first course of zzso 3 had zzso as a boost after zzso for local zzso and 3 had zzso for disease that recurred after zzso The tumor volume ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment was prescribed at zzso zzso line and ranged from 12 to 18 zzso zzso zzso with a mean tumor surface dose ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso The median clinical follow-up was zzso months zzso zzso and the median imaging follow-up was zzso months zzso zzso 

One patient had complete zzso of tumor after zzso five had reduction in tumor size, three had no change, and one had progression of zzso The overall response rate to zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso developing zzso zzso Excluding patients receiving zzso as a boost treatment after zzso the response rate was 57% zzso and none developed zzso zzso Only one patient developed a new zzso zzso in the absence of disease zzso 

In selected patients with locally persistent or zzso zzso zzso zzso can be considered as a salvage treatment with good short-term local zzso The complications appear to be minimal except for treating recurrence in the cavernous zzso Early results are encouraging although more experience and longer follow-up are still needed to better define the role of zzso in the management of persistent and zzso zzso
