The causes of zzso the correlation between serum levels of zzso and zzso function and magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso were studied in patients with chronic zzso zzso female patients and 15 normal control women participated in this clinical zzso Fourteen of 74 patients with various zzso conditions had increased serum zzso The zzso of hyperprolactinemia in the overt primary zzso group was zzso and was significantly higher than in any other group with normal serum zzso There was a close association between the zzso in serum zzso and of free zzso above the zzso level after zzso zzso There were 14 patients with hyperprolactinemia in three of which serum zzso was over 60 zzso zzso producing zzso severe primary zzso and liver zzso were detected in these three patients, zzso These results indicate that the zzso of increased serum zzso was not uniform in patients with zzso zzso although there was a correlation between hyperprolactinemia and impaired zzso zzso It is proposed, therefore, to measure and follow serum levels of zzso and zzso of the zzso in patients with chronic zzso especially with impaired zzso zzso
