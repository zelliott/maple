zzso MR imaging with blood oxygen zzso zzso contrast enhancement is believed to rely on changes in cerebral blood flow and zzso level to estimate the location and degree of neural zzso We studied the relationship between neural zzso and the observed zzso response by using zzso an zzso of the zzso neurotransmitter zzso and a potent inhibitor of the zzso response to neural zzso 

Using a rat model with electrical zzso zzso we performed zzso zzso before and after the systemic injection of either zzso zzso zzso or an equivalent volume of zzso Changes in the zzso response were zzso by determining the number of activated zzso and the zzso of the zzso response for each animal in the zzso and saline zzso 

The zzso group had a significantly zzso zzso response zzso increased activated zzso count and zzso increased zzso response zzso at 45 and 60 minutes after systemic injection compared with zzso The response of the zzso control group did not change zzso 

The administration of systemic zzso significantly zzso the zzso response due to either an zzso of resting zzso levels or the zzso effect of zzso This effect potentially could be used in human zzso studies to increase the sensitivity of the zzso zzso
