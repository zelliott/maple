To compare the sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso of ultrasound zzso and zzso in evaluation of pregnant patients with a clinical suspicion of zzso 

A total of 33 pregnant patients with suspected zzso underwent US and zzso The original imaging reports generated at the time of presentation were used for data zzso zzso reports were used for disease confirmation in patients who underwent zzso When surgery was not performed, a medical record review was zzso The sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso were calculated for US and zzso in the diagnosis of zzso 

Five of the 33 patients had zzso zzso Four of the five patients with zzso were correctly diagnosed at zzso while one was interpreted as indeterminate zzso not zzso At zzso one was correctly zzso one was incorrectly diagnosed as normal, and three were interpreted as indeterminate zzso not zzso In 13 patients, a normal appendix was diagnosed at zzso none of whom had zzso In three patients, a normal appendix was diagnosed at zzso one of whom had zzso When the appendix was zzso at zzso the sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso for the diagnosis of zzso was zzso for all zzso When the appendix was zzso at zzso the sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso for the diagnosis of zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Based on a relatively small number of zzso our data suggests that zzso is very useful for the diagnosis and exclusion of zzso in pregnant zzso
