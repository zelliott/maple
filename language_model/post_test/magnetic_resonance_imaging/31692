Research on zzso zzso transmission has emphasized the importance of increased zzso zzso cell firing in the presence of unpredictable zzso Using zzso zzso we previously reported that zzso transmission was both suppressed and enhanced in different regions of the zzso during an unpredictable reward task zzso zzso zzso zzso El zzso zzso Gunn, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso transmission in the human zzso during monetary reward zzso zzso zzso 24, zzso However, it was unclear if reductions in zzso release during this task reflected a response to the high proportion of zzso trials, and whether the behavioral demands of the task influenced the observed zzso To test these issues, we presented 10 healthy subjects with an automated zzso zzso wheel game in which the amount of reward and its timing were unpredictable and the rewarding trials greatly outnumbered the zzso zzso As in the previous study, zzso transmission in the zzso was significantly suppressed relative to a predictable control zzso A similar suppression occurred when subjects were presented with temporally unpredictable novel pictures and zzso At present, models of zzso functioning during reward do not account for this suppression, but given that it has been observed in two different studies using different reward zzso this phenomenon warrants zzso Neither the unpredictable reward nor the novelty conditions produced consistent increases in zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that active behavioral engagement may be necessary to observe robust zzso increases in zzso release in the zzso
