Corpus zzso zzso the largest compact white matter fiber bundle of the human brain involved in zzso transfer, is frequently damaged in the course of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso impairment is one of the factors affecting quality of life of patients with benign zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the cognitive profile of zzso patients and the extent of tissue damage in the zzso Brain conventional and zzso zzso scans were acquired from 54 zzso patients and 21 healthy zzso zzso tests zzso exploring memory, attention, and frontal lobe cognitive zzso were administered to the zzso zzso zzso was used to calculate the mean zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso of the zzso normal appearing white matter zzso An index of zzso zzso was also zzso Nine zzso zzso patients fulfilled criteria for cognitive zzso Compared with controls, zzso had significantly different zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with cognitively preserved patients, those with zzso had significantly higher zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso MD zzso zzso zzso The scores obtained at zzso were significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and MD zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso P values ranging from zzso to zzso zzso impairment in zzso is associated with the extent of zzso damage in terms of both focal zzso and diffuse fiber bundle zzso zzso assessment of topographical distribution of tissue damage may represent a rewarding strategy for understanding the subtle clinical deficits of patients with zzso
