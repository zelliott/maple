The purpose of this study was to zzso in anterior cruciate ligament zzso and zzso population, zzso plateau zzso variables zzso and lateral zzso plateau slopes zzso and zzso and zzso zzso plateau depth zzso on conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso using a novel combined method and to determine whether these variables are risk factors for zzso zzso 

zzso isolated zzso patients (20 women and 53 zzso were compared with 51 control group patients (19 women and 32 zzso 

The combined method had very high zzso and zzso reliability compared with previously described zzso zzso was significantly steeper in the overall injured group and injured men compared with the control group, with odds ratio zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Women with zzso injury had significantly zzso zzso than zzso women, with OR of zzso 

We conclude that the new combined method is accurate and zzso for assessing the zzso plateau zzso Women with zzso zzso and men with steeper zzso are at higher risk of sustaining zzso zzso Overall, steeper zzso is a significant risk factor for sustaining zzso zzso
