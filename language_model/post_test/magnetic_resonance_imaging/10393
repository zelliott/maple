zzso invasive neurosurgery requires methods to specify surgical boundaries of target zzso such as brain zzso This study investigated technical possibilities and clinical usefulness of adapting zzso attenuated inversion recovery zzso pulse sequences to suppress magnetic resonance signal from cerebral zzso in brain tumor zzso 

A zzso zzso magnetic resonance scanner with zzso inversion recovery sequences was zzso zzso separate scanning tests in 25 zzso brain tumor patients were performed on the day before zzso An inversion recovery sequence with several inversion times between 150 and 2,200 zzso was zzso The same sequences were also used zzso and zzso 

zzso relaxation time of brain zzso varied from case to zzso An inversion recovery sequence with an inversion time of zzso milliseconds attenuated brain zzso and seemed to help in zzso gross brain tumor for surgical zzso These features were helpful for the evaluation of zzso tumor tissue particularly using zzso zzso 

According to these preliminary findings, inversion recovery sequences supplement other imaging zzso and assist zzso in evaluating different surgical zzso and in zzso brain tumor volume before zzso
