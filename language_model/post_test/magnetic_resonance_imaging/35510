To present a novel fully automated method for assessing the quality of magnetic resonance imaging zzso data acquired in a clinical trials zzso 

This work was performed in the context of clinical trials for multiple zzso Quality control zzso procedures included were: zzso patient brain identity zzso zzso zzso zzso matching, zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso detection of zzso due to head zzso Each zzso procedure produces a quantitative measurement which is compared against an acceptance threshold that was determined based on receiver operating characteristic analysis of traditional manual and visual zzso performed by trained zzso 

The automated zzso results have high sensitivity and specificity when compared with the visual zzso 

Our automated objective zzso procedure can replace many manual zzso procedures to provide increased data zzso while reducing reader zzso
