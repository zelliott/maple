The aim of this work is to study the regional zzso zzso by zzso early after zzso zzso zzso and to compare it with regional zzso This prospective work has included 15 patients with acute first zzso zzso that was zzso zzso A zzso zzso was performed between zzso and zzso after zzso zzso The regional zzso zzso was evaluated from zzso zzso For the study of zzso zzso the first pass of the contrast agent was zzso from zzso of the signal evolution versus zzso The signal enhancement on late images acquired 10 minutes after the zzso of the contrast agent was also zzso Among zzso studied zzso zzso those with a normal zzso first pass curve had a relative zzso of 46 zzso zzso The segments with a severely reduced first pass kinetic have a markedly reduced relative zzso zzso zzso zzso in relation with zzso zzso The zzso enhancement is frequently seen in the zzso territory and appears related to a reduced regional zzso The zzso is enhanced on late images in zzso of the normally zzso zzso These segments have a mildly reduced wall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso appears to depend both on the zzso zzso which reflects the zzso and on the zzso enhancement which is linked to zzso structural zzso zzso appears to be an adequate method to evaluate these abnormalities and allows an easy assessment of the zzso phenomenon, if zzso
