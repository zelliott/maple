Before the advent of MR imaging, zzso zzso were difficult to diagnose zzso Among the invasive procedures used were contrast zzso and CT zzso MR imaging, with its zzso imaging capabilities, excellent depiction of tissue contrast, and versatile zzso is an important tool in the assessment of zzso zzso zzso We investigated the role of three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state zzso MR sequences in the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso 

The study group comprised 11 patients with zzso zzso zzso MR studies included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All images were obtained on a zzso zzso MR zzso The routine and zzso sequences were reviewed and interpreted separately by two zzso 

All patients underwent surgery for zzso of zzso zzso zzso Eight patients had zzso in the fourth zzso two in the lateral zzso and one in the third zzso zzso zzso images showed the zzso wall in nine cases, the zzso in four, and the zzso fluid in zzso zzso zzso images showed the zzso wall and zzso in three and four cases, zzso The routine sequences did not show the zzso zzso wall, or zzso fluid together in any of the 11 zzso zzso images showed the zzso in all 11 patients and the zzso wall and zzso fluid in eight patients zzso In seven of the 11 patients, zzso images showed the zzso zzso wall, and fluid zzso 

The zzso sequence is more sensitive and specific than routine zzso sequences in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso
