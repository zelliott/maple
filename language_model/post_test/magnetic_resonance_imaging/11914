The effect of slice orientation on zzso and sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso using a motor task has been investigated in six normal zzso Four slice zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We applied analysis of zzso zzso to zzso zzso statistics to zzso zzso in zzso between zzso and between zzso We also assessed signal detection accuracy in zzso across the whole brain by using a finite mixture model to fit receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso to the zzso zzso findings suggest that zzso cluster characteristics demonstrate high motor zzso across subjects and zzso although a significant difference between slice zzso in number of activated zzso was demonstrated in left motor zzso but not zzso zzso zzso differences are highlighted in the zzso zzso which are not obvious by zzso the zzso zzso slice orientation offers the highest signal detection zzso whereas zzso slices give the zzso
