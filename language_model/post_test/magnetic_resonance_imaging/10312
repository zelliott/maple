This study aimed to investigate the zzso of using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis for zzso skeletal muscle volume zzso in the zzso defined as the body segment from the zzso process to the greater zzso Using a magnetic resonance imaging zzso method, the trunk zzso was determined in 28 men (19 approximately 34 zzso divided into validation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 8) groups, and used as a reference zzso For zzso zzso of the zzso the source zzso were placed at the zzso surface of the third zzso bone of both hands and the zzso surface of the third zzso bone of both feet, and the detector zzso were placed at the zzso process of both shoulders and the greater zzso of both zzso Using this arrangement, the zzso values of five parts of the zzso both sides of the upper region, the middle region, and both sides of the lower region, were obtained and then used to calculate the whole trunk zzso value and zzso index zzso zzso In the validation group, a simple zzso analysis of the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso showed a significant correlation between the two variables zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and produced a prediction equation with a zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the validation and zzso groups, there were no significant differences between the measured and estimated zzso without systematic zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso analysis employed in the present study can be used to estimate trunk zzso
