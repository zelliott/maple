We report a case of adrenal zzso with organizing zzso mimicking zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso demonstrated zzso zzso on heavily zzso zzso On dynamic zzso zzso the zzso demonstrated early, zzso peripheral enhancement with subsequent zzso that zzso Chemical shift zzso images failed to demonstrate the presence of zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging failed to characterize the zzso and an erroneous zzso diagnosis of adrenal zzso was zzso Although the zzso findings reflected the organized zzso with abundant vascular spaces, our case emphasizes the point that the zzso characteristics of zzso zzso may overlap with those of adrenal zzso and chronic expanding zzso
