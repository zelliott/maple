Spinal burst fractures are produced by rapid zzso zzso and may result in spinal zzso injury from bone fragments forced from the zzso body into the spinal zzso This fracture is one of the most difficult injuries of the spine to successfully treat, in part because the zzso of reduction and the exact mechanism by which the distraction forces are transmitted to the zzso fragments of the burst fracture have not been adequately zzso The authors developed a zzso technique for creating these fractures in zzso The fractures produced were identical to those observed in clinical practice, and were used for investigating the mechanics of this fracture and its zzso This work describes the zzso anatomy of the burst fracture both on the gross structure and also on zzso sections of the zzso and examines the zzso of fracture zzso The margins of the zzso bone fragment, which was forced zzso into the spinal canal during zzso were noted to extend far zzso beyond the zzso The authors also found extensive damage not only to the disc above the injured level, but also to that below, explaining the clinical observation that disc zzso frequently occurs at both zzso zzso of zzso data provided by zzso section supported the hypothesis that the fibers that actually reduce the zzso zzso originate in the zzso of the superior vertebra in the zzso of the zzso and insert into the lateral margins of the zzso zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging confirmed that these obliquely directed fibers account for the indirect reduction of the zzso The zzso studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso ligament provides only a minor contribution in the reduction of the fracture in comparison to the attachments of the zzso portion of the zzso zzso The forces required to reduce this zzso were zzso zzso was found to be the zzso force required for indirect zzso zzso This was confirmed by a series of tests using devices that provided zzso zzso The application of uniform distraction forces was most effective in the zzso reduction of the zzso zzso
