The purpose of this study was to establish MR zzso criteria for discriminating benign from zzso zzso zzso tumors of the zzso 

Thirty-one patients with 34 zzso zzso tumors underwent MR zzso zzso were classified as either main duct type zzso zzso 10) or branch duct type zzso zzso zzso In patients with the main duct type, the maximum diameter and the location of the main pancreatic zzso the extent of main pancreatic duct zzso and the presence of a filling zzso were zzso For branch duct type, the location and maximum diameter of the zzso zzso the presence of a filling zzso and the presence of associated main pancreatic duct zzso were zzso 

In patients with the main duct type, the main pancreatic duct was significantly zzso when associated with benign rather than zzso zzso All zzso tumors showed diffuse main pancreatic duct zzso whereas all benign tumors showed zzso zzso Among patients with branch duct type, the zzso was smaller when it was a benign rather than zzso zzso All but one zzso tumor showed mild associated main pancreatic duct zzso whereas benign tumors were not associated with main pancreatic duct zzso Filling defects suggested zzso although half of the zzso tumors had no filling zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso tumors of the zzso filling defects are indicative of zzso zzso main pancreatic duct zzso greater than 15 zzso zzso duct zzso or any main pancreatic duct zzso zzso duct zzso is strongly associated with zzso
