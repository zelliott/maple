Previous zzso studies show that women with eating disorders zzso have differential neural zzso to viewing food zzso However, despite clinical differences in their responses to food, differential neural zzso to thinking about eating food, between women with anorexia zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is not zzso 

We compare 50 women (8 with zzso 18 with AN and 24 zzso healthy controls zzso while they view food images during functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso 

In response to food zzso zzso images, women with zzso showed greater neural zzso in the visual cortex, right zzso prefrontal cortex, right insular zzso and zzso zzso women with AN showed greater zzso in the right zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso and right zzso HC women activated the zzso right insular cortex, right zzso zzso lobe and left zzso zzso comparisons revealed that compared to zzso the zzso group showed relative zzso in the bilateral superior zzso zzso and visual cortex, and compared to AN had relative zzso in the zzso lobe and zzso zzso zzso cortex, but greater zzso in the zzso superior zzso zzso right zzso and supplementary motor zzso 

Women with AN and zzso activate zzso cognitive control in response to food images, yet women with zzso have increased zzso in reward and zzso regions, which might impinge on cognitive control over food consumption and binge zzso
