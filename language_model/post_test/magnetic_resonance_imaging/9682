To determine safe surgical margins for soft tissue zzso it is essential to perform a general evaluation of the extent of zzso responses to auxiliary therapy, and other factors preoperatively using multiple types of diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a tool for diagnostic imaging that has recently spread rapidly in clinical zzso At present, the roles played by zzso in determination of margins for surgical zzso of zzso are zzso The present study was undertaken to explore the roles of zzso in determination of surgical margins for soft tissue zzso and to examine whether PET can serve as a standard means for setting the margins of surgical zzso during reduced zzso 

The study involved 7 patients with zzso who underwent surgery in our department and in whom evaluation with zzso was zzso zzso was zzso rated as zzso in 6 cases and zzso in 1 zzso In all cases, zzso was superficial zzso or zzso The tumor border was defined by zzso zzso and zzso were measured at intervals of 1 zzso over a zzso long area from the tumor zzso zzso of viable tumor cells was carried out on zzso sections of zzso zzso and zzso were compared with zzso zzso 

zzso maximum zzso zzso of the tumor averaged zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso from the tumor border, zzso zzso at 2 zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso zzso at 4 zzso and zzso zzso at 5 zzso When zzso tissue was zzso tumor cells were absent in the areas where zzso was below zzso 

Our findings suggest that a safe surgical margin free of viable tumor cells can be ensured if the zzso zzso level is set at zzso zzso is promising as a diagnostic imaging technique for setting of safe minimal margins for surgical zzso of soft tissue zzso
