A novel zzso paradigm was employed to investigate conceptual expansion, a central component of creative zzso Participants were presented with word pairs, consisting of everyday objects and uses for these objects, which had to be judged based on the two defining criteria of creative zzso zzso and zzso Three zzso trial types resulted from this zzso high unusual and low appropriate zzso zzso low unusual and high appropriate zzso zzso and high unusual and high appropriate zzso zzso Word pairs of the creative uses type are held to passively induce conceptual zzso The zzso component was not specifically modulated by conceptual expansion but was, instead, generally responsive as a function of zzso or novelty of the stimuli zzso zzso analyses in a later time window zzso zzso revealed that zzso activity in this phase indexes appropriateness zzso In the discussion of these findings with reference to the literature on semantic zzso both components are proposed as indexing processes relevant to conceptual expansion as they are selectively involved in the zzso and integration of a newly established semantic connection between two previously unrelated zzso
