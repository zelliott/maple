The purpose of this study was to assess zzso zzso in children with a newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic brain stem zzso zzso and to investigate associations with zzso survival zzso overall survival zzso and zzso zzso 

Two zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso therapeutic trials in children with newly diagnosed zzso were designed to test radiation therapy combined with zzso targeted agents zzso phase zzso study of zzso zzso phase zzso study of zzso zzso brain zzso PET scans were obtained in 40 children in these zzso Images were evaluated by consensus between 2 PET experts for intensity and uniformity of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso intensity and uniformity with both zzso and zzso as well as associations with tumor zzso zzso at baseline zzso volume on zzso inversion recovery, baseline zzso enhancement, diffusion and zzso zzso were zzso 

In most of the children, zzso zzso zzso was less than zzso zzso Survival was poor, irrespective of intensity of zzso zzso with no association between intensity of zzso zzso and zzso or zzso However, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso compared with gray matter, suggested poorer survival zzso Patients with zzso zzso in 50% or more of the tumor had shorter zzso and zzso than did patients with zzso zzso in less than 50% of the zzso There was some evidence that tumors with higher zzso zzso were more likely to show enhancement, and when the diffusion ratio was lower, the uniformity of zzso zzso appeared zzso 

Children with zzso for which zzso zzso involves at least half the tumor appear to have poorer survival than children with zzso in less than 50% of the zzso A larger independent study is needed to verify this zzso zzso zzso zzso in the tumors, compared with gray matter, suggests decreased zzso Higher zzso zzso within the tumor was associated with enhancement on MR zzso Increased tumor zzso as reflected by restricted zzso diffusion may be associated with increased zzso uniformity throughout the zzso
