Clinical differential diagnosis between zzso and benign tumors is important in order to select a therapeutic strategy for a primary zzso zzso 

The clinical findings and zzso features of 25 patients with primary zzso tumors were zzso evaluated to find those signs that might contribute to the zzso distinction between benign and zzso zzso 

Of 25 primary zzso tumors, 15 were zzso This may reflect the increased number of zzso found small benign zzso There were significant associations between the presence of symptoms and zzso zzso zzso zzso between irregular margins on imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso and between the absence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors were significantly larger than benign tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso tumor scoring system was developed to distinguish primary zzso benign tumors from their zzso counterparts based on zzso 1) maximum diameter equal to or larger than zzso zzso 2) presence of symptoms, 3) absence of zzso 4) presence of irregular margins, and 5) presence of zzso zzso or zzso A significant correlation was found between the zzso of zzso tumors and the total zzso tumor score zzso zzso zzso 

This study suggests that the size of zzso the presence of symptoms, irregular margins, and the absence of zzso may be valuable zzso of primary zzso zzso zzso
