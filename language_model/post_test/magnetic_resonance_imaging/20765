Although zzso fixation with zzso screws has been shown to be a safe and zzso method for zzso dislocation and zzso fractures, it is a technically demanding technique, and one of its zzso is zzso anatomical variations and zzso The zzso and pattern of zzso and zzso anatomical variations were evaluated in 61 patients (35 women and 26 zzso using magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso in an attempt to explore the possible existence of groups of individuals in whom zzso zzso fixation is difficult due to local zzso zzso and zzso dimensions in both the zzso and zzso planes were recorded and zzso In each individual, zzso and zzso dimensions both in the zzso and zzso planes were zzso with zzso dimensions being zzso of those of zzso on zzso Patients were separated into 4 groups based on the zzso and zzso body size and the asymmetry of dimensions in the zzso and zzso zzso In 48 patients zzso dimensions in both planes were symmetrical despite the varying size of the zzso and zzso zzso In 2 patients zzso there was a combination of large zzso plane and small zzso plane dimensions, with large zzso and zzso body zzso In 9 patients zzso zzso plane dimensions were disproportionately smaller compared to those of the zzso plane, with a varying size of zzso and zzso body making effective zzso screw zzso a difficult zzso Thus, a zzso imaging study, preferably zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso body size and zzso plane dimensions and an zzso zzso control of zzso and zzso dimensions on the zzso plane are suggested for safe zzso screw zzso
