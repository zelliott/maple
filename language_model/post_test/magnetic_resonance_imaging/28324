Currently, there is no reliable and readily accessible technique with which the distribution and diffusion of blowing agents in rigid insulating foams can be detected and zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that zzso zzso microscopic imaging together with zzso solid-state zzso zzso zzso is zzso suited for such zzso and yield zzso reliable information that will be critical to the development and fabrication of zzso insulating materials with alternative blowing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso foam samples were investigated with the objective of determining zzso the amount of blowing agents in the gaseous phase and dissolved in the zzso phase, and to determine and monitor the distribution of the blowing agents in aged foams as a function of time and zzso The zzso of the gaseous blowing agents in the cells and dissolved in the solid were simultaneously and zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso foam filled with zzso has about zzso of total zzso dissolved in the zzso while there is about zzso of zzso in the solid of a faced zzso zzso foam filled with zzso The data from zzso zzso imaging demonstrate that the zzso of the blowing agents in an aged foam are quite uniform around the center part (2 zzso away from any zzso of a foam board; however, a zzso in blowing agent concentration was found as a function of distance from the initial factory cut zzso The effective diffusion zzso of the blowing agents can be directly calculated from the imaging zzso zzso diffusion zzso and zzso barriers were zzso Additionally, a foam treated with a second blowing agent was monitored with chemical shift selective imaging and the diffusion of the second gas into the foam and the zzso of the original gas were zzso
