We report the development and in zzso study of a zzso serving as a targeted magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast enhancement agent for detection of cancer cells zzso the folate zzso The zzso was zzso by coating zzso iron oxide zzso with zzso bound zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso with zzso acid zzso The specificity of the zzso targeting zzso cells was demonstrated by comparative zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso by human zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting to zzso cells was studied by comparing the zzso of the zzso by zzso cells and by zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso cells after 4 h incubation was found to be a zzso higher than that of zzso or zzso zzso as zzso by zzso coupled plasma zzso A significant negative contrast enhancement was observed with magnetic resonance zzso phantom imaging for zzso cells over zzso cells, when both were cultured with the zzso zzso of the zzso for folate receptors was also verified with a competitive zzso zzso in which zzso cells were incubated with both zzso and free zzso The zzso zzso used has zzso linkages within the zzso chains that can form zzso hydrogen zzso leading to improved stability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be controlled at the molecular level and are suitable for zzso zzso
