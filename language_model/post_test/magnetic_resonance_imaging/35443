Our aim was to use zzso to evaluate and compare the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human pancreatic tumor cell lines after zzso into zzso mice and to correlate tumor zzso with gene expression of membrane zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Four weeks after zzso zzso of human pancreatic zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso into zzso mice, combined imaging was performed with a zzso PET scanner and a zzso zzso scanner using a dedicated mouse zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso of the zzso were compared with gene expression profiles of the tumor cell lines and both normal pancreatic tissue and pancreatic tumor tissue based on gene zzso analysis and quantitative zzso chain zzso 

zzso showed the highest tumor zzso with a mean zzso of zzso allowing correct zzso of all 12 pancreatic zzso zzso detected only 4 of 8 tumors and had low zzso in tumors, with a mean zzso of zzso in visible zzso zzso did not show any tumor zzso Gene array analysis revealed that both zzso 1 as the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 were significantly zzso whereas zzso zzso 1, responsible for zzso zzso was significantly zzso in the tumor cell lines, compared with normal pancreatic duct cells and pancreatic tumor zzso zzso genes involved in the zzso of zzso were predominantly unaffected or zzso in the tumor cell zzso 

In comparison to zzso and zzso zzso was the PET zzso with the highest and most consistent zzso in various human pancreatic tumor cell lines in zzso zzso The imaging results could be explained by gene expression patterns of membrane zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and retention as measured by gene array analysis and quantitative zzso chain reaction in the respective cell zzso Thus, standard molecular techniques provided the basis to help explain zzso zzso zzso patterns in zzso human tumor cell lines in mice as observed by zzso
