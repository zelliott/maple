Animal and human newborn studies suggest that exposure to cocaine in zzso delays zzso maturation and white matter zzso zzso data show that in the frontal and zzso zzso white matter zzso continues into middle zzso Recent magnetic resonance imaging zzso data have confirmed continued white matter volume increase in these regions, reaching a maximum at age zzso 

zzso male cocaine dependent zzso and 52 normal control subjects between ages 19 and 47 were evaluated with zzso zzso images focused on the frontal and zzso zzso were acquired using pulse sequences that zzso zzso matter zzso 

zzso significant positive correlations between white matter volume and age were observed in both the frontal and zzso zzso of the control group zzso zzso p zzso and r zzso p zzso zzso however, CD subjects did not demonstrate any age-related increase in white matter volume of the frontal zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in this age zzso 

The age-related expansion in white matter volume occurring in normal control subjects was absent in CD zzso The findings suggest that in adults, cocaine dependence may arrest normal white matter maturation in the frontal and zzso zzso of addicts who continue using zzso
