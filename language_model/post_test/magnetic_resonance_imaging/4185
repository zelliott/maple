The central decision in every functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiment is whether zzso in brain zzso are showing zzso in response to neural stimulus or as a result of zzso Images are zzso not only by random zzso zzso noise, but also by structured noise due to MR system zzso cardiac and respiratory zzso and patient zzso A novel digital filter has been developed to suppress cardiac and respiratory structured noise in zzso images, using estimates of structured and random noise power zzso obtained directly from the zzso It is an zzso filter based on stationary noise statistics, and is equivalent in form to a Wiener zzso A mathematical model of the filtering process was developed to understand how the strength and distribution of structured and random noise power influenced filter zzso The filter was tested using images from an auditory zzso study in ten zzso In subjects whose structured noise power was localized to a relatively narrow frequency range, a strong relationship was found, both zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso for zzso R zzso zzso and using the model, between filter performance and the level of structured noise power zzso the experiment zzso The filter significantly reduced the rate of zzso zzso in the subset of subjects whose experiment frequency was relatively heavily contaminated by structured zzso zzso zzso that simply eliminate unwanted zzso performed poorly in all zzso Unlike the proposed Wiener zzso these filters did not suppress structured noise power at the experiment frequency that contributes to zzso zzso
