The effect of zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso for zzso was evaluated with dynamic MR imaging with zzso in 37 patients (44 zzso zzso was performed using zzso and gelatin sponge (or zzso as an zzso zzso All patients were examined with dynamic CT and MR imaging before and after zzso On conventional spin echo images, changes of signal intensity after treatment varied regardless of presence of zzso Dynamic MR imaging revealed changes of tumor zzso before and after zzso On zzso zzso areas of persistent tumor enhancement on dynamic MR imaging corresponded to areas of viable tumor cells while areas of zzso corresponded to areas of zzso Dynamic MR imaging was superior in contrast resolution and was not influenced by the presence of zzso compared with dynamic CT, and therefore residual viable tumors were better defined by dynamic MR zzso
