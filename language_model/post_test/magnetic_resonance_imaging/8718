A method is proposed for zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso muscle from magnetic resonance zzso images, which is often performed in zzso planning and zzso Because of a lack of suitable automatic techniques, a common practice is for clinicians to manually trace out all relevant regions from the image slices which is extremely zzso The proposed method allows significant time zzso In the proposed method, a zzso zzso model is built from a test zzso after determining the dominant slices that represent the salient features of the zzso muscle shape from training zzso zzso is carried out only on these slices in the test zzso with zzso zzso then applied to build the zzso model, which serves as a coarse zzso of the zzso This is first refined by matching the intensity distribution within the zzso volume against the distribution estimated from the zzso in the dominant zzso and further refined through boundary analysis where the zzso of the zzso of the boundary zzso is analyzed and zzso zzso It was observed that the left and right zzso zzso volumes in young adults zzso and zzso zzso are higher than those of older zzso group zzso adults zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicates good agreement between the zzso and manual zzso with average overlap indexes for the left and right zzso at zzso and zzso zzso
