Alzheimer's disease is associated with abnormalities in the levels of some brain zzso including decreases in zzso zzso and increases in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have proven modest effects on zzso in patients with mild or moderate Alzheimer's zzso however, there is little information on the effects of these drugs on zzso parameters in the zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso provides a method of determining changes in such zzso 

To assess the effect of zzso on zzso levels in different areas of the brain, and whether changes in zzso levels correlate with clinical outcome, in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with zzso patients with Alzheimer's zzso 

zzso consecutive patients with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease were enrolled in the study and were treated with zzso at a target dosage of 12 zzso for 4 zzso A comparison group of ten consecutive zzso patients with Alzheimer's disease with similar cognitive impairment to the treatment group were also zzso Each patient underwent assessment using the zzso State zzso zzso zzso the Blessed zzso zzso zzso the Clinical zzso zzso scale, the zzso for zzso in Daily living activities in zzso the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment zzso cognitive and zzso zzso and zzso MRS of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the brain to assess levels of brain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their ratios to zzso All assessments were performed at baseline and after 4 months of treatment with zzso and at baseline and 1 month later in the comparison zzso 

Globally, although there was some mean improvement, no significant changes in the cognitive and zzso scale scores between baseline and zzso assessments were seen in patients who received zzso A significant increase in the zzso ratio in the frontal zzso zzso at baseline vs zzso after zzso p zzso zzso and in the zzso ratio in the zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso was seen in zzso zzso No other significant changes in the zzso levels or their ratios to zzso were seen in these zzso After correction for multiple zzso the significant effects zzso Only in the frontal zzso did the changes in zzso ratios correlate with changes on the clinical zzso In the comparison group, no significant differences between the zzso levels or ratios to zzso seen with the two scans were zzso 

Treatment with zzso showed modest zzso functional recovery in the frontal zzso only zzso able to reverse zzso decreases in zzso ratio in this area but unable to affect the zzso increase in zzso ratio in any zzso Since the modest clinical changes correlated with the small changes in the zzso rates, MRS could be useful in monitoring response to current or future treatments for Alzheimer's zzso
