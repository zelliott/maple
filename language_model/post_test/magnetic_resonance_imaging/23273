There is great interest in zzso brain zzso from zzso zzso This is often attempted by identifying a set of functional zzso zzso spatial zzso or zzso zzso and then conducting a connectivity analysis between the zzso based on the zzso zzso associated with the zzso Analysis methods range from very simple measures that consider just two zzso at a time zzso correlation between two zzso zzso to sophisticated approaches that consider all zzso simultaneously and estimate one global network model zzso zzso net zzso Many different methods are being used in the literature, but almost none has been carefully validated or compared for use on zzso zzso zzso In this work we generate rich, realistic simulated zzso data for a wide range of underlying networks, experimental protocols and problematic confounds in the data, in order to compare different connectivity zzso zzso Our results show that in general zzso approaches can be quite successful, methods based on zzso statistics are less sensitive, and zzso approaches perform very zzso More zzso there are several methods that can give high sensitivity to network connection detection on good quality zzso data, in particular, partial zzso zzso inverse zzso zzso and several zzso net zzso however, accurate zzso of connection zzso is more difficult to zzso though zzso zzso can be reasonably zzso With respect to the various confounds added to the data, the most striking result was that the use of functionally inaccurate zzso (when defining the network zzso and zzso their associated zzso is extremely damaging to network zzso zzso results derived from inappropriate zzso definition (such as via structural zzso should be regarded with great zzso
