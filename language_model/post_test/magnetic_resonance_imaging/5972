The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso in comparison to magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In a retrospective analysis, zzso zzso bodies of 41 patients with various zzso confirmed primary zzso were zzso The zzso were acquired on a zzso scanner zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on zzso T scanners zzso zzso The zzso and zzso were evaluated separately by two experienced zzso in a consensus zzso The combination of zzso and zzso in an expert reading including follow-up examinations and/or zzso as well as clinical data served as the gold zzso 

zzso zzso bodies were defined as zzso affected by the gold zzso In zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso were zzso 68 zzso bodies were false negative in zzso whereas 3 false zzso were found in zzso 3 false positive results were obtained in zzso 5 in zzso zzso was significantly lower for zzso zzso than for zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different for both methods zzso zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy resulted in zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso 

Although zzso provides excellent image quality and a high spatial resolution in the assessment of zzso structures, zzso zzso without significant bone destruction may be zzso The diagnostic accuracy of zzso proved to be significantly superior to zzso for the detection of zzso zzso
