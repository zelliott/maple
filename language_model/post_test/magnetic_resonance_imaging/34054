The aim of the study was to assess the value of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso enhancement in the zzso staging of zzso zzso 

In addition to standard zzso patients with zzso zzso were assessed by zzso obtained with a pelvic zzso zzso in combination with an zzso zzso 

The study group comprised 29 patients with zzso cancer staged with an zzso zzso who had surgery without zzso zzso zzso In addition to standard zzso and zzso images, dynamic zzso images were acquired in all zzso zzso zzso variation was noted, particularly for pathological zzso stage zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with pathological findings, zzso zzso correctly staged nine patients, zzso 16 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were accurately detected in 70 per cent of patients, the positive zzso value was only 58 per zzso 

MR staging of zzso cancer with an zzso zzso and zzso enhancement is inaccurate for early zzso zzso zzso or zzso and is associated with a considerable degree of zzso variation for individual scan zzso
