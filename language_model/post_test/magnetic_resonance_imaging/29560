This study used functional connectivity analyses to assess zzso brain activity correlations during the recall of traumatic memories in traumatized subjects with and without zzso stress disorder zzso 

Both zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and functional connectivity analyses were used to assess zzso brain activity correlations during zzso symptom provocation in traumatized subjects with zzso and without zzso zzso zzso connectivity analyses were carried out by using data for brain regions activated in both the zzso group and the comparison zzso The use of functional connectivity analyses in addition to zzso analyses allowed assessment of specific brain regions involved in the recall of traumatic events and of the zzso networks underlying the recall of such zzso 

zzso zzso differences in functional connectivity were zzso zzso of connectivity maps at coordinates zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso for the two groups showed that the subjects without zzso had greater correlation than the zzso subjects in the left superior frontal zzso zzso area zzso left anterior zzso zzso zzso area zzso left zzso zzso left zzso lobe zzso areas 40 and zzso and left zzso zzso area zzso In contrast, the zzso subjects showed greater correlation than the subjects without zzso in the right zzso zzso zzso zzso area 29), right zzso right zzso lobe zzso areas 7 and zzso and right zzso lobe zzso area zzso 

The differences in brain connectivity between zzso and comparison subjects may account for the zzso nature of traumatic memory recall in zzso subjects, compared to a more verbal pattern of traumatic memory recall in comparison zzso
