Atomic force zzso zzso zzso and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance have been used to improve our current knowledge on the molecular characteristics of the zzso zzso the main component of the plant zzso After comparison of samples of zzso isolated from young and mature tomato fruit zzso has been possible to establish different degrees of zzso in the zzso and that the zzso is mainly formed after zzso of secondary zzso groups of the zzso that form this type of zzso Atomic force zzso gave useful structural information on the molecular topography of the outer surface of the isolated zzso The texture of these samples is a consequence of the zzso degree or chemical status of the zzso Thus, the more dense and zzso zzso from ripe or mature tomato fruit is characterized by a zzso and more zzso texture in addition to the development of zzso and zzso zzso
