Bone zzso are frequently found in association with complete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament zzso and can be a helpful secondary sign in zzso We compare the frequency, location, and significance of bone zzso in complete and partial zzso zzso 

zzso patients with complete and 42 patients with incomplete tears of the zzso were examined by zzso for the presence of accompanying bone zzso within 1 month of zzso 

Bone zzso were found in zzso of the complete zzso tears but in only zzso of the partial zzso Of the partial zzso tears with accompanying zzso zzso were high grade injuries that eventually went on to complete zzso within 6 zzso Only zzso of the partial zzso injuries without bone zzso progressed to complete zzso at 1-2 year zzso There was no difference between the bone zzso of partial and complete tears in terms of general appearance and zzso They were predominantly in the lateral compartment zzso and had a specific zzso for the mid portion of the lateral zzso zzso and the zzso portion of the lateral zzso zzso often occurring in zzso 

Bone zzso occur with much less frequency in partial zzso tears than in complete tears but their presence in partial zzso favors a high grade tear that is likely to become zzso
