The human visual system uses texture information to segment visual scenes into figure and zzso We developed a zzso model of human texture processing zzso A, Neumann H zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso interaction in texture boundary zzso a modeling zzso zzso zzso which allows us to examine the functional roles of early and intermediate stages of the zzso visual zzso in zzso zzso In particular, the model highlights the central role of cells in zzso areas (such as zzso with larger receptive fields in the robust identification of texture boundaries and zzso stimuli even under noisy zzso A straightforward prediction of the model is that the activity of cells in zzso but not early visual areas directly zzso with the zzso of the texture borders in the visual zzso zzso their activity should directly correlate with the zzso of zzso texture regions as zzso in zzso studies zzso HC (1991) zzso zzso and zzso from orientation zzso Vision Res zzso This prediction explicitly derived from the model was tested using functional magnetic resonance zzso The zzso of texture bars composed of oriented line items was varied by zzso changing the defining orientation contrast between zzso and background zzso zzso with the model, increasing contrast at texture boundaries resulted in a zzso increase of blood oxygen level dependent responses in zzso but not early visual zzso Our modeling and imaging results indicate that zzso visual areas form a key stage in zzso segregation by gradually signaling the zzso of region boundaries defined by orientation zzso
