zzso lowers the blood zzso zzso zzso signal by acting as an zzso zzso thus decreasing the cerebral blood flow zzso The aims of this study were to demonstrate the sensitivity of zzso imaging zzso to zzso changes in zzso and to investigate the time course and magnitude of signal change in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired with both groups at zzso T using a fully zzso compensated zzso zzso echo zzso Following a native zzso subjects were given a tablet containing 200 zzso of zzso zzso were repeated for about 1 h and the acquired zzso data sets were zzso to each zzso zzso signal changes of several zzso vessels were analyzed in dedicated zzso zzso of relative signal change clearly zzso the zzso signal response of zzso Only very weak signal changes of about zzso were found in both, zzso and white matter and zzso in the zzso zzso signal decrease of veins occurred zzso zzso after caffeine zzso The signal decrease was zzso and zzso for the caffeine users group and zzso zzso The signal difference of both groups was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso Data acquired at zzso 3 and 7 T with echo times scaled to the respective field strength display very similar zzso signal zzso
