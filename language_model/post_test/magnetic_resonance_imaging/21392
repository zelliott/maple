The brain needs continuous oxygen supply even in zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso rhythms in the delta range, and reduces those in the alpha range, with a pattern similar to that observed in Alzheimer's disease zzso Here we tested whether zzso cortical zzso rhythms in patients with zzso heart failure zzso as a model of acute zzso present frequency similarities with zzso patients, comparable by cognitive status revealed by the mini mental state examination zzso 

zzso zzso data were recorded in 10 zzso patients, 20 zzso patients, and 20 healthy elderly subjects zzso as zzso zzso software estimated cortical zzso zzso 

Compared to zzso both zzso and zzso groups presented higher delta zzso and lower alpha zzso zzso zzso The highest delta and lowest alpha sources were observed in zzso zzso In these subjects, the global zzso of delta sources correlated with brain zzso zzso zzso level in the blood, as a marker of disease zzso 

zzso delta and alpha rhythms suggest analogies between the effects of acute zzso and zzso zzso on the cortical zzso zzso 

Acute zzso zzso could affect the mechanisms of cortical neural synchronization generating resting state zzso zzso inducing the zzso of zzso rhythms typically observed in zzso zzso
