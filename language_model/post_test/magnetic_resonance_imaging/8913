When events occur spontaneously during the acquisition of a series of images, traditional modeling methods for detecting functional zzso zzso detection cannot be zzso The two-dimensional zzso zzso algorithm, zzso has been shown to accurately detect random, transient zzso in computer simulations without the use of known event zzso In this study we applied the zzso technique to detect the zzso and spatial locations of zzso zzso transient zzso of the zzso zzso and motor zzso in 12 normal zzso zzso with one and two independent types of stimuli were zzso zzso zzso using known timing was compared with zzso zzso using zzso timing in individuals and across zzso The zzso zzso detected the zzso from all presented stimuli in every zzso When compared with zzso results using a measure of correlation between zzso zzso no significant difference was found between the zzso zzso maps and the zzso maps using known timing across all zzso zzso zzso has the potential to be an accurate and more practical method for detection of spontaneous, transient events using zzso
