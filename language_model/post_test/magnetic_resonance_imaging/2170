The effects of resistance exercise combined with vascular zzso on muscle function were investigated in highly trained zzso Elite zzso players zzso zzso 17) took part in an 8 week study of exercise training of the knee zzso muscles, in which zzso zzso 50% of one repetition zzso exercise combined with an zzso pressure of about 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exercise without the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and no exercise training zzso control, zzso zzso 5) were zzso The exercise in the zzso group was of the same intensity and amount as in the zzso zzso The zzso group showed a significantly larger increase in zzso knee extension zzso than that in the other two groups zzso zzso zzso at all the zzso zzso On the other hand, no significant difference was seen between zzso and the control zzso In the zzso group, the zzso area of knee zzso increased significantly zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the increase in knee extension strength was mainly caused by muscle zzso The dynamic endurance of knee zzso estimated from the decreases in mechanical work production and peak force after 50 repeated concentric zzso was also improved after zzso whereas no significant change was observed in the zzso and control zzso The results indicated that zzso resistance exercise causes, in almost fully trained athletes, increases in muscle size, strength and zzso when combined with vascular zzso
