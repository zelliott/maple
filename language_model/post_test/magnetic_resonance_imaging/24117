Previous zzso childhood onset schizophrenia zzso zzso brain zzso studies found progression of zzso volume and other structural brain anomalies at zzso follow up across mean ages 14 to 16 zzso However, studies in adult patients generally do not show progression of zzso volume or correlation of zzso volume with duration of zzso To address issues of progression of brain anomalies in zzso this report extends previous studies to include a third zzso zzso uses a larger sample size, and includes measures of the zzso and zzso 

Volumes of the total zzso lateral zzso zzso and zzso were zzso on 208 brain magnetic resonance imaging scans from 42 adolescents with zzso zzso with one or more repeat zzso and 74 zzso and zzso controls zzso with one or more repeat zzso A statistical technique permitting combined use of zzso and zzso data was used to assess age-related changes, zzso and diagnostic group zzso 

zzso zzso progression of brain anomalies was seen during adolescence with the total zzso and zzso decreasing and lateral zzso increasing in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso for these structures reached an zzso by early adulthood for the zzso group and did not significantly change with age in the control zzso 

These findings reconcile less striking progression of zzso brain images usually seen for adult schizophrenia and complement other data consistent with zzso zzso decreases in brain zzso zzso appears to be a unique period of differential brain development in zzso
