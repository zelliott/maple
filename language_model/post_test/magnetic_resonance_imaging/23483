In the course of daily living, changing environmental demands often make our actions, once zzso unnecessary or even zzso Under such circumstances, the ability to inhibit the obsolete action and to update behavior can be of vital zzso Previous zzso and zzso studies have shown that the right prefrontal zzso and the zzso zzso seem to play an important role in the zzso of already initiated motor zzso The present study was designed to investigate whether the neural activity of zzso motor control was altered if the zzso process was succeeded by an additional process, namely the zzso into an alternative zzso zzso cerebral blood zzso during performance of a zzso paradigm was registered in 15 male participants using zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso Data analysis zzso that during successful and failed stopping and changing zzso zzso and subsequent response zzso of initiated motor responses a very similar network was activated including primarily the right inferior frontal zzso zzso Besides, zzso zzso in right IFC was significantly greater for fast zzso than for slow zzso zzso of the present study thus further underline the important role of right IFC in response zzso and suggest that the zzso process functions similarly regardless whether changing task demands require the complete suppression of an already initiated motor response or its suppression and a subsequent response zzso into an alternative zzso
