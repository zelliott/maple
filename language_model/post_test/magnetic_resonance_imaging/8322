To investigate the role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso of bone zzso in zzso germ cell zzso 

There were 5 consecutive patients with bone zzso from zzso germ cell tumors treated between 2003 and 2006 who underwent imaging studies, including zzso The characteristic imaging findings are discussed in the light of the clinical zzso 

Of the 5 patients, 3 had symptoms related to bone involvement at zzso All patients received conventional zzso of their zzso zzso but only 1 of them was considered zzso zzso zzso was obtained in all zzso A bone scan was available in 3 cases with spinal zzso It was normal in 1 case and detected only a minority of the zzso visible on zzso in the other 2 zzso zzso zzso were available in all zzso A partial resolution of bone involvement during chemotherapy was observed in only 1 of zzso In 2 cases, there was a slight progression of a diffuse zzso of the bone zzso during zzso In 1 patient, severe spinal bone zzso changes were visible on zzso 2 years after zzso of treatment without evidence of disease zzso 

zzso may disclose bone zzso in zzso germ cell tumors, which otherwise may be zzso zzso findings of bone zzso during treatment do not directly reflect the course of the disease and have to be interpreted with caution using clinical zzso
