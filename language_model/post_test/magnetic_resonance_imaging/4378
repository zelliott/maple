To assess the utility of MR in third zzso nerve zzso 

We reviewed zzso and zzso MR of 50 patients with third zzso nerve zzso 

MR demonstrated an appropriate zzso in 32 zzso Of these patients, 6 had brain stem zzso and 15 had involvement of the nerve in the cavernous zzso zzso of the zzso segment of the nerve were present in 11 patients, with enhancement of this segment observed in 9 zzso An inflammatory or zzso source of the zzso was indicated in 19 of these 32 zzso Of 7 patients with zzso involvement suggestive clinically of a zzso zzso 4 demonstrated zzso and enhancement consistent with an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso patients with zzso third zzso nerve zzso and a history of diabetes or vascular disease had normal MR findings, with no enhancement of the third zzso nerve zzso 

Patients who do not have a history of diabetes or hypertension and in whom a complete or incomplete third zzso nerve zzso develops with or without zzso sparing should undergo MR imaging initially (unless there are clear symptoms or signs of zzso zzso to exclude the presence of an zzso zzso or zzso zzso Patients who have a history of vascular disease and a clinical presentation that is suggestive of an zzso event may be observed initially, but should undergo imaging if improvement does not occur within 3 zzso
