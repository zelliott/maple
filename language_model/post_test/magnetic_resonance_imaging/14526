zzso in impulse control are discussed as key mechanisms for major worldwide health problems such as drug addiction and zzso For example, obese subjects have difficulty controlling their impulses to zzso when faced with food zzso Here, we investigated the role of neural impulse control mechanisms for dietary success in middle-aged obese zzso Specifically, we used a zzso delayed gratification paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure zzso zzso in middle-aged obese subjects just before they underwent a zzso low calorie zzso As expected, we found that subjects with higher behavioral impulse control subsequently lost more zzso Furthermore, brain activity before the diet in zzso and zzso zzso with subsequent weight zzso Additionally, a connectivity analysis revealed that stronger functional connectivity between these regions is associated with better dietary success and impulse zzso Thus, the degree to which subjects can control their eating impulses might depend on the interplay between control regions zzso and regions signaling the reward of food zzso This could potentially constitute a general mechanism that also extends to other disorders such as drug addiction or alcohol zzso
