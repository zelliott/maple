An impairment of zzso control in the face of zzso zzso is well established for zzso zzso Beyond that, it has been hypothesized that high trait anxiety more generally zzso the neural efficiency of cognitive processes requiring zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Here, we use zzso to show that trait anxiety indeed zzso brain zzso and functional zzso between zzso brain regions in an zzso neutral zzso zzso In zzso individuals, zzso zzso showed stronger zzso zzso and reduced zzso with zzso lateral frontal regions, zzso zzso and a zzso area in the left zzso zzso These results support the assumption that a general zzso not zzso impairment of zzso control leads to reduced neural processing efficiency in anxious zzso The increased zzso zzso zzso is interpreted as an attempt to compensate for zzso connectivity within the cortical network zzso task zzso
