The experimental validation of a zzso zzso therapy control system which automatically and simultaneously achieves the specified efficacy and safety objectives of the treatment is zzso zzso zzso are used in real-time to control the power of a zzso focused ultrasound zzso in order to achieve the desired treatment outcome in minimum time without violating the imposed safety zzso Treatment efficacy is zzso in terms of the zzso dose delivered to the zzso zzso tissue safety is ensured by automatically maintaining normal tissue temperature below the imposed limit in the zzso zzso To reflect hardware limitations, constraints on the maximum applied power are also zzso At the zzso stage, MR imaging and zzso are used to zzso the treatment target and identify zzso and zzso zzso The results of phantom and canine experiments demonstrate that zzso real-time MR temperature zzso enhance one's ability to robustly achieve the desired treatment outcome in minimum time without violating safety zzso zzso evaluation of the outcome using zzso images of canine muscle showed good spatial correlation between the zzso area and zzso damaged zzso
