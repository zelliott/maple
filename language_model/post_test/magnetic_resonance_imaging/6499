The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of zzso to detect magnetic particle zzso into advanced solid zzso tumors and to document the extension of these tumors, carried out in the context of magnetic drug zzso In a prospective phase I trial, 11 patients were examined with zzso before and after magnetic drug zzso The sequence protocol included zzso and zzso in several planes, followed by quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the signal zzso and tumor zzso In nine patients, a signal decrease was observed in the early follow-up zzso days after zzso on the zzso zzso two patients did not show a signal zzso The signal changes in zzso were less zzso In late follow-up zzso weeks after zzso signal within nine tumors reached their initially normal level on both zzso and zzso two tumors showed a slight signal decrease on zzso and a slight signal increase on zzso Within the surveillance period, tumor zzso in 3 out of 11 patients was observed, and in 5 patients tumor growth had zzso The remaining three patients showed significant tumor zzso There was no statistically significant correlation between signal change and zzso zzso is a suitable method to detect zzso zzso deposited at the tumor site via magnetic drug zzso zzso is therefore eligible to control the success of zzso and to assess the tumor size after the end of zzso
