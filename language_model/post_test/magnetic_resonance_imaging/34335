zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to examine the neural zzso of internally zzso and zzso zzso induced covert shifts of zzso Thirteen normal subjects performed three zzso conditions: zzso zzso of peripheral target predicted by a central zzso zzso of the time), zzso zzso target preceded by zzso central zzso zzso results indicated faster reaction times zzso for valid than for invalid trials for the zzso condition but slower zzso for valid than for invalid trials for the zzso condition zzso of zzso The spatial extent and intensity of zzso was greatest for the zzso condition, consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso is more zzso (less zzso than zzso zzso Overall, we did not observe distinctly zzso neural systems associated with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso but not the control condition, activated bilateral zzso and zzso zzso regions, including the frontal eye zzso These results suggest a specific role for these regions in zzso responding to peripheral zzso The right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso was activated selectively by the zzso zzso This finding suggests that zzso but not zzso shifts of attention engage working memory zzso
