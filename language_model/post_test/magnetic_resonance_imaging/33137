zzso and zzso zzso are the hallmarks of established white matter zzso zzso The zzso of ongoing zzso is only partially zzso We explored zzso fluid zzso substances as markers of brain tissue damage in relation to progression of zzso rated on magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso from elderly individuals with zzso was analyzed for zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso protein light zzso zzso and zzso zzso After 3 years, a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging was zzso zzso of zzso was rated using the Rotterdam zzso zzso zzso 

37 subjects (age zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso with more pronounced progression zzso zzso 2; zzso zzso zzso had lower mean zzso concentration at baseline as compared to subjects with no or minimal progression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso according to zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso zzso was the only zzso that predicted the zzso score according to zzso analysis, explaining zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The correlation of zzso zzso levels and zzso scores may reflect a zzso response to the zzso process associated with zzso Furthermore, the results strengthen the notion that zzso pathology is different from that of Alzheimer's zzso
