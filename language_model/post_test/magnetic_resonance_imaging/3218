In magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, zzso is used to compensate for head zzso The technique focuses mainly on acquisition of zzso or zzso zzso images in adults; its utility for zzso zzso imaging in children is not well zzso We compared the quality of zzso zzso inversion recovery brain imaging with zzso zzso to that of conventional zzso zzso imaging zzso in pediatric patients who cannot stay still during MR zzso 

Our investigation included a volunteer study and a retrospective clinical zzso Six healthy adult volunteers underwent scanning to compare the contrast of zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery imaging zzso and zzso at both zzso and 3 zzso zzso was based on scores assigned independently by 2 blinded observers and by calculated zzso zzso The clinical study included 20 children who underwent both zzso and zzso at either zzso zzso zzso 9) or 3 T zzso zzso zzso On each zzso 2 blinded observers independently scored zzso of the cerebral zzso and contrast between gray and white zzso We compared scores between sequences separately for zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

At both zzso and zzso contrast was better using zzso and zzso than zzso in volunteers, and overall scores were significantly higher with zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso in the clinical zzso 

zzso may be superior to zzso in demonstrating brain structures in children who cannot stay still and may be used to supplement or replace zzso when zzso is insufficient for patient zzso
