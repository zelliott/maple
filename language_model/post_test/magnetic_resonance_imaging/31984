Following zzso death, organ weights at autopsy may provide evidence of growth restriction and pulmonary zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso may provide comparable information to autopsy about structural zzso its ability to provide zzso data about organ size has yet to be zzso We examined the feasibility of using zzso zzso to provide estimates of organ size and zzso 

Twenty-five fetuses of zzso age from 16 to 40 weeks underwent zzso zzso prior to zzso Fetal zzso brain and liver volume zzso were performed by two observers using the zzso technique on zzso zzso zzso Fetal zzso brain and liver weights were recorded at zzso zzso volume estimates and autopsy organ weights were compared using zzso analysis, and estimates of fetal organ zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed using a zzso zzso zzso characteristics curve zzso analysis compared zzso brain : liver volume ratios to autopsy brain : liver weight zzso 

A linear relationship between organ volume estimates and organ weight was zzso zzso zzso for the fetal brain, liver and lung were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 5th and 95th zzso limits of agreement for fetal brain, liver and lung were - zzso to + zzso - zzso to + zzso and - zzso to + zzso zzso For zzso organ volumes to detect a brain weight : liver weight ratio zzso or zzso 4, zzso analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of zzso with an optimal zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso organ zzso can be used to estimate weights of major fetal zzso This may increase the information obtained from a zzso zzso autopsy, particularly in the context of pulmonary zzso and zzso growth zzso where differential organ growth plays a major part in assessment of the underlying zzso
