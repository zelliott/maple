The aim of this work was to determine the role of zzso in interpreting abnormal signals within bones and soft zzso adjacent to tumor bulk of zzso and Ewing's zzso in a pediatric population by zzso MR findings with zzso 

Thirty patients met the inclusion criteria, which included zzso zzso or Ewing's zzso zzso MR studies no more than zzso prior to surgery, zzso presence of abnormal MR signal surrounding the tumor bulk, zzso pathological material from zzso zzso The patients received standard zzso zzso Using grid maps on gross pathology zzso the abnormal MR areas around the tumor were matched with the corresponding grid zzso zzso slides of these sections were then analyzed to determine the nature of the regions of zzso The zzso correlation was evaluated using zzso U test and zzso exact zzso 

zzso patients had zzso and three patients had Ewing's zzso Of the studied areas, zzso were positive for tumor zzso or zzso There was no statistically significant correlation between areas positive for tumor and age, zzso signal extent and intensity on zzso or tissue zzso There was, however, a statistically significant correlation between presence of tumor and the appearance of abnormal soft tissue zzso A zzso appearance correlated with zzso areas whereas a bulky appearance correlated with zzso zzso 

MR imaging is helpful in identifying the nature of abnormal signal areas surrounding bone zzso that are more likely to be zzso particularly when the signal in the soft zzso surrounding the tumor is zzso and zzso in zzso
