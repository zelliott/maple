To estimate central visual field (30 zzso of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis zzso zzso was confirmed by magnetic resonance zzso 

There was no zzso zzso zzso in the history of the zzso The visual acuity of examined the 28 eyes was zzso The results of zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso 

There were significant relationships between mean sensitivity zzso and duration of the disease, stage of the disease (in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Mean zzso zzso was significantly higher in the upper half of central visual field and between zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso We observed positive relationships between MD, short time fluctuation zzso and corrected loss zzso zzso We found negative correlations between zzso MD, zzso and zzso Mean reliability factor zzso was zzso zzso 

zzso zzso seems to be a useful test in early diagnosis and monitoring of zzso nerve zzso in zzso
