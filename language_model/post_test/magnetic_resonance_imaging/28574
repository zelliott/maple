zzso patients with acoustic zzso zzso were studied to determine whether different types of zzso could be correlated with specific signs and symptoms of the zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso zzso the 42 cases of AN could be divided into three groups, either by size zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or by site of origin of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Relations were found between the size and the site of origin of the zzso and certain clinical, zzso and zzso zzso The clinical presentation seemed to vary with the site of origin and the size of the zzso patients with lateral zzso generally had small zzso sometimes only located in the internal auditory canal zzso and presented early zzso hearing loss while patients with zzso zzso had larger zzso which grew without causing significant zzso zzso zzso hearing function was seen only in the patients with zzso zzso however, a significant relation between the size or the site of origin of the AN and the average hearing threshold was not zzso The sensitivity of the zzso zzso test zzso was higher for lateral zzso zzso in the zzso auditory evoked zzso zzso did not seem to be related to either the size or the site of origin of the zzso The zzso tests demonstrated a higher frequency of central zzso involvement in the large zzso while normal function was more frequent in the lateral zzso In the group studied the combination of zzso and zzso tests allowed us to identify all the zzso with an optimal level of zzso
