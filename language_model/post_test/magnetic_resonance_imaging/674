The superior zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso landmark of the external zzso zzso and is very important for functional zzso language areas on the left) mapping and zzso The methodology we use is based on the extraction of the zzso shape of zzso and their separation into zzso called zzso zzso zzso normal brains zzso 11, female: 6, age: zzso were systematically zzso Additionally, parameters generated by visual observation were zzso zzso statistics were performed to evaluate the variation of the zzso and influence of side, zzso and zzso We found that the zzso architecture of the zzso was consistent with our generic model in four zzso roots and four zzso de zzso zzso and significant differences between right and left zzso These zzso differences may be related to the zzso cortical areas difference and are pertinent for defining the limits of zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso
