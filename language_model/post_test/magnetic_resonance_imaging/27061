The zzso of the zzso zzso contribution to the blood zzso zzso zzso effect is important for understanding the spatial specificity of zzso contrast and for zzso approaches that aim to extract quantitative zzso parameters from the zzso zzso Using bipolar zzso zzso total zzso ) and predominantly zzso zzso ) zzso echo zzso zzso and signal changes zzso in response to visual stimulation zzso zzso zzso were investigated zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso T in the same zzso of healthy volunteers zzso and at identical spatial resolutions zzso Total zzso zzso zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso increased zzso with field, as expected, it was found that zzso zzso increased less than zzso with field in a manner that varied with TE zzso Furthermore, unlike zzso total and zzso zzso did not zzso at zzso zzso These trends were similar whether a zzso analysis or zzso zzso zzso approach was used for zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso approaches may benefit from an zzso zzso measurement as opposed to a zzso measurement at a single zzso
