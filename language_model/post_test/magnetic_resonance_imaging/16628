zzso cortical zzso zzso is characterized by a progressive decline in zzso object and space processing, but the extent to which these deficits are underpinned by basic visual zzso is zzso This study aimed to assess basic and zzso visual deficits in 21 zzso zzso Basic visual skills including form detection and discrimination, color discrimination, motion zzso and point zzso were measured, and associations and zzso between specific basic visual functions and measures of zzso object and space perception were zzso All participants showed impairment in at least one aspect of basic visual zzso However, a number of zzso between basic visual skills indicated a zzso pattern of visual impairment among the zzso zzso Furthermore, basic visual zzso were associated with particular zzso object and space perception deficits, but not with zzso zzso tasks, suggesting the specific involvement of visual networks in zzso zzso thickness analysis revealed trends toward lower cortical thickness in zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions in patients with zzso and zzso deficits, zzso However, there was also a lot of overlap in their patterns of cortical zzso These findings suggest that different presentations of zzso represent points in a zzso of zzso zzso
