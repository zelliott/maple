zzso based zzso zzso methods are used to detect the difference in brain structures between the zzso stress disorder zzso zzso and the normal zzso Standard zzso method can detect the difference of the gray matter or white matter zzso while the zzso zzso method can detect the difference of gray matter or white matter volumes in the whole zzso The experiments showed that for the patient group, gray matter density or volumes significantly increased in the right frontal zzso middle frontal zzso zzso left zzso and zzso zzso compared with the normal zzso However, in the left frontal lobe and middle frontal zzso gray matter density significantly zzso There is no significant difference in white matter between the two zzso These results are consistent with those of the zzso which not only provide the evidence for further study of the zzso in zzso but also validate the efficiency of the zzso methods for detecting the difference in the whole brain zzso
