To assess the feasibility of the prenatal diagnosis using fetal zzso of brain injuries in the surviving fetus after the demise of a zzso zzso 

This was a retrospective zzso study in the period zzso of zzso twin zzso with a single fetal zzso A detailed zzso evaluation of the zzso anatomy of the surviving twin had been performed whenever possible using a zzso approach and from 1999, fetal magnetic resonance imaging was offered as zzso zzso follow-up was obtained in all zzso 

In six of nine cases, abnormal zzso findings were identified including zzso zzso brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso evolving into zzso zzso diagnosis of brain zzso was confirmed zzso and all affected infants who survived had severe neurological zzso Two fetuses had normal cerebral structures both on the prenatal zzso and on zzso imaging and were following normal zzso zzso one at 1 and the other at 5 years of zzso In one case the zzso examination was zzso and the infant was found at birth to have a zzso zzso Fetal magnetic resonance imaging was performed in two cases and confirmed the ultrasound zzso 

zzso zzso is a valuable tool for the prediction of neurological outcome in fetuses surviving after the zzso death of a zzso zzso Although our experience is zzso we suggest that magnetic resonance imaging should also be zzso
