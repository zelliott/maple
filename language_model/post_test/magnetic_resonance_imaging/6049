We investigated the zzso mechanism of zzso drift in zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso by exploring its spatial distribution, dependence on imaging zzso and relationship with zzso brain zzso zzso and respiratory signals were zzso recorded during zzso scanning and subsequently removed from zzso zzso It was found that the spatial distribution of zzso drifts in human brain followed a zzso pattern, with greater drift magnitude in the gray matter than in white zzso In gray matter, the dependence of drift zzso on TE was similar to that of zzso zzso signal changes, zzso the absolute drift magnitude reached the maximum when TE approached zzso whereas relative drift magnitude increased zzso with zzso By systematically varying the flip angle, it was found that drift zzso possessed a positive dependence on image zzso In phantom experiments, the observed drift was not only much smaller than that of human brain, but also showed different dependence on TE and flip zzso In zzso studies with visual zzso a strong positive correlation between drift effects at baseline and zzso zzso signal changes was observed both across subjects and across activated zzso within individual zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso drift effects are a major component of the spontaneous fluctuations of zzso zzso signal within the frequency range of zzso zzso Our study supports brain zzso as opposed to scanner zzso or zzso zzso as the main source of zzso drifts in zzso zzso
