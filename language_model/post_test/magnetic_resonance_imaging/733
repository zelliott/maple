We aimed to establish a rat model of zzso zzso zzso to evaluate potential treatment zzso For adequate timing of therapy in future experiments, we studied the development of tissue damage, zzso formation, and zzso over time with different zzso zzso Permanent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso was performed in 32 zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments including diffusion weighted zzso zzso zzso zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging before and after zzso were performed at 1, 3, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h of zzso zzso zzso consistently led to zzso of the complete zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso volumes as derived from apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso maps increased to maximum values of zzso zzso at 24 h and zzso zzso at 48 h of zzso zzso zzso shift peaked at 24 zzso The area with zzso deficit decreased to a minimum at 24 h after onset of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso dropped at the same time zzso Leakage of zzso through the zzso barrier in the entire zzso occurred within 3 h of zzso Permanent zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats is an adequate model for zzso cerebral zzso zzso may benefit from intervention aimed at reducing tissue shift and zzso pressure zzso and at improving cerebral blood flow, if initiated before 24 h after zzso zzso The value of treatment zzso depending on an intact zzso barrier should be zzso
