zzso data sets contain coherent fluctuations unrelated to neural processes originating from residual motion zzso zzso and cardiac zzso Such zzso effects may introduce correlations and cause an zzso of functional connectivity zzso In this study we applied several zzso linear zzso approaches to remove artificial zzso and examined the impact of zzso on sensitivity and specificity of functional connectivity results in simulated data and zzso data sets from 40 zzso Furthermore, we aimed at clarifying possible causes of zzso and test the hypothesis that zzso are introduced via certain zzso approaches, with particular focus on the effects of zzso against the global zzso Our results show that zzso in general greatly increased connection zzso in particular correction for global signal fluctuations almost doubled connection zzso However, widespread zzso networks were only found when zzso against the global signal was zzso zzso in simulated data sets compared with result of human data strongly suggest that zzso are indeed introduced by global signal zzso and should therefore be interpreted very zzso In addition, global signal zzso may also reduce the sensitivity for detecting true zzso zzso increase the number of false zzso zzso from our results we suggest that is highly recommended to apply correction against realignment zzso white matter and zzso time courses, as well as the global signal to maximize the specificity of positive zzso zzso
