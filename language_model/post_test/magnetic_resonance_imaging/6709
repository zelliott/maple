The corpus zzso is the major zzso connecting the cerebral zzso Prior evidence suggests involvement of the corpus zzso in the zzso of Tourette's zzso The authors assessed corpus zzso size and anatomical connectivity across the cerebral zzso in persons with Tourette's zzso 

The size of the corpus zzso was determined on the true zzso slices of zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans and compared across groups in a zzso zzso study of 158 subjects with Tourette's disorder and 121 healthy comparison subjects, ages zzso zzso 

In the context of increasing zzso corpus zzso area from childhood to age 30 years, children with Tourette's disorder had smaller overall corpus zzso size, whereas adults with Tourette's disorder on average had larger corpus zzso size, yielding a prominent interaction of diagnosis with zzso Corpus zzso size correlated positively with zzso zzso Corpus zzso size also correlated zzso with zzso prefrontal and zzso cortical volumes in both the subjects with Tourette's disorder and the comparison subjects, but the zzso of the correlations were significantly greater in the group with Tourette's zzso The effects of medication and zzso illnesses had no appreciable influence on the zzso 

Given prior evidence for the role of prefrontal zzso in the regulation of zzso symptoms, the current findings suggest that neural plasticity may contribute to smaller corpus zzso size in persons with Tourette's disorder, which thereby limits zzso trafficking across the cerebral zzso and reduces input to cortical zzso zzso within the prefrontal zzso zzso zzso input may in turn enhance prefrontal zzso thus helping to control tics and possibly contributing to the cortical zzso reported previously in patients with Tourette's zzso
