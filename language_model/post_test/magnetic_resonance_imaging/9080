Brain development during late childhood and adolescence is characterized by decreases in gray matter zzso and increases in white matter zzso and zzso zzso The dynamic nature of development across different structures is, however, not well zzso and the present magnetic resonance imaging study took advantage of a zzso zzso approach to describe the zzso zzso of 16 zzso volumes in the same sample of children, zzso and young adults zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso The cerebral cortex, cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area, zzso amygdala, thalamus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso inferior lateral zzso third zzso and fourth zzso were zzso The cerebral zzso was further analyzed in terms of zzso thickness and surface zzso The results revealed substantial zzso in zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso in the cerebral zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the zzso and zzso showed slight, zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in both the zzso and zzso with an earlier maturation in zzso zzso In addition to similarities in zzso zzso within zzso regions, our results also point to differences between structures within the same zzso among the zzso zzso the zzso showed a weaker relationship with age than the zzso and zzso and in the zzso differences were found between zzso and zzso zzso These results emphasize the importance of studying a wide range of structural variables in the same sample, for a broader understanding of brain zzso zzso
