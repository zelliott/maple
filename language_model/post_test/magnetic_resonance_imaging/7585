zzso tissue reactions associated with zzso zzso hips are common in resurfacing and total hip zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these reactions in painful, zzso zzso is zzso zzso 

The purposes of this study were to compare the zzso zzso wear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response on zzso and zzso graded zzso tissue damage between zzso zzso hips revised for unexplained pain and zzso hips revised for other reasons and to zzso determine whether the presence of a taper junction on a zzso articulation affects these four parameters in unexplained zzso 

We zzso studied 88 patients zzso zzso who had undergone revision of either a hip resurfacing or a zzso zzso 36 zzso zzso Thirty-five hips revised for unexplained pain were compared with a control group of 59 hips revised for other zzso zzso wear was measured using three-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso analysis was performed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on 57 patients to determine zzso volumes and zzso zzso damage was graded from zzso zzso 

zzso wear rates in the unexplained pain group were lower than in the control group zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso percent of patients in the unexplained pain group had zzso confirmation of zzso compared with zzso in the control group zzso zzso zzso The zzso thickness on zzso was higher in the unexplained pain group zzso zzso zzso and was highly zzso of zzso Severe zzso tissue damage was noted in more cases in the unexplained pain group zzso zzso zzso There were no differences in zzso wear, zzso zzso and tissue damage between zzso and zzso revised for unexplained zzso 

Unexplained pain in patients with zzso zzso hips warrants further investigation with zzso to look for features zzso of zzso zzso destruction in these cases does not appear to be related to high bearing wear or the presence of a zzso
