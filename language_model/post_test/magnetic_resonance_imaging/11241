zzso ambiguous sentences have been found to be difficult to process, in particular, for individuals with low working memory zzso The current study used zzso to investigate the neural basis of this effect in the processing of written zzso Participants with high and low working memory capacity read sentences with either a short or long region of temporary zzso ambiguity while being zzso A distributed zzso network in the zzso region was identified to support sentence processing in the critical region of the zzso Within this network, only the superior portion of zzso area zzso zzso and a zzso region showed an zzso increase as a function of the length of the syntactically ambiguous region in the zzso Furthermore, it was only the BA 44 region that exhibited an interaction of working memory span, length of the zzso zzso and sentence zzso In this area, the zzso increase for syntactically more complex sentences became only significant under longer regions of zzso and for low span readers zzso This finding suggests that neural activity in BA 44 increases during sentence comprehension when processing demands increase, be it due to zzso processing demands or by an interaction with the individually available working memory zzso
