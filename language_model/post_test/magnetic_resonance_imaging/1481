We have developed an zzso zzso zzso whose tuning can be adjusted automatically between 120 and 128 zzso for sequential zzso imaging of hydrogen and zzso zzso at field strength 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were placed on each rung of an zzso zzso zzso zzso to change the tuning frequency of the zzso The zzso junction zzso can be controlled by the amount of applied reverse bias zzso zzso matching was also done automatically by another pair of zzso zzso to obtain the maximum zzso at each zzso The same bias zzso was applied to the tuning zzso on all rungs to avoid zzso in the zzso A network zzso was used to monitor matching and tuning of the zzso A zzso PC controlled the zzso through the zzso zzso A code written in zzso was used to communicate with the network zzso and adjust the bias zzso of the zzso via zzso zzso zzso programmed zzso zzso devices were used to apply the bias zzso to the zzso Isolation amplifiers were used together with zzso choke zzso to provide isolation between the zzso zzso and the DC bias zzso We acquired zzso and zzso images zzso from a zzso phantom using the designed zzso Good matching and tuning were obtained at both resonance zzso The tuning and matching of the zzso were changed from one resonance frequency to the other within 60 zzso
