zzso resonance imaging with contrast agents zzso is a procedure currently used for the diagnosis of zzso zzso These zzso are often characterized by zzso barrier zzso which determines a direct contact between CA and brain zzso For this reason, an accurate assessment of zzso is useful for the development of new zzso The present study was designed to evaluate the zzso of a new CA for zzso zzso zzso employing a zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on the zzso levels of zzso was zzso In particular, the brain zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, were measured using zzso after the direct application of zzso zzso into the rat corpus zzso zzso zzso and zzso were employed as reference zzso 

A zzso probe for brain zzso fluid sampling and a stainless-steel zzso for CA application were chronically inserted into the right corpus zzso of zzso All zzso were administered at a dose of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed using zzso liquid zzso 

zzso zzso did not induce any significant changes in the zzso levels of zzso or zzso zzso up to 2 hours after zzso zzso produced similar zzso zzso zzso caused a moderate but not significant increase in zzso levels throughout the duration of the zzso 

zzso zzso directly administered into the corpus zzso of freely moving rats did not affect the zzso zzso This result demonstrates the safety of zzso zzso under the experimental conditions used, thus confirming previous behavioral and zzso zzso
