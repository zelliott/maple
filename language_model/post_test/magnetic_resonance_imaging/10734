The zzso ratio zzso is often used to evaluate magnetic resonance images, because it has two zzso contrast and zzso and indicates the zzso of clinical zzso Two methods zzso a phantom and using clinical zzso are employed to measure zzso In addition, there are some methods of measurement that use clinical zzso In this report, the accuracy of measurement and correlation for signal zzso were evaluated in four methods of measuring zzso using clinical zzso The results indicated that the zzso method using an air signal provided good accuracy and was consistent with signal zzso using observer zzso In addition, a small region of interest zzso was better suited as the target for zzso measurement using clinical zzso
