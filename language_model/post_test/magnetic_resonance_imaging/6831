To evaluate the magnetic resonance zzso imaging features of the developing zzso in fetal pig zzso 

MR images of 15 fetal pig zzso which were zzso into three groups of specimens representing each third of the zzso period, were used to compare increasing zzso length (as an indication of zzso zzso with zzso growth in multiple dimensions by using zzso product moment zzso zzso zzso visibility of the secondary zzso center and its zzso prominence of the zzso structures zzso groove of zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso differences were evaluated zzso These features were also evaluated on zzso zzso 

With zzso length zzso used as indications of zzso age, there were three, five, and seven fetal pig specimens in each gestation zzso During fetal development, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso transformed from an oval to a zzso structure, with most of the growth occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso visibility of the secondary zzso center and its zzso and zzso zzso increased later in zzso zzso of zzso structures, however, was greatest during the middle third of gestation and decreased zzso During the fetal period, the zzso groove of zzso and the bone bark were easily identifiable at MR zzso zzso zzso increased with zzso 

MR imaging depicts fetal pig skeletal features that can be confirmed zzso and that may prove to be useful at human prenatal skeletal zzso
