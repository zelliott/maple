The presence of zzso is used for diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso Assessment of zzso bone zzso in children is challenging due to lack of normal zzso 

To define normal appearances of zzso depressions in the wrist on zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso of the wrist were performed in 88 healthy children, zzso years of zzso We assessed the number of zzso depressions within the zzso zzso on both zzso separately and zzso 

A total of 75 zzso depressions were identified on zzso compared to zzso on zzso The number of zzso depressions identified zzso showed no statistically significant difference across zzso Within the zzso there was no significant difference between zzso depressions identified by zzso or zzso except at the bases of the second zzso 

zzso depressions that resemble zzso are normal findings in the wrist in zzso zzso identifies more depressions than zzso in the zzso Some zzso depressions occur at typical locations and should be accounted for when assessing the wrist in zzso to avoid zzso
