zzso injuries occur due to zzso forces causing disruption of the zzso and middle spinal zzso These fractures classically consist of a fracture line through the zzso zzso zzso involvement of the zzso zzso complex is, however, zzso zzso treatment is often required for these unstable injuries to avoid neurological deterioration and zzso zzso and the surgery traditionally consists of an open zzso approach with zzso zzso zzso zzso screw fixation for these injuries, with the goal of minimal tissue disruption and preservation of normal anatomy while achieving adequate stabilization, has recently been reported in the literature, but to date, a direct comparative study comparing open and zzso fixation has not been zzso The authors report their experience treating these fractures with both techniques and review the available zzso 

Patients with zzso injury who were treated between May 2003 and March 2013 were zzso zzso American Spinal zzso Association scores and degree of zzso zzso were recorded at admission, zzso and zzso Data regarding zzso blood loss and operative time were obtained from a chart zzso Patients treated with open versus minimally invasive procedures were zzso 

The authors identified 39 patients who suffered zzso injuries and were treated at their institution during the specified zzso one of these patients declined zzso All had injury to the zzso zzso zzso Open surgical procedures with zzso screw fixation and zzso fusion were performed in 27 patients, while 11 patients underwent minimally invasive zzso screw zzso Overall, there was improvement in zzso zzso at the time of discharge as well as most recent follow-up in both the open surgery and minimally invasive surgery zzso zzso The authors found no significant difference in American Spinal zzso Association score or the degree of zzso zzso between the zzso and open surgery zzso There was a trend toward shorter operative time for the zzso group, and patients who underwent minimally invasive procedures had significantly less blood zzso 

zzso invasive zzso zzso screw fixation appears to have similar efficacy in the treatment of zzso injuries and it allows for reduced blood loss and tissue damage compared with open surgical zzso Therefore it should be considered as an option for the treatment of this type of zzso
