Some surgeons use magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in patients with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso origin zzso referred to as lateral zzso to plan and justify surgical zzso zzso of defects of the origin of the zzso or associated abnormalities of the lateral collateral ligament zzso could affect zzso We tested the hypothesis that patients with zzso signal abnormalities consistent with zzso of the zzso are equally likely to have findings consistent with an zzso zzso or zzso zzso whether they are being evaluated as part of zzso planning for lateral elbow pain or for an elbow condition that does not feature lateral elbow zzso 

For each of 24 consecutive patients with zzso of the zzso who had zzso for zzso zzso we selected 2 zzso and zzso controls from a list of patients who had an elbow zzso to evaluate other elbow zzso The origin of the zzso and the zzso were specifically zzso 

Patients diagnosed with zzso of the zzso were significantly more likely than control patients to have signal changes consistent with zzso of the zzso origin (24 of 24 vs 9 of zzso p zzso zzso The proportion of patients with a partial thickness zzso of the zzso origin zzso of 24 vs 4 of 9) was comparable between patients diagnosed with zzso of the zzso origin and zzso Signal changes in the zzso were comparable in patients diagnosed with zzso of the zzso origin and control patients (8 of 24 vs 2 of 9; p zzso zzso and no patient had clinical evidence of zzso 

Use of zzso in the management of patients with zzso of the zzso origin merits further zzso
