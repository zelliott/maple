A zzso process to remove zzso from zzso solution is investigated in this study using a magnetic resonance imaging zzso protocol to rapidly obtain multiple zzso zzso resolved zzso zzso concentration zzso The zzso technique is described in detail and its ability to determine the evolution in both zzso and zzso concentration profiles demonstrated, from which total column capacity can be zzso The final zzso exchange column design allows operation in the zzso zzso regime, hence making use of its full capacity before zzso Conventional techniques for such process zzso are either restricted to the analysis of the zzso outlet, which provides no information on the spatial zzso of the system, or are invasive and need a variety of sample points to obtain zzso concentration zzso To the best of our knowledge, our results represent the first concentration maps describing the zzso of metal zzso contaminated zzso
