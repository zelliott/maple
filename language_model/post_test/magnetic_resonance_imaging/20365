zzso study improves memory, but the underlying neural mechanisms of this improvement are not well zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso similarity analysis of brain activity, we found that, compared with forgotten items, subsequently remembered faces and words showed greater similarity in neural zzso across multiple study in many brain regions, including (but not limited to) the regions whose mean activities were correlated with subsequent zzso This result addresses a longstanding debate in the study of memory by showing that successful episodic memory zzso occurs when the same neural representations are more precisely zzso across study episodes, rather than when patterns of zzso are more variable across zzso
