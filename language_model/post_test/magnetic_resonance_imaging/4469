Although zzso in the female pelvis are not rare, their magnetic resonance zzso appearance has not been well zzso zzso we zzso the MR appearances of various stages of zzso in the female zzso A retrospective analysis of 35 zzso in 28 patients zzso zzso with a zzso T MR unit was zzso The time zzso between the insult and MR imaging was determined and the appearances of the zzso were zzso The results were compared with those in the central nervous zzso The evolution of zzso in the pelvis appeared similar to that of zzso in the brain, and four stages zzso early zzso late zzso and zzso were identified according to the signal intensity pattern on zzso and zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso differed from zzso zzso in the following features: zzso The speed of evolving pelvic zzso was zzso zzso In the zzso of acute zzso slightly zzso areas were seen on both zzso suggesting residual zzso zzso zzso evaluated in the early zzso stage had complex zzso zzso In older zzso central intermediate signal intensity areas, presumably due to zzso zzso became zzso on zzso weighted zzso In conclusion, although the evolution of a pelvic zzso is similar to that of a brain zzso its speed is gradual and MR appearances are somewhat different due to environmental zzso
