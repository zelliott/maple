To compare the accuracy of cardiac zzso CT zzso reconstructions obtained at zzso and zzso of the cardiac cycle and zzso for zzso global left zzso zzso function and mass in heart transplant zzso 

We zzso included 23 heart transplant recipients (21 male, mean age zzso zzso who underwent cardiac zzso and zzso zzso We compared zzso parameters on cardiac zzso reconstructions obtained at zzso zzso and zzso zzso intervals of the cardiac cycle and on zzso zzso MR zzso We determined ejection fraction zzso zzso volume zzso zzso volume zzso stroke volume zzso and zzso mass using commercially available zzso zzso analysis software for zzso zzso and conventional manual zzso tracing for MR zzso 

Using different reconstruction intervals to zzso zzso parameters at zzso resulted in zzso differences zzso Compared to zzso zzso slightly overestimated zzso zzso and mass when both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso difference zzso zzso and zzso zzso reconstruction intervals were zzso zzso and zzso estimates of zzso and zzso were not significantly zzso 

In heart transplant recipients, zzso allows reliable zzso of zzso function and mass compared with zzso even using zzso zzso zzso
