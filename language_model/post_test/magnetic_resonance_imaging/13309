A boy with a right zzso zzso due to a left zzso middle cerebral artery zzso developed focal zzso at 33 months and then an insidious and subsequently more zzso massive cognitive and zzso zzso with a frontal syndrome between the ages of 4 and 5 years with continuous zzso during sleep zzso on the zzso Both the zzso and the zzso were immediately suppressed by zzso at the age of 5 years and 4 zzso A zzso follow-up prior to zzso an zzso zzso and zzso and serial zzso zzso assessments were performed until the age of 11 zzso The spread of the zzso activity to the zzso frontal region was the cause of the zzso frontal zzso A later gradual long-term but incomplete cognitive recovery, with moderate mental disability was zzso This outcome is probably explained by another facet of the zzso namely the structural effects of prolonged zzso zzso in rapidly developing cerebral networks which are, at the same time undergoing the reorganization imposed by a unilateral early zzso zzso Group studies on the outcome of children before and after zzso using only single zzso measures, zzso and zzso may miss particular zzso cognitive zzso as they are likely to be different from case to zzso Such detailed and rarely available complementary clinical and zzso data obtained in a single case at different time periods in relation to the zzso including zzso zzso findings, may help to understand the different cognitive deficits and recovery profiles and the limits of full cognitive zzso
