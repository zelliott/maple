zzso fluid dynamics zzso and magnetic resonance zzso gas zzso were zzso performed to study zzso in the same model of human zzso zzso zzso in zzso human airway geometry was segmented from zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional zzso description of the airways was used for both generation of a physical airway model using rapid zzso and mesh generation for zzso zzso Steady zzso zzso experiments zzso number Re zzso zzso were performed and zzso maps down to the fourth airway generation were extracted from a new zzso mapping technique based on MR zzso using zzso zzso zzso Full two-dimensional maps of the zzso zzso were measured within a few zzso zzso simulations were carried out with the experimental flow conditions, and the two sets of data were compared between the two zzso zzso zzso agreed within zzso Main and secondary flow zzso zzso were similar, as were zzso zzso zzso This work demonstrates that experimental and zzso gas zzso data can be obtained and compared in the same complex airway zzso zzso validated the simulation platform that zzso zzso airway reconstruction process from in zzso zzso scans and zzso field calculation with zzso hence allowing the results of this zzso tool to be used with confidence in potential clinical applications for lung zzso Finally, this combined zzso and experimental approach of flow assessment in realistic in zzso human airway zzso confirmed the strong dependence of airway flow patterns on local and global geometrical factors, which could contribute to gas zzso
