Natural stimuli are increasingly used in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies to imitate real-life zzso zzso challenges are created for novel analysis methods, including new zzso zzso With natural stimuli it is no longer feasible to assume single features of the experimental design alone to account for the brain zzso Instead, relevant combinations of rich enough stimulus features could explain the more complex zzso zzso We propose a novel zzso approach, where independent component analysis is first used to identify zzso independent brain zzso which we refer to as functional zzso As the second step, zzso zzso between stimuli and functional patterns are detected using zzso correlation zzso Our proposed method looks for combinations of stimulus features and the corresponding combinations of functional zzso This zzso approach was used to analyze zzso from an zzso study during zzso zzso The detected complex zzso patterns were explained as resulting from interactions of multiple brain zzso Our approach seems promising for analysis of data from studies with natural zzso
