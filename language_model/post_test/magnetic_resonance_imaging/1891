The aim of the present zzso zzso zzso study was to measure the dynamic changes in cerebral activity before and after practice of an explicitly known sequence of foot movements when executed physically and to compare them to those zzso during motor imagery of the same zzso Nine healthy volunteers were scanned while performing both types of movement at an early phase of learning and after a zzso training period of a sequence of zzso and zzso with the left zzso These experimental conditions were compared directly, as well as to a zzso control zzso Changes in regional cerebral blood flow associated with physical execution of the sequence early in the learning process were observed zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as in the left inferior zzso zzso After training, however, most of these brain regions were no longer significantly zzso suggesting that they are critical for establishing the cognitive strategies and motor routines involved in executing sequential foot zzso By contrast, after practice, an increased level of activity was seen zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as in the left zzso portion of the anterior zzso and a different region of the inferior zzso zzso suggesting that these structures play an important role in the development of a long lasting representation of the zzso Finally, as predicted, a similar pattern of dynamic changes was observed in both zzso of learning during the motor imagery zzso This last finding suggests that the cerebral plasticity occurring during the incremental acquisition of a motor sequence executed physically is reflected by the covert production of this skilled behavior using motor zzso
