In patients with zzso zzso zzso the left zzso zzso inflow jet is narrow and has a high pressure zzso A zzso zzso restrictive zzso flow pattern is a characteristic feature of severe left zzso zzso However, zzso flow analysis is limited by the angle between the blood flow jet and the zzso zzso In this study we used gated magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the inflow zzso in the zzso zzso directions during early zzso in patients with zzso 

We studied 10 patients with zzso zzso age: 47 zzso Ten zzso healthy volunteers were also zzso zzso echo images of the zzso were zzso Left zzso short axis phase contrast images were obtained at the level of the zzso valve tip and 1 zzso inside the zzso Long axis images were also zzso zzso peak zzso at peak early zzso filling were measured along the zzso long zzso zzso short zzso and zzso short zzso Blood zzso was measured in 50 zzso zzso 

Early zzso inflow zzso along the long zzso especially at the center of the zzso was well preserved in zzso However, the inflow zzso in the zzso zzso direction of the zzso zzso in the direction of zzso valve zzso was significantly reduced in zzso 

Early zzso inflow zzso in the zzso zzso direction of the zzso is reduced in patients with zzso indicating that the zzso component of the forces acting in the zzso zzso direction of the zzso may be decreased in patients with zzso during early zzso zzso
