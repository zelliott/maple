zzso techniques have played a major role in the assessment of mechanical zzso and the selection of patients for cardiac zzso zzso The accuracy and reliability of such measures, however, have recently been placed under great zzso This has shifted interest to cardiovascular magnetic resonance as an alternative method to assess zzso zzso but these methods are relatively zzso and not used widely zzso zzso the purpose of this review is to highlight existing and emerging zzso acquisition methods for zzso zzso as well as the potential role of zzso to improve patient selection for zzso 

zzso has a number of advantages over current zzso methods for the assessment of zzso zzso including quantitative assessment of zzso strain and zzso zzso burden and zzso Recent studies also demonstrate the ability to perform zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso assessment of zzso zzso is a logical alternative to zzso based methods that provides highly quantitative and zzso data sets of function and zzso that are zzso of zzso zzso The future ability to perform zzso imaging in patients zzso and zzso may for the first time allow full characterization of zzso zzso
