In order to expand the repertoire of zzso functions that can be effectively studied through functional zzso we have developed a tactile zzso which can deliver rich and varied combinations of stimulation that simulate natural tactile zzso The system is computer controlled and compatible with an zzso zzso Complex aspects of zzso can thus be studied independent of confounds introduced by motor activity or problems with precision, accuracy or zzso of stimulus zzso
