zzso zzso are frequently detected in brains of patients with zzso zzso and rare in those with zzso zzso zzso zzso This study investigates for the first time the zzso distribution of zzso on a zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso findings in 12 zzso brains were compared with eight zzso zzso The presence of cerebrovascular zzso was evaluated on a zzso section of a cerebral zzso at the level of the zzso body and on a horizontal section through zzso and zzso On zzso the distribution and the number of cortical focal signal intensity losses, representing zzso were assessed on zzso sections at the zzso the central and the zzso level of a cerebral zzso 

Overall, cerebrovascular zzso were zzso Only white matter damage was significantly more severe in zzso brains compared with controls zzso zzso zzso On zzso zzso were only significantly prevalent in the deep cortical layers zzso zzso zzso and borderline increased in the middle cortical layers zzso zzso zzso of the frontal zzso 

zzso zzso are rare in zzso The white matter damage has to be considered as part of the neurodegenerative zzso zzso prevail in the frontal regions with the most severe zzso damage and probably represent associated disruption of the zzso zzso
