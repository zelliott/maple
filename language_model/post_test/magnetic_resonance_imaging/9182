zzso cochlear nerves zzso have been associated with poor cochlear implant zzso zzso data on zzso diameter based on zzso imaging have not been zzso The objectives of this study were to determine if zzso diameter could be zzso measured on zzso constructive interference in steady state zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to establish a zzso range for zzso zzso 

zzso review of zzso images by two independent blinded zzso 

Thirty patients zzso zzso with a zzso zzso done for auditory complaints in patients with normal hearing in one ear were zzso zzso diameters were measured in a zzso plane just zzso to the internal auditory canal zzso zzso by two independent zzso zzso areas were calculated and zzso agreement was zzso 

The zzso was identified in zzso of studied zzso In zzso the diameters were able to be measured by both zzso In zzso of zzso the cochlear nerve was unable to be measured secondary to the proximity of the zzso to zzso zzso The zzso vertical diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso horizontal diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso area zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were normally zzso There was good zzso correlation for each zzso 

zzso diameter can be reliably measured at the zzso zzso This study establishes zzso zzso data for the zzso zzso These data may be used to evaluate the cause and treatment prognosis in patients with zzso hearing zzso
