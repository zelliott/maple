The objective of this study was to evaluate the zzso and its supporting structures in patients with stress urinary zzso using MR imaging with an zzso zzso 

We reviewed MR images obtained using an zzso zzso in 63 patients with stress urinary zzso and in 16 continent zzso We compared the two groups for the thickness of the zzso muscle, smooth muscle, and zzso of the zzso degree of asymmetry of the zzso zzso frequency of distortion in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso degree of the zzso zzso and dimension of the zzso zzso Using the status of the zzso and its supporting structures as our basis, we scored the risk of stress urinary zzso for each woman on a scale of zzso 

The zzso muscle layer of the zzso was thinner in the group with stress urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than that in the continent group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A high degree of asymmetry of zzso muscle zzso was more frequent in the group with stress urinary zzso zzso than in the continent group zzso zzso zzso zzso Supporting ligaments were more frequently distorted in the zzso group than in the continent zzso zzso zzso ligaments were found in zzso of the patients with stress urinary zzso versus zzso of the women who were zzso distorted zzso ligaments were found in zzso of the patients with stress urinary zzso versus zzso of the women who were zzso and distorted zzso ligaments were found in zzso of the patients with stress urinary zzso versus zzso of the women who were continent zzso zzso zzso The group with stress urinary zzso had a greater zzso angle zzso degrees vs 125 degrees ) and larger zzso space zzso vs zzso zzso than did the women who were continent zzso zzso zzso The score for the risk of stress urinary zzso was higher in the group with stress urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the women who were continent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

MR imaging with an zzso zzso revealed significant zzso zzso of the zzso and supporting structures in patients with stress urinary zzso
