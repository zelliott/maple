In this work some of the factors that can influence the zzso ratio zzso and spatial resolution in MR images of zzso zzso gases are systematically zzso In particular, the effects of zzso depletion of zzso polarization and image zzso diffusion zzso were assessed in terms of their contribution to a zzso zzso By means of theoretical simulations and a novel method of experimental validation using a variable zzso zzso of the zzso zzso systematic quantitative and qualitative investigations of the effects of zzso filtering intrinsic to imaging of zzso gas were zzso A zzso zzso image is considered for a range of flip angles with zzso zzso and zzso Cartesian zzso strategies, and the results are assessed in terms of zzso and spatial resolution in the reconstructed zzso Centric phase zzso was found to give the best zzso at higher flip angles, with a zzso in spatial resolution compared to sequential phase zzso A zzso approach potentially offers increased zzso through the use of higher flip angles without compromising the spatial resolution, which is comparable to that achieved with sequential zzso
