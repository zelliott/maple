A fast parallel zzso zzso reconstruction method is presented for zzso and zzso zzso zzso A limitation of the zzso generalized zzso partially parallel acquisitions zzso method is the need to acquire training data prior to the actual zzso This can be eliminated by the use of zzso when zzso the missing data for each zzso zzso The training data for each zzso are estimated by zzso the conventionally reconstructed composite image, which contains the zzso artifacts from zzso with each zzso spatial sensitivity zzso An estimate of the individual receiver spatial sensitivity profiles is obtained from the zzso data that fulfill the zzso sampling zzso The frequency domain representation of the training data is then calculated at the acquired zzso sample points and at the zzso locations at which we desire to zzso zzso zzso Fitting the acquired zzso samples to the zzso points creates reconstruction weights that are used to zzso zzso zzso zzso The in zzso feasibility of the method for zzso zzso zzso is illustrated with an example of zzso abdominal zzso zzso results obtained after applying the method on a zzso zzso zzso free zzso zzso data set are also zzso
