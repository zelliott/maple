Our objective is to outline the utility of adrenal zzso sampling zzso with zzso of zzso to zzso ratios for diagnostic zzso of zzso in a patient with normal plasma levels of zzso A zzso was referred for evaluation of zzso zzso following a right zzso 14 years zzso Diagnosis of zzso disease was established from zzso in plasma zzso with normal levels of zzso zzso resonance imaging indicated two 1-2 zzso masses in the right surgical bed and another zzso zzso mass in the left zzso These masses were negative on zzso zzso There was no evidence of a zzso zzso zzso therefore, carried out two zzso approaches to identify the tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso disease in the right surgical bed and also suggested additional left adrenal zzso zzso plasma catecholamines precluded the use of adrenal zzso sampling zzso with zzso zzso zzso we performed zzso with zzso of plasma zzso which were zzso to zzso higher in the left adrenal vein than in central zzso zzso We observed a reversal of the normally high zzso to zzso ratio zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso establishing the presence of a left adrenal zzso zzso pathology confirmed bilateral zzso This case highlights a scenario where a combination of zzso and zzso with measurement of the zzso to zzso ratio was crucial for the zzso assessment of a patient with bilateral zzso
