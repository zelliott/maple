Our objective was to map by means of a conventional zzso zzso zzso MR imaging system the zzso areas activated by unilateral tactile stimulation of the hand, with particular attention to the areas of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso imaging sequences were performed in 12 healthy volunteers to acquire 10 zzso zzso sections parallel to the zzso and zzso planes during tactile stimulation of the zzso The stimulation paradigm consisted of brushing the subjects' palm and fingers with a rough sponge at a frequency of about 1 zzso 

zzso provoked a signal increase (about zzso to zzso that temporally corresponded to the stimulus in several cortical regions of both zzso zzso zzso zzso were in the anterior zzso zzso in an area presumably corresponding to the hand representation zone of the first zzso cortex, in the zzso zzso cortex, and in the zzso zzso zzso forming the upper bank of the zzso zzso and probably corresponding to the second zzso zzso zzso zzso were also observed in the frontal zzso zzso activated areas were in regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso roughly symmetrical to those activated in the zzso zzso The same zzso pattern was observed in all zzso 

The activated areas of the zzso zzso described in the present study corresponded to those reported in other studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso functional MR zzso An additional area of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso unnoticed in other functional MR imaging studies, was also zzso
