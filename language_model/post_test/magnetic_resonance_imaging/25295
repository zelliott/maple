In this study, we demonstrate the application of zzso labeling and magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the zzso zzso of changes in bacterial density zzso as a function of time in a zzso porous zzso zzso particles zzso zzso zzso were attached via a zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The cells maintained their zzso after zzso and the presence of the zzso did not significantly alter cell swimming zzso zzso migration for both zzso and zzso zzso coli through a porous medium with a zzso distribution of zzso zzso was zzso The movement of the zzso cells was described by an effective random zzso zzso consistent with zzso diffusion of a zzso zzso An effective zzso determined a zzso from bacterial zzso in an zzso medium and properties of the porous medium adequately described the movement of the zzso zzso The ability to zzso zzso bacterial zzso within an opaque porous medium in real time provides researchers with a powerful tool for studying bacterial transport in porous zzso This is important for understanding the impact of bacterial transport on zzso strategies for environmental cleanup of zzso zzso
