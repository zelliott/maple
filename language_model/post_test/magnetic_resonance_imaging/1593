Independent component analysis zzso is a new technique in statistical signal processing to extract independent components from zzso zzso of mixed zzso In this paper, for the processing of functional magnetic resonance zzso data, two signals of near zzso are used as the mixed signals and are separated by zzso The correlation zzso between the reference signal and the separated signals are calculated and those zzso whose correlation zzso are greater than a threshold are considered to be the activated zzso by the zzso and so the functional zzso of the stimulation is zzso The zzso of the method was primarily proved by trial of real brain functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso
