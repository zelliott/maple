To evaluate whether there are any factors that predict zzso cells being found in zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso To determine whether zzso provides useful staging information not provided by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso patients with primary central nervous system zzso zzso 

We compared the zzso zzso and spinal zzso staging results in zzso patients with primary zzso zzso at a UK zzso referral zzso over a zzso 

Of 159 zzso samples, 72 samples were from 72 patients with primary zzso zzso with spinal zzso available for zzso Eight of these 72 had positive zzso zzso zzso and one zzso All had a high clinical suspicion of zzso at the time of zzso Of the 72 patients, only two had evidence of zzso spread on zzso spinal staging and zzso zzso ten had zzso without zzso evidence and six had zzso without zzso zzso 

In zzso patients with primary zzso zzso zzso zzso provides useful staging zzso Spinal zzso alone may miss some patients with zzso spread who would be identified with zzso zzso
