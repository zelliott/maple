The vast majority of zzso patients with semantic impairment have better comprehension of concrete than abstract zzso In contrast, several patients with semantic zzso zzso who show circumscribed zzso of the anterior zzso zzso zzso have been reported to show reverse zzso effects, that is, relative preservation of abstract zzso Although these reports largely concern individual patients, some researchers have recently proposed that superior comprehension of abstract concepts is a characteristic feature of zzso This would imply that the anterior zzso zzso are particularly crucial for processing sensory aspects of semantic knowledge, which are associated with concrete not abstract zzso However, functional zzso studies of healthy participants do not unequivocally predict reverse zzso effects in zzso because the zzso poles sometimes show greater zzso for more abstract zzso The authors examined a zzso of 11 zzso patients on a synonym judgment test that zzso varied the frequency and zzso of the zzso All patients had higher success rates for more zzso as well as more frequent words, suggesting that zzso the anterior zzso zzso zzso semantic knowledge for both concrete and abstract concepts, zzso more zzso zzso because of their richer zzso zzso typically more robust in the face of global semantic degradation and zzso reverse zzso effects are not a characteristic feature of zzso
