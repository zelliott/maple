To evaluate the utility of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the lung zzso and to compare it with zzso zzso zzso in the assessment of zzso lung disease and other zzso lung zzso 

Institutional review board approval was obtained for retrospective image zzso A total of 236 patients who underwent MR imaging and CT as part of their assessment for suspected pulmonary hypertension were included in this zzso Lung MR imaging was performed with a zzso system as a stack of zzso two-dimensional balanced zzso free zzso zzso zzso Two zzso independently evaluated CT and MR images for various zzso zzso such as pulmonary fibrosis, zzso and zzso disease, solid zzso zzso disease, and zzso zzso statistics were used to measure zzso zzso 

zzso and specificity of MR imaging in the identification of pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso respectively, when compared with zzso In comparison to CT, MR imaging depicted zzso of zzso zzso Nine of the 12 zzso zzso were identified on MR zzso Lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also well zzso on MR zzso MR imaging was however less effective in depicting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and minor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study shows zzso MR imaging is inferior to CT in imaging zzso lung zzso however, this study does demonstrate for the first time a potential role for the zzso sequence as an alternative radiation-free zzso imaging zzso for use in patients with pulmonary zzso
