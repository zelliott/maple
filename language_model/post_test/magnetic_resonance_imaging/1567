The purpose of this investigation was to correlate magnetic resonance zzso images of zzso zzso ligament zzso injuries with gross zzso zzso zzso knees with zzso injury following an initial zzso dislocation were examined using zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso MR zzso MR findings were subsequently correlated with open zzso zzso injury was observed in 26 zzso of the 27 zzso From the MR images, zzso zzso and/or zzso intensity changes anterior to the zzso attachment were seen in 13 zzso of the 16 knees with zzso type injuries of the zzso In 8 zzso of the 10 knees with zzso type injuries, detachment of the zzso from the zzso attachment, accompanied with or without zzso intensity changes, was zzso zzso injury types could be accurately diagnosed on 21 zzso out of 26 knees using MR zzso MR imaging was an acceptable method in diagnosing zzso injury zzso
