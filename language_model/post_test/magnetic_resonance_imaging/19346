zzso brain size increased dramatically in the face of apparently severe associated evolutionary zzso This suggests that increasing brain size must have provided some sort of zzso zzso zzso Several recent studies using magnetic resonance imaging zzso have indicated that a substantial correlation zzso r zzso approximately zzso exists between brain size and general cognitive performance, consistent with the hypothesis that the payoff for increasing brain size was greater general cognitive zzso However, these studies confound zzso environmental influences with direct zzso zzso To address this problem, zzso zzso sibling differences for several zzso measures were correlated to zzso scores on a diverse battery of cognitive tests in a sample of 36 sibling zzso zzso correlations between zzso and general cognitive ability were essentially zero, although moderate correlations were found between prefrontal volumes and the zzso test zzso to involve prefrontal zzso These findings suggest that zzso influences play a role in brain zzso ability zzso zzso direct zzso associations may be quite small, and yet still may be strong enough to account for zzso brain zzso
