Due to the proximity of eloquent areas of the brain, the surgical treatment of insular zzso causing zzso zzso is considered zzso We report here on our experience in this zzso 

We identified 24 patients zzso zzso years, mean zzso who underwent zzso surgery for an insular zzso from the zzso surgery data zzso We analyzed the zzso zzso surgical strategy and zzso follow-up zzso zzso months, mean zzso for functional morbidity and seizure zzso
