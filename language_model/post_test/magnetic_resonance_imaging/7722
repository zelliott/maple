zzso state brain activity, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the absence of zzso is widely investigated in clinical, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, despite the general and broad interest in zzso the nature of resting state networks zzso there has not been a thorough investigation into the relationship between these functional networks and their adherence to zzso brain zzso We acquired resting state zzso data from 10 subjects and extracted individual and group zzso maps respectively using independent component analysis zzso and self zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based alignment zzso an advanced surface based alignment technique which uses individual zzso information to align individual subjects' brains to a dynamic group average, was used to zzso anatomical correspondence across zzso Cross subject spatial correlations of the zzso maps zzso zzso were carried out with and without zzso Seven zzso which are amongst the most reported and studied networks, were zzso We observed a systematic gain in the spatial correlation in all of them following zzso although this gain was not uniform across zzso The observed increase in similarity of the functional zzso after anatomical alignment illustrates that these functional networks are indeed related to underlying zzso zzso Moreover, our results demonstrate that by correcting for individual anatomical differences, advanced surface based alignment techniques increase the overlap of corresponding resting state networks across subjects, thereby providing a useful means to improve resting state group statistics with no need for substantial zzso
