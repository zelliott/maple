In routine clinical work, registration accuracy is assessed by visual zzso However, the accuracy of visual assessment of registration has not been zzso This study establishes the limits of visual detection of zzso in a registered brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to magnetic resonance image zzso The zzso registered image volume was obtained by automatic registration using mutual information zzso zzso movements by 1 zzso 2 zzso 3 zzso and 4 zzso and zzso movements by 1 degrees , 2 degrees , 3 degrees and 4 degrees in the positive and negative directions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso axes were introduced to this zzso These 48 images plus six zzso registered images were presented in random sequence to five observers for visual categorization of registration zzso No observer detected a zzso zzso in the zzso registered zzso zzso for zzso variation using observer pairings showed a high percentage of agreement in assigned categories for both zzso and zzso zzso Assessment of the limits of detection of zzso showed that a zzso zzso zzso was zzso by all observers in the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso With zzso zzso rotation around the zzso was zzso by all at 2 degrees rotation whereas rotation around the zzso was detected at zzso degrees zzso zzso around the zzso was not zzso with a positive rotation being identified at 2 degrees whereas negative rotation was detected by all only at 4 zzso zzso visual analysis appears to be a sensitive and practical means to assess image zzso zzso The awareness of the limits of visual detection of zzso will lead to increase care when evaluating registration quality in both research and clinical zzso
