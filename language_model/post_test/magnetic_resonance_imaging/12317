The purpose of this study was to determine if geometry of the zzso surfaces of the zzso plateau is associated with zzso anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso This was a zzso cohort study with a zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects who suffered a zzso zzso tear and a corresponding number of controls matched by age, sex, and sport underwent 3 T zzso of both zzso Surface geometry of the zzso zzso cartilage was characterized with zzso equations and comparisons were made between knees on the same person and between zzso and control zzso There was no difference in surface geometry between the knees of the control zzso In contrast, there were significant differences in the surface geometry between the injured and normal knees of the zzso subjects, suggesting that the zzso injury changed the cartilage surface zzso zzso comparisons were made between the zzso knees of the zzso subjects and the corresponding knees of their matched controls and this revealed significant differences in the surface geometry for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects tended to demonstrate a zzso directed orientation of the zzso surface relative to the long axis of the zzso while the control subjects were more likely to show a zzso directed zzso
