To evaluate the technical feasibility of performing elbow MR zzso via a zzso approach through the zzso 

The images of 19 patients with elbow MR zzso via a zzso zzso approach were zzso zzso The injections were performed by four musculoskeletal zzso using zzso guidance and a zzso or zzso zzso The zzso and subsequent MR images were reviewed by two musculoskeletal zzso and evaluated for zzso of joint zzso zzso degree and location of contrast zzso and presence of gas zzso 

The injection was diagnostic in all 19 patients, with a sufficient amount of contrast agent seen in the elbow zzso No significant contrast leakage occurred in 12 patients who received injections of 8 zzso or less of contrast agent, but moderate contrast leakage occurred in zzso patients who received injections of greater than 8 zzso zzso leakage generally occurred within the zzso zzso zzso No gas bubbles were identified in the injected zzso 

Patients often present for MR zzso of the elbow with zzso or lateral elbow zzso zzso leakage during a zzso approach may complicate evaluation of the lateral collateral ligament or the common zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso offers an alternative to the more commonly used zzso zzso With injected volumes not exceeding 8 zzso the risk of significant contrast leakage is zzso An advantage of the zzso injection is that contrast leakage through the zzso needle tract does not interfere with evaluation of the lateral zzso
