Early zzso cerebral zzso is implicated in the evolution of secondary damage after experimental and clinical traumatic brain injury zzso This is the first report of cerebral blood flow zzso measurement by continuous zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso early after zzso in rats using the controlled cortical impact zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso globally at approximately 3 zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso reductions in a zzso cortical region and zzso cortex, zzso In contrast, a prior zzso study from this laboratory showed at 24 zzso post trauma a focal zzso reduction restricted to the injury zzso In zzso zzso relaxation time zzso which is used in zzso zzso was zzso zzso early after zzso a time when zzso is developing in injured brain zzso At zzso zzso zzso values are increased zzso in the zzso zzso zzso consequently reducing zzso zzso to a similar zzso zzso should facilitate zzso zzso zzso with long-term functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
