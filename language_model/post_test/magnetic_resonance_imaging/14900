zzso resonance imaging zzso enables a zzso in zzso zzso of iron in various zzso Several techniques have been developed that detect signal zzso derived mainly from the magnetic properties of zzso and zzso the major iron storage zzso High magnetic zzso of zzso shortens the zzso relaxation time of nearby water zzso and thus zzso a focal signal extinction of zzso areas in zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue contrast is additionally influenced by other factors such as water content, zzso density, and the presence of other zzso zzso more specific methods are needed with higher specificity to zzso These in zzso techniques can be divided into three groups: zzso magnetic field correlation imaging and zzso contrast covering zzso imaging, and quantitative zzso zzso The differential diagnosis of various neurological disorders is aided by characteristic patterns of iron zzso Reliable estimates of cerebral tissue iron concentration are equally important in studying zzso age-related as well as pathological conditions in zzso zzso and vascular zzso In the future, monitoring changes in iron storage and content may serve as sensitive zzso for diagnosis as well as treatment zzso
