zzso studies have shown the involvement of prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso in regulating information zzso We conducted behavioral and zzso experiments to investigate the relationship between memory selection and proactive interference zzso using a delayed recognition task with a selection cue presented during the delay indicating which two of the four studied digits were relevant to the present zzso zzso was zzso by the response time differences between rejecting zzso matching and not matching the no longer relevant zzso By varying the delay zzso we found that the effect of zzso did not diminish, even for cases in which the zzso zzso was extended to 9 zzso but was stronger when the zzso zzso was zzso to 5 zzso By examining the correlation between zzso index and neural zzso of memory selection, we found that stronger zzso is predicted by lower zzso activity in the left inferior zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso middle frontal zzso Our results suggest that activity in the zzso network may contribute to one's ability to focus on the zzso information and may zzso reduce zzso in working zzso
