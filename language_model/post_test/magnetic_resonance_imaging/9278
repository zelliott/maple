zzso with a functional role of the motor system in speech perception, disturbing the activity of the left zzso zzso zzso by means of repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso has been shown to impair auditory identification of syllables that were masked with white zzso However, whether this region is crucial for speech perception under normal listening conditions remains zzso To directly test this hypothesis, we applied zzso to the left zzso zzso zzso and participants performed auditory speech tasks involving the same set of syllables but differing in the use of zzso zzso zzso Compared to sham zzso zzso applied over the zzso zzso zzso resulted in slower zzso discrimination requiring zzso zzso No effect was observed in zzso identification and syllable discrimination tasks that could be performed without need for zzso zzso The findings demonstrate a zzso role of the zzso zzso zzso in speech zzso under normal listening conditions and are interpreted in relation to theories assuming a link between perception and action in the human speech processing zzso
