The fine spatial scales of the structures in the human brain represent an enormous challenge to the successful integration of information from different images for both zzso and zzso zzso While many zzso to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and zzso to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity zzso and/or only part of the brain is zzso This paper introduces a new zzso called zzso zzso or zzso The novelty of zzso is that it treats the two images very zzso The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue zzso The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity zzso across tissue zzso Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the zzso Visual inspection and zzso results show that zzso is more accurate than correlation ratio or zzso mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity zzso zzso also excels at aligning zzso images to zzso images, a domain in which existing registration zzso frequently zzso Even in the limit of registering a single zzso we show the zzso results to be robust and zzso
