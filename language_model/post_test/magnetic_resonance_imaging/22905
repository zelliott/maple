To zzso investigate the apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso levels measured at hydrogen 1 zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso to monitor therapeutic responses of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval was zzso and all patients and control subjects provided informed zzso zzso proved large zzso zzso zzso in zzso were evaluated in 20 patients (16 men and four zzso mean age, 59 years; range, zzso zzso before zzso and 2-3 days after zzso A control group of eight adults (five men and three zzso mean age, 43 years; range, zzso zzso with normal zzso was examined by using the same zzso zzso zzso levels were measured by means of an external phantom replacement method, zzso the peak at zzso zzso at zzso MR zzso zzso were measured for all zzso A zzso rank sum test was used to compare absolute zzso zzso and zzso at baseline between zzso and normal liver zzso Changes in zzso levels and zzso in the tumors before and after zzso were analyzed by using the zzso signed rank zzso 

The median zzso zzso level in patients with zzso zzso in 18 of the 20 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was significantly higher than that in patients with normal zzso zzso zzso 8) zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso P zzso zzso Among 18 patients with zzso zzso levels decreased significantly from before zzso to after zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant increase in zzso from before zzso to after zzso in the 20 patients with zzso was also found zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels and zzso may allow monitoring of therapeutic responses of zzso to zzso although larger, more definitive and quantitative studies with clinical end points are zzso
