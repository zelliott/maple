To evaluate the diagnostic performance of fat suppression zzso compared to conventional zzso zzso spin echo sequences in zzso zzso 

31 patients with zzso conditions or clinically suspected pathology of the zzso were examined using conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso 3) and fat suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso 3) spin zzso before and after zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso All images were evaluated by three zzso experienced in MR imaging, concerning anatomical and pathological structures as well as zzso The images were graded on a scale of zzso (5 zzso excellent to 1 zzso zzso 

The evaluation of zzso structures showed that the zzso technique was superior to the conventional technique in respect of zzso the zzso muscles zzso to zzso p zzso zzso and also with regard to the zzso nerve zzso to zzso zzso conditions of the orbit zzso zzso and zzso spread of local zzso to the zzso however, were better zzso using the fat suppression technique zzso to zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso zzso fat suppressed spin zzso are useful in pathological conditions of the zzso In zzso zzso they may be the only sequences to show the zzso
