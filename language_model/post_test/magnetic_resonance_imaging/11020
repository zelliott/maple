zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso are the techniques of choice for zzso staging in zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso the information provided by zzso zzso regarding characterization of the zzso is rather zzso The present retrospective study was performed in the attempt to identify distinguishing features of zzso on zzso 

zzso examinations of 23 patients affected by zzso (16 primary and 7 zzso and 23 patients affected by zzso tumors zzso 12 zzso 9 zzso cell zzso and 2 neuroendocrine zzso of the zzso tract were zzso zzso arose from the lateral zzso wall in 17 cases, the zzso zzso in 5 cases, and the zzso zzso in 1 zzso The signal intensity of zzso and zzso was compared with muscles on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contrast enhancement was compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso patterns in the two groups of patients were zzso Bone involvement was graduated as zzso or erosion zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso extended, zzso zzso The size of the zzso was assessed by measuring the greatest diameter on zzso zzso statistics in the form of zzso zzso or zzso test was used for data zzso 

zzso showed a zzso pattern in all 23 cases by enhanced zzso zzso images and in 16 of 23 zzso zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso This pattern was observed in only I of the 23 zzso pathological examination of that zzso showed multiple zzso of zzso associated with zzso cell zzso Bone zzso was observed in 19 of 23 zzso which in five patients was associated with focal zzso zzso or intermediate (three zzso zzso In zzso zzso was present, which was always combined with focal (2 zzso or extended (21 zzso zzso A strong correlation was found between the pattern of bone changes and zzso zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso did not correlate with the size of the zzso The mean size of the zzso was significantly less than that of zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

A zzso pattern is a reliable zzso indicator of zzso and reflects its zzso architecture zzso zzso value of zzso The combination of this finding with the absence of extended bone erosion allows for the confident discrimination of zzso from zzso
