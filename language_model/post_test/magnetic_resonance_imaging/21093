zzso resonance images are useful in the study of experimental models of zzso lobe zzso The zzso zzso zzso technique is of interest since it combines the effects caused by zzso on the increased contrast in activated cell zzso when competing with calcium in synaptic zzso Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso evolution of the contrast related to zzso in the acute phase of zzso lobe zzso induced by systemic zzso and compare it to the expression of the zzso zzso During this phase, the intensity of the zzso signal was analyzed at three different time points zzso 15 or 30 minutes) after the onset of status zzso zzso The group that was maintained in status zzso for 30 minutes showed a decrease in intensity of the signal in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso There were no differences between the control group and the other groups treated with zzso The expression of the zzso zzso in the same animals showed that even in the zzso status zzso (5 zzso there was already zzso cellular zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Under the experimental conditions tested, our data suggest that the zzso signal was not sensitive for the identification of zzso variations of cell zzso in the acute phase of the zzso zzso Our findings are not consistent with the idea that zzso contrast reflects primarily zzso in cellular activity during zzso when other zzso elements can zzso
