An improved strategy for the design of zzso zzso zzso with high selectivity and broad zzso using the zzso zzso zzso transformation is zzso Unlike previous zzso the required zzso finite impulse response zzso filters are generated using the complex zzso exchange algorithm, which ensures an zzso zzso from the ideal response zzso It is argued zzso that zzso zzso are zzso in terms of zzso the zzso for a given bandwidth and flip zzso Furthermore, several zzso relations are zzso providing practical design zzso The effectiveness of the proposed design method is demonstrated by examples of zzso and zzso zzso applied in zzso and in zzso
