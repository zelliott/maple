To determine the trends in zzso of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and of MR zzso examinations performed from 1993 to 1998, the trends in zzso participation in MR imaging, and the relative reimbursements for these examinations compared with those for all other zzso imaging studies performed in zzso 

By using the 1993, 1996, and 1998 nationwide Medicare Part B databases, zzso rates per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries and physician reimbursements were determined for seven MR zzso and 14 body MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso version 4) zzso Medicare specialty codes were used to categorize physicians as zzso or zzso

MR zzso and body MR imaging zzso rates increased substantially from 1993 to zzso However, these studies still account for a minor fraction of all zzso imaging examinations performed and fees zzso MR zzso and musculoskeletal MR imaging zzso has increased zzso zzso participation in musculoskeletal MR imaging is zzso
