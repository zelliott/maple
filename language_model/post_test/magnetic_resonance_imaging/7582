zzso local tissue reactions zzso around zzso zzso hip zzso are increasingly being recognized as a cause of zzso These reactions may be associated with zzso tissue damage and complication rates as high as 50% after zzso Although zzso can identify zzso in zzso hips, it is unclear whether the zzso findings predict those at revision zzso 

We therefore zzso identified which zzso characteristics correlated with zzso confirmed zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tissue damage and zzso developed a zzso model using modified zzso to detect zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso 

We zzso reviewed 68 patients with failed zzso hip zzso who underwent zzso zzso and subsequent revision zzso Images were analyzed to determine zzso volume, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso score was used to grade tissue samples, thus identifying a subset of patients with zzso zzso tissue damage was graded using a zzso zzso Random forest analysis determined the sensitivity and specificity of zzso characteristics in detecting zzso zzso zzso 5) and zzso tissue zzso 

zzso zzso thicknesses and zzso volumes as determined on zzso correlated with the zzso score and were higher in cases of severe zzso tissue zzso Our zzso zzso model showed sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso respectively, for detecting zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso tissue zzso 

zzso is sensitive and specific in detecting zzso and tissue damage in patients with zzso hip zzso zzso can be used as a screening tool to guide surgeons toward timely revision zzso
