The appropriate management of acute grade III zzso collateral ligament injury when it is combined with a torn anterior cruciate ligament has not been zzso 

zzso resonance imaging grading of grade III zzso collateral ligament injury in patients who also have anterior cruciate ligament injury zzso with the outcome of their zzso zzso 

Prospective cohort zzso 

zzso patients were first treated zzso with zzso Eleven patients with restored zzso stability received anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction only, and six with residual zzso zzso also received zzso collateral ligament zzso 

zzso resonance imaging depicted complete disruption of the superficial layer of the zzso collateral ligament in all 17 patients and disruption of the deep layer in zzso Restoration of zzso stability was significantly correlated with the location of superficial fiber zzso zzso was evident over the whole length of the superficial layer in five patients, and all five patients had residual zzso zzso despite zzso Both groups had zzso results 5 years zzso 

zzso of injury in the superficial layer may be useful in predicting the outcome of zzso treatment for acute grade III zzso collateral ligament zzso combined with anterior cruciate ligament zzso
