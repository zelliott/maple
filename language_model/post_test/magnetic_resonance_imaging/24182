zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging have both proved valuable for detecting acute zzso zzso but little is known about the value of zzso imaging beyond the acute zzso zzso Furthermore, no direct comparison of the techniques has been zzso We compared the diagnostic utility of zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso imaging for detecting cerebral zzso up to 10 days zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso MR sequences were obtained zzso over a zzso period in 212 patients with suspected cerebral zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso less than 10 days old whose symptoms lasted longer than 48 hours were zzso The three sequences were compared for zzso and zzso of abnormalities that correlated with the zzso zzso 

zzso symptomatic zzso were found in the 70 zzso zzso imaging detected 70 zzso zzso 69 zzso and zzso 64 zzso of the 72 zzso Only the difference between zzso and zzso imaging approached statistical zzso There was no difference in the number of zzso detected in the patients zzso 48 hours or more after zzso zzso zzso on zzso images was judged superior to that on zzso and zzso images in 55 zzso and 47 zzso of the cases, zzso zzso images were judged superior to zzso in 34 zzso of the zzso 

zzso images showed more zzso than zzso and zzso images, and zzso images showed more than zzso images, but the differences were not statistically zzso zzso zzso however, was consistently better on zzso images than on either zzso or zzso images throughout the 10-day zzso Acquisition of zzso images in the late acute and zzso periods after zzso cerebral zzso appears to be zzso
