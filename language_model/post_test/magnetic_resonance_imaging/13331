zzso resonance images of the brain were obtained in 10 female patients before and 2-6 h after a standard general zzso The zzso magnetic relaxation times zzso showed a zzso decrease, whereas the zzso magnetic relaxation times zzso increased in all scans, with significant increases in the zzso and corpus zzso This suggests that general zzso may be associated with structural changes in the brain at a molecular zzso
