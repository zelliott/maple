The zzso barrier zzso regulates the passage of molecules between the zzso and the zzso zzso the difficulty of delivery drugs to specific areas of the brain is a major zzso The zzso exerts a zzso function as it zzso the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the zzso Here, we provide an overview of the way in which peptides and zzso are being exploited in tandem to address this zzso zzso can be used as zzso zzso able to transport zzso with specific properties, such as zzso The zzso can also carry a zzso zzso Furthermore, peptides can be used in less conventional approaches such as zzso zzso In zzso the combined use of peptides and zzso offers tremendous hope in the treatment of brain zzso
