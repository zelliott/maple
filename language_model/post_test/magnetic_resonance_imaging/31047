zzso models, which are frequently used in attempts to solve the electromagnetic inverse problem, require explicit a zzso assumptions about the cerebral current zzso This is not the case for solutions based on zzso zzso In the present study, we evaluated the spatial accuracy of the zzso zzso estimate zzso in realistic noise conditions by assessing its ability to zzso sources of evoked responses at the primary zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso evoked zzso zzso and magnetic fields zzso were recorded in 5 subjects while stimulating the median and zzso nerves at the left zzso A zzso zzso constructed on a zzso surface from the zzso signals, was compared with an equivalent current zzso zzso solution obtained from the zzso 

zzso zzso current sources accounted for both zzso and zzso zzso at around 20 zzso zzso and 70 zzso zzso which zzso were chosen for comparative zzso The distances between the locations of the maximum current zzso obtained from zzso and the locations of zzso were on the average zzso zzso for both zzso and nerves zzso In accordance with the zzso order of zzso both the zzso and zzso tended to zzso median nerve zzso more zzso than zzso nerve zzso for the zzso zzso zzso experiments further indicated that, with a proper estimate of the source depth and with a good fit of the head model, the zzso can reach a mean accuracy of 5 zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

When compared with previously reported zzso based on zzso zzso of zzso it appears that equally accurate zzso of zzso can be obtained with the zzso 

zzso can be used to verify zzso source zzso zzso Having a relatively good zzso accuracy and requiring minimal zzso the zzso may be useful for the zzso of poorly known activity zzso and for tracking activity changes between brain areas as a function of zzso
