Few articles have illustrated minimally invasive management of potentially zzso adrenal zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of zzso zzso for potentially zzso adrenal zzso 

Eight patients with potentially zzso or complex zzso were treated by zzso zzso in the past 10 years at our zzso The operative techniques strictly abided by the principles of surgical zzso The entire adrenal zzso including the cyst, was excised en bloc via a lateral zzso zzso approach and moved into a zzso zzso After protecting the exterior abdominal surface, we pulled the zzso opening out of the zzso wound and opened the zzso wall to siphon all the fluid content with a zzso tip dipped into the zzso zzso Then the remaining zzso components and the adrenal zzso were removed with the zzso 

All of the zzso operations were successful without zzso or zzso zzso open conversion, or zzso Mean operative time was 135 minutes with minimal blood zzso Mean hospital stay was zzso zzso zzso examinations revealed five zzso zzso two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso There was involvement of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso tumor cells in the zzso zzso and zzso could not be zzso At a mean follow-up of 40 months, all patients were zzso and had no zzso evidence of recurrence or zzso 

To our knowledge, this report represents the largest series of zzso zzso for complex adrenal zzso This technique is safe and zzso while maintaining the benefits of minimal zzso
