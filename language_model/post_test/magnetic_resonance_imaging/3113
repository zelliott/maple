The zzso is one of the most common sites for zzso and other zzso zzso zzso knowledge of the normal patterns of zzso distribution could help evaluate zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the age-related normal sequence of conversion from zzso to fatty zzso in the zzso as depicted on MR zzso 

We zzso reviewed zzso MR images of the zzso for the distribution of zzso and fatty zzso zzso subjects 4 months to 25 years old with no known zzso zzso were examined with the zzso zzso zzso conversion was assessed in the zzso zzso angle, and body of the zzso using visual grading based on zzso signal intensity, and a zzso ratio determined by the zzso of the surrounding subcutaneous fat and zzso 

zzso of zzso to fatty zzso occurred first in the zzso body, followed by the angle, zzso and finally the zzso The zzso in the region zzso to the zzso had almost fully converted to fatty zzso by the third decade of life, but the remaining regions contained some zzso zzso Further zzso these results, the zzso ratio increased up to about zzso in the angle and zzso in the zzso by the age of 10 years and then leveled zzso On the other hand, the zzso ratio in the zzso reached zzso by age 15 and remained unchanged for the following 10 zzso 

The normal age-related conversion from zzso to fatty zzso in the zzso follows a zzso zzso first seen in the mental region early in childhood, then in the body, the zzso and finally the zzso
