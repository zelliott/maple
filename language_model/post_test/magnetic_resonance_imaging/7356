We evaluated neural zzso related to the loss of control in college students with zzso gaming disorder zzso We hypothesized that deficit in response zzso under gaming cue distraction was the possible mechanism for the loss of control zzso zzso Eleven cases of zzso and 11 controls performed zzso tasks zzso gaming distraction in the functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso When the gaming picture was shown as background while individuals were performing zzso tasks, the zzso group committed more commission zzso The control group increased their brain zzso more over the right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and superior zzso lobe under gaming cue distraction in comparison with the zzso zzso Furthermore, brain zzso of the right zzso and superior zzso lobe were zzso associated with performance of response zzso among the zzso zzso The results suggest that the function of response zzso was impaired under gaming distraction among the zzso group, and individuals with zzso could not activate right zzso and superior zzso lobe to keep cognitive control and attention allocation for response zzso under gaming cue zzso This mechanism should be addressed in any intervention for zzso
