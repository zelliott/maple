Although it is well known that there is considerable variation among individuals in the size of the human brain, the zzso of less extreme individual differences in brain size is largely zzso We present here data from the first large twin sample zzso zzso in which the size of brain structures has been zzso As part of an ongoing project examining the brain zzso of reading disability zzso whole brain zzso analyses of structural magnetic response image zzso scans were performed on a sample of adolescent zzso Specifically, there were 25 zzso zzso and 23 zzso zzso pairs in which at least one member of each pair had zzso and 9 zzso and 9 zzso pairs in which neither member had zzso We first zzso volume data for 13 individual brain structures, zzso all of the zzso and most of the zzso This analysis yielded two factors zzso and zzso that accounted for zzso of the zzso We next tested whether genetic and environmental influences on brain size variations varied for these two factors or by zzso We zzso zzso correlations within zzso and zzso pairs in each sample for the cortical and zzso factor scores, for left and right zzso and for the total cerebral zzso All five zzso correlations were substantial zzso zzso and significant in both samples, as well as being larger than the corresponding zzso zzso zzso to zzso in both zzso The zzso difference was significant for 3 variables in the zzso sample and for one variable in the smaller control zzso These results indicate significant genetic influences on these zzso The magnitude of genetic influence did not vary markedly either for the 2 factors or the 2 zzso There was also a positive correlation between brain size and zzso zzso consistent with the results of earlier zzso The total cerebral volume was moderately correlated zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso there was a similar trend in the smaller control sample zzso zzso zzso Corrections of similar magnitude were found between the zzso factor and zzso zzso whereas the results for the cortical factor zzso zzso were smaller and not zzso In sum, these results provide evidence for the zzso of individual differences in brain size which do not vary markedly by zzso or for zzso relative to zzso Since there are also correlations between brain size and zzso zzso in this sample, it is possible that genetic influences on brain size partly contribute to individual differences in zzso
