zzso zzso zzso is a serious complication of traumatic brain injury zzso This study is designed to determine the feasibility of using zzso zzso zzso to predict differences in seizure zzso after experimental zzso 

zzso imaging and behavioral zzso were performed at multiple time points after lateral fluid percussion injury zzso in zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso monitoring and zzso signal analysis after zzso zzso 

Multiple zzso zzso including measures of zzso brain swelling zzso zzso volume difference, zzso and zzso signal change with contrast enhancement (a measure of zzso barrier zzso zzso reliably distinguished between injured and zzso animals at 72 hours after zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso values (a measure of water zzso in injured zzso at 72 hours and 1 week after injury, zzso in injured zzso at 72 hours after injury and zzso at 72 hours after injury were significantly correlated with zzso measures of seizure zzso to zzso challenge at 3 months after zzso 

The correlations between our zzso quantitative zzso and zzso measures of seizure zzso to zzso challenge in injured animals versus zzso animals support the feasibility of these zzso zzso as potential zzso for post-traumatic zzso
