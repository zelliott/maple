The advent of zzso zzso CT has significantly modified several traditional clinical approaches to cardiovascular zzso The current availability of rapid image acquisition has provided the basis for investigating direct imaging in real time of cardiac structures using zzso Application of zzso zzso image acquisitions to three-dimensional zzso reconstruction zzso produces zzso data sets from which images of the coronary arteries may be obtained in any zzso zzso The advantage of the zzso zzso spatial resolution is partly offset by reduced zzso resolution as well as reduced contrast resolution compared to zzso This lack in contrast sensitivity prevents accurate zzso imaging and restricts the clinical use to coronary artery zzso Moreover, the large amount of zzso contrast medium injected has potential zzso effects, which can be deleterious if coronary artery zzso must to be zzso On the other hand, zzso has less spatial resolution, and acquisitions must be performed in the plane of each coronary artery because of reduced volume zzso Both techniques play a role in the zzso assessment of coronary artery disease, by providing complementary information already useful in a growing number of clinical zzso
