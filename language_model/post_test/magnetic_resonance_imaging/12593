Social zzso threat zzso is a potent zzso in humans that causes zzso changes, zzso responses, and multiple health zzso zzso has recently begun to zzso the brain zzso of zzso but as yet little is known about the zzso zzso pathways in zzso This paper replicates and extends findings in a companion paper zzso et zzso zzso using an independent cohort of participants and different image acquisition zzso Here, we focused specifically on relationships between the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso gray zzso and heart rate zzso We applied zzso path analysis to zzso brain zzso of zzso effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso responses were zzso by opposing signals in two distinct zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso prefrontal zzso zzso In addition, zzso responses were zzso by zzso Additional path analyses provided support for two zzso zzso one linking zzso zzso and HR, and another linking zzso thalamus, and zzso zzso responses were linked with zzso changes both before and during zzso whereas cortical regions showed stronger connectivity with zzso during zzso zzso anxiety showed a partially zzso but weaker, pattern of zzso including the zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, and lateral frontal cortex, as well as substantial individual differences that were largely zzso Taken together, these data suggest pathways for the translation of social threats into both zzso and experiential responses, and provide targets for future research on the generation and regulation of zzso
