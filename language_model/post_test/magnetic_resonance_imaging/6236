A fast MR zzso method is introduced that is capable of generating difference images of blood vessels in scan times of zzso zzso This is an order of magnitude faster than many previous zzso The fundamental concept of this approach is to use cardiac gating and acquire several phase zzso at least twice during each cardiac cycle using limited flip angles zzso and repetition times in the 20 to 50 zzso zzso The zzso acquired during zzso are zzso from those acquired during zzso to generate the difference zzso The contrast in the difference image is due both to the influx of zzso spins and to the loss of phase zzso of zzso blood moving at high zzso along a magnetic zzso The zzso peak of the cardiac cycle is determined during reconstruction by shifting the zzso and zzso zzso until the difference signal is zzso zzso artifacts due to zzso flow are eliminated by a phase zzso technique similar in concept to those developed for suppression of breathing zzso zzso in thick slices are successfully zzso and initial in zzso results are zzso
