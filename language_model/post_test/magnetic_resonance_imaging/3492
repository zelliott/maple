There is considerable evidence of functional abnormalities of the zzso zzso zzso in affective zzso However, it has been unknown whether this represented primary pathology within these circuits or altered zzso as a result of zzso input from other brain zzso The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso circuit dysfunction represents primary pathology in zzso zzso zzso male subjects with zzso zzso depression and zzso controls without psychiatric illness were studied using functional zzso and functional connectivity zzso All zzso subjects were zzso and without current psychiatric zzso Compared to controls, zzso subjects exhibited altered connectivity between bilateral zzso components of the zzso zzso and left zzso input and output zzso zzso provided evidence that functional abnormalities of these circuits represent primary zzso Further, we found that age of onset but not duration of illness impacts circuit zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is likely one of several zzso of primary pathology in major zzso Additionally, early age of onset is associated with greater circuit zzso and as such may impact clinical characteristics and/or treatment response through a mechanism of decreasing functional connectivity of some circuit zzso Finally, altered zzso zzso circuit connectivity with cortical regions zzso cingulate, inferior frontal zzso and zzso may contribute to the emotional zzso impaired emotional recognition and zzso symptoms associated with zzso zzso
