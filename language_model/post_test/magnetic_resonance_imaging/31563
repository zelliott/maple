Despite evidence for zzso abnormalities in elderly depression, it is unknown whether these changes are regionally zzso This study used three-dimensional mapping techniques to identify regional zzso abnormalities in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were also zzso 

With high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso was compared among elderly patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso depression and comparison subjects zzso Regional structural abnormalities were identified by comparing zzso measured from zzso zzso surface points to the central core of each zzso zzso surface model, between zzso 

zzso volumes differed between depressed patients and comparison subjects but not between patients with zzso and zzso zzso However, statistical mapping results showed that regional surface zzso were significantly pronounced in zzso compared to zzso depression in the anterior of the zzso and lateral zzso of the zzso zzso in the left zzso zzso shape differences were observed zzso in anterior zzso zzso and the zzso in patients in relation to comparison zzso These results were similar when each disease group was separately compared to comparison zzso zzso surface zzso significantly correlated with memory measures among zzso but not zzso depressed patients or comparison zzso 

More pronounced regional volume deficits and their associations with memory in zzso depression may suggest that these patients are more likely to develop cognitive impairment over time than individuals with zzso zzso zzso regional zzso abnormalities and their cognitive zzso may help guide research in defining risk profiles and treatment zzso
