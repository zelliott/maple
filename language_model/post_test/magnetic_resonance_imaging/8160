zzso has been shown to be a promising zzso for imaging brain zzso receptors with zzso zzso zzso in zzso and nonhuman zzso We now report the first use of zzso in six healthy human subjects, using kinetic brain imaging and serial zzso zzso of plasma parent zzso At 80 zzso after zzso injection, activity ratios were about three for brain zzso regions compared with zzso However, the zzso from brain was unexpectedly slow relative to plasma clearance of the parent zzso This disparity between brain and plasma activity was zzso with distribution volume calculated from increasingly truncated brain imaging zzso In both zzso regions and zzso distribution volumes were unstable and increased continuously from 90 to 150 zzso by about zzso This increasing distribution volume was unlikely due to the variations or errors of plasma input at later time points, since a similar zzso of plasma time points from 150 to 90 zzso did not significantly affect the analysis of the brain zzso When the zzso of zzso in human and monkey were zzso a moderate zzso zzso was present at a significantly higher percentage of total plasma zzso in human than in zzso The relatively slow zzso of activity from brain and the zzso instability of distribution volume likely reflect the zzso of zzso in human zzso Although prior studies in zzso and nonhuman primates showed zzso to be a promising zzso we suspect that a species difference in metabolism caused this serious zzso in zzso
