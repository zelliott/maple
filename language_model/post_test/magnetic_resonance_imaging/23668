The effects of normal aging on the zzso brain are incompletely zzso Although both human and nonhuman primates demonstrate clear functional declines in selective attention, zzso functions, and some components of zzso memory with aging, most studies have failed to demonstrate extensive zzso zzso or loss as a zzso for these degenerative changes in zzso In particular, extensive age-related zzso loss in zzso brain regions such as the zzso and zzso zzso has not been zzso However, it is possible that zzso loss or zzso might occur in zzso zzso that zzso the activity of zzso regions, thereby accounting for altered cognitive function with zzso In the present study, we describe, to our knowledge for the first time, a significant and extensive decline in the number and size of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso regions of aged zzso zzso the best animal model of human aging, by using zzso zzso zzso the loss of zzso zzso zzso markers in aged monkeys was nearly completely reversed by human nerve growth factor gene zzso These findings zzso identify zzso cellular zzso as a potential mechanism contributing to age-related cognitive decline in zzso zzso suggest, when considered with other studies, that zzso brain regions exhibit greater vulnerability to the effects of aging than cortical regions, and zzso indicate that zzso gene transfer may be an effective means of preventing zzso zzso or zzso in age-related neurodegenerative zzso
