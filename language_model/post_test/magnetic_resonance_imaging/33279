The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the zzso of zzso bone structure zzso of the zzso radius at zzso and zzso T magnetic resonance imaging zzso Root mean square zzso errors ranged from zzso to zzso at zzso T zzso and from zzso to zzso at zzso T zzso Thus, zzso errors of zzso bone structure zzso are overall in an acceptable range and similar at zzso and zzso T zzso
