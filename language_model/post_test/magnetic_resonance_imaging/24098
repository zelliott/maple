Assessment of zzso viability has become an important issue in patients presenting with either acute zzso zzso or presenting with chronic zzso left zzso zzso In patients with viable zzso recovery of left zzso function can be zzso spontaneously in patients with acute zzso zzso or following zzso in patients with zzso zzso In contrast, patients without viable tissue are not likely to improve in left zzso zzso Currently, nuclear imaging techniques and zzso stress zzso are used for assessment of zzso recent studies with magnetic resonance imaging zzso have however demonstrated the potential usefulness of this technique for the assessment of zzso Various zzso derived from resting zzso can be used as markers of zzso zzso including the zzso wall zzso zzso wall zzso and signal intensity without zzso Other studies have combined the information from resting zzso with the assessment of zzso reserve during zzso zzso Finally, recent studies have evaluated the use of zzso zzso to detect viable zzso All of these parameters are potentially useful and zzso provide an alternative approach for the assessment of viable zzso
