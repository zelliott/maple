Two patients are presented with large cerebral zzso zzso and large zzso zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso may either arise due to an aberration in the formation of the zzso space or by its zzso A recently proposed theory for the formation of zzso is that this condition is an extreme zzso of cortical zzso in which the zzso of zzso extends all the way into the lateral zzso In light of these data, and based on the imaging findings in our two patients with large cerebral zzso zzso and large zzso zzso zzso we propose that the mechanism which causes zzso zzso cortical zzso may lead to some kind of a traction effect and splitting of the zzso resulting in the formation of an zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso This appears to be a significant observation because the zzso of zzso zzso is still zzso
