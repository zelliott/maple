zzso evidence shows that the neural circuits involved in beat perception overlap with motor zzso even in the absence of overt zzso This study investigated effects of tempo on zzso processing by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with a zzso timing paradigm where participants made simple zzso judgments about short rhythmic zzso Of central interest were judgments about ambiguous test rhythms where the perceived direction of a timing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depended on the induction of an implied zzso zzso beat induction was reduced when the implied beat was at a slower tempo zzso zzso than when it was at a faster tempo zzso zzso zzso beat induction was accompanied by decreased functional activity in the zzso zzso zzso and supplementary motor regions, and zzso zzso support the conclusion that rhythms presented at a slow tempo reduce involvement of a zzso network in zzso zzso
