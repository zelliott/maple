To test for brain structure differences in reading disability zzso by means of zzso zzso 

Consensus is lacking on the brain structural zzso of zzso The current study reports on a wider set of structures in the largest sample yet zzso controlling for age, zzso zzso and attention deficit zzso disorder zzso 

A zzso study was performed that was comprised of 75 individuals with zzso zzso age, zzso zzso and 22 control subjects without zzso zzso age, zzso zzso each a single member of a twin zzso The two groups were similar in age, zzso and zzso but differed in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso group having a lower mean zzso zzso versus zzso Using three zzso analyses of zzso groups were compared in terms of volume (in cubic zzso of major zzso zzso zzso structures, and zzso areas (in square zzso of three subdivisions of the corpus zzso 

Controlling for age, zzso and zzso the authors found a significant zzso interaction for the major zzso subdivisions zzso zzso zzso reflecting a different zzso pattern in the zzso group, with the zzso and anterior superior zzso being smaller and the zzso zzso being larger in the zzso zzso In contrast, they found no group main or interaction effects for the zzso or zzso zzso The pattern of results was essentially the same in subjects without zzso 

Most brain structures do not differ in size in zzso but cortical development is altered zzso This study replicates in a larger sample previous findings of insular differences in zzso and demonstrates further that those differences are not attributable to zzso zzso
