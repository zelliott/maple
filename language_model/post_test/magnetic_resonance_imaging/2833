The purpose of this study was to compare a combined zzso and zzso zzso technique, which is a rapid zzso imaging zzso with conventional zzso zzso sequences for imaging brain zzso The zzso sequences would allow increased patient zzso with potential cost savings and be useful in uncooperative patients without requiring zzso imaging techniques and specialized zzso 

Conventional zzso and zzso zzso images of 49 consecutive patients zzso years old) were reviewed independently by three zzso for the presence and characterization of zzso (most of which were zzso zzso of zzso within the white zzso zzso matter zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signal zzso The MR studies were performed on a zzso zzso zzso Impact zzso with the zzso images obtained using a zzso of zzso and the zzso images obtained using a zzso TE of zzso 

The number of zzso detected that were 5 zzso or larger in zzso diameter did not significantly differ among zzso For zzso smaller than 5 zzso conventional zzso zzso images showed more zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso images were better than the zzso images for assessing zzso matter zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signal zzso The two zzso zzso were better assessed on the conventional zzso zzso 

Although zzso imaging may be potentially useful for rapid imaging of the brain, our experience shows it has a markedly diminished sensitivity for detecting zzso smaller than 5 zzso in zzso Currently, zzso imaging should not replace the routine clinical use of conventional zzso zzso
