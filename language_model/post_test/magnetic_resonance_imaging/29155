In an attempt to compare the sensitivity of bone zzso and bone zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for bone zzso detection in patients with stage III multiple myeloma zzso and to evaluate the possible consequences of the replacement of the conventional zzso skeletal survey zzso by an MR survey of the spinal and pelvic bone zzso in these patients, we obtained MR studies of the zzso and zzso spine, pelvis and zzso zzso in addition to the conventional zzso (including zzso of the skull, entire spine, zzso ribs, zzso and zzso in 80 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed stage III zzso according to the zzso and zzso staging system (based on blood tests and on the zzso The performance of MR and zzso studies to detect bone zzso in given zzso areas and in given patients were zzso The consequences on zzso staging following the substitution of the zzso by the MR survey were zzso MR imaging was superior to zzso for zzso detection in the spine zzso v zzso of zzso and pelvis zzso v zzso of zzso The zzso was superior to the limited MR imaging survey for the detection of bone involvement in the patient population zzso v zzso of zzso If the zzso had been replaced by the MR imaging survey for patient staging, zzso patients would have been zzso as stage I and one as stage II zzso on the basis of normal MR findings and biological findings consistent with these zzso zzso of the zzso by a limited spinal and pelvic zzso MR survey would lead to zzso of zzso of patients with otherwise stage III zzso on the basis of blood tests and the conventional zzso
