We investigated the correlation between cortical zzso and white matter zzso on magnetic resonance images zzso of patients with zzso The study included 40 subjects, each of whom had undergone both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies as part of their diagnostic evaluation for degenerative zzso Two zzso rated the zzso films for severity of zzso white matter changes on a zzso point scale and severity of zzso white matter changes on a zzso point zzso Twelve regions of interest from association zzso were sampled for the zzso analysis of zzso zzso No relationship was found between these global zzso ratings and zzso or qualitative zzso zzso zzso severity as measured by the zzso State zzso and the Clinical zzso zzso was significantly correlated with zzso whereas age was significantly correlated with zzso ratings, particularly in the zzso zzso These data support the view that cortical zzso abnormalities are not associated with global zzso abnormalities in the zzso and zzso regions of patients with a clinical picture of degenerative zzso
