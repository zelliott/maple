The measurement of human muscle size is essential when assessing the effects of training, disuse and zzso The considered zzso zzso for zzso area zzso of muscle size is magnetic resonance imaging zzso However, zzso is costly and often zzso The aim of the present study was to test the zzso and zzso of a more accessible alternative method using zzso zzso We examined the zzso areas in the zzso zzso muscle of six zzso zzso zzso scans were taken at given levels along the entire muscle zzso The zzso scanning was repeated on different days zzso and validated against zzso zzso Mean zzso correlation zzso were zzso for the reliability of zzso and zzso for the zzso of zzso against zzso The zzso of variation values for zzso area zzso assessed by six different zzso were zzso and zzso for images obtained with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso method is a valid and reliable alternative tool for assessing zzso areas of large individual human zzso The present findings justify the application of the zzso method for the detection of changes throughout large muscles in response to training, disuse or as a consequence of zzso
