The purpose of this study was to further develop and compare zzso zzso prepared by two different approaches wherein a zzso zzso was zzso within the internal zzso space of the zzso or into the zzso surface via membrane bound zzso 

Small zzso zzso zzso were prepared zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes of zzso were prepared and also incorporated into zzso The two different zzso zzso were compared for zzso zzso stability, zzso and zzso imaging in rats with liver zzso 

zzso zzso zzso had a zzso change in zzso that was zzso at a zzso zzso excess of zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso complexes showed zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso imaging showed greater and more specific zzso enhancement with zzso zzso bearing zzso complexes than those zzso zzso zzso 

zzso effects likely explain the increased zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Greater zzso however, is afforded by zzso bearing zzso zzso
