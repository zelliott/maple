To assess the ability of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure functional vascular zzso parameters of normal human zzso in zzso using an open linear zzso zzso zzso 

zzso women with no zzso disease underwent zzso zzso images were acquired during injection of a contrast zzso zzso volumes were calculated and zzso data analyzed using a zzso zzso zzso tissue was compared with skeletal muscle to demonstrate the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso tissue was found to enhance rapidly and zzso When compared with skeletal muscle as a control, zzso tissue was seen to demonstrate a significantly higher maximum enhancement factor and zzso of the zzso although there was no significant difference in the exchange zzso Sample size precluded conclusions about differences due to zzso cycle or zzso zzso 

The results reflect the vascular physiology of the normal zzso Definition of the zzso properties of normal zzso will allow zzso to be applied zzso to conduct zzso in zzso studies of zzso zzso function, including response to drugs, contraceptive research, assessment of zzso zzso syndrome, zzso zzso syndrome, diagnosis of zzso and prediction of response to zzso zzso
