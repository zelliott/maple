To investigate the zzso imaging presentation of the pancreatic retention zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

Imaging data including CT, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso guided fine needle aspiration zzso and zzso retrograde zzso zzso in zzso patients (five males and ten zzso mean age, zzso zzso with zzso proven zzso were analyzed zzso and imaging features were correlated with pathological zzso 

Sixteen zzso of 15 patients were included in this zzso The mean size of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were round zzso zzso zzso oval zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the wall on CT zzso zzso zzso thin zzso zzso zzso zzso thin wall zzso zzso zzso and zzso of upstream pancreatic duct zzso zzso 6; mean diameter, zzso zzso were zzso zzso of upstream pancreatic duct was smooth in five zzso and irregular in one zzso with pancreatic duct with zzso zzso Communication of zzso with pancreatic duct was seen in two patients (one on CT, one on zzso zzso inflammation and zzso were detected in four and two patients, zzso 

zzso typically presents as a zzso round zzso zzso and different associated zzso conditions including pancreatic inflammation and zzso may be detected in some patients on the zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso of upstream pancreatic duct with uncommon communication to the zzso may be helpful for the zzso Combination of a variety of imaging zzso could contribute to improve the zzso
