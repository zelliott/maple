zzso size predicts zzso zzso zzso zzso within 24 hours of a zzso zzso acute zzso zzso zzso is a zzso indication, however early intravenous zzso zzso initiation is not zzso In recent magnetic resonance imaging zzso experimental studies, the zzso zzso has been shown to reduce zzso size only when administered before coronary zzso To date, there is not a single trial comparing the zzso zzso zzso zzso initiation in zzso 

The zzso trial is testing whether the early initiation of IV zzso before primary zzso coronary intervention zzso could reduce zzso size and improve outcomes when compared to oral zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso trial is a zzso zzso zzso (to outcome zzso clinical effectiveness trial conducted in 5 Counties across Spain that will enroll 220 zzso zzso are zzso to 80-year-old patients with anterior zzso zzso by zzso zzso hours from symptom zzso zzso criteria are zzso zzso zzso block or active treatment with zzso zzso end point is zzso size evaluated by zzso 5 to 7 days zzso zzso major secondary end points are zzso left zzso ejection fraction recovery zzso zzso to 6 zzso the composite of zzso zzso zzso due to heart zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso trial is testing the hypothesis that the early initiation of IV zzso zzso reduces zzso size in comparison to initiation of oral zzso zzso Given the implications of zzso size reduction in zzso if positive, this trial might evidence that a refined use of an approved inexpensive drug can improve outcomes of patients with zzso
