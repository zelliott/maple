We present a personal case of zzso zzso in a 42-year-old zzso 

The zzso was first treated surgically both for diagnostic aims and for resolution of the mass effect causing zzso and correlated neurological zzso Because the tumor recurred after surgery and zzso we decided to further treat the patient with chemotherapy, in particular with zzso 

Currently, almost 9 years after the first treatment, the patient is zzso and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging shows no tumor zzso 

Although surgery should be considered the zzso therapy, we think that zzso can be a valid option in case of recurrence of these rare zzso
