Respiratory motion is a challenging factor for image acquisition and zzso procedures in the abdominal and zzso zzso In order to address the issues arising from respiratory motion, it is often necessary to detect the respiratory zzso In this article, we propose a novel, purely zzso retrospective respiratory gating method for ultrasound and zzso Further, we apply this technique to acquire zzso zzso ultrasound with a zzso probe and, similarly, to create zzso MR with a slice stacking zzso We achieve the gating with zzso zzso a zzso learning technique, to determine the zzso zzso embedded in the zzso image zzso Since zzso zzso assign to each image frame a coordinate in zzso space by respecting the neighborhood relationship, they are well suited for analyzing the breathing zzso We perform the zzso gating on several zzso and zzso ultrasound zzso over time, and zzso its very good performance by comparing it to zzso from an external gating zzso For zzso we perform the zzso learning on several zzso for various zzso and zzso We achieve very high correlations by a comparison to an alternative gating with zzso zzso
