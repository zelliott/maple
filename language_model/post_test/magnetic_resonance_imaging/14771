zzso individuals demonstrate neural and behavioral differences compared to healthy comparison subjects when performing the zzso zzso interference zzso zzso measures also relate to treatment outcome for cocaine zzso zzso connectivity analyses assess the extent to which zzso regional brain zzso are related to each other in the absence of defining a zzso regions of zzso 

This study examined 1) the extent to which zzso and zzso individuals differed on measures of intrinsic connectivity during zzso zzso performance; and 2) the relationships between zzso zzso intrinsic connectivity and treatment outcome in cocaine zzso 

Sixteen zzso zzso patients and matched zzso comparison subjects completed an zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in intrinsic connectivity were assessed and related to zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso comparison subjects showed less intrinsic connectivity in cortical and zzso zzso When adjusting for individual degree of intrinsic zzso zzso zzso comparison subjects showed relatively greater intrinsic connectivity in the zzso zzso zzso inferior frontal zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso measures in the zzso thalamus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso correlated with measures of cocaine zzso 

The diminished intrinsic connectivity in zzso zzso comparison subjects suggests poorer communication across brain regions during zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso group displayed relatively greater zzso connectivity in regions implicated in motivational processes in zzso The relationships between treatment outcomes and connectivity in the zzso and zzso zzso suggest that connectivity represents a potential treatment zzso
