The aim of this study was to compare patterns of cerebral zzso on zzso and zzso on magnetic resonance zzso zzso in patients with zzso cortical zzso zzso and typical Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso was used to assess zzso matter zzso in 38 patients with zzso 38 patients with typical zzso and 38 zzso Clinical data was assessed in all zzso zzso Single zzso zzso MRS located in the zzso zzso was analyzed in a subset of patients with zzso typical zzso and control zzso zzso showed a pattern of zzso affecting zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso The pattern was zzso but more severe on the zzso Patients with zzso showed greater zzso in the right visual association zzso than patients with typical zzso whereas those with zzso showed greater zzso in the left zzso than those with zzso zzso MRS suggested loss of zzso integrity and zzso zzso in subjects with zzso and typical zzso The differing patterns of zzso on zzso suggest that zzso should be considered a distinct entity from typical zzso
