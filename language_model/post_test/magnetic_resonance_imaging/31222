This study sought to evaluate the ability of blood oxygen zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to successfully identify functional cortical areas in patients with primary brain tumors, to evaluate the use of the zzso results in zzso planning, and to assess the functional outcome of the patients with respect to the functional maps obtained with zzso 

The study included 25 consecutive zzso zzso sessions in patients with primary brain tumors in or near zzso and/or language zzso All zzso zzso were analyzed and rated according to the degree of zzso Several distances between tumor and functional zzso as delineated with zzso zzso were measured to assess the zzso relationship between these two zzso zzso and zzso neurological zzso were obtained from the patients' zzso 

Acquisition of zzso zzso images was successful in zzso of the zzso The primary cause of unsuccessful zzso was zzso imaging signal voids that were the result of previous zzso the secondary cause was excessive zzso The zzso used the zzso results for zzso planning in zzso of the cases in which zzso was zzso The risk of zzso loss of function tested with zzso was significantly lower when the distance between tumor periphery and zzso activity was 10 zzso or zzso 

The majority of patients with primary brain tumors were capable of zzso performing the zzso zzso and the information obtained was used in the zzso zzso A distance of 10 zzso or more between the functional cortex, as delineated with zzso and the tumor significantly reduced the risk of zzso loss of zzso
