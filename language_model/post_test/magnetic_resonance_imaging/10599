The role of zzso in primary central nervous system zzso zzso is zzso It was the aim of this study to investigate the role of zzso in detecting zzso and in predicting response to zzso 

An zzso scan of the brain was performed in 15 patients with zzso proven zzso (16 PET zzso zzso zzso zzso PET was planned to investigate patients at the time of primary diagnosis, after chemotherapy and at the time of suspected zzso in seven, five and three cases, zzso All except two patients simultaneously underwent zzso of the zzso zzso results were correlated with zzso results after zzso biopsy zzso diagnosis zzso and with clinical data and zzso during zzso 

Six of the seven patients in the primary diagnosis group demonstrated a true positive finding zzso In one of the true positive PET patients, there were two zzso zzso one of which was only zzso on the zzso zzso zzso In five patients, zzso showed no sign of zzso during ongoing zzso These results were confirmed by the clinical follow-up zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated minimal residual disease which had disappeared on further follow-up zzso in three of these five patients at the time of PET zzso zzso of disease was confirmed zzso by zzso and zzso in three different zzso The zzso zzso value of all zzso was zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrate high zzso zzso and can be diagnosed by zzso with high zzso It seems that zzso is suitable for early therapeutic monitoring after zzso
