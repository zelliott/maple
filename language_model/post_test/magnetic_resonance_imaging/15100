Face recognition is a key component of successful social zzso However, the zzso processes that zzso zzso learning and recognition as faces transition from unfamiliar to familiar are poorly zzso In zzso coding, learning occurs through prediction errors that update stimulus familiarity, but recognition is a function of both stimulus and contextual zzso Here we show that zzso responses on a zzso face recognition task can be predicted by the level of contextual and facial familiarity in a zzso model derived from zzso zzso Using zzso we show that activity in the superior zzso zzso varies with the contextual familiarity in the model, whereas activity in the zzso face area zzso with the prediction error zzso that updated facial zzso Our results characterize the key zzso underpinning the zzso learning of faces, highlighting that the functional properties of zzso areas conform to the principles of zzso zzso
