To describe the use of zzso and a zzso model to measure the zzso zzso rate zzso and compare the results with those obtained with the zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso of rabbit zzso was performed during and after injection of zzso zzso The enhancement zzso in the zzso and the kidney were analyzed with the zzso and zzso models to assess the zzso 

A substantial correlation was observed between the zzso measured with zzso using the zzso model and the plasma clearance of zzso zzso zzso No significant correlation was observed between the zzso clearance zzso zzso and the zzso obtained with the zzso model in regions of interest zzso encompassing the zzso zzso and zzso A zzso and Altman analysis showed that zzso zzso agreed better with the zzso clearance compared to zzso when zzso were limited to the zzso However, the zzso values obtained by zzso were lower than the plasma clearance of zzso 

zzso with a zzso model provides more accurate assessments of zzso zzso than the zzso zzso
