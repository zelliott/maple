White matter zzso zzso detected by magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain are associated with zzso and cognitive impairment in the general population and in Alzheimer's zzso Their effect in cognitive decline and zzso associated with Parkinson's disease zzso is still zzso 

We studied the relationship between zzso and cognitive state in 111 patients with zzso classified as cognitively normal zzso zzso zzso with a mild cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 26), in a zzso and follow-up zzso zzso state was evaluated with a comprehensive zzso battery, and zzso were identified in zzso and zzso zzso The burden of zzso was rated using the zzso zzso 

No differences in zzso were found between the three groups in the zzso zzso A negative correlation was observed between semantic zzso and the zzso for zzso in the frontal zzso Of the 36 zzso patients re-evaluated after a mean follow-up of 30 months, three patients converted into zzso and 5 into zzso zzso of zzso zzso was associated with an increased conversion to zzso A marginal association between the increase in total zzso burden and worsening in the Mini Mental State zzso was zzso 

White matter zzso do not influence the cognitive status of patients with zzso zzso zzso have a negative impact on semantic zzso Brain vascular burden may have an effect on cognitive impairment in patients with zzso as zzso increase overtime might increase the risk of conversion to zzso This finding needs further confirmation in larger prospective zzso
