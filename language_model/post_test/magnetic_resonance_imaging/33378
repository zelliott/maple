zzso cerebral zzso is associated with the use of of zzso zzso The exact mechanism is unclear but may be related to their zzso properties, as evidenced in patients already on other zzso derivatives who deteriorated only after taking additional zzso zzso We zzso that zzso agents, independent of zzso zzso may produce the same zzso 

A zzso patient, initially presenting with zzso subsequently zzso rapid neurological deterioration after ingesting zzso a zzso zzso She was not on any zzso zzso but presented similar clinical and zzso zzso She experienced increased headache severity, visual zzso and zzso associated with multiple zzso cerebral zzso on zzso and increased zzso signal in the zzso areas on magnetic resonance zzso 

This case is additional evidence that zzso actions of some drugs, such as zzso derivatives and zzso may lead to zzso cerebral zzso Documentation of medication used by zzso women suffering similar complications is needed to verify these zzso
