The effects of imaging conditions and measures for their improvement were examined with regard to recognition of the effects of contrast on images when zzso imaging with selective fat suppression was zzso 

zzso at the target region was examined before and after contrast imaging using zzso assuming zzso and zzso zzso A clinical examination was performed on tumors revealed by breast examination, including those surrounded by zzso zzso and by fat zzso 

When fat suppression was used and imaging contrast was zzso the zzso level of fat tumors with the same structure as the prepared zzso appeared to be high both before and after contrast imaging, and the effects of contrast were not zzso This observation is attributable to the fact that the imaging conditions before and after contrast imaging were substantially zzso To make a comparison between zzso and zzso images, it is considered necessary to perform imaging with fixed receiver gain and to apply the same imaging method for zzso and zzso images by adjusting zzso imaging conditions to those of zzso zzso
