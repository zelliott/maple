Neurological disorders characterized by abnormal zzso migration, organization, zzso guidance, and maintenance have recently been associated with zzso and zzso zzso in the genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso C in zzso 4 of the gene zzso zzso in a female with zzso zzso of the corpus zzso zzso zzso of the left zzso zzso extensive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and right third nerve zzso The zzso change results in a zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso falls within an zzso zzso region and therefore is likely to result in impaired protein function and possibly zzso zzso This study expands the spectrum of brain zzso associated with zzso in the zzso gene zzso supporting its critical role in zzso and zzso guidance zzso In addition, it suggests a possible genetic zzso of zzso thus strengthening the hypothesis that there is a common zzso base in zzso and zzso
