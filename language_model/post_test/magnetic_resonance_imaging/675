zzso is associated with zzso zzso A previous study zzso zzso 59 zzso zzso has shown that this zzso is present at the level of automatic discrimination of change in speech sounds, as revealed by zzso recording of auditory mismatch field in response to zzso change in zzso Here, we investigated the zzso zzso for this zzso zzso Thirteen patients with schizophrenia and 19 matched control subjects were examined using zzso zzso and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso to evaluate both mismatch field strengths in response to change between vowel zzso and zzso and gray matter volumes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The magnetic global field power of mismatch response to change in zzso showed a bilateral reduction in patients with zzso The gray matter volume of left zzso zzso but not right zzso zzso or bilateral zzso zzso was significantly smaller in patients with schizophrenia compared with that in control zzso Furthermore, the phonetic mismatch strength in the left zzso was significantly correlated with left zzso zzso gray matter volume in patients with schizophrenia zzso These results suggest that structural abnormalities of the zzso zzso may zzso the functional abnormalities of fundamental zzso processing in zzso
