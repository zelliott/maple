We tested whether the stimulation of zzso in the same spinal segments could induce different central responses with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso both activated primary and secondary zzso area, zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso Area 40, zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso stimulation specifically activated zzso frontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso activated zzso zzso and inhibited those of primary motor area and zzso zzso Thus, stimulation of zzso in the same spinal segments induced distinct though overlapped cerebral response patterns, which indicated the existence of zzso zzso
