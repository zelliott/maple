zzso approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of hip disorders are well zzso however, there are limited data regarding revision hip zzso There have been several studies evaluating the findings of MR zzso with primary hip zzso but to our knowledge, no study has evaluated the diagnostic value of MR zzso before revision hip zzso 

We obtained sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso of MR zzso to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso and loose bodies before revision hip zzso 

We performed a zzso retrospective review of 70 revision hip zzso (62 zzso and assessed the association between MR zzso findings and zzso zzso There were 43 females and 19 males with a mean age of 36 years zzso zzso zzso zzso interpretation was performed by one of four zzso musculoskeletal zzso at three institutions, who had at least 5 years of zzso zzso findings were compared with surgical findings by one of the authors for calculation of sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso 

The sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso of MR zzso for detecting zzso tears were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso of MR zzso for detecting zzso damage were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso of MR zzso for detecting loose bodies were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Our study showed the utility of MR zzso to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with ongoing or zzso symptoms who have had prior hip zzso Our data show that MR zzso is superior at ruling in, rather than ruling out, zzso zzso zzso zzso and loose bodies, as there were studies interpreted as normal which in fact showed zzso
