zzso zzso stem zzso cells are being used increasingly to complement their embryonic counterparts to understand and develop the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso Our objectives were to identify an efficient cardiac differentiation protocol for human zzso cells as zzso and demonstrate that the resulting cardiac zzso could provide a therapeutic benefit in a zzso model of zzso zzso zzso we describe a zzso protocol for efficient cardiac differentiation of human zzso cells as a zzso which routinely yielded a mixed population in which over 50% were zzso zzso or smooth muscle zzso When zzso cardiac zzso from day 6 of this protocol were injected into the zzso region of the rat zzso after coronary artery zzso and zzso we were able to show that human zzso zzso cardiac zzso cells zzso differentiated into zzso and smooth muscle, and persisted for at least 10 weeks zzso Hearts injected with zzso cells showed a zzso trend toward protection from decline in function after zzso zzso as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging at 10 weeks, such that the ejection fraction at 10 weeks in zzso treated hearts was zzso compared to that of control zzso hearts at zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated efficient cardiac differentiation of human zzso cells that gave rise to zzso that were retained within the zzso rat heart, and reduced zzso of the heart after zzso zzso
