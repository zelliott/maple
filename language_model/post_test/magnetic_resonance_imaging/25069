The purpose of this study was to design and build an zzso Radio zzso zzso zzso zzso that would facilitate the acquisition of high resolution zzso zzso images of zzso and normal rabbit zzso A surface zzso transmit surface zzso receive zzso was built, in order to ensure adequate zzso zzso over the imaging volume and maximum filling factor, and hence to maximize the Signal to Noise ratio zzso and resolution of the zzso zzso The two coils were passively zzso using crossed zzso and zzso lines, both during the transmit and receive zzso of the imaging zzso A specialized animal bed, to zzso the use of the coils and minimize the experiment setup time was designed and zzso Three zzso images of resolution 156 zzso 156 zzso zzso zzso were acquired in 20 zzso the results, in terms both of the high resolution images and the ease with which the experimental setup could be zzso demonstrated that this zzso is ideal for imaging rabbit knee zzso
