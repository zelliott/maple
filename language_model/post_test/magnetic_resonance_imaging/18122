Although schizophrenia and major depressive disorder zzso differ on a variety of zzso measures, a diagnostic tool to discriminate these disorders has not yet been zzso We tried to identify structural changes of the brain that best discriminate between schizophrenia and zzso on the basis of gray matter volume, zzso volume, and diffusion zzso imaging zzso 

The first exploration sample consisted of 25 female patients with schizophrenia and 25 females with zzso Regional brain volumes and fractional zzso zzso values were entered into a zzso zzso The second validation sample consisted of 18 female schizophrenia and 16 female zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso analysis resulted in correct zzso rates of zzso in the schizophrenic group and zzso in zzso In the second validation sample, the obtained model yielded correct zzso rates of zzso in the schizophrenia group and zzso in the zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that schizophrenia and zzso have differential structural changes in the examined brain regions and that the obtained zzso score may be useful to discriminate the two zzso
