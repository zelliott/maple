zzso moving objects are often detected by zzso zzso We investigated the cortical activity associated with coherent visual motion perception in the presence of a stationary or moving auditory noise source using functional magnetic resonance zzso Twelve subjects judged episodes of zzso zzso motion containing either no zzso or abundant zzso coherent direction zzso zzso noise was presented with the displayed visual motion that was moving in phase, was moving zzso or was zzso zzso judged whether visual coherent motion was present, and if so, whether the auditory noise source was moving in phase, was moving zzso or was not zzso Performance was greatest for a moving sound source that was in phase with the visual coherent dot motion compared with when it was in zzso A zzso analysis revealed that auditory motion activated extended regions in both cerebral zzso in the superior zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso Combined audiovisual motion led to zzso clusters in the zzso the zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso and the zzso The size of the activated regions was substantially larger than that evoked by either visual or auditory motion zzso The zzso audiovisual motion evoked the most extensive zzso pattern, exhibiting several exclusively activated zzso
