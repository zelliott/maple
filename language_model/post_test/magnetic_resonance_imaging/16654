A combined zzso and zzso zzso framework for the assessment of human zzso transit and motor function is zzso This framework consists of silicone coated zzso capsules filled with zzso as zzso marker, a flexible zzso surface zzso and a zzso projection imaging zzso allowing for real-time tracking of a single or multiple zzso The capsules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contain 140 zzso zzso and were tested for zzso and leakage prior to oral zzso A balanced zzso projection sequence was zzso yielding a zzso resolution of 133 zzso zzso zzso zzso allowing for zzso tracking of differently labeled zzso zzso was zzso The passage of the zzso capsules through zzso sections was monitored in two healthy zzso zzso coordinates were successfully zzso with anatomical reference zzso zzso zzso residence times, lengths and forward zzso were zzso zzso tracking of two capsules allowed for the assessment of zzso patterns with correction for respiratory zzso By providing the means for real-time multiple capsule tracking and high resolution anatomical imaging, the presented zzso imaging framework has the potential to provide important supplemental information for zzso and pharmaceutical zzso
