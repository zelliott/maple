zzso zzso in the zzso strip are often considered to be zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a combined approach for surgery in this region, aided by a robotic zzso system under zzso zzso 

In a prospective study on 10 patients, space occupying zzso in the zzso central area were removed using the zzso robotic navigation system and the zzso Viking IV zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with the zzso system and the information on the patient's cortical motor distribution obtained by bipolar cortical stimulation led to zzso improvement in motor function in all but one zzso Seven of the patients had zzso defined pathology (four zzso two zzso one zzso 

Due to the zzso of two recent technologies, surgery of zzso in the zzso zzso region can be performed with greater zzso
