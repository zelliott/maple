A new optical parallel detection system of hybrid frequency and zzso zzso was developed to improve the data quality and accuracy in recovery of all breast optical zzso This new system was deployed in a previously existing system for magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and allows incorporation of additional zzso zzso beyond zzso zzso with zzso channels of zzso tubes zzso and silicon zzso zzso The acquisition time for obtaining zzso data at six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso data at three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is 12 zzso The dynamic ranges of the detected signal are 105 and 106 for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared to the previous detection system, the zzso ratio of zzso detection was improved by nearly 103 through the addition of an zzso amplifier and the zzso of zzso zzso The current system is being zzso in a clinical trial imaging suspected breast cancer tumors as detected by contrast zzso zzso
