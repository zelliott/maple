zzso zzso are routinely used in zzso diagnosis and treatment zzso It would be useful if these zzso could also provide information about internal zzso zzso of the zzso joint zzso 

The sample consisted of zzso zzso in 84 zzso They underwent panoramic zzso on 1 of 3 machines and bilateral magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso on 1 zzso Six panoramic variables were analyzed by zzso zzso to evaluate differences in zzso zzso with respect to status of the zzso ID and type of panoramic zzso 

zzso zzso heights and zzso inclined zzso were found in the patients with zzso zzso irrespective of the type of panoramic machine zzso The change became more severe as ID progressed to disk displacement without zzso 

This study suggests that some panoramic variables can help the zzso identify patients with potential zzso
