zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso studies followed by zzso examination were used to study the size and the shape of the lateral part of the zzso zzso of the brain in seven individuals with zzso disease zzso and five zzso In control zzso the lateral part of the zzso zzso is a narrow zzso protruding zzso as zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso the lateral part of the zzso zzso becomes a large zzso space as a result of different degrees of zzso of various zzso and zzso zzso Our findings directly indicate the relationship between changes in the zzso and zzso structures and the size of the lateral part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso the zzso cortex, and the zzso zzso are the most affected, whereas the zzso zzso is much less zzso zzso zzso structures, which are less vulnerable to the zzso pathology, do not appear to contribute to zzso zzso zzso The size and the shape of the lateral part of the zzso zzso of the brain in zzso reflect the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso
