For a zzso study 8 specimens of the zzso spine zzso were scanned with zzso After that 21 motion segments were prepared for the zzso The zzso zzso as well as the zzso elements were zzso From each disc zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso g of nuclear material were zzso removed under an zzso load of 500 zzso At the beginning of every standardized experiment of a motion segment, as well as after the zzso of every gram of nuclear material, zzso pressure, the height of the disc and the zzso of the disc were determined with an zzso load on the motion segment of 1000 zzso The change in zzso bulging of the disc was measured using the zzso recordings of each disc zzso All the data were statistically analyzed using the zzso The nuclear material removed from the discs zzso nuclear zzso was placed in zzso saline over 45 minutes and again weighted zzso zzso zzso that the nuclear material was zzso zzso zzso The results of this study showed that after the zzso of every gram of nuclear material the height of the disc decreased in average zzso zzso Also zzso pressure reduces zzso from the initial stage, on average, 9, 19 bar to the zzso zzso after the removal of zzso zzso on average, 2, 58 zzso zzso zzso increases with every gram removed, on average zzso zzso The weight of the wet nuclear material is zzso times as much as that of the zzso nuclear material and 11 times as much as that of the zzso zzso
