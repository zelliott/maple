In recent years, three-dimensional zzso zzso has been zzso to detect zzso tears and has displayed several advantages over zzso zzso The diagnostic performance to discriminate the type of zzso tears by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso images from zzso zzso zzso has not been reported zzso The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of the zzso reconstructed images from zzso zzso zzso for the zzso diagnosis of zzso tears of the zzso 

zzso zzso in 37 patients who underwent zzso surgery of the knee were zzso All patients were examined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and by zzso images from zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso First, we compared the diagnostic performance for zzso tears by zzso zzso and zzso zzso to that by zzso images from zzso zzso zzso as judged by zzso zzso Second, we compared the correlation of tear types presumed from zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso with those presumed from zzso images from zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

For the diagnostic performance of zzso tears on zzso zzso the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were zzso zzso and zzso zzso On zzso images from zzso zzso the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nine cases were zzso on zzso images, while 5 cases were zzso on zzso zzso zzso to zzso were zzso by both scans for zzso tears and zzso zzso zzso Only zzso were correctly diagnosed by zzso zzso and zzso images for zzso tears, however, all zzso tears could be correctly diagnosed by zzso zzso All horizontal tears were correctly diagnosed on zzso zzso and zzso images, while none of the horizontal tears could be correctly diagnosed from zzso zzso 

zzso images from zzso zzso zzso were useful in the diagnosis of zzso tears, but two limitations are noted concerning the use of zzso zzso First, zzso zzso should be carefully read on zzso slices because of the relatively high rate of zzso on zzso zzso Second, zzso images cannot discriminate horizontal tears from other types of zzso zzso
