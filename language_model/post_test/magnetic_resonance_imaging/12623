While many advanced zzso models have been proposed and are used in zzso the zzso ordinary least squares zzso is still the one that is most widely zzso A survey of 90 papers found that zzso of group zzso analyses used zzso Despite the widespread use, this simple approach has never been thoroughly justified and zzso for example, the typical reference for the method is a conference abstract, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso random effects & population zzso zzso 7 (4 zzso zzso proceedings of Fourth International Conference on zzso zzso of the Human zzso June zzso 1998, Montreal, zzso which has been referenced over 400 zzso In this work we fully derive the simplified method in a general setting and carefully identify the zzso assumptions it is based zzso We examine the specificity zzso I error zzso of the zzso method under zzso in the zzso case and find that the zzso method is zzso with only slight zzso Surprisingly, a zzso approximation for effective degrees of freedom only makes the method more conservative, instead of more zzso While other authors have highlighted the inferior power of the zzso method relative to optimal zzso methods under zzso we revisit these results and find the power differences very zzso While statistical methods that make the best use of the data are always to be zzso software or other practical concerns may require the use of the simple zzso group zzso In such cases, we find that group mean zzso will be valid under the zzso hypothesis and will have nearly optimal sensitivity under the zzso
