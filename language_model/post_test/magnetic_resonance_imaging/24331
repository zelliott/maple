In zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso of up to hundreds of highly sensitive zzso quantum interference devices zzso can be used to detect the weak magnetic fields zzso by the zzso zzso Here, we investigate the noise amplification in zzso zzso zzso at various acceleration rates using a zzso array consisting of 102 zzso 102 zzso or zzso zzso and zzso to cover the whole zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso consisting of 102 zzso and 102 zzso are similar in zzso zzso A zzso array of zzso sensors zzso zzso and 204 zzso only marginally improves the zzso zzso with previous studies, the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with 9 to zzso zzso zzso using the zzso array studied here may be zzso
