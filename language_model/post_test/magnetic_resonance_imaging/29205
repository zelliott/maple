Corpus zzso is a surgical option for medically uncontrolled generalized zzso in appropriate zzso Because numerous complications related to open zzso are still reported, we performed zzso corpus zzso with the gamma zzso 

Between October 1992 and June 1995, three patients underwent zzso zzso to zzso the anterior third of the corpus zzso The patients had intractable zzso two had zzso syndrome, and one had zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso absence zzso The history of zzso ranged from 20 to 37 years' zzso zzso zzso was performed with a zzso gamma knife using a zzso zzso targeted to the zzso zzso and anterior third of body of the corpus zzso Two patients were treated once with 150 and 160 zzso at zzso respectively, and one patient was treated in two stages with 50 zzso and then 170 zzso at zzso 

The severity and frequency of zzso were significantly reduced in all three zzso The types of zzso associated with the most improved outcome were zzso and generalized zzso zzso The mean follow-up period was 38 zzso zzso required for this procedure was 3 zzso No complications related to zzso were recorded except transient headache in one zzso 

The outcomes suggest that zzso corpus zzso may be a promising alternative treatment to open zzso
