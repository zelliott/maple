zzso fluid zzso and nerve root volumes within the zzso zzso zzso were estimated at various zzso levels, in an attempt to determine any possible relevance to the zzso of nerve root trauma during zzso puncture or spinal zzso zzso resonance images from seven patients were zzso Volumes were calculated by zzso threshold zzso combined with manual editing of each zzso The mean zzso zzso volume from zzso to zzso was zzso zzso and the mean zzso volume zzso zzso with the mean root volume being zzso zzso The mean zzso volume per zzso segment ranged from zzso zzso at zzso to zzso zzso at zzso with high zzso zzso The mean root volume ranged from zzso zzso at zzso to zzso zzso at zzso The zzso zzso was located at zzso in four of the five patients scanned at upper zzso levels, and at the lower border of zzso in the zzso zzso to nerve root damage was expressed as the zzso Index zzso being defined as the ratio of root volume to zzso zzso volume zzso volume + root zzso The value ranged between 7 and zzso at zzso increasing zzso to 30 to zzso at zzso zzso is obviously required in high zzso to avoid contact with the zzso zzso but the zzso zzso is also vulnerable to contact with more zzso zzso and had a zzso Index of about zzso at zzso that increased zzso
