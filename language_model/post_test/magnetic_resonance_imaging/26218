We used PET to study differences in cerebral blood flow zzso in smooth zzso zzso zzso and zzso Eye movements were monitored in the zzso Compared with zzso pursuit and zzso zzso activated a network of highly similar areas, including frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, zzso and zzso zzso Our findings are consistent with zzso zzso studies that suggest that pursuit and zzso are controlled by similar and adjacent neural zzso Pursuit was associated with greater zzso of zzso than zzso suggesting a role for zzso zzso in pursuit that is consistent with studies of neurological zzso zzso were associated with greater zzso of zzso and frontal eye zzso A zzso loop may be important in zzso the preparation and timing of zzso in zzso zzso
