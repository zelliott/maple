Dynamic signal intensity changes of zzso zzso zzso are well documented in cases of zzso These changes have been staged zzso depending on zzso signal intensity changes in zzso tract with magnetic resonance imaging zzso We performed both prospective and retrospective evaluation of various zzso zzso to look for evidence of zzso and to assess its zzso zzso zzso patients of acute stroke were studied zzso Their functional disability was evaluated by using a modified zzso index of activity of daily living zzso at zzso at 1 month and at 4 months, and was correlated with presence or absence of zzso on zzso zzso patients showed signal intensity changes of zzso on zzso and their mean zzso score changed from zzso at 1 month to zzso at 4 months duration suggestive of moderate to severe disability after 4 months of zzso The rest of the eight patients, where zzso did not reveal signal intensity changes of zzso the mean zzso score improved from zzso at 1 month to zzso at 4 months, suggesting significant improvement in their clinical zzso 520 patients were studied zzso out of whom 31 showed signal intensity changes of zzso in various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple sclerosis zzso and encephalitis zzso zzso of zzso in these zzso zzso correlated well with persistent clinical zzso This observation has immense zzso value, particularly in zzso and zzso disease like multiple zzso We conclude that zzso can be seen secondary to any zzso insult with zzso and its presence zzso well with persistent functional zzso It thus has zzso zzso
