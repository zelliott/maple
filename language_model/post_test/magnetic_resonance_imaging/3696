We previously introduced a zzso zzso application of the partial least square zzso zzso to characterize the linkage between patterns in a person's complementary complex zzso without the need to correct for multiple regional zzso Here we used it to demonstrate a strong correlation between zzso scores to characterize the linkage between the zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of regional zzso metabolism and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of regional gray matter associated with zzso E zzso zzso gene dose zzso three levels of genetic risk for zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso in cognitively normal, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso PET and zzso images from zzso of the subjects (27 zzso zzso 36 zzso zzso and 67 zzso zzso were used in a zzso zzso analysis to characterize the zzso pattern of regional gray matter volume and cerebral zzso metabolism most strongly correlated with zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso PET and zzso images from the remaining zzso of the subjects were used in a zzso zzso analysis to generate zzso zzso gray matter zzso scores blind to their zzso zzso and characterize their relationship to zzso gene zzso The zzso analysis revealed zzso regional gray matter volume and cerebral zzso metabolism patterns that resembled those in traditional zzso analyses of zzso and zzso gene dose and zzso scores that were strongly correlated with zzso gene dose zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis results showed strong correlations between zzso zzso gray matter scores and zzso gene dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings support the possibility of using the zzso to analyze complementary zzso from the same person in the zzso detection and tracking of zzso
