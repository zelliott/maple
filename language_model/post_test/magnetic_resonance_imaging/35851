In zzso zzso of zzso and zzso values were performed in surgical specimens from 15 patients with lung zzso zzso between zzso results and measured values revealed that different zzso zzso can be characterized by means of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso curve of the lung tissue was zzso which can be explained by two different relaxation times, fast zzso and slow zzso The signal intensity of zzso lung zzso at different pulse sequences was simulated on a signal intensity zzso graph based on measured values of zzso fast zzso slow zzso and water zzso The results showed that zzso sequences were more valuable in discriminating viable lung cancer from zzso tumor and collapsed lung zzso
