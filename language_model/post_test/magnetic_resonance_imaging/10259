To determine the zzso manifestations, zzso value, and surgical zzso value of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso 

Eighty-one consecutive patients undergoing zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso were screened for zzso The characteristics of the zzso phenomena, occurrence of other aura types, seizure zzso findings of zzso and imaging studies, zzso lobe zzso and zzso seizure outcome were determined in each patient with zzso 

Nine zzso of 81 patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso reported distinct zzso as part of their habitual zzso The most common manifestation of zzso was zzso zzso of nine, zzso but sensory loss (one of nine, zzso and pain (one of nine, zzso also were zzso Five patients had unilateral zzso symptoms, and four patients had bilateral zzso zzso zzso origin was in the zzso zzso lobe in four zzso of five patients with unilateral zzso including all patients with unilateral zzso affecting a zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso produced complete seizure zzso in all nine zzso patients 1 year after surgery and in seven zzso of nine patients 2 years after zzso 

zzso occur more frequently than previously appreciated in patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso and usually manifest as either unilateral or bilateral zzso In patients with zzso lobe seizures, unilateral zzso involving a limb suggest a seizure origin in the zzso zzso zzso The surgical outcome of zzso patients with zzso is zzso Thus the presence of zzso should not serve as a deterrent to zzso lobe zzso in patients with clearly defined zzso
