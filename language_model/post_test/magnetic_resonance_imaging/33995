This study was aimed at determining an easy way to project zzso zzso results onto brain zzso This simplified projection is based on the zzso of the mean location of the zzso of the zzso sphere according to internal brain zzso The mean values for the zzso location were calculated from ten zzso zzso To define the axes of the zzso model frame on the patient's magnetic resonance image zzso markers were pasted at some zzso positions during the zzso An zzso was then made of the mean position of the model zzso from the zzso line zzso zzso zzso zzso and a simple transformation to pass from the model zzso coordinates to the anatomical zzso either in the subject zzso or in the zzso zzso These data were then tested in four additional subjects in whom no markers had been placed during the zzso zzso On average, the horizontal plane of the sphere model was pitched up zzso degrees zzso zzso only with respect to the zzso horizontal plane, which allowed the projection of zzso directly onto the zzso atlas, without zzso The mean sphere zzso was located zzso zzso zzso zzso above the zzso line, and zzso zzso 1 zzso in front of the zzso zzso In the four additional subjects, projections on zzso and zzso indicated the same anatomical regions and showed high zzso with the physiology or the zzso This simplified way we report zzso has proved to give reliable zzso We believe that this method will be useful as a first approximation to project zzso coordinated onto zzso zzso moreover, when zzso is zzso our results show that zzso zzso results can be superimposed onto zzso slices provided that they are represented according to the zzso zzso
