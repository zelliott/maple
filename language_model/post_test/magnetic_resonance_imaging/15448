The choice of imaging before liver surgery is debated regarding the use of magnetic resonance zzso imaging, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso No studies have compared zzso zzso with zzso iron oxide zzso MR zzso 

To compare zzso with zzso iron oxide zzso MR imaging, zzso and CT in the detection of liver zzso zzso and zzso tumor from zzso cancer zzso 

Thirty-five patients with suspected zzso underwent zzso with a zzso CT protocol and zzso MR zzso Readers independently analyzed images from MR imaging, zzso and the CT part and PET part of the zzso zzso Imaging findings were compared with surgical and zzso zzso 

zzso sensitivity and accuracy for liver zzso was zzso and zzso for PET alone, zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso MR imaging, and zzso and zzso for CT alone, zzso CT and zzso MR imaging were less specific but significantly more sensitive than PET zzso For zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity was zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for CT, zzso 

CT and zzso MR imaging are more sensitive but less specific than PET in the detection of zzso zzso can detect more patients with zzso tumor than CT zzso
