Despite a growing body of zzso data, little consensus has been reached regarding the neural zzso of zzso processing in zzso This paper presents a zzso of two previously published zzso experiments, which used two different cognitive timing tasks and examined both zzso and zzso zzso By processing these data in an identical manner, this zzso allows valid comparison and contrasting across zzso zzso of these studies using inclusive masking reveals shared activity in right zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso and anterior zzso supporting a zzso system for cognitive time measurement in the right zzso prefrontal zzso Consideration of the patterns of activity in each zzso with respect to the others, and taking task characteristics into account, provides insight into the possible role of zzso prefrontal zzso in working memory and of zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso in zzso processing during cognitive time measurement zzso
