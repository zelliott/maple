A comparison of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso To compare the capability and zzso of zzso and zzso in measuring the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso of zzso disc levels from 61 subjects with various zzso spinal diseases were zzso zzso area, zzso zzso (AP) diameter, zzso zzso diameter, and thickness of the zzso zzso were measured by two orthopedic zzso Each section was graded by degree of zzso Absolute value and zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso of these zzso and the associations between zzso and zzso values were zzso 

Except for zzso determination of ligament zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso suggested sufficient zzso When zzso of zzso area, zzso zzso diameter, and zzso diameter were zzso values in zzso were significantly zzso zzso zzso larger than those in zzso zzso ratios, zzso zzso and zzso zzso As spinal zzso became more zzso discrepancies between zzso and zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso became zzso 

Both zzso and zzso provided zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso thickness may be more accurately measured by zzso Because the differences in the zzso between zzso and zzso are very slight and there is very little data to suggest that the precise degree of zzso is related to symptoms or treatment outcome, the usefulness of the zzso over zzso needs to be confirmed in future zzso
