Our goal was to assess the prevalence of complicated American Heart Association zzso zzso type VI plaques in the carotid arteries of patients with zzso zzso 

In up to zzso of zzso stroke patients, no zzso cause can be established despite extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso To test the hypothesis if zzso complicated carotid plaques may be the underlying zzso in some of these patients, we used high-resolution zzso carotid magnetic resonance imaging zzso which can zzso assess plaque composition and zzso with good correlation to zzso Specifically, we focused on zzso type VI zzso which are characterized by zzso zzso or zzso cap zzso 

zzso consecutive patients zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso stroke and zzso zzso eccentric carotid plaques were recruited from a single stroke zzso All patients underwent extensive clinical zzso zzso zzso duplex zzso zzso and zzso monitoring, zzso and zzso zzso and laboratory zzso to exclude other causes of zzso All patients received a zzso carotid zzso at zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso images using surface coils and parallel imaging zzso zzso of zzso type VI plaque was determined in both carotid arteries on the basis of previously published zzso zzso 

zzso type VI plaques were found in 12 of 32 arteries zzso zzso to the stroke, whereas there were no zzso type VI plaques zzso to the stroke zzso zzso zzso The most common diagnostic feature of zzso type VI plaques was zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso plaque zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

This pilot study suggests that zzso embolism from complicated, zzso carotid zzso plaques may play a role in a zzso of patients previously diagnosed with zzso zzso To further evaluate the significance of zzso type VI plaques in zzso stroke, future studies will have to analyze both clinical and imaging follow-up data, including event rates for secondary zzso
