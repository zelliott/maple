A 64 year old woman with a predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso presented with bilateral total zzso One week later reasonable zzso thresholds appeared but she still had total bilateral loss of speech zzso At that time zzso acoustic zzso were zzso zzso whereas zzso acoustic zzso and waves IV and V of the zzso auditory evoked potential were zzso zzso It is proposed that this patient's hearing deficit was due to zzso of the zzso acoustic zzso zzso in the trapezoid zzso This case supports the contention that in humans the zzso zzso acoustic zzso carries most of the neural signals required for hearing and perhaps all the neural signals required for speech zzso
