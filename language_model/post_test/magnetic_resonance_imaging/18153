The objective of this study is to design and develop a zzso zzso hybrid zzso with shell embedded magnetic zzso for zzso zzso The hybrid zzso were engineered based on complex zzso zzso from zzso block zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The reason to choose PA is due to its zzso character and the coordination capability for zzso and zzso The PA incorporation allows the in zzso growth of the magnetic iron oxide zzso onto the complex zzso to yield the zzso with shell embedded magnetic zzso at an ambient condition without any organic zzso The zzso drug zzso zzso can be efficiently loaded into the hybrid zzso Interestingly, the magnetic zzso anchored on the shell were found to significantly zzso the zzso release behavior of the drug loaded hybrid zzso It was proposed that a zzso effect of the shell by magnetic zzso is a key to zzso the above intriguing phenomenon, which could enhance the stability and control the drug diffusion of the hybrid zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso revealed the potential of these hybrid zzso to be served as a zzso MR imaging contrast zzso for clinical zzso
