In zzso zzso with zzso contrast agents, the signal levels vary over time due to zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso usage of the zzso zzso zzso requires specialized zzso pulse zzso In this work, we introduce two novel variable flip angle schemes for dynamic zzso zzso in which the flip angle is varied between zzso and between zzso These were zzso to distribute the zzso relatively evenly throughout the acquisition by accounting for zzso zzso prior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso results are presented to confirm the flip angle designs and evaluate the zzso of signal dynamics across typical ranges of zzso and zzso zzso They were implemented using zzso zzso zzso zzso to independently zzso the flip angle at various chemical shift zzso With these schemes we observed increased zzso of zzso generated from zzso particularly at later time zzso This will allow for improved characterization of tissue zzso and zzso profiles in dynamic zzso zzso
