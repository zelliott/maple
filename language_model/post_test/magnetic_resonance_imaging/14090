zzso of accordance and zzso of the stroke volume assessment of fast flow measurement in zzso technique in the ascending zzso and pulmonary zzso with fast right zzso and left zzso zzso zzso 

The correlation an accordance of stroke volumes zzso were evaluated by flow zzso in the ascending zzso and pulmonary zzso and RV and zzso zzso zzso in 33 cardiac healthy zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the different measurement methods and locations were checked in 10 cardiac healthy zzso 

With respect to the early zzso flow and the zzso of the zzso flow rate the difference in zzso was smaller than zzso zzso for all possible zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of flow zzso were significantly lower by approximately a factor of zzso than those of RV and zzso zzso 

The accordance of fast prospective triggered flow zzso in the ascending zzso and pulmonary zzso with RV and zzso zzso can be achieved with reasonable limits of zzso zzso zzso are more zzso than zzso
