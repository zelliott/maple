This study aims to determine the effect of human zzso stem cell zzso labeling with the fluorescent dye zzso and the iron oxide zzso zzso on zzso 

zzso were labeled with zzso alone or with zzso and zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso optical imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso was induced by transforming growth zzso and confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Data of labeled and zzso zzso were compared with a zzso zzso 

Cellular zzso of zzso and zzso was confirmed with zzso zzso zzso labeling caused a significant zzso on zzso and zzso labeling caused a significant zzso effect on MR zzso Compared to zzso controls, zzso of labeled zzso exhibited similar zzso zzso after zzso zzso but the labeled cells demonstrated significantly reduced zzso production zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso labeling of zzso does not interfere with cell viability or zzso differentiation into zzso but labeled cells exhibit significantly less zzso production compared to zzso zzso
