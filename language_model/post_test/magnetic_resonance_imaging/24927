zzso zzso patients with severe spinal zzso were reviewed zzso after being treated with chemotherapy and/or zzso zzso 

To determine the most appropriate treatment protocol and to predict the prognosis for zzso zzso with severe spinal zzso 

Catholic University of Korea Medical Center and zzso Institute of zzso Research, Seoul, Korea from 1971 to zzso 

In this study, there were 33 patients zzso children and 25 zzso ranging from 13 to 56 years of zzso They developed spinal tuberculosis at the age of 9 years zzso zzso zzso and remained zzso symptom free from an average of 16 years zzso zzso zzso Four adults who responded well to treatment initially suffered relapses of zzso Only six patients had previously received a full course of triple zzso Seven zzso children, five zzso had healed disease, and 26 (six children, 20 zzso had active zzso Eleven cases had frequent drainage from the zzso zzso was found in 11 zzso four children and seven zzso The remaining patients had zzso zzso Among the 26 patients with active zzso 10 had triple chemotherapy itself and the rest had additional zzso surgery (10 anterior and six zzso All seven patients with healed tuberculosis were subjected only to surgery zzso anterior and five zzso 

In seven patients with healed zzso surgery did not improve zzso except in one child zzso In four patients, the severity of paralysis remained unchanged and two patients, deteriorated zzso after zzso In six children with active zzso there were remarkable neurological zzso by either conservative treatment or surgical zzso Seven adults with active tuberculosis recovered slowly, improving by one or two Frankel grades (three Frankel C, three D, one zzso In 11 out of 13 surgically treated adults with active disease, paralysis that had persisted for less than 3 months gradually improved by one or two Frankel zzso One Frankel A and one Frankel B zzso patients who had paralysis that had lasted through 6 months did not recover after zzso 

The neurological recovery of zzso zzso with severe spinal zzso resulted in three different zzso zzso severe zzso is different from moderate and mild zzso zzso patients with healed tuberculosis had poorer prognosis than patients with active zzso zzso children had better prognosis than zzso Furthermore, patients with paralysis zzso over 6 months did not recover zzso after zzso
