zzso and voices are key features of human recognition but the way the brain links them together is still zzso In this study, we measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while participants were recognizing previously learned zzso faces, voices and zzso face zzso Using a zzso method between zzso and zzso conditions, we observed that zzso associations activated both zzso visual and auditory areas, and specific zzso regions located in the left angular zzso and the right zzso Moreover, a functional connectivity analysis confirmed the connectivity of the right zzso with the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that binding faces and voices rely on a cerebral network sustaining different aspects of integration such as sensory zzso processing, attention and zzso
