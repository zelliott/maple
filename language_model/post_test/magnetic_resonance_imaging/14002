To explore the potential of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in characterizing zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in 23 zzso proven zzso masses using a zzso zzso sequence with diffusion zzso strengths yielding five zzso zzso zzso True diffusion zzso and zzso zzso were estimated and compared with apparent diffusion zzso zzso 

zzso values of all tumors, subcutaneous fat, and muscle were significantly higher than true diffusion zzso indicating a contribution of zzso to the zzso True diffusion zzso of zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower than those of benign masses zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso values between these groups were not significantly zzso 

zzso zzso zzso has potential in zzso benign from zzso zzso zzso
