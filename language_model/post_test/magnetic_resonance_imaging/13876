zzso is a cerebral cortical zzso that is zzso characterized by excessive cortical folding and microscopically characterized by abnormal cortical zzso Although zzso appears to have one or more genetic causes, no zzso zzso have been zzso Here we describe the clinical and zzso features of a new genetic form of zzso and zzso the responsible zzso We studied two zzso Palestinian zzso with an zzso zzso form of bilateral zzso zzso zzso using linkage zzso Five affected children had zzso mental zzso zzso zzso and zzso and four of the five affected children developed zzso Brain zzso imaging revealed zzso that was most prominent in the frontal and zzso zzso but involved other cortical areas as zzso A zzso linkage screen revealed a single locus that was identical by descent in affected children in both families and showed a single zzso zzso suggesting a common founder zzso The locus for zzso maps to zzso zzso with a minimal zzso of 17 zzso For zzso the zzso pooled zzso zzso score was zzso and the zzso zzso zzso score was zzso This study provides the first genetic evidence that zzso is an zzso zzso disorder and serves as a starting point for the identification of the responsible zzso
