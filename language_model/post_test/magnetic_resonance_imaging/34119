A case report of a 41-year-old man with psoriasis who had cervical zzso caused by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

To describe the possible mechanism underlying the zzso zzso formation and the optimal treatment for such zzso 

zzso zzso causing spinal zzso zzso at the zzso junction may develop in patients with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso formation plays an important role in compromising the zzso diameter of the spinal canal and in causing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is sometimes thought necessary for anterior zzso of the spinal zzso zzso resolution of the zzso zzso after zzso zzso fusion and fixation has been documented in zzso arthritis, but not in zzso zzso 

The patient underwent zzso zzso fusion and Halifax zzso 

The patient experienced clinical zzso zzso of the zzso zzso mass was observed on magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso fusion and zzso resulted in spontaneous zzso of the zzso mass and symptomatic zzso This report provides evidence that zzso instability may be the sine zzso non for the formation of zzso zzso and that zzso of such instability leads to spontaneous resolution of the zzso zzso
