Our aim was to assess the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging with complimentary magnetic resonance zzso zzso in the zzso evaluation of patients with zzso zzso zzso 

The present study was zzso conducted on 27 patients with zzso zzso All patients showed normal zzso findings and were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging zzso with complimentary magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were investigated by CT, and zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso All patients' clinical investigation was reviewed to discard systemic causes of zzso 

All hard copies of zzso studies were zzso zzso detected the underlying zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso and zzso patients zzso showed normal zzso zzso The most common cause was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso patients, high jugular zzso in zzso zzso aneurysm of internal carotid artery in zzso zzso zzso internal carotid artery in zzso zzso zzso artery zzso in zzso zzso and zzso tumor in zzso zzso The statistical results of the present study showed that zzso had the zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso error percentage for diagnosis of zzso 

zzso was an effective zzso imaging method in detecting the underlying pathology of zzso zzso zzso resonance may be considered a first line diagnostic imaging zzso in the assessment of zzso zzso zzso
