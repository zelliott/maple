Patients with zzso zzso (or zzso zzso focal zzso are the most challenging group undergoing zzso zzso Few large-scale studies have systematically reviewed the pathological zzso underlying zzso zzso In the current study, zzso specimens were zzso reviewed from zzso zzso patients zzso mean zzso years, 50% female zzso zzso cortical zzso cases were classified according to the International League Against zzso zzso and zzso et al zzso The most common zzso found in this zzso cohort zzso focal cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sclerosis zzso zzso The majority of focal cortical zzso were zzso type I zzso or zzso type I zzso Seven patients had no identifiable pathological zzso The existence of positive pathology was not significantly associated with age or zzso zzso zzso data post surgery was available in 90 zzso 63 zzso and 57 zzso attained seizure freedom at 6 and 12 months, zzso The finding of positive pathology was significantly associated with zzso outcome at 6 months zzso but not at 12 zzso In zzso analysis, the focal cortical zzso group was not significantly correlated with zzso outcome, as compared with the zzso groups at either 6 or 12 zzso Of note, the finding of zzso sclerosis had a significant positive correlation with zzso outcome when compared with the zzso group zzso and zzso for 6- and 12-month outcome, zzso zzso of a significant zzso in the zzso surgical zzso did not zzso seizure zzso In conclusion, our study highlights the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso with focal cortical zzso being the most common zzso The existence of positive pathology in surgical zzso may be a good indication for short-term good seizure zzso There is a small subset of cases in which no pathological abnormalities are zzso
