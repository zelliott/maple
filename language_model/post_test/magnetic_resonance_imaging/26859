systematic review and zzso 

to assess how confidently low back pain zzso can be attributed to abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging zzso and thereby explore the potential value of zzso abnormalities in refining case definition for mechanical zzso in zzso zzso 

most zzso studies of mechanical zzso have defined cases only by reported symptoms, but it is possible that the potency of causes differs depending on whether there is zzso underlying spinal zzso 

we reviewed the published data on zzso zzso looking for data on the zzso of their assessment, their prevalence in people free from zzso and their association with zzso Where data were zzso we calculated a summary estimate of prevalence in people without zzso and a zzso of the odds ratio for the association with zzso A formula was then applied to estimate the corresponding prevalence rate ratio, assuming 3 possible prevalence rates for zzso in the general zzso 

data were most extensive for disc zzso nerve root displacement or zzso disc zzso and high intensity zone, all of which could be assessed zzso All were associated with zzso zzso of odds ratios ranging from zzso zzso root displacement or zzso to zzso zzso zzso However, even for disc zzso estimates of the corresponding prevalence rate ratios were mostly less than zzso 

zzso findings of disc zzso nerve root displacement or zzso disc zzso and high intensity zone are all associated with zzso but individually, none of these abnormalities provides a strong indication that zzso is attributable to underlying zzso This limits their value in refining zzso case definitions for zzso
