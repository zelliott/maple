The zzso fast zzso zzso MR imaging sequence is not used zzso since the speed advantage is not as dramatic as it is in zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso sequence to determine whether this technique can replace the conventional zzso zzso zzso sequence for routine zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso enhancing zzso underwent both zzso and zzso sequences in a random order after administration of contrast zzso Acquisition time was 55 seconds for the zzso sequence and 2 minutes 38 seconds for the zzso zzso The zzso of enhancing zzso zzso zzso and zzso matter contrast as well as motion and flow artifacts were zzso zzso ratios of enhancing zzso gray matter, and white matter as well as zzso ratios zzso of enhancing zzso with gray matter with white matter as the standard, were zzso 

The zzso of enhancing zzso was better on zzso sequences than on zzso zzso although the difference in the zzso of enhancing zzso did not reach zzso Images obtained with the zzso sequence showed less flow and motion artifacts than did those obtained with the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso matter contrast was lower on the zzso images than on the zzso zzso 

The zzso sequence reduces imaging time and has the potential to replace the conventional zzso sequence for the evaluation of enhancing zzso in the brain when time is a zzso
