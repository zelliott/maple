To evaluate the range of normal contrast enhancement zzso in dynamic MR zzso of healthy breast zzso and to reduce zzso results caused by incidental contrast enhancing zzso 

We performed a prospective zzso study on 20 healthy zzso volunteers who were examined four times within one month zzso 1) or during four consecutive months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and contrast enhancement pattern of zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso of Group 1) and zzso zzso of Group 2) showed at least one of a total of 60 contrast enhancing zzso In zzso or zzso zzso 1 or zzso zzso with enhancement zzso beyond the zzso threshold were zzso zzso or zzso of zzso resolved completely during zzso zzso of zzso were focal with irregular zzso zzso intensity zzso were almost always not zzso no zzso phenomenon was zzso 

In MR zzso of zzso breast zzso focal contrast enhancing zzso with enhancement beyond the zzso zzso occur without any underlying zzso
