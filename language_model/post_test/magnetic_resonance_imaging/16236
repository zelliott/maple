Several studies have confirmed the zzso value of baseline and follow-up magnetic resonance zzso imaging variables for conversion to clinically zzso multiple sclerosis zzso depending on the population, follow-up zzso and treatment zzso However, the timing of follow-up imaging and the effect of treatment intervention on the zzso value of baseline MR imaging variables require further zzso 

To assess the zzso value of baseline MR imaging variables for conversion to zzso over 3 years and whether this was affected by treatment intervention and zzso to assess the increased risk for conversion posed by dissemination in time on follow-up MR zzso

Four hundred zzso patients with a clinically isolated syndrome who had an initial clinical zzso event within the past 60 days who received early treatment (3 years of zzso zzso or delayed treatment zzso first, followed by zzso or zzso year of zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso Main zzso Measure Time to zzso 

The overall conversion rate to zzso was zzso zzso criteria with the strongest zzso value were the presence at baseline of at least 9 zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and at least 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No specific advantage was noted in using a fixed zzso of at least 3 zzso criteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso value of all MR imaging criteria was unaffected by treatment intervention zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso in time resulted in increased risk for zzso only in patients without dissemination in space at baseline and was most zzso at the zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The modified zzso criteria showed moderate zzso value for conversion to zzso although all patients had received zzso zzso therapy for at least 1 zzso The zzso value was unaffected by treatment zzso zzso MR imaging was most zzso after 9 months in patients without dissemination in space at zzso
