We performed a functional zzso zzso study during the execution of the zzso Visual zzso zzso Task zzso in 9 patients with a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis zzso 9 patients with clinically zzso multiple sclerosis zzso and 18 matched healthy control zzso In controls, the zzso zzso a zzso network with zzso zzso which we expected for this kind of working memory test and which indicates that this zzso version is an appropriate tool for measuring functional changes during a cognitive zzso Although there were no significant differences in the actual test results of patients zzso controls, zzso and zzso patients activated distinct cerebral networks in their attempt to solve the zzso Compared to zzso patients, zzso patients showed increased zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the need to additionally support their working zzso In contrast, compared to zzso patients and healthy controls, zzso patients demonstrated stronger zzso of the anterior zzso cortex, which might indicate focused involvement of executive zzso On the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients also performed similarly to controls but they showed decreased scores on most of the zzso of the zzso Memory zzso Based on our observations using the zzso we zzso that distinct differences in cognitive processing occur with the evolution of zzso and that, at these early stages of the disease, they cannot be detected with sufficient sensitivity using only the zzso
