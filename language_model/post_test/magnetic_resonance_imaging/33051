It has been proposed that distinct neural circuits are activated by reading Japanese zzso zzso and zzso zzso By measuring zzso zzso zzso we recently reported that spatial frequency zzso information is responsible for the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso In particular, we found close links between zzso and low zzso zzso information and between zzso and high zzso zzso zzso However, it remains unclear which brain regions contribute to this zzso To determine this, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging while presenting unfiltered or zzso filtered zzso and zzso word stimuli to healthy native Japanese zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso stimuli were characterized by zzso and zzso information, zzso When presented with either type of unfiltered stimulus zzso or zzso the bilateral inferior zzso zzso BA zzso regions were activated compared to the resting zzso zzso but not zzso reading also activated the bilateral inferior zzso zzso zzso BA zzso When we compared zzso and zzso reading directly, the left IT region was significantly activated by zzso reading, while significant zzso of the left zzso was observed during zzso zzso In response to filtered zzso zzso the zzso reading minus zzso reading comparison revealed significant zzso of the left IT region but not the left zzso zzso significant zzso of the left zzso but not the left IT region occurred in the zzso reading minus zzso reading comparison for filtered zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso engage a relatively overlapping network, within which the left IT is more involved in zzso processing, while the left zzso contributes more to zzso zzso The preferential engagements of these brain regions could reflect the close links between zzso and zzso information, and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso this study provides further evidence that zzso contributes to the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso
