We used diffusion zzso imaging to assess diffusion zzso in the zzso tract in ten young, and ten elderly subjects (five males and five females in each zzso The purpose of this study was to define zzso values for zzso at different zzso levels of the zzso as well as to assess differences due to age, zzso and zzso In all subjects, zzso was highest in the cerebral zzso lowest in the zzso zzso and intermediate in the zzso In the zzso and zzso the regional zzso was high, with significant differences in zzso even between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the average value of zzso within each region of interest) revealed that elderly subjects had significantly lower values than young subjects in the cerebral zzso with no differences in the zzso and zzso No significant differences in zzso due to gender and side were zzso The differences in zzso at different levels of the zzso reflect differences in the local architecture of white matter zzso zzso is high in the cerebral zzso because fibers have a highly ordered arrangement, while in the zzso and zzso zzso is lower because the local fiber architecture is less coherent due to the presence of other fibers and zzso The zzso meaning of the intergroup differences in zzso is discussed in light of the structure and architecture of the tissue under zzso We also consider potential sources of artifacts, such as noise and motion, partial volume contamination, zzso zzso and the use of inappropriate statistical zzso We conclude that the age-related decrease in zzso in the cerebral zzso is not zzso but rather reflects subtle structural changes of the aging white zzso Our study however shows that caution must be exercised in interpreting diffusion zzso zzso
