Women with zzso zzso or Turner syndrome zzso are at increased risk for zzso zzso and zzso To better understand the pathology and develop tools to monitor the risk of zzso disease, we investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in women with zzso and healthy female zzso 

We evaluated zzso levels in women with zzso zzso and healthy female volunteers in relation to ascending zzso diameter and descending zzso diameter measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso 

The zzso levels were strongly and positively correlated with ascending zzso diameter and descending zzso diameter in both zzso The zzso group zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso 12 zzso had greater body surface zzso zzso diameters and higher zzso levels than the control group zzso zzso 27, age zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 35 zzso P zzso zzso Within the zzso group, zzso levels were higher in those with zzso ascending zzso zzso zzso 42, zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with those with normal zzso dimensions zzso zzso 72, zzso zzso 49 zzso P zzso zzso zzso high zzso zzso levels were seen in 3 of 4 zzso women who presented with previously zzso zzso aneurysm and/or zzso 

The zzso levels are positively associated with zzso diameters in women with and without zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso wall zzso Further study is necessary to determine whether zzso measurement may be used to monitor zzso diameter and/or detect zzso pathology in individuals at risk for zzso zzso
