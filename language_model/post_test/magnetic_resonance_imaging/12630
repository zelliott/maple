The purpose of this study was to estimate the zzso acid zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso zzso in the cortical zzso of patients with zzso sclerosis complex zzso using the zzso zzso method and a zzso zzso mode with a short echo time, and to determine which zzso was more dominant between zzso and zzso in patients with zzso with zzso This study included six patients with zzso zzso age, zzso zzso and seven control subjects zzso age, zzso zzso zzso were obtained with a zzso apparatus and zzso was conducted with an zzso The zzso level in the cortical gray matter zzso was calculated as a result of zzso in zzso and from the literature values for gray and white matter ratios for zzso Increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a decreased zzso zzso zzso concentration were observed in the cortical zzso The zzso level, and zzso and zzso ratios were also higher in patients with zzso than in control zzso No significant difference was found in zzso concentration between patients with zzso and control zzso Although the number of patients with zzso in this study was small, the increase in zzso and no significant change in zzso were consistent with previous zzso studies and support the hypothesis that brain zzso plays a key role in the zzso of zzso during the process of zzso zzso
