zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study five healthy human subjects while they performed two zzso visual working memory tasks and one control zzso In the first memory task, the subjects were required to view a sequence of three pattern zzso randomly selected from a familiar set of four zzso and then identify which one of three simultaneously presented stimuli was the one that had not been presented in the previous zzso In the other task, the subjects were required to observe an identical sequence of three randomly selected pattern stimuli and then to respond by selecting those same stimuli in the order zzso In comparison to a baseline control task, increases in signal intensity were observed, zzso in the zzso frontal zzso and in the right zzso frontal zzso in both memory zzso When the two tasks were compared directly, however, the first memory task, which had the higher monitoring requirement, yielded significantly greater signal intensity changes in area zzso of the right zzso frontal zzso These results provide further evidence for the precise functional contribution made by the zzso frontal zzso in visual working memory tasks and zzso closely with findings in nonhuman zzso
