The purpose of this work was to investigate the zzso of zzso zzso in comparison with stable xenon CT for evaluating regional cerebral blood flow zzso 

The zzso was measured by xenon CT and zzso zzso within a 24 h zzso in 10 patients zzso zzso zzso age 63 zzso 10 zzso For zzso zzso absolute values of zzso were calculated based on the indicator dilution theory after injection of zzso zzso of zzso Eight to 10 regions of interest zzso zzso were located in the white and gray matter on the zzso images for each of the 10 zzso 

The mean zzso zzso values of zzso in gray matter were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured by xenon CT and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso In the white matter, the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by xenon CT and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso There was a good correlation of zzso values between zzso zzso and xenon CT zzso correlation zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso to xenon CT, zzso zzso provides relatively high resolution, quantitative local zzso information coupled to MR zzso
