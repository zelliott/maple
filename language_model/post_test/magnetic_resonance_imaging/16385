zzso to cognitive zzso therapy zzso in psychosis may have a neurological zzso This study aimed to determine whether improvement in symptoms following zzso for psychosis zzso in people with schizophrenia is positively associated with zzso zzso matter volume in brain regions involved in cognitive zzso 

Sixty zzso stable on medication with at least one zzso symptom of schizophrenia and willing to receive zzso in addition to their standard care zzso and 25 healthy participants underwent magnetic resonance zzso zzso 30 patients received zzso zzso 25 zzso for zzso months and 30 continued with their standard care zzso 19 zzso zzso in all patients were assessed zzso at entry and zzso 

The zzso and SC groups did not differ clinically at zzso and only the zzso group showed improved symptoms at zzso zzso of baseline symptoms was not associated with zzso zzso Reduction with zzso in positive symptoms was associated with greater right zzso zzso zzso zzso matter volume, in negative symptoms with left zzso zzso and right inferior zzso zzso zzso matter volumes, and in general zzso with greater right superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I) zzso matter zzso Grey matter volume in these brain areas did not correlate with the severity of baseline zzso 

Grey matter volume of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso areas that are known to be involved in the zzso of mental activity, cognitive flexibility, and verbal learning and memory predict responsiveness to zzso in patients with zzso
