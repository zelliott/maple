zzso is the most frequent zzso zzso disease of the zzso The clinical impact of various MR imaging markers has been repeatedly studied in this disorder, but zzso of contrast between gray matter and zzso white matter remain zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the contrast zzso between gray matter and zzso white matter on zzso images in patients with zzso compared with healthy zzso 

zzso between gray matter and zzso white matter was assessed by using zzso analyses of zzso zzso high-resolution MR imaging in 23 patients with zzso at the initial stage of the disease zzso State zzso score zzso 24 and modified Rankin scale score zzso 1; mean age, zzso zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso contrast between gray matter and zzso white matter was significantly reduced in patients compared with zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This reduction was mainly driven by a signal decrease in zzso white zzso zzso loss was strongly related to the volume of white matter zzso 

Conventional zzso zzso imaging shows significant loss of contrast between gray matter and zzso white matter in zzso This probably reflects tissue changes in zzso white matter outside signal abnormalities on zzso or zzso zzso These contrast zzso should be taken into account for image interpretation and zzso
