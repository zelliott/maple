The purpose of the study is to determine if zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso can predict the outcome of zzso surgery in patients with zzso zzso 

Fifty four patients were divided in three groups according to zzso findings: those with a well circumscribed focal zzso clearly separated from the cavernous zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso 24), those with zzso in close contact with the cavernous zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso and those with no identified zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso is found on the predicted side in zzso of the cases with positive zzso A zzso proven zzso is found in 96, 100 and zzso of the cases in groups 1, 2 and 3, with successful outcome in 91, 94 and zzso of the patients zzso In group 2, surgery failed in a patient in whom zzso tissue surrounded the internal carotid artery, but succeeded in two other cases in whom a zzso involvement of the cavernous zzso was zzso 

We confirm the excellent zzso value of zzso Failure due to cavernous zzso involvement can be predicted only when zzso shows that the zzso tissue surrounds the carotid zzso In cases of negative zzso the outcome is less zzso
