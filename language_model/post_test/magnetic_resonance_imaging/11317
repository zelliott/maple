Increased knowledge of the zzso basis behind the signal enhancement in tumors during dynamic zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging may be useful in development of zzso zzso based on this zzso In the present work, the relative signal intensity zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso MR images of patients with cervical zzso was related to tumor zzso vascular density, cell density, and oxygen tension zzso The patients were subjected to MR imaging before the start of treatment (N zzso zzso and after two weeks of zzso (N zzso zzso zzso was determined from the zzso of contrast agent in tumors and zzso vascular density and cell density were determined from tumor zzso and zzso was determined by zzso needle zzso The zzso zzso was correlated to zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell density zzso zzso zzso but was not related to vascular zzso There was also a correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso tended to be correlated to cell density zzso zzso zzso but was not related to vascular zzso There was a significant correlation between zzso and zzso regardless of whether the median zzso zzso zzso zzso or the fraction of zzso readings below zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Our results suggest that the zzso signal enhancement in MR images of cervical tumors is influenced by both zzso and cell zzso These parameters are also of major importance for tumor zzso leading to a correlation between signal enhancement and zzso Dynamic zzso MR imaging may therefore possibly be useful in prediction of treatment zzso
