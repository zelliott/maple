To assess the value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in discriminating between active and inactive juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso patients and to compare physical examination outcomes with zzso outcomes in the assessment of disease status in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso patients with knee involvement were zzso studied using an zzso zzso Imaging findings from 146 zzso patients were zzso zzso zzso mean age, zzso zzso Patients were classified as clinically active or zzso zzso features were evaluated using the zzso system, zzso validated scores for zzso zzso bone zzso zzso cartilage zzso and bone zzso 

zzso reliability was good for all zzso features zzso correlation zzso zzso No differences were found between the two groups regarding zzso scores of bone zzso zzso cartilage zzso or bone zzso zzso zzso scores differed significantly between groups zzso Nonetheless, zzso zzso was also present in 14 zzso patients zzso with clinically inactive zzso Of zzso patients considered clinically active, zzso showed no signs of zzso zzso 

zzso can discriminate between clinically active and inactive zzso zzso However, physical examination is neither very sensitive nor specific in evaluating zzso disease activity compared with zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso of presumed clinically inactive zzso 

zzso zzso is sensitive for evaluating juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso can distinguish clinically active and inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso of presumed clinically inactive zzso zzso Physical examination is neither sensitive nor specific in evaluating zzso disease zzso
