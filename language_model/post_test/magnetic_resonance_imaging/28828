To compare contrast zzso zzso zzso CT with zzso zzso MR imaging for sensitivity in the detection of pancreatic zzso and for accuracy in local tumor zzso 

zzso patients zzso men, 20 women aged zzso zzso suspected of having pancreatic zzso were zzso The final diagnosis was confirmed at surgery to be pancreatic cancer in 31 zzso the other 26 patients were deemed not to have pancreatic zzso All patients underwent both CT and MR imaging zzso zzso and fast zzso zzso zzso Image quality and pancreatic enhancement were zzso zzso All CT scans and MR images were assessed by two independent observers by using a zzso scale for the detection of tumor and of invasion into the zzso zzso portal zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso for CT and MR imaging were zzso 

At visual analysis, pancreatic enhancement at CT and at MR imaging was comparable, but depiction of vessels was superior at zzso zzso zzso of tumor was zzso zzso CT was significantly superior to MR imaging in diagnostic imaging of invasion into the zzso zzso portal zzso and/or zzso artery zzso zzso zzso 

zzso dynamic CT is more sensitive than MR imaging for detection of zzso and vascular invasion in patients with pancreatic zzso
