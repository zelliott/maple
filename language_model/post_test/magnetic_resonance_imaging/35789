A low field zzso nuclear magnetic resonance imaging system zzso zzso was used to study the in zzso changes in the relaxation zzso zzso of the left zzso zzso from the first day to six months after acute zzso zzso in 41 consecutive patients admitted to a coronary care zzso zzso maps were constructed from zzso and zzso images at various times after zzso zzso treatment had been successful in 28 zzso Thirty three of the 34 patients studied within two weeks of zzso had a significantly increased zzso value but this developed only after the third day in zzso At day 1-3 the mean (1 zzso maximum zzso was 413 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with 430 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at day zzso 433 (35) zzso zzso zzso 24) at day zzso zzso zzso at one month zzso zzso zzso 388 zzso zzso zzso zzso at three months, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at six zzso The number of regions of interest with an increased zzso followed a similar time zzso Although the increase in zzso measured at three months correlated with the initial maximum zzso zzso and with the left zzso ejection fraction measured at one month, the number of regions with abnormal zzso from day 4 through to one month correlated best with left zzso ejection zzso There was no significant difference in zzso between patients with or without zzso The rise in zzso over the first few days together with the prolonged time course of zzso increase suggests that the increase in zzso may reflect cellular zzso as much or more than tissue zzso
