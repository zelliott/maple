Children with a history of a prolonged zzso seizure show signs of acute zzso injury on magnetic resonance zzso In addition, animal studies have shown that adult rats who suffered zzso zzso during development reveal memory zzso Together, these lines of evidence suggest that memory zzso related to zzso injury may be evident in human children after prolonged zzso zzso The current study addressed this question by investigating memory abilities in 26 children soon after a prolonged zzso seizure zzso zzso zzso and compared their results to those of 37 normally developing zzso Fifteen patients were zzso at a mean of zzso months after their first assessment to determine the zzso of any observed zzso We used the visual paired comparison task to test memory abilities in our group, as this task does not depend on verbal abilities and also because successful performance on the task has been proven to depend on the presence of functional zzso Our findings show that patients perform as well as controls in the absence of a delay between the learning phase and the memory test, suggesting that both groups are able to form representations of the presented zzso However, after a zzso zzso patients' recognition memory is not different from chance, and comparison of patients and controls points to an accelerated forgetting rate in the prolonged zzso seizure zzso The patients' performance was not related to the time elapsed from the acute event or the duration of the prolonged zzso seizure, suggesting that the observed effect is not a zzso of the seizure itself or a delayed effect of medication administered to terminate the zzso By contrast, performance was related to zzso size; participants with the smallest mean zzso volumes revealed the biggest drop in performance from the immediate to the delayed zzso At zzso children were still showing deficiencies in recognizing a face after a zzso zzso Similarly, this suggests that the observed memory zzso are not a transient effect of the prolonged zzso zzso This is the first report of such zzso in humans, and it is clinically significant given the links between zzso zzso sclerosis and prolonged zzso zzso The persistence of these zzso a year zzso signals the potential benefits of intervention in these children who run the risk of developing episodic memory deficits in later zzso
