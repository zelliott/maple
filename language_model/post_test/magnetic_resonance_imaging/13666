To compare conventional zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging with contrast zzso US for detection of zzso liver tumors in zzso 

Conventional zzso liver US was performed in 65 zzso 38 of which had zzso zzso tumor zzso Twenty minutes after contrast agent injection, zzso zzso harmonic US images of the zzso phase were zzso Following sacrifice of the animals, zzso and zzso MR imaging was performed at zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed as the reference zzso The capability of each imaging zzso to correctly depict tumor presence or absence and the number of tumors was zzso 

Conventional US correctly depicted the presence or absence of tumors in 54 zzso for an accuracy of zzso sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso With zzso zzso accuracy increased to zzso zzso correct zzso sensitivity, to zzso and zzso to zzso MR imaging facilitated 56 correct diagnoses, for an accuracy of zzso sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso There was a marginally significant difference between US with and US without contrast agent zzso zzso but not between MR imaging and zzso US zzso zzso or zzso zzso When the numbers of correctly detected tumors were zzso zzso US performed significantly better than MR imaging zzso zzso and conventional US zzso zzso 

There was no significant difference between zzso US and MR imaging in the detection of zzso tumors, whereas zzso US had the highest accuracy zzso of the three zzso zzso
