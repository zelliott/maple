To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 3 zzso zzso zzso for the assessment of zzso infiltrates in zzso patients with acute zzso zzso 

In a prospective study, 3 zzso zzso was performed in 19 zzso zzso patients (5 women, 14 zzso mean age 61 years zzso zzso range zzso zzso All patients underwent high-resolution CT less than zzso prior to zzso The zzso protocol zzso Tim zzso zzso included a zzso zzso sequence zzso 49 zzso slice thickness zzso and a high-resolution zzso zzso sequence with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slice thickness zzso The zzso sequence was examined before and after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of pulmonary zzso their location within the zzso and zzso type zzso zzso glass zzso zzso were analyzed by one reader and compared to the findings of zzso which was evaluated by a second independent zzso who served as the reference zzso The findings were compared per lobe in each patient and rated as true positive zzso findings if all three characteristics zzso location, and zzso zzso listed above were zzso to zzso 

Pulmonary abnormalities were characterized by 3 zzso zzso with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso resulting in an overall accuracy of zzso zzso zzso In 51 zzso (19 of 19 zzso pulmonary abnormalities zzso by MR were judged to be zzso in their location and in the zzso type identified by both zzso In 22 zzso (11 of 19 zzso no abnormalities were present on either MR or zzso zzso zzso In 6 zzso (5 of 19 zzso ground glass zzso areas were detected on zzso but were not visible on zzso zzso zzso In 11 zzso (7 of 19 zzso zzso failed to detect ground glass zzso areas identified by zzso However, since the abnormalities were zzso in these patients, accurate treatment decisions were possible in every case based on zzso In one case zzso showed a central area of zzso which was not zzso by zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso can be detected in zzso patients with acute zzso leukemia with a sufficient diagnostic accuracy by 3 zzso zzso zzso of ground glass zzso areas is the main limitation of zzso zzso when compared to zzso
