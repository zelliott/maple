zzso of the zzso zzso lobe zzso and zzso zzso zzso are characteristic of various neurodegenerative diseases in older zzso In search of potentially modifiable factors that lead to zzso in these structures, we studied the association of vascular risk factors with zzso of the zzso and zzso in 368 zzso men and women zzso zzso who participated in the Age, zzso zzso zzso A fully automated zzso pipeline estimated volumes of the zzso and zzso from zzso magnetic resonance imaging performed at baseline and zzso years zzso Linear zzso models showed higher zzso and zzso blood pressures and the presence of zzso E zzso were independently associated with increased zzso of the zzso but no association of vascular risk factors with zzso of the zzso The different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso to the vascular risk factors suggests zzso of the zzso is relatively preserved when vascular risk factors are zzso
