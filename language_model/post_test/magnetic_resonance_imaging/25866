zzso stimulation of the motor zzso and cervical spine was performed on 24 patients with cervical zzso zzso documented by zzso zzso motor action zzso zzso were recorded from the biceps and zzso muscles to study the central motor pathways of two different zzso zzso and zzso Central motor zzso was abnormal in all 24 patients for zzso muscles and in 5 patients for biceps zzso In patients with a single zzso level, central motor zzso abnormalities were confined to the zzso zzso to the site of zzso documented by zzso in both zzso and zzso upper limb muscles in the patients with upper zzso zzso and in zzso muscles only in the patients with lower zzso In the patients with zzso zzso central motor zzso time was abnormal for zzso muscles and always normal for the biceps muscle, but its mean value was significantly greater than in the control subjects, suggesting a slight involvement of central motor pathways for zzso upper limb muscles and major damage of the lower cervical zzso zzso to their high degree of sensitivity, central motor zzso studies may be of considerable value in the functional assessment of central motor pathways in cervical zzso zzso
