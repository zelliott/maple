This study examined the feasibility of using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on a clinical zzso magnetic resonance zzso scanner for evaluating zzso changes in zzso bovine and zzso human zzso zzso In bovine discs (N zzso 17), zzso was induced with zzso zzso zzso of human zzso discs (N zzso zzso was assessed using the zzso grading on zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso the zzso head group zzso the zzso region zzso and the zzso and zzso region zzso were zzso using zzso zzso and were compared between specimens with different degrees of zzso The correlation between the zzso findings and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso was zzso zzso differences were found between the ratios zzso zzso acquired before and after zzso injection in bovine zzso For human zzso discs, significant differences in the ratios zzso zzso were found between discs having high and low zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between zzso and zzso content in bovine discs (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso discs (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso correlation between zzso and zzso content was also found in zzso discs (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso This study demonstrates for the first time that zzso PRESS on a clinical zzso MR scanner can be used to zzso and can zzso zzso zzso changes associated with zzso of zzso zzso
