The aim of the present study was to define the optimal zzso method to derive accurate and reliable zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters with zzso zzso 

Nine healthy subjects (5 zzso 4 zzso underwent two zzso PET scans on the same zzso Five zzso methods were used to estimate binding parameters in 10 brain zzso zzso modeling with zzso and zzso compartment models zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso images based on zzso theory zzso analysis, zzso analysis, and the simplified reference tissue model zzso Two variations in the fitting procedure of the zzso method were zzso zzso zzso and basis function zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso or zzso were assessed for 3 outcome zzso distribution volume zzso binding potential zzso and specific to zzso equilibrium partition zzso zzso 

All methods gave similar values across all zzso The zzso of zzso was excellent zzso or zzso in all regions, for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso was good in regions of high zzso density and poorer in regions of moderate and lower zzso The zzso of all 3 outcome measures was excellent in all zzso The basis function zzso of zzso demonstrated improved reliability compared with zzso zzso particularly in moderate and zzso zzso 

The results of this study indicate that zzso can be used to measure zzso parameters with high reliability and low zzso in zzso regions of the brain, with somewhat less reliability and increased zzso in regions of moderate zzso density and poor zzso in zzso zzso
