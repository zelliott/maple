zzso stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso has been reported to be useful for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease zzso Most studies use rest and stress zzso zzso The objectives of this study were to determine zzso et zzso in J zzso zzso Imaging zzso 1) the accuracy of visual assessment and zzso zzso reserve index zzso in the diagnosis of zzso and zzso et zzso in zzso Heart J zzso 2) the accuracy of analysis based on zzso and stress zzso We enrolled patients with suspected zzso and referred them for coronary zzso zzso All the patients underwent zzso stress zzso before zzso zzso and stress zzso images were analyzed by calculation of zzso and visual assessment zzso Visual assessment was performed separately by using rest and stress images and by using only stress zzso zzso was considered the gold zzso zzso zzso and accuracy of both methods were calculated and zzso A total of 66 patients zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso patients zzso were diagnosed with zzso The sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso visual method, and zzso and zzso for stress visual method, zzso zzso zzso had a relatively lower accuracy in patients with left zzso zzso dysfunction, high left zzso mass, or presence of late zzso enhancement than in patients without those zzso zzso Visual assessment of stress image of zzso zzso is accurate and comparable to zzso for the detection of zzso
