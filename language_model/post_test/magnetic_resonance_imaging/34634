The role of conventional CT scan and conventional MR imaging in assessing patients with zzso tumors is now well zzso Because both techniques have an unacceptably low accuracy for identifying the early stages of primary zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and early zzso or zzso or zzso stage A, B1 and 2, and zzso their routine use for zzso staging is not zzso This low staging accuracy is related to the fact that neither method can assess the depth of tumor zzso within the zzso wall and both have difficulty in diagnosing zzso zzso These distinctions are necessary in order to determine correctly patient prognosis and tumor zzso If the various publications on CT scan and MR imaging staging of primary colon tumors are zzso a mean overall accuracy of approximately zzso can be zzso The sensitivity for zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso is only about zzso The sensitivity for detection of positive zzso zzso is better for zzso tumors because any zzso in the zzso area can be considered zzso because benign zzso is not seen in this zzso For the early stages of colon cancer or zzso tumor at the zzso site, zzso ultrasound or zzso is the method of zzso Both zzso and MR imaging with zzso coils can demonstrate the various layers of the zzso wall, but the zzso examination can be performed at lower cost and is less zzso Despite these limitations CT scan and MR imaging are useful for assessing patients suspected of having extensive disease, including invasion of fat or neighboring zzso or zzso spread to distant sites including, liver, zzso zzso and so zzso CT scan and MR imaging are also helpful in the following ways: in determining whether a patient will benefit from zzso radiation or whether a patient with zzso cancer can undergo a zzso zzso for designing radiation ports; and for detecting complications related to the zzso such as zzso with zzso formation or zzso zzso in patients with complete obstruction by zzso In these cases, management often is based on CT scan and MR imaging findings and zzso follow-up studies can establish the success of zzso CT scan and MR imaging have a premier role in the detection of zzso zzso zzso CT scan and MR imaging are superior to zzso for diagnosing zzso zzso tumor zzso and they are the only methods by which patients with total zzso zzso can be fully zzso The overall accuracy of CT scan and MR imaging for detecting zzso zzso tumors ranges from zzso to zzso Following zzso zzso CT scan cannot reliably determine whether a soft tissue density in the surgical bed represents zzso zzso and it is important to obtain CT scan baseline studies 4 months after surgery and to repeat this examination at zzso zzso zzso zzso even if initially zzso shrinks over time and after 1 year should be smaller and its margins more sharply zzso Any apparent increase in size of a mass or any demonstration of zzso must be considered an indication for zzso zzso tumors that do not extend to the pelvis or abdominal zzso or invade bone or nerves can be zzso zzso tumor recurrence or tumor zzso in small zzso can be detected by PET scan and zzso but their future role in the diagnostic imaging of zzso cancer patients depends on the results of ongoing zzso zzso CT scan has the advantages of fast volume scanning associated with optimal zzso delivery, absence of artifacts related to motion, absence of missed zzso and availability of zzso in multiple planes and three-dimensional reconstruction (virtual zzso The role of this technique in patients with zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso zzso
