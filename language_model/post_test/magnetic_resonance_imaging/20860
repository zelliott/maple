zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Berlin, zzso is a zzso zzso zzso contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system as well as liver and zzso and for contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance zzso For risk assessment of the single diagnostic use in humans, the toxicity of this compound was evaluated with a series of zzso zzso 

zzso studies into zzso zzso zzso and zzso toxicity as well as zzso local zzso zzso potential, and zzso were zzso 

In zzso zzso was observed after a single intravenous administration of 20 zzso representing doses at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than the standard single diagnostic dose in humans zzso zzso The no observed adverse effect levels after repeated zzso administrations over the course of 4 weeks exceeded the single diagnostic dose in humans by a factor of 12 in rats and 10 in dogs zzso on the basis of body zzso and no unexpected organ toxicity was zzso The most salient finding of repeated dosing in both rats and dogs was zzso of zzso zzso zzso without zzso effect on kidney function, which represents a well-known finding for this class of zzso zzso was not zzso in rats, zzso and monkeys even when given repeatedly during zzso at maximum dose levels tested, being 25 to 100 times (based on body zzso above the diagnostic dose in zzso No indications of potential zzso contact zzso or zzso effects were zzso In local tolerance testing, zzso was well tolerated after intravenous zzso 

zzso was well tolerated with high safety margins between the single diagnostic dose of zzso zzso in humans and the doses showing effects in animal zzso
