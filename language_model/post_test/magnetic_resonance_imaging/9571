zzso zzso are commonly used to zzso zzso zzso and the resulting complexes are useful as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging zzso Many commercially available zzso are especially useful because they contain functional groups that allow for fast, zzso and high-yielding zzso to zzso and zzso via zzso activated zzso and zzso groups or zzso zzso While zzso of these zzso is considered common knowledge in the field of zzso chemistry, subtle differences in zzso procedures must be taken into account when selecting metal starting zzso Furthermore, multiple options for zzso and characterization exist, and selection of the most effective procedure partially depends on the selection of starting zzso These subtle differences are often neglected in published zzso Here, our goal is to demonstrate common methods for zzso zzso and characterization of zzso complexes that can be used as contrast agents for zzso zzso zzso We expect that this publication will enable biomedical scientists to incorporate zzso zzso reactions into their repertoire of commonly used reactions by easing the selection of starting materials and zzso zzso
