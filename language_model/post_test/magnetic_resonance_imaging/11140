A reduction in cartilage volume is characteristic of zzso and hence there exists a need for an accurate and zzso method to measure in zzso cartilage zzso zzso of cartilage volume from magnetic resonance zzso images requires a zzso technique such as the zzso zzso zzso strategy that can reliably delineate object volumes in a zzso zzso In the present work, the accuracy and zzso of the Live Wire method for the zzso of cartilage volume in MR images is zzso 

The accuracy of the Live Wire method was assessed by comparing the zzso volume measurement of a zzso zzso phantom versus data calculated via water zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the technique was evaluated from Live Wire zzso of the zzso cartilage volume from zzso zzso zzso images of five healthy human volunteers performed by three zzso To provide data for analysis of zzso zzso the human scans were repeated five times with the aid of a zzso zzso to minimize repositioning zzso 

The volume of the zzso zzso phantom measured via Live Wire zzso of MR images was within zzso of its true zzso The average zzso and zzso zzso of variation of three operators were zzso and zzso zzso The average zzso zzso of variation of five repeated scans of each volunteer was zzso 

The data suggest that the Live Wire strategy is an accurate, zzso and efficient technique to measure cartilage volume in zzso in a feasible amount of operator zzso
