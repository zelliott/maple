Previous open trials performed repeated zzso application of the sustained release steroid zzso zzso every third day in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis and described enhanced walking zzso 

The objectives of this study were to demonstrate the efficacy of 5 zzso administrations every other day and to describe their effects on the amount of zzso free zzso in zzso zzso 

Clinical ratings, zzso of maximum walking distance, and execution of an instrumental peg zzso test were performed at baseline and on each day after a zzso injection in 21 patients with progressive multiple zzso zzso of free zzso was assessed in zzso fluid before each zzso application by electron spin resonance zzso 

Scores for multiple sclerosis improved, walking distance increased, and necessary intervals for the peg zzso procedure were zzso The amount of zzso free zzso zzso 

Repeat zzso application improves dysfunction of upper and lower zzso even when administered 5 times only and in series every other zzso The declined potential for free radical synthesis may be caused by the zzso effect of zzso It may contribute to suppress the smoldering, chronic zzso particularly in spinal zzso of patients with progressive multiple zzso The enhanced arm function hypothetically reflects the effect on cervical and brain zzso due to the zzso features of zzso
