To correlate gastric wall layers visible of zzso with the anatomical structure of the gastric zzso 

After zzso preparation 5 zzso 5 zzso zzso tissue sections of the gastric zzso were evaluated using a zzso zzso MR unit zzso zzso zzso MR imaging consisted of zzso zzso sequences in zzso and zzso zzso The specimens then were stained with zzso for zzso zzso After that zzso correlation of the gastric wall layers visible on zzso was zzso 

In all specimens four gastric wall layers could be clearly identified on zzso The direct comparison of those layers to the zzso findings showed the following zzso 1) intermediate signal zzso zzso 2) zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso signal zzso zzso 4) intermediate signal zzso zzso zzso 

zzso wall layers visible on zzso were successfully correlated to the zzso layers of the gastric zzso This allows us for the first time to zzso invasion of gastric zzso using high zzso MR zzso However, the zzso and zzso are excluded from this conclusion, because so far a reliable statement concerning the value of zzso to depict these very variable layers is not zzso
