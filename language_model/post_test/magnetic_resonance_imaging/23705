To assess the long-term effect of the zzso humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso on MR markers of disease activity and progression in secondary progressive zzso zzso 

Twenty-five patients participated in a crossover treatment trial with monthly zzso MR scans for 3 months, followed (after a single pulse of zzso zzso by monthly MR scans from months 1 to 6 and again from months 12 to zzso MR analysis was performed to provide zzso of the number and volume of zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso volume on a zzso zzso In addition, serial zzso of zzso brain zzso volume, brain volume, and spinal zzso zzso area were made over the duration of the zzso The relationship between clinical and MR measures of disease evolution was also zzso 

Treatment was associated with a reduction in the number and volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite this, a decrease in brain volume was seen in 13 patients during the 18 months zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso volume was zzso of subsequent reduction in brain volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Reduction in brain volume also correlated with the change in zzso zzso zzso volume after treatment zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A reduction in spinal zzso area was also seen throughout the study zzso and this correlated with an increase in disability zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso zzso treatment was associated with a sustained and marked reduction in the volume of zzso enhancement, indicating suppression of active zzso Nevertheless, many patients developed increasing brain and spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This study highlights the potential role for novel MR techniques in monitoring the effect of treatment on the zzso process in zzso
