To prove the clinical usefulness of zzso and compare zzso images derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cameras for zzso of partial zzso zzso 

We zzso studied 38 partial zzso patients, using zzso zzso zzso to magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso imaging of the first 15 patients was performed by zzso camera, and the next 23 patients by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluation and zzso images were blindly reviewed and classified as either zzso to one of 16 sites or zzso A third reviewer evaluated cases of disagreement between primary zzso zzso were compared with seizure zzso by any of the following three traditional zzso surgical outcome, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results from the zzso and zzso zzso cameras were zzso 

zzso localized areas of zzso with zzso images more often than with side-by-side zzso evaluation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso When we compared results of zzso evaluation with traditional techniques, zzso showed greater zzso than side-by-side zzso evaluation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There were no differences in zzso between images derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso of seizure zzso compared with traditional techniques, also was not different between these groups zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a worthwhile technique for zzso evaluation in partial zzso patients and improves the sensitivity and specificity of seizure zzso of zzso images derived from both zzso and zzso zzso zzso
