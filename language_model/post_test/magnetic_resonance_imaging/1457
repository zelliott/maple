zzso phase images have been shown to be sensitive to blood flow and have been used to differentiate slow flow from zzso with an apparent advantage in comparison with zzso intensity images zzso In order to zzso the diagnostic efficacy of phase images, a study was performed comparing the sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging in identifying zzso zzso using zzso magnitude images alone and combined with phase zzso In 45 subjects, 66 vessels with questionable zzso signal were reviewed in a blinded manner by four zzso using seven levels of zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso in the zzso abdomen, and pelvis were included in the evaluation and were selected on the basis of the presence of zzso zzso which raised the possibility of zzso zzso zzso studies were available in all zzso zzso zzso were constructed for the accuracy of the decision of zzso zzso vs flow signal when using magnitude images alone and when using magnitude plus phase zzso zzso images identified zzso with a sensitivity of zzso at a specificity of zzso On the other hand, combining magnitude image and phase images yielded sensitivities of zzso and zzso at zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that addition of phase images substantially increases the level of confidence in detecting zzso zzso
