To improve the performance of zzso separation and reduce the sensitivity to zzso variation in balanced zzso zzso 

zzso the repetition time zzso reduces zzso artifacts in zzso zzso A shorter zzso may also improve the spectral selectivity obtained when zzso combining data acquired using different zzso phase cycling zzso The desired short zzso is achieved by using an zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso acquisition sequence that achieves a near zero echo time zzso and also a short zzso 

Images from human volunteers demonstrate broad coverage of the cervical spine and knee with zzso zzso Excellent zzso separation is achieved in these zzso 

The short zzso capability of the proposed sequence greatly improves the fat suppression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso with reduced zzso artifacts can be obtained from a single acquisition using this zzso
