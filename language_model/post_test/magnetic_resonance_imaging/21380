To investigate the changes of dynamic zzso MR imaging zzso parameters at zzso in cervical cancer patients before and after concurrent zzso zzso and to correlate the parameters with final zzso response to zzso 

Thirty-five patients with cervical cancer underwent zzso before zzso zzso after starting therapy and at zzso after the end of zzso zzso parameters were calculated in the zzso and normal zzso zzso Final response to treatment as determined by changes in zzso size and volume was correlated with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso parameters zzso K zzso v zzso and k zzso in the zzso showed significant changes in response to zzso zzso and in particular K zzso and v zzso demonstrated early significant increase zzso but those in normal muscle did not show a significant difference zzso Before therapy, the mean values of K zzso k zzso v zzso and v zzso in the zzso were significantly greater than those in muscle zzso zzso parameters of the zzso at zzso were not statistically associated with final zzso size or volume zzso 

zzso parameters may help evaluate early changes of cervical cancer to zzso but larger, more definitive studies are zzso 

zzso zzso offers new insights into zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso size lag behind zzso which improve quickly in zzso zzso zzso is a zzso imaging technique that can characterize zzso zzso zzso zzso of cervical cancer may be useful in monitoring changes with zzso
