The zzso zzso is both a strong zzso predictor and a diagnostic hallmark of zzso and therefore has major clinical zzso Here, we developed a new technique to detect the zzso zzso in the plasma of patients with zzso 

zzso DNA zzso base zzso was extracted from the plasma of 31 controls and 80 patients with zzso with known zzso status and correlated with zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected by a combination of zzso at lower zzso temperature and digital zzso 

The small size DNA concentration was zzso zzso zzso zzso in controls vs zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso not zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso vs zzso zzso in high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso The small size DNA concentration correlated with enhancing tumor volume zzso zzso zzso when zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso when zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected in 15 out of 25 plasma DNA zzso zzso from patients with zzso tumors and in none of the 14 patients with a zzso zzso The sensitivity increased with enhancing tumor volume zzso in zzso tumors, zzso for enhancing volume zzso zzso and zzso for enhancing volume zzso zzso 

With a specificity of zzso and a sensitivity related to the tumor volume and contrast enhancement, zzso identification has a valuable diagnostic accuracy in patients not amenable to zzso
