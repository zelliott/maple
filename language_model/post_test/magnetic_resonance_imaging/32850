To test new diagnostic criteria for the discrimination of early zzso zzso zzso from benign zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso 34 patients with 29 surgically diagnosed early zzso and 31 surgically diagnosed benign zzso zzso Two zzso reviewed zzso including zzso imaging zzso and the signal intensity at each zzso presence of zzso enhancement and zzso were zzso We composed new diagnostic criteria based on the zzso size and zzso findings, and then the diagnostic performance was compared with that of conventional imaging criteria with zzso zzso and a zzso zzso equation zzso 

A size zzso value zzso zzso zzso and zzso findings of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on both low and high zzso images zzso and 800 s zzso respectively), zzso enhancement, late zzso and zzso zzso were selected as the diagnostic zzso When zzso were considered zzso if they satisfied three or more of the above criteria, the sensitivity was significantly higher than when making a diagnosis based on zzso enhancement and zzso alone zzso vs zzso zzso zzso while the specificity was zzso for both zzso 

Our new diagnostic criteria on zzso may help to improve the discrimination of early zzso from benign zzso zzso
