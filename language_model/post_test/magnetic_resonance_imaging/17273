zzso to the zzso aspects of the deep digital zzso zzso zzso is an important cause of zzso in zzso The purpose of this study was to review the magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of 18 horses affected by zzso injuries in the zzso The zzso was performed with the horses standing using an open zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results were compared with those previously reported for horses using zzso zzso zzso of 84 horses zzso with zzso zzso pain were found to have zzso affecting the zzso The history, clinical findings and results of zzso diagnostic zzso and nuclear zzso of these horses were zzso The duration of zzso ranged from 1 to 12 months, and the severity varied from zzso to zzso Fifteen horses had unilateral zzso zzso fore in nine, left fore in zzso whereas three horses were zzso zzso zzso zzso changes, considered of zzso significance, were found in six of 18 zzso zzso changes involving the zzso were identified in only one of nine zzso zzso zzso were detected in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Four different types of zzso were zzso core zzso zzso zzso zzso border zzso and zzso zzso zzso of different zzso types within the same horse were zzso The types and locations of the zzso zzso were similar to those previously reported using zzso zzso The use of zzso standing zzso avoids the necessity for general zzso and access to conventional zzso zzso zzso However, studies comparing the results of standing zzso zzso with zzso zzso (and other imaging zzso are required before the sensitivity and specificity of the technique can be zzso
