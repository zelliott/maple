This study aimed to investigate zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the assessment of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso images as a possible method for visualizing the zzso origin of zzso sudden cardiac zzso 

zzso cardiac death has challenged clinical and forensic zzso for decades because zzso on zzso autopsy is not zzso zzso as an zzso examination technique has been shown zzso different stages of zzso zzso 

In 136 human forensic zzso a zzso cardiac MR examination was carried out prior to forensic zzso zzso and horizontal zzso images were acquired in zzso on a zzso zzso 

In 76 cases, zzso findings could be documented and correlated to the autopsy zzso Within these 76 study cases, a total of 124 zzso zzso were detected on zzso zzso 25; zzso 16; zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and acute zzso cases correlated zzso to the zzso findings on zzso zzso zzso (age zzso minutes to approximately 1 zzso were not visible on zzso autopsy or zzso zzso zzso zzso areas detected on zzso could be verified in targeted zzso investigations in zzso of cases and could be related to a matching coronary finding in zzso A total of zzso of zzso zzso on zzso lacked a matching coronary finding but presented with severe zzso zzso or cocaine intoxication zzso a cardiac death without verifiable coronary zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and acute zzso zzso in zzso In zzso zzso as a possible cause of sudden cardiac death, it demonstrates affected zzso areas not visible on zzso zzso should be considered as a feasible zzso investigation technique for the deceased patient if no consent for a clinical autopsy is zzso
