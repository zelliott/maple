The purposes of this study were to extend the investigation of age-related increases in brain iron to a younger age group, replicate previously published results, and further evaluate the zzso of a novel zzso magnetic resonance zzso method for measuring tissue iron zzso levels with zzso The method consists of measuring the dependence of tissue zzso relaxation rates zzso on the field strength of MR zzso Two MR instruments operating at zzso and zzso T were used to measure the zzso zzso increase zzso in the frontal white matter, zzso zzso and zzso zzso A group of 13 normal adult males zzso zzso with seven subjects below and six above age 35, was zzso As expected from zzso and prior zzso data, robust and significant age-related increases in zzso were observed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso increasing sharply in the second decade and reaching a plateau after age zzso In addition, we zzso previous reports showing very high correlations between zzso and published brain iron levels for the four regions zzso The data replicate and extend previous zzso observations on brain aging and are consistent with zzso data on age-related increases in brain zzso These results are relevant to the investigation of age-related neurodegenerative diseases in which iron may catalyze toxic free radical zzso
