To evaluate the spectrum of magnetic resonance zzso imaging appearances of the liver in primary zzso zzso zzso and to examine their correlation with clinical stage of zzso 

zzso patients zzso female, 27 zzso mean age, 43 years; age range, zzso zzso with zzso underwent zzso and zzso MR zzso Two abdominal zzso zzso reviewed all images zzso and then in zzso for the imaging pattern of the liver zzso presence and grade of zzso zzso zzso zzso and presence of areas of zzso zzso or abnormal signal intensity and/or zzso zzso Imaging findings were correlated with Child class, zzso score, and Mayo zzso liver disease zzso zzso zzso analyses zzso scoring for zzso agreement, zzso test, zzso U test, multiple zzso analysis, zzso zzso were zzso 

Of 52 patients, seven zzso had no imaging findings of zzso 17 zzso had a diffuse pattern of zzso and 28 zzso had a large zzso pattern (with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in 44 zzso patients and was general in 18 zzso and zzso in 26 zzso zzso zzso areas of zzso were observed with zzso in 23 zzso and 25 zzso patients by the two readers zzso zzso zzso and without zzso in 18 zzso patients by both readers zzso zzso zzso No correlation was found between imaging findings and clinical scores zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso P zzso zzso U zzso zzso correlation zzso between zzso and zzso 

The spectrum of MR imaging appearances of zzso is diverse and comprises distinct patterns that do not appear to correlate with severity of zzso Large zzso zzso are a frequent finding and may help to establish the zzso
