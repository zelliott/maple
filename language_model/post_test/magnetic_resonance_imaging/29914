The aim of our study was to compare zzso and zzso dynamic zzso images with zzso findings in assessing the depth of zzso invasion by zzso zzso in zzso 

We zzso reviewed the zzso of 11 patients who had a total of 12 zzso of zzso zzso within zzso zzso and zzso dynamic zzso images were compared with the zzso findings zzso We assessed the extent of zzso invasion by zzso zzso The depth of zzso invasion seen on zzso was classified as stage S zzso zzso stage D zzso zzso or zzso The staging zzso of each sequence were zzso The zzso zzso ratios were calculated for each zzso 

The zzso specimens revealed that zzso invasion was deep in seven of 12 zzso and superficial in zzso On zzso images the depth of invasion was underestimated in two zzso and impossible to determine in five zzso On dynamic zzso images the depth of invasion was overestimated in one zzso and underestimated in one zzso The staging accuracy on dynamic zzso images zzso was significantly higher than that on zzso images zzso The zzso ratio was significantly higher on dynamic zzso studies during the early phase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than it was on zzso studies zzso zzso zzso and during the delayed phase zzso zzso zzso 

When zzso coexists with zzso cancer at the same site on zzso images, zzso dynamic zzso imaging improves the accuracy of zzso
