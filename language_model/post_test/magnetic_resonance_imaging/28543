We evaluated the usefulness of dynamic zzso zzso MR imaging in the differential diagnosis of complications after zzso transplantation in 17 patients (10 from living relatives and 7 from zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamic images were obtained every 5 zzso for 5 zzso after an intravenous zzso injection of zzso zzso differentiation zzso on spin echo zzso zzso images and MR zzso patterns of the zzso zzso and zzso were obtained for quantitative analysis of the zzso dynamic zzso zzso The signal intensity ratio of the zzso to zzso after zzso enhancement was compared among four groups: normal zzso zzso zzso acute zzso necrosis zzso or zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acute rejection zzso in the living related donor kidney zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso Although loss of zzso was seen in severe zzso dysfunction in the transplanted zzso there was considerable overlap among the four zzso On dynamic study, there was significant differences in the signal intensity ratio of the zzso to zzso between normally functioning zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In patients with severe zzso dysfunction, the zzso cortical peak was zzso In conclusion, MR zzso obtained from dynamic zzso zzso MR imaging played a significant role in evaluating dysfunction of the zzso zzso
