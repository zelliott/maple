zzso resonance imaging markers of zzso cognitive decline among healthy elderly individuals have become important for both clarifying the biological zzso of zzso and clinically identifying healthy individuals at high risk of cognitive zzso Even though the role of zzso zzso is well known in the later stages of decline, the ability of zzso markers to predict the earliest clinical deterioration is less zzso 

To examine the involvement of the zzso circuit in the very earliest stages of cognitive impairment and to determine whether the volumes of zzso white matter and zzso gray matter would be useful markers for understanding the onset of zzso and for clinical zzso 

A zzso cohort of cognitively normal elderly participants received clinical evaluations with zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso scans during repeated visits over an average of 4 zzso zzso and Cox zzso hazards models were used to analyze the relationships between zzso and zzso measures and their zzso power for zzso and time of conversion from normal to impaired zzso 

A cohort of zzso elderly individuals at the zzso Disease Center of the University of California, zzso 

A total of 102 cognitively normal elderly participants, with an average age of 73 years, recruited through community outreach using methods designed to enhance ethnic zzso 

Our preliminary hypothesis was that zzso white matter volume should be a significant predictor of cognitive decline among normal elderly individuals and that zzso measures would be associated with gray matter changes in the zzso 

zzso body volume and zzso zzso were highly significant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cognitive decline from normal zzso zzso volume was not significant as a predictor of decline but was significantly associated with zzso volume and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This could be among the first studies establishing zzso zzso as a predictor of zzso cognitive decline among healthy elderly zzso zzso zzso volume reductions might be explained at least in part by clinically silent zzso zzso The importance of this finding is that white matter tract measures may become promising candidate zzso for identifying zzso cognitive decline in a clinical setting, possibly more so than traditional gray matter zzso
