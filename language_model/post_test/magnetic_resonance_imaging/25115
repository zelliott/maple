zzso of the study was to assess the value of zzso using zzso zzso in the evaluation of tumor response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated for 9 patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed before, during and after chemotherapy, and zzso zzso was scored visually and zzso to evaluate tumor zzso 

In the case of complete response zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso decreased 8 days after beginning zzso chemotherapy and zzso in the following zzso zzso zzso decreased more slowly in patients with partial response zzso zzso zzso who showed clear, zzso zzso zzso after zzso The patients without response zzso zzso 3) showed a zzso high tumor activity even after chemotherapy was zzso 

The preliminary data suggest that in contrast to other imaging zzso zzso appears to yield early information regarding tumor response to zzso zzso
