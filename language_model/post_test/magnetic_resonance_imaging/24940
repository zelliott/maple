A large number of studies suggest the presence of deficits in zzso prefrontal zzso function during performance of working memory tasks in individuals with zzso However, working memory deficits may also present in other psychiatric disorders, such as major zzso It is not clear whether people with major depression also demonstrate impaired prefrontal zzso during performance of working memory zzso 

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the patterns of cortical zzso associated with the performance of a zzso version of the zzso task zzso zzso in 38 individuals with schizophrenia and 14 with major zzso 

We found significant group differences in the zzso of zzso prefrontal zzso associated with working memory zzso zzso with prior research, participants with schizophrenia failed to show zzso of right zzso prefrontal zzso in response to working memory tasks demands, whereas those with major depression showed clear zzso of right and left zzso prefrontal zzso as well as bilateral zzso of inferior and superior frontal zzso 

During performance of working memory tasks, deficits in prefrontal zzso including zzso regions, are more severe in participants with schizophrenia (most of whom were recently released zzso than in zzso zzso with acute zzso major zzso
