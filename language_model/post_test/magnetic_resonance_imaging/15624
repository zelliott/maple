To study the value of early (24 zzso zzso zzso and serum cortisol as zzso of zzso after zzso surgery in zzso zzso 

We zzso studied 44 patients who underwent zzso surgery for zzso disease between 1997 and zzso The mean follow-up period of patients after surgery was 49 months zzso zzso The zzso value of clinical zzso zzso hormonal studies, zzso surgical and zzso findings, and zzso hormonal studies were zzso For the zzso hormonal study plasma zzso and serum cortisol were determined at zzso zzso the day after zzso 

After surgery, zzso disease zzso in 39 patients zzso and persisted in 5 patients zzso Three patients relapsed during the follow-up zzso Only three study variables were zzso of persistence of zzso disease after zzso the non identification of the zzso in zzso (an zzso was found in zzso of the patients in zzso and in zzso of treatment failures, p zzso zzso the early zzso plasma zzso zzso in zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the early zzso serum cortisol zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that plasma zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso distinguished patients in zzso from treatment failures with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso and serum cortisol zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso hours after zzso surgery for zzso disease, and without zzso replacement, patients with serum cortisol zzso higher than zzso zzso and/or plasma zzso higher than zzso zzso and/or those in which an zzso is not identified in the zzso study, have a high risk of treatment zzso
