Recently, zzso procedures of brain zzso have been enriched by an optical zzso system, enabling us to assess the zzso location and size by means of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The aim of the study was to check which areas of brain zzso would be most useful in zzso diagnosis of the material taken during zzso zzso We also zzso whether the zzso processed in the zzso zzso system would be reliable in determination of a safety margin of zzso zzso 

zzso from the zzso biopsy has been examined zzso by means of the zzso Station navigation zzso zzso specimens were taken from the zzso of zzso its intermediate area, edge of the zzso and the nearest vicinity of zzso 2-3 specimens in each area of the zzso were zzso The material was fixed in zzso zzso and embedded in zzso and then stained with zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso II were diagnosed in 17 cases, including zzso zzso in 13 cases and zzso zzso in 2 zzso In other cases zzso zzso were zzso In 6 cases zzso zzso and in 16 cases zzso zzso were zzso In 3 cases the degree of zzso was not possible to be zzso In 2 cases the zzso was not zzso zzso of the method was zzso and its zzso was zzso The best results were achieved zzso the material from the intermediate area of zzso There was the lowest number of zzso zzso diagnostic results in this zzso A few positive results were found in the central area and a high number of results zzso zzso could be defined as zzso assuming the specimens with no zzso zzso In more than zzso of zzso from the edge of the zzso zzso was not found, while in more than zzso of zzso from the nearest vicinity of the zzso zzso cells were zzso 

Intermediate zone of brain zzso located between its central parts and the zzso edge appears to be the most appropriate zzso area for diagnostic zzso biopsy assisted by the optical zzso zzso Because of zzso character of brain zzso as well as their real dislocation during surgical procedure compared to the position based on the earlier zzso the territories considered in the optical zzso system as the vicinity or zzso edge, run a risk of zzso zzso in this zzso
