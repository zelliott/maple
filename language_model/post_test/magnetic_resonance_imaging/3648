In this study, we sought to characterize zzso zzso changes mimicking zzso which we refer to as zzso zzso zzso in children with brain zzso We analyzed whether SP is associated with particular tumor types or therapeutic zzso Between 2000 and 2009, we identified 181 consecutive children zzso years of age at our center who were treated for brain tumors and had at least three zzso scans within a year after completing zzso SP was defined as zzso abnormalities characterized by increase in size, enhancement, zzso or zzso changes within 12 months following therapy, and stabilization or improvement on subsequent zzso zzso zzso patients with brain tumors were zzso zzso zzso had imaging abnormalities initially suggestive of disease zzso of these, 34 zzso had true disease progression zzso The remaining 22 zzso had SP based on either stability, decrease in enhancement, zzso size, or disappearance of these zzso or zzso zzso SP occurred in patients with low grade zzso zzso zzso and high grade zzso zzso zzso zzso Median time to SP was zzso months zzso zzso zzso with time to stability, decrease, or disappearance at a median of 4 months zzso zzso zzso Five patients were clinically symptomatic from SP and were treated with steroids, zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso SP occurs more commonly in children with low grade tumors, but can also occur with high grade brain tumors, regardless of therapeutic zzso
