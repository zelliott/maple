zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso mapping zzso such as zzso time and partition zzso zzso have shown potential to assess diffuse zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate how scanner and field strength variation affect the accuracy and zzso of zzso mapping zzso 

zzso studies were performed on two zzso and three zzso zzso Eight zzso were made to mimic the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and blood at zzso and zzso zzso mapping using zzso was performed with simulated heart rate of zzso zzso recovery spin echo zzso was the reference standard for zzso zzso zzso was defined as the percent error between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso was defined as the relative percent mean difference between repeat zzso zzso Partition zzso was estimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso linear mixed model was used to compare the accuracy and zzso of zzso and zzso across field strength, zzso and zzso 

Field strength significantly affected zzso zzso accuracy zzso error for zzso zzso zzso error for zzso zzso but not zzso accuracy zzso error for zzso zzso zzso error for zzso zzso Partition zzso of zzso were not different between two zzso scanners zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed only slight variation across three zzso scanners zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Partition zzso also had significantly lower percent error for precision zzso zzso zzso than measurement of individual zzso values zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso values, zzso for zzso blood and zzso zzso 

Based on phantom studies, zzso errors using zzso ranged from zzso across various MR scanners while errors for partition zzso were less zzso Compared with absolute zzso times, partition zzso showed less zzso across platforms and field strengths as well as higher zzso
