The acquisition of definitive evidence for systematic zzso zzso in the size of the zzso zzso zzso has been restricted by difficulties in zzso zzso and measuring the region of zzso In this paper an operational definition for identifying the problematic zzso border of the zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans is zzso An interactive zzso program was used to identify and label the zzso simultaneously in zzso zzso and zzso planes in zzso scans, transformed into the standardized zzso zzso space, from 50 normal right-handed zzso Both zzso matter volume and cortical surface area of the zzso were measured, while controlling for individual variation in overall brain shape and zzso The labeled tissue was averaged together to produce a probability map in standardized space of the region of zzso The zzso region is highly zzso with no single zzso being labeled with a probability of zzso In this study there were no significant zzso differences in volume or area of the zzso An asymmetry in area and volume was introduced by using an alternative method - the zzso method - for identifying the zzso zzso zzso for functional zzso of the zzso are zzso
