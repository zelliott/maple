General zzso is known to promote zzso zzso High zzso pressures are required to zzso healthy but collapsed zzso However, in the absence of positive zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso collapse zzso Using magnetic resonance imaging, the impact of an zzso recruitment strategy on the amount and distribution of zzso was zzso 

The authors zzso zzso 24 children who met American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II criteria, were aged 6 zzso zzso and were undergoing zzso magnetic resonance imaging into three zzso After zzso zzso in the zzso recruitment strategy zzso group, an zzso recruitment maneuver was performed by manually zzso the lungs with a peak airway pressure of 40 zzso zzso and a zzso of 15 zzso zzso for 10 zzso zzso was then reduced to and kept at 5 zzso zzso The continuous positive airway pressure zzso group received 5 zzso zzso of continuous positive airway pressure without zzso The zero zzso pressure zzso group received neither zzso nor the recruitment zzso All patients zzso spontaneously during the zzso After zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso magnetic resonance imaging was zzso 

The zzso volume zzso first and third standard zzso detected in the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso in the right lung and zzso zzso zzso in the left zzso The zzso group had zzso zzso zzso of collapsed lung tissue in the right lung and zzso zzso zzso in the left zzso Only one patient in the zzso group presented an zzso of less than 2 zzso An uneven distribution of the zzso was observed within each lung and between the right and left zzso with a clear predominance of the left zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso was much less following the zzso recruitment strategy, compared with children who did not have the maneuver zzso The mere application of 5 zzso zzso of zzso without a prior recruitment did not show the same treatment effect and showed no difference compared to the control group without zzso
