In a previous retrospective zzso study, zzso was associated with the development of pancreatic zzso The aim of the present study was to determine in a cohort study whether zzso is a marker for both organ failure and zzso zzso A cohort study was performed on patients admitted with acute zzso from February 1996 to April zzso zzso necrosis was defined by findings on dynamic zzso zzso zzso scan or magnetic resonance zzso Of 128 total patients with acute zzso 53 underwent zzso zzso or magnetic resonance zzso zzso of 53 had zzso zzso zzso zzso identified an admission zzso zzso or zzso zzso and a failure of admission zzso to decrease at 24 hours as the best zzso zzso of zzso zzso and organ zzso By 24 hours, 17 of 18 patients with zzso zzso versus 11 of 35 with zzso zzso met one or the other criterion for necrosis zzso zzso zzso By 24 hours, 13 of 15 with organ failure versus 36 of 104 without organ failure met one or the other criterion zzso zzso zzso The negative zzso value by 24 hours was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for organ zzso zzso with an admission zzso zzso or zzso zzso and/or failure of admission zzso to decrease at approximately 24 hours was associated with the development of zzso zzso and organ zzso Patients who did not experience zzso were very unlikely to develop pancreatic necrosis or organ zzso
