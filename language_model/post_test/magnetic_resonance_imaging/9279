There is no consensus regarding the fundamental phonetic units that zzso speech zzso There is, however, general agreement that the frequency of occurrence of these units is a significant zzso Investigators often use the effects of manipulating frequency to support the importance of particular zzso Studies of zzso production have been used to show the importance of zzso units, such as initial zzso zzso and zzso However, it is not clear that these units play the same role when the production of zzso is compared to the production of real zzso In this study, participants overtly repeated real and zzso that were similar for zzso complexity, and initial syllable frequency while undergoing functional magnetic resonance zzso Compared to real words, production of zzso produced greater zzso in much of the speech production network, including bilateral inferior frontal cortex, zzso zzso and supplementary motor areas and left superior zzso zzso and anterior zzso Only middle right frontal zzso showed greater zzso for real words than for zzso Compared to a zzso control condition, production of zzso or real words resulted in zzso of all of the areas shown to comprise the speech production zzso Our data, in conjunction with previous studies, suggest that the unit that is identified as the basic unit of speech production is influenced by the nature of the speech that is being zzso zzso real words as compared to other real words, zzso as compared to other zzso or real words as compared to zzso
