Renal zzso pain, and zzso are common presentations of zzso dominant zzso kidney disease zzso in zzso Renal function, however, is typically preserved in these patients despite increased zzso zzso Since zzso has been implicated in promotion of zzso zzso growth in zzso we measured the serum level of various zzso factors and early zzso structural changes and cardiovascular parameters in 71 patients with zzso with a mean age of 16 zzso Renal structure and left zzso mass index were measured by magnetic resonance imaging or by zzso Renal function was assessed by zzso clearance and urinary protein zzso zzso growth factor levels were measured by zzso zzso zzso Because of skewed zzso the various parameters are reported as zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor was positively correlated with zzso and cardiac structure, but zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 levels significantly correlated with structural change in both the kidney and the heart and with urinary zzso Thus, the correlation between zzso growth factors with both zzso and cardiac disease severity is compatible with a possible role for zzso in the early progression of disease in zzso
