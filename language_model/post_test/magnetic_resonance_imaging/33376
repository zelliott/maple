zzso zzso is an uncommon manifestation of zzso We describe a case investigated by both brain magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso using zzso 

Three months after a pure motor stroke, a 65-year-old man developed a right arm and leg zzso The zzso was of large zzso intermittent at zzso its frequency was 5 to 6 zzso Neither rigidity nor zzso was zzso and administration of L-dopa was zzso Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed an zzso zzso in the left zzso zzso and a left zzso zzso zzso We suspected that the resting unilateral zzso was related to this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso in the left zzso zzso 

This case suggests that unilateral zzso may be related to a zzso stroke in the zzso nucleus and may be accompanied by an increased zzso metabolism in the zzso zzso zzso
