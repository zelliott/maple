zzso high fields zzso permit unprecedented explorations of functional organizations and insight into basic zzso zzso zzso in the signal and contrast to noise ratios have allowed increases in the spatial resolution of zzso weighted zzso echo zzso echo zzso imaging zzso Furthermore, while the use of zzso weighted imaging methods at zzso zzso spin echo zzso zzso zzso and spin echo zzso zzso can also permit higher resolution images, they in addition allow for increased spatial specificity of functional responses, permitting the zzso study of functional organizations down to the zzso level of the zzso The study of the visual zzso has, thus far, zzso the most from higher resolution zzso weighted studies as achieving the required transmit zzso magnitude at zzso is more challenging in other brain regions, such as the auditory zzso As such, auditory zzso studies at zzso have been limited to zzso weighted GE zzso Recent advances in zzso zzso transmission zzso zzso zzso have enabled procedures to efficiently address deficiencies in transmit zzso zzso However, these techniques, shown to be advantageous in anatomical imaging at zzso are not generally zzso to facilitate zzso weighted zzso zzso Here we investigate the feasibility of applying zzso zzso to achieve efficient zzso transmission in the human auditory zzso We demonstrate that, with zzso zzso functional responses to simple tones and to complex sounds zzso voices, speech, animal cries, tools and zzso can be efficiently measured with zzso weighted zzso in the bilateral human auditory zzso at zzso without exceeding specific zzso rate zzso zzso
