The purpose of the study was to identify structural brain differences in school-age children with residual speech sound zzso zzso based zzso was used to compare gray and white matter volumes for 23 children with speech sound zzso ages zzso and 54 typically speaking children matched on age, oral language, and zzso We hypothesized that regions associated with production and perception of speech sounds would differ between zzso zzso indicated greater gray matter volumes for the speech sound error group relative to typically speaking controls in bilateral superior zzso zzso There was greater white matter volume in the corpus zzso for the speech sound error group, but less white matter volume in right lateral zzso zzso zzso may indicate delays in zzso pruning in critical speech regions or differences in the development of networks for speech perception and zzso
