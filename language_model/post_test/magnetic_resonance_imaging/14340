zzso resonance zzso zzso with zzso coupled implanted coils has been used previously to follow loss and return of zzso contrast as a result of zzso acute zzso necrosis with 117 zzso resolution over a 2000 zzso thick zzso The purpose of the current study was to further investigate the capabilities of in zzso MR zzso by combining the implanted zzso imaging technique with spin echo pulse sequence zzso done through zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso These models included consideration of the effects of zzso and sampling time on zzso and zzso zzso They were initially tested with zzso and zzso gel zzso constructed to the relaxation time and spin density specifications of the zzso junction which bridges the outer and inner stripe of the outer zzso In zzso zzso was performed using single turn zzso zzso coils that were surgically implanted around the left kidney of two rats and zzso coupled to an external zzso body zzso The models revealed maximum zzso per unit imaging time at a zzso of 800 zzso A TE of 16 zzso proved to be the best compromise between loss of zzso zzso and decreased zzso These zzso predictions were supported by the gel phantom and in zzso zzso zzso the zzso in the current study enabled us to improve the resolution of in zzso MR zzso to 78 zzso over a 1000 zzso slice with an zzso of 40 and a zzso of eight in a total imaging time of 54 zzso
