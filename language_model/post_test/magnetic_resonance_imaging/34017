The aim of this study was to determine suitable image parameters and an zzso method for zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a means of measuring cerebral blood flow zzso This was done by constructing an experimental model and applying the results to a clinical zzso The experimental model was constructed from the zzso of a bull and circulating zzso zzso The image parameters of zzso zzso time, flip angle, zzso zzso rate zzso and the use of square zzso were studied with percent flow volume (the ratio of actual flow volume to measured flow zzso The most suitable image parameters for accurate blood flow measurement were as zzso repetition time, 50 zzso flip angle, 20 zzso and a 512 zzso 256 zzso without square zzso Furthermore, zzso rate zzso should be set ranging from the maximum flow zzso in the vessel to five times this zzso The correction in measuring blood flow was done with the intensity of the region of interest established in the zzso With these parameters for zzso percent flow volume was greater than zzso Using the image parameters for zzso and the zzso method described above, we evaluated cerebral blood flow volume in 12 patients with zzso disease of the major cervical zzso The results were compared with conventional xenon zzso zzso The values found with both methods showed good zzso Thus, we concluded that zzso was a zzso method for evaluating cerebral blood flow in patients with zzso disease of the major cervical zzso
