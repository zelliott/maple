zzso direct current stimulation zzso is a zzso brain stimulation technique that has been shown to alter cortical zzso and activity via application of weak direct zzso Beyond zzso effects, functional imaging as well as behavioral studies are suggesting additional zzso zzso of zzso areas, however, direct evidence for such effects is zzso We aimed to investigate the impact of zzso on zzso functional networks by seed functional connectivity analysis of different zzso and zzso regions to prove zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resting state data sets were acquired immediately before and after 10 zzso of bipolar zzso during rest, with the zzso placed over the left primary motor zzso zzso and the zzso over the zzso zzso zzso To control for possible zzso effects, an additional sham stimulation session was carried zzso zzso zzso between the left zzso and the zzso primary motor zzso zzso significantly increased following zzso stimulation over zzso Additionally, functional connectivity between the left zzso nucleus and zzso association zzso was significantly zzso In contrast, zzso zzso over zzso decreased functional zzso between left zzso and zzso zzso In zzso in this study, we show for the first time that zzso zzso functional connectivity of zzso and zzso zzso Here we highlight that zzso zzso over zzso is capable of modulating elements of the zzso functional motor zzso
