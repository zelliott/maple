To find magnetic resonance zzso findings predicting cement leakage in patients receiving zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso zzso 

MR was done in 43 patients (age zzso zzso before zzso zzso zzso which was done via a zzso approach with zzso zzso Shortly after the zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso scan was done at the zzso sites for evaluation of bone cement zzso The following MR findings of fractured zzso bodies were zzso reviewed for correlation with leakage risk: severity of bone-marrow zzso presence of a zzso zzso line, percentage residual zzso body zzso presence of either a vacuum or zzso change within the zzso body, and presence of a cortical zzso 

After zzso cement leakage was detected in 35 zzso zzso Leakage was most frequently observed in the anterior external zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leakage rate increased when there was a cortical disruption zzso zzso zzso especially at the zzso while it decreased when there was a vacuum or a zzso change within the fractured vertebra zzso zzso zzso Other MR findings were not related to the risk of cement zzso 

The risk of cement leakage in zzso increases when MR shows cortical disruption in a fractured zzso body, especially at the zzso It decreases when MR shows a vacuum or zzso change within the zzso
