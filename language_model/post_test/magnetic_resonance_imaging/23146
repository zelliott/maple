zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso patients are thought to be particularly vulnerable to convert to clinical zzso where functional zzso is a major feature of the cortical zzso However, the presence and extent of zzso connectivity disturbances is largely unknown in zzso zzso Twenty-six zzso patients and zzso matched healthy subjects were evaluated at baseline and at mean 20 months follow zzso zzso correlations between zzso distinct regions were evaluated by using zzso zzso zzso Compared to normal aging controls, patterns of abnormal zzso correlations in widely dispersed brain areas were identified in the patients, which also changed with disease zzso These disturbances were found particularly in zzso regions and frontal zzso zzso significantly decreased negative functional connection may be specifically associated with the development of zzso zzso This suggests a zzso mechanism is zzso where local processing deficits are offset by recruitment of more dispersed cortical zzso In addition, the presence of this increased connectivity is seen to eventually weaken with disease zzso The results suggest that patterns of zzso functional connection may be a useful risk marker for conversion to zzso in zzso zzso
