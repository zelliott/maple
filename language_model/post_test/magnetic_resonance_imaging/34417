We have developed a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso cluster analysis model of acute zzso stroke using zzso relaxation times and the diffusion zzso of water zzso To test the ability of this model to predict cerebral zzso male zzso rats zzso zzso 7) were subjected to 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery zzso zzso and diffusion and zzso weighted zzso were performed on these rats before, during and up to 7 days after zzso zzso zzso tissue signatures, specified by values of zzso and zzso were assigned to tissue zzso zzso correlations were obtained between zzso signatures at different time points and zzso zzso of zzso area obtained at 1 zzso In addition, we compared the zzso evolution of zzso tissue signatures to a separate population of animals at which zzso data were obtained at select times of zzso A significant shift zzso zzso or zzso zzso within signatures reflecting tissue zzso was demonstrated as the zzso zzso evolved over zzso Our data suggest, that the zzso signatures are associated with the degree of zzso cell zzso Thus, the tissue signature model may provide a zzso means to monitor the evolution of zzso cell damage and to predict final outcome of zzso cell zzso
