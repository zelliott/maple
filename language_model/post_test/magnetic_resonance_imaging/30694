To examine magnetic resonance zzso zzso relaxation times in the zzso cartilage of the zzso zzso in healthy children and in children with juvenile zzso arthritis zzso 

zzso relaxation time maps were created for 39 girls zzso zzso zzso 21 of whom were considered healthy and 18 of whom had zzso The spatial distribution of zzso relaxation times for the zzso zzso zzso cartilage (including zzso and zzso zzso was mapped for each group as a zzso Average data sets for each group were then compared using paired zzso to detect differences between the 2 zzso 

The spatial distribution of zzso relaxation time values was nearly identical in the 2 groups, with a zzso curve that was highest near the zzso bone and zzso zzso The average zzso relaxation times were significantly higher in the girls with zzso than in the group of healthy girls zzso zzso zzso 

The finding of an increased average zzso relaxation time in the children with zzso suggests that zzso relaxation time maps may reflect cartilage zzso differences that occur in zzso zzso relaxation time mapping may allow for early detection of cartilage changes and provide an objective, quantitative method of monitoring disease zzso with the long-term potential to guide zzso
