Imaging of zzso expression in zzso diseases has been extensively studied in the last years, mainly because the level of zzso zzso expression might be a surrogate zzso of zzso zzso Most studies have been performed using zzso tumor models but recently first results if imaging zzso expression in patients have been zzso The first approach used was the zzso approach with zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso or zzso for single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso In this article we will focus on the experimental design and methodology of PET imaging of zzso expression with the zzso zzso Common difficulties and pitfalls in image acquisition and interpretation will be zzso Finally, the performance of PET will be compared to other methods of imaging of zzso zzso like magnetic resonance imaging, zzso or optical zzso
