Estimates of the apparent zzso relaxation rate zzso can be used to zzso important properties of biological zzso Surprisingly, the mechanism of zzso dependence on tissue orientation is not well zzso The primary goal of this paper was to characterize orientation dependence of zzso in gray and white matter and relate it to independent zzso of two other zzso based zzso the local zzso frequency shift zzso and quantitative volume magnetic zzso zzso Through this comparative analysis we calculated zzso relations zzso zzso zzso contribution to the zzso relaxation rate from local field zzso in a zzso given zzso of the local zzso frequency zzso zzso is a measure of both zzso geometry and density and is related to tissue zzso Additionally, two methods (the zzso zzso model and zzso zzso zzso for calculating zzso were compared in gray and white zzso The value of zzso derived from fitting the zzso zzso model was then connected to the observed zzso orientation dependence using zzso optical density zzso from zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso and zzso of white and cortical gray matter are well described by a zzso dependence on the orientation of the tissue and a linear dependence on the volume fraction of zzso in the zzso In deep brain gray matter structures, where there is no obvious symmetry zzso zzso and zzso have no orientation dependence but retain a linear dependence on tissue iron concentration and hence zzso
