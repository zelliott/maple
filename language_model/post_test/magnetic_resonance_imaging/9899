: To compare a commercial contrast agent zzso zzso and a zzso CA zzso for their ability to evaluate the therapeutic necrosis with a vascular zzso agent zzso on magnetic resonance imaging in zzso liver tumors to determine which could better correlate with the zzso zzso 

: After the zzso treatment, 16 rats with 32 liver zzso were zzso into zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso 8 per zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging, zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso and zzso imaging were performed at zzso after zzso treatment and CA zzso The enhancing efficacy of zzso at immediate and delayed enhancement on zzso in viable tumor and necrosis was zzso zzso necrosis ratios calculated from zzso and zzso were compared and correlated with zzso zzso 

: On the immediate zzso viable tumor was enhanced by either zzso On the delayed zzso at 30 minutes, both zzso failed to zzso viable tumor from zzso At 24 hours zzso the necrosis was clearly distinguished from viable tumor and thus derived necrosis ratio matched that from zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis ratio from zzso was significantly lower than that from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a higher correlation of zzso than that of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso 

: zzso better evaluated zzso tumor necrosis than zzso CA on zzso in tumor models of rat zzso zzso showed a closer correlation with zzso than zzso CA for the zzso of true zzso Delayed enhancement on zzso with zzso CA is not suitable for the assessment of zzso tumor zzso
