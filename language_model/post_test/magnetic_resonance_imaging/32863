zzso and osteoporosis are a common clinical problem in patients with beta zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to assess the possible correlation of excess iron in liver and heart of beta zzso patient with bone mineral density zzso 

We performed a prospective zzso study on 80 patients with beta zzso major and zzso The patients were zzso into normal zzso and those with abnormal zzso test based on zzso All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging examinations of heart and zzso zzso fast zzso sequence was used and zzso values were calculated based on the Royal zzso Hospital zzso zzso between zzso values in heart and liver as well as serum zzso levels with zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

There were no significant differences between patients with and without zzso or osteoporosis with respect to age and zzso Patients with abnormal zzso had lower zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso and heart iron load (based on zzso were zzso correlated with zzso 

zzso zzso and heart iron content are good indicators of zzso in patients with beta zzso major and zzso
