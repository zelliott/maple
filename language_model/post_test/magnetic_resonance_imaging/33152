To determine optimal delay times and flip angles for zzso zzso imaging at zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid and to demonstrate the feasibility of using a high-resolution zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence to evaluate zzso zzso 

Eight healthy volunteers were scanned at zzso using a zzso three-dimensional zzso pulse sequence following the administration of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso enabled acquisition of high spatial resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) images in approximately 5 zzso of zzso Multiple zzso acquisitions were performed at flip angles between zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso To evaluate the performance of this zzso sequence in the setting of zzso disease, the image quality and zzso zzso of 51 consecutive clinical scans performed to assess primary zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso imaging occurs at zzso zzso using a zzso flip zzso The image quality and zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso scans were excellent, despite the decreased liver function in some zzso zzso of reduced zzso often provided diagnostic information that was unavailable by conventional magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging using zzso acid and zzso scan parameters is technically feasible and can be clinically useful, even in patients with decreased zzso zzso
