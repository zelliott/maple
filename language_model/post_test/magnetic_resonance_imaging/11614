Despite substantial evidence that the prefrontal zzso does not function normally in patients diagnosed with zzso evidence for prefrontal structural zzso as measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been zzso Additionally, evidence for relationships between prefrontal structural and functional measures has been zzso The inconsistencies in the zzso literature are, at least in part, due to a lack of standard and specific measurement protocols that allow zzso of functionally distinct cortical zzso In this study, reliable methods for measuring an estimate of area 46 zzso referred to as area zzso as defined by zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso were developed and used to examine relationships between area zzso volumes, working memory, and symptom severity in 23 male patients and 23 healthy male comparison zzso Patients performed more poorly than healthy reference subjects on all cognitive measures including measures of spatial and zzso working memory, but showed no significant corresponding deficits in area zzso volumes or whole brain zzso Moreover, there were no significant relationships between symptom severity and area zzso zzso These findings suggest that the prefrontal functional abnormalities observed in schizophrenia may occur in the absence of prefrontal volume deficits, and may instead involve more widespread brain systems or prefrontal connections with other brain zzso
