zzso zzso zzso tend to deteriorate over time, developing both obstruction and zzso In this prospective study, magnetic resonance imaging zzso was compared with zzso zzso to determine whether zzso improves the zzso evaluation of zzso zzso Twenty-five patients zzso age 10 years, range zzso to zzso were investigated 27 times with zzso zzso and an zzso protocol with spin echo sequences for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso echo technique for right zzso volume zzso zzso zzso data were available in 6 zzso zzso could assess the zzso of the zzso in 6 patients, whereas zzso demonstrated all zzso zzso zzso zzso could evaluate the occurrence of zzso in 18 patients and could zzso peak zzso in 20 of the zzso A technically adequate zzso zzso mapping was obtained in 25 zzso There was good agreement between zzso and zzso zzso in establishing or not establishing zzso but zzso zzso was less reliable in evaluating the degree of zzso The correlation between peak zzso determined with zzso and magnetic resonance imaging was r zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso pressure zzso and zzso techniques were r zzso zzso for magnetic resonance imaging zzso versus zzso and r zzso zzso zzso for zzso versus zzso zzso can provide complete information on the zzso and function of zzso zzso zzso as well as of the right zzso If the results of zzso and zzso with zzso are in agreement, heart zzso and zzso can be avoided, even in patients considered for zzso zzso
