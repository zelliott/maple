zzso resonance imaging zzso offers promise as a zzso method to determine the potential of an zzso zzso zzso zzso to heal without surgical zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the value of zzso plain zzso and clinical findings in predicting the success of zzso treatment of juvenile zzso zzso zzso zzso in 24 patients zzso age zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso diagnosed based on zzso were zzso A zzso or zzso blinded to the clinical status of the patients, correlated the zzso with patient zzso zzso were assessed for zzso size, location, and four criteria evaluating signal intensity changes and zzso surface defects to determine zzso zzso Older, more zzso mature patients with at least one sign of instability on zzso were most likely to have zzso treatment zzso zzso treatment failed most often in patients with large zzso in zzso areas, as seen on lateral zzso However, location based on zzso zzso was not statistically significant for predicting treatment zzso Although no single factor was zzso zzso of successful zzso treatment, younger, zzso immature patients with no zzso criteria of instability were most amenable to zzso zzso
