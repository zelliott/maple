The purpose of this research was to reassess the effects of topical zzso on the integrity of the zzso barrier, using high resolution, magnetic resonance imaging, and the standard intravenous contrast agent zzso zzso It has long been known that topical zzso gives rise to an increase in protein levels in the anterior chamber of the zzso This protein zzso light and is referred to clinically as zzso Prior studies concluded that zzso flare resulted from disruption of the zzso zzso These studies relied upon indirect methods that precluded direct zzso of the zzso chamber of the zzso Five normal, human volunteers (age zzso received a single drop of zzso zzso in one eye, following baseline zzso of zzso size and anterior chamber zzso These zzso were repeated every 15 zzso for 45 zzso The subject was then positioned in the magnet and the eye that received zzso was taped closed and covered with a 3 zzso zzso surface zzso The open zzso eye focused on a target to maintain fixation of the zzso zzso A baseline image of the eye was obtained and the contrast agent was administered zzso A series of additional images was obtained during the following 60 zzso to track the movement of contrast material from the zzso into the zzso and compartments of the zzso zzso enhancement was calculated from selected regions of interest in the images, including the zzso body, and the anterior and zzso zzso Within the 45 zzso after administration of zzso zzso size in zzso decreased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso During this period, average zzso zzso zzso increased from zzso to zzso zzso In all cases, zzso images showed rapid enhancement of the zzso body, followed by a progressive increase in signal in the anterior chamber but not the zzso zzso These studies confirm that topical zzso gives rise to zzso in the anterior zzso But the lack of enhancement in the zzso chamber strongly suggests that the presence of this added protein in the anterior chamber is not the result of increased zzso of the zzso barrier of the zzso zzso These studies also introduce the novel concept that not all clinically observed flare is the result of zzso barrier zzso
