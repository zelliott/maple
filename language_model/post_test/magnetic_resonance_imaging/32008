zzso nerve zzso originate frequently in zzso zzso zzso and have various and complex zzso performances, some of which are still not well zzso This study was to explore zzso performances and features of zzso from zzso nerves in zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso performances of 75 cases of zzso from zzso nerves in zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso facial zzso acoustic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed by surgical and zzso findings, were analyzed zzso 

Most of zzso in zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso when their sizes were larger than zzso zzso in zzso Small zzso (less than zzso zzso in zzso may be completely solid, which were closely related to zzso zzso On zzso the solid part of tumor appeared zzso or slightly zzso while zzso part was zzso On zzso solid part appeared high or slightly high signal intensity, but zzso part appeared very high signal zzso On zzso zzso there was obvious enhancement in the solid part, but not in the zzso zzso Some typical signs were very useful to zzso tumor origin, such as, zzso zzso zzso extended across the middle and zzso zzso zzso enlargement of internal auditory canal, widened jugular zzso and zzso zzso caused by acoustic zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The correct ratio for qualitative diagnosis of zzso was zzso using zzso but the incorrect ratio for identifying the nerve of tumor origin was zzso 

zzso is a good method in qualitative diagnosis of zzso and identifying zzso nerves of tumor origin in zzso zzso zzso
