Several findings suggest lower levels of serum zzso acid in multiple sclerosis zzso zzso The aim of this study is to investigate relationships of zzso acid serum levels in zzso zzso zzso patients with clinical activity of disease and zzso barrier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients and 40 controls divided into two groups: 20 healthy donors and 20 patients with other inflammatory neurological diseases zzso were zzso By using a quantitative zzso zzso according to the zzso protocol and a commercial zzso acid standard solution, serum zzso acid levels were measured and the results were zzso To investigate zzso function, magnetic resonance imaging after administration of zzso was zzso zzso patients were found to have significantly lower serum zzso acid levels zzso zzso zzso zzso mean value zzso in comparison with healthy donors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso patients with zzso had significantly lower serum zzso acid levels zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and more over, zzso patients with zzso disruption had significantly lower serum zzso acid levels zzso zzso zzso zzso than those with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, we also found that serum zzso acid level independently correlated with disease activity, zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that lower zzso acid levels in zzso patients are associated with zzso and suggest that zzso acid might be beneficial in the treatment of zzso
