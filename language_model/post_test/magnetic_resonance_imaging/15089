zzso is common in brain zzso Due to characteristic magnetic field changes induced by zzso it can be detected using zzso weighted zzso zzso Its relevance to clinical syndromes is zzso Here we investigated the patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a surrogate for zzso with regard to the prevalence of zzso We report on 105 patients with newly diagnosed zzso zzso and brain zzso The following parameters were recorded from zzso zzso zzso zzso defined as zzso or fine linear signal changes; zzso allocation of zzso to tumor compartments zzso enhancement, central zzso zzso area outside zzso zzso allocation of zzso to include the cortex, or zzso in zzso tumor parts only; zzso tumor size on zzso weighted and zzso zzso zzso 80 tumors zzso zzso showed zzso zzso diffuse zzso WHO II, zzso zzso zzso WHO III, zzso zzso WHO IV, zzso zzso The presence of zzso depended on tumor size but not on patient's age, medication with zzso drugs or zzso zzso occurred in 60 % of zzso zzso zzso significantly correlated with zzso in brain zzso zzso zzso zzso and as a trend in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may zzso a risk for zzso in patients with newly diagnosed brain zzso and zzso Whether development of cortical zzso induced by treatment or by the natural course of tumors also leads to the new onset of zzso has to be addressed in zzso studies in larger patient zzso
