The brain and skeletal muscle of eight adult patients with migraine with prolonged zzso or migraine strokes leaving a permanent zzso zzso were studied by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso performed on muscle biopsy and zzso had revealed abnormal zzso zzso zzso Brain magnetic resonance zzso showed an zzso low zzso to zzso zzso ratio in all patients, apparently due to decreased zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso Muscle zzso magnetic resonance zzso showed low recovery from exercise in seven zzso Three patients had an increased zzso zzso ratio at rest, and the exercise transfer characteristics were abnormal in four patients for relatively low levels of zzso The zzso zzso defects present in zzso and muscle of complicated migraine patients are therefore also expressed in the zzso
