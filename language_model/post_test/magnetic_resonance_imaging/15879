The authors examined the effect of zzso on brain activity in children and adolescents with zzso performing the zzso Color and Word zzso 

The authors acquired 52 functional zzso scans in 16 youths with zzso who were known zzso to stimulant medication and 20 healthy comparison zzso Participants with zzso were scanned on and off medication in a zzso design, and comparison subjects were scanned once without zzso 

zzso medication significantly improved suppression of zzso activity in the zzso anterior zzso zzso in the zzso zzso When off medication, youths with zzso were unable to suppress zzso activity to the same degree as comparison subjects, whereas when on medication, they suppressed this activity to comparison group zzso Greater zzso of the lateral prefrontal zzso when off medication predicted a greater reduction in zzso symptoms when on zzso zzso causality analyses demonstrated that activity in the lateral prefrontal and zzso anterior zzso zzso mutually influenced one another but that the influence of the zzso anterior zzso zzso on the lateral prefrontal zzso was significantly reduced in youths with zzso off medication relative to comparison subjects and increased significantly to normal levels when zzso youths were on zzso 

zzso in youths with zzso improved suppression of zzso activity in the zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso zzso components of a circuit in which activity has been shown to correlate with the degree of zzso during zzso zzso zzso seem to improve symptoms in youths with zzso by zzso activity within this circuit and improving its functional interactions with the lateral prefrontal zzso
