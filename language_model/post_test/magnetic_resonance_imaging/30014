To evaluate the impact of brain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in early detection of central nervous system abnormalities in patients affected by Wilson's disease zzso with or without neurological zzso 

Out of 25 consecutive zzso patients, 13 showed zzso involvement, ten zzso and neurological manifestations, and zzso zzso zzso and psychiatric symptoms, including mainly movement disorders, major depression, and zzso zzso healthy, zzso matched subjects served as zzso All patients underwent brain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso before starting specific zzso zzso analyses were performed using statistical zzso mapping to compare differences in zzso brain zzso between the two zzso 

Brain zzso showed zzso zzso in seven patients zzso six of whom were affected by zzso and neurological zzso Brain zzso zzso showed pathological data in 19 patients zzso revealing diffuse or focal zzso in superior frontal zzso area zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 18, BA zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 37, BA zzso and in zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso involvement was detected in nine zzso eight presented both zzso and neurological signs, while two exhibited zzso zzso zzso and psychiatric zzso All but one patient with abnormal zzso matched with abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso findings were obtained in six out of ten patients with zzso and neurological involvement while abnormal zzso zzso was revealed in eight zzso Both patients with zzso zzso and psychiatric involvement displayed abnormal zzso zzso and one displayed an altered zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso zzso might be useful in detecting early brain damage in zzso not only in the perspective of assessing and treating motor impairment but also in evaluating better the less investigated disorders in the cognitive zzso
