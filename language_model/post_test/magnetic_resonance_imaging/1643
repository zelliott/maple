zzso zzso is a zzso option for zzso zzso activity on the human zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso and reliability of zzso imaging integrated into a zzso system to identify the zzso zzso zzso in patients with brain tumors in or near the central motor zzso It was performed prior to surgery in 30 patients with zzso zzso in or around the central region to zzso the primary zzso zzso These functional brain maps were superimposed on MR images obtained prior to surgery and transferred in the operating room for zzso functional zzso During surgery, the phase reversal technique identified a generator which coincided with the zzso zzso as displayed by the zzso functional zzso zzso Following surgery, the motor deficit improved in seven patients, was unchanged in five, and showed a slight transient deterioration in zzso One patient suffered a deterioration of motor function with incomplete zzso The zzso functional zzso was found to be zzso and useful in finding a safe approach to tumors in or adjacent to the central zzso The accuracy of zzso was concluded to be reliable as verified by the phase reversal zzso
