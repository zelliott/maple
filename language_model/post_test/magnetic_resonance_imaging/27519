Small zzso zzso is a complex of many individual motion zzso Although each element of zzso can be measured there is no current global measure of zzso 

To examine the feasibility of automated computerized assessment of global small zzso zzso using simple zzso zzso 

zzso dynamic MR images were obtained from five healthy volunteers who had zzso for 9 h and drunk zzso L of zzso Images were taken using single zzso and zzso zzso Acquisitions were repeated at 10 and 20 zzso after an intramuscular injection of zzso zzso zzso maps were generated representing the mean change in signal zzso zzso per zzso for each dynamic zzso Two observers independently assessed zzso for optimal zzso of small zzso from other sources of zzso Total zzso activity zzso for each study was calculated as a sum of zzso per slice and whole examination and zzso profiles were zzso 

Independent observations suggest that the automated zzso method described zzso segments small zzso activity from other zzso Small zzso movement represented as zzso varied zzso in the five volunteers and was inhibited by zzso zzso 

It is possible to develop a new measure, based on automated zzso of mean signal zzso changes, of small zzso zzso using dynamic zzso
