The goal of this study was to document the healing time course and expression of ex zzso zzso gene delivery in zzso fracture models in the mouse and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in the stifle (knee) zzso of zzso zzso mice and zzso or lateral similar zzso was performed in zzso nude zzso zzso modified cells expressing zzso were delivered in a three-dimensional zzso zzso directly into the zzso zzso zzso of an in zzso imaging system to detect expression of zzso was compared between zzso in this fracture zzso zzso healing was assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso The mouse model was less satisfactory because the small size of the zzso zzso made reliable assessment of fracture healing restricted to zzso and complications occurred in zzso mice zzso most frequently zzso zzso zzso fracture zzso Gene expression was zzso confirmed in mice in zzso for 11 days zzso zzso zzso In rats, zzso zzso and CT were used to assess zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso in rats could produce three-dimensional images that would permit assessment of bone and cartilage, but was time-consuming and zzso In rats, the only surgical complication, zzso zzso zzso was reduced from zzso with the zzso zzso to zzso with a lateral zzso In zzso imaging confirmed gene expression in the zzso zzso in rats for at least 4 days zzso zzso zzso The nude rat model has the advantage of larger zzso and the ability to implant zzso zzso A lateral zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the rat can be used to study the healing of zzso zzso
