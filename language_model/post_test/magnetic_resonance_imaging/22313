We studied clinical signs, zzso and zzso cerebral blood flow by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in eight patients with intractable supplementary zzso area zzso zzso zzso scans were performed after injection of the regional cerebral blood flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso early in the zzso phase zzso s after seizure zzso zzso zzso demonstrated unilateral predominance of zzso of the zzso in all patients, zzso with either zzso clinical signs, zzso of zzso scalp zzso or with the site of zzso onset of seizures, obtained from zzso zzso Two distinctive cortical zzso propagation patterns were identified in zzso zzso The type I pattern consisted of primary involvement of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and motor zzso The type II pattern consisted of bilateral but zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso head and eye movements were associated with a type I propagation pattern zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso structures led to variable zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in all zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is a useful method for seizure zzso in patients with zzso zzso The observed zzso of clinical features in zzso zzso zzso with propagation to, and zzso of, specific cortical structures, and is consistent with known anatomical zzso between the zzso zzso cortical and zzso cortical zzso
