The zzso network involved in a precise type of calculation zzso mental zzso was investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance zzso Two tasks were used requiring covert production of zzso zzso with zzso zzso without zzso During the first task, zzso was observed in the left zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso in zzso area and zzso in the inferior zzso zzso During the second task, zzso was mainly observed in zzso area and to a less extent in the left prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso comparison of data in the two situations revealed that the procedure of mental zzso is zzso by a distributed system which includes predominantly the left zzso prefrontal zzso and the inferior zzso zzso zzso
