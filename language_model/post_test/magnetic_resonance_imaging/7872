To develop a zzso acquisition for regional mapping of ventilation and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso dissolved in tissue zzso zzso and zzso and red blood cells zzso and to perform an exploratory study to characterize data obtained in human zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence was developed to obtain ventilation zzso zzso zzso and zzso images in healthy subjects, smokers, and zzso Signal ratios zzso dissolved zzso to gas, zzso zzso and zzso were calculated from the images for quantitative zzso 

Healthy subjects demonstrated generally uniform values within zzso zzso and a zzso in values along the zzso zzso In contrast, images and associated ratio maps in smokers and zzso were generally zzso and exhibited values mostly lower than those in healthy zzso zzso values of total dissolved zzso to gas, zzso and zzso ratios in healthy subjects were significantly larger than those in diseased zzso 

Regional maps of tissue and zzso zzso of dissolved zzso were obtained from a short zzso zzso well tolerated by healthy volunteers and subjects with zzso lung zzso zzso differences were observed in spatial zzso and overall amounts of zzso dissolved in tissue and zzso among healthy subjects, smokers and zzso
