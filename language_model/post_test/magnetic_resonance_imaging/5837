To evaluate differences in carotid zzso measured using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and three-dimensional ultrasound zzso 

Ten subject volunteers underwent carotid zzso and zzso zzso black blood fast spin zzso zzso contrast, double inversion recovery, zzso zzso zzso resolution, 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso within 1 zzso zzso and MR images were manually segmented by two observers providing vessel wall and zzso contours for zzso of vessel wall volume zzso and generation of carotid thickness zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso 210 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 110 zzso were significantly different zzso zzso zzso When zzso for the estimated zzso volume, mean zzso zzso decreased 240 zzso 50 zzso and was significantly different from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carotid maps showed qualitative evidence of regional differences in the plaque and vessel wall thickness between MR and zzso in all zzso Power zzso US confirmed that zzso in the common carotid artery in all patients resulted from apparent flow zzso not zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were significantly different and carotid maps showed homogeneous thickness differences and zzso in specific regions of interest identified as MR flow artifacts in the common carotid zzso
