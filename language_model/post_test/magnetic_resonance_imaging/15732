zzso are important cues defining coherent auditory zzso As a model of auditory edges, sound zzso and offset are particularly suitable to study their neural zzso because they contrast a specific physical input against no physical zzso Change from silence to sound, that is zzso has extensively been studied and elicits transient neural responses zzso in auditory zzso However, neural activity associated with sound onset is not only related to edge detection but also to novel zzso zzso zzso at the change from sound to silence, that is zzso are not zzso by novel physical input and thus allow to examine neural activity associated with sound edges per zzso In the first experiment, we used silent acquisition functional magnetic resonance imaging and found that the offset of zzso sound activates zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the right zzso In the zzso zzso and the superior zzso zzso offset response zzso were related to the pulse repetition rate of the preceding zzso In the second experiment, we found that these zzso regions were also activated by single sound zzso onset of sound pulse sequences and single sound pulse zzso within sound pulse zzso However, they were not active during sustained sound zzso Thus, our data show that circumscribed areas in right zzso zzso are specifically involved in identifying auditory zzso This operation is crucial for translating acoustic signal time series into coherent auditory zzso
