The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and assess the correlation between the volume of the zzso zzso and zzso status during the zzso stage of zzso zzso zzso stroke was induced in 6 healthy laboratory zzso through permanent zzso of the middle cerebral artery zzso zzso and zzso inversion recovery zzso imaging, zzso imaging zzso measurement of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso ratio, and zzso evaluation were performed 3 times serially by using a zzso MR system: before and 3 and 10 d after zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso ratio was decreased initially but then was increased at 10 d after zzso zzso zzso volumes on zzso and zzso imaging were not significantly different from those on zzso The zzso volume and zzso score showed strong zzso Our results suggest that conventional zzso may be a reliable diagnostic tool during the zzso stage of canine zzso zzso
