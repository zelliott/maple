Early risk of stroke after a transient zzso attack can be reliably predicted with risk scores based on clinical features of the patient and of the zzso event, but it is unclear how these features correlate with findings on brain zzso 

We performed a systematic review of the literature and identified all previous studies which reported patient characteristics and the nature of transient zzso attack symptoms in relation to appearances on zzso imaging zzso We then performed a zzso of the associations between the components of the risk scores and positive zzso Authors were contacted for additional unpublished zzso 

zzso studies were identified by the systematic review, and additional unpublished data were obtained from 11 of these zzso On zzso several components of the risk scores were associated with positive zzso including symptom duration zzso or zzso minutes (13 studies, odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso (9 studies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso (8 studies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and motor weakness (9 studies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso However patient age, sex, hypertension and diabetes were not associated with the presence of zzso zzso From an zzso perspective, zzso zzso (9 studies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso carotid zzso (10 studies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso were associated with positive zzso 

zzso of acute zzso zzso on zzso zzso with several clinical features known to predict stroke risk after transient zzso zzso Large studies zzso size zzso will therefore be required to determine the independent zzso value of zzso and its interactions with these clinical zzso
