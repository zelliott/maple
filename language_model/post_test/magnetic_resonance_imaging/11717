The ability to bring to mind a past experience depends on the cognitive and neural processes that are engaged during the experience and that support memory zzso A central and much debated question is whether the processes that zzso rote verbal zzso is, working memory mechanisms that keep information in zzso memory formation and subsequent zzso The present study used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to explore the relation between working memory maintenance operations and long-term zzso Specifically, we investigated whether the magnitude of zzso in neural regions supporting the zzso maintenance of verbal codes is zzso of subsequent memory for words that were zzso during zzso Furthermore, during rote rehearsal, the extent of neural zzso in regions associated with semantic retrieval was assessed to determine the role that incidental semantic zzso may play in subsequent memory for zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso the magnitude of zzso in neural regions previously associated with zzso rehearsal zzso zzso bilateral zzso supplementary zzso and zzso zzso was correlated with subsequent memory, and zzso while rote rehearsal did zzso zzso zzso in an anterior left prefrontal region associated with semantic zzso zzso in this region was greater for trials that were subsequently better zzso zzso to the prevalent view that rote rehearsal does not impact learning, these data suggest that zzso maintenance mechanisms, in addition to semantic zzso support the zzso of an experience such that it can be later zzso
