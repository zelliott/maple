Few data are presently available on the effective control of cavernous zzso zzso invasion of invasive zzso The aim of this retrospective study, through a mean period of 5 years follow up, is to observe the tumor shrinkage of zzso invasive zzso as well as zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

68 patients met the criteria of invasive zzso zzso III or IV in the zzso scheme of zzso and zzso serum zzso level greater than 200 zzso 33 patients underwent zzso therapy as the initial treatment, and 14 of these 33 had combined treatment with zzso and/or zzso The other 35 patients received zzso as the primary treatment, after which two patients had normal zzso without taking zzso and other 33 patients received zzso treatment after zzso 

zzso volume on magnetic resonance images had completely disappeared in 50 patients zzso while all the other 18 patients had residual tumor in the zzso areas, invading the zzso and 14 patients had a secondary empty zzso due to tumor zzso Of those 14 patients, seven still had elevated zzso zzso five had zzso zzso zzso by different degrees zzso zzso zzso There were 49 patients with normal zzso levels zzso five patients with zzso levels more than 200 zzso After the treatment, 14 patients with tumor volume disappearance on MR images and zzso zzso therefore withdrew from zzso zzso During a subsequent zzso zzso tumor recurrence and zzso increase were not found in those 14 zzso zzso patients maintained normal zzso levels with zzso zzso of which 20 patients had their tumor disappear while seven patients had zzso residual zzso 

About three-fourths of zzso with zzso invasion can be effectively controlled not only with regard to tumor volume disappearance but also in serum zzso zzso zzso tumor in the zzso areas with zzso zzso and no pressure symptoms can be treated with zzso of zzso so as to achieve long-term tumor volume control and zzso zzso Great attention should be paid to zzso residual tumors accompanying the empty zzso especially in cases with zzso zzso zzso
