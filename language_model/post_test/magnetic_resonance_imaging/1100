To determine the value of MR imaging in the detection and measurement of tumor size in patients with invasive zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso and zzso 

From 36 cases of zzso in 34 patients who were surgically treated, the zzso imaging zzso being zzso ultrasound and contrast enhanced zzso were zzso re-evaluated for tumor detection and zzso zzso were compared with zzso Two zzso were used for evaluation of the zzso the other imaging zzso were only evaluated by one zzso The zzso correlation test was used to determine the correlation between zzso and imaging zzso for each imaging zzso 

For zzso ultrasound and zzso the false negative scores were respectively zzso zzso and zzso The percentage for underestimated, correctly estimated and overestimated zzso on imaging were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso 1 and zzso zzso and zzso for zzso 2 on zzso For ultrasound and zzso these percentages were respectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The correlation zzso for zzso were respectively r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for both zzso for zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Of the three imaging zzso contrast enhanced MR has the lowest false negative rate in detecting zzso and has the highest accuracy in measuring the size of the zzso MR could play a key role in the zzso zzso for accurate tumor size zzso
