zzso zzso joint dysfunction, resulting from either zzso or skeletal disorders, may be zzso or zzso zzso zzso joint disorders are zzso The authors review their experience with pediatric zzso joint disorders and propose a new zzso zzso 

Clinical records, zzso zzso zzso scans, magnetic resonance images, and zzso specimens of all pediatric patients zzso than 18 zzso with zzso or restricted zzso excursion from 1976 to 2008 were zzso Cases were zzso according to zzso or skeletal zzso zzso skeletal abnormalities were further characterized as zzso or zzso 

zzso patients, ranging in age from 1 day to 18 years at diagnosis, were identified with zzso joint zzso Ten cases zzso percent) were attributable to zzso zzso The remaining 28 cases zzso percent) were attributable to skeletal zzso consisting of 14 zzso and 14 acquired cases zzso percent zzso zzso skeletal zzso included 12 zzso zzso zzso percent) and two zzso zzso zzso percent) zzso bone zzso zzso skeletal zzso accounted for five zzso zzso zzso percent) and nine zzso zzso zzso zzso 

On initial survey, the data are consistent with published reports that attribute zzso joint dysfunction to acquired zzso zzso trauma and zzso However, the authors observed a significantly higher percentage zzso percent) of zzso zzso joint skeletal disorders than previously zzso Most zzso cases involved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only a minority of cases had zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso Because the diagnosis and zzso of zzso joint disorders determine treatment options, the authors provide a new zzso that characterizes the extent of zzso zzso
