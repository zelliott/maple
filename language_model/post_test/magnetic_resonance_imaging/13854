To compare the diagnostic efficacy of a standard dose of zzso contrast agent in the evaluation of primary brain tumors and zzso using a zzso 3 zzso MR unit versus a zzso zzso MR zzso 

Sixteen patients with brain tumors were examined at both field strengths using identical zzso zzso protocols zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso preparation zzso which was adjusted separately for each field zzso zzso of the images was performed zzso and, in the case of zzso images, also by visual zzso 

zzso after zzso administration using statistical evaluation of zzso scans was significantly higher at 3 zzso zzso than at zzso zzso zzso The same was true for zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso Signal enhancement of the zzso in zzso sequences was not significantly different between both field zzso 

Administration of a zzso contrast agent produces higher contrast between tumor and normal brain at 3 zzso than at zzso zzso
