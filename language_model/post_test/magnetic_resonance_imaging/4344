This paper presents a method for the zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso of brain images that have been acquired in different zzso The basic idea is that instead of matching two images directly, one performs intermediate zzso registrations to two template images that are already in zzso One can use a zzso zzso to determine the zzso transformations that map between the templates and the zzso By incorporating suitable constraints, a rigid body transformation which directly maps between the images can be extracted from these more general zzso zzso A further refinement zzso on the implicit zzso of both images into a standard zzso This zzso zzso or zzso of both original images into zzso tissue zzso Once zzso the partitions can be jointly zzso further increasing the accuracy of the zzso In short, these techniques reduce the zzso problem to a series of simpler zzso zzso These methods are relatively zzso address a number of problems in image zzso and require no manual zzso
