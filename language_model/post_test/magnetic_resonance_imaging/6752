Although zzso disease zzso can affect the entire zzso zzso the proportion of patients with zzso inflammation zzso to the terminal zzso is still zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso combined with zzso zzso can detect inflammatory zzso of the small zzso zzso we applied zzso to assess the percentage of patients with zzso inflammation zzso to the terminal zzso among patients with CD and abdominal zzso 

Twenty-five consecutive patients with low, active CD of the colon and/or terminal zzso and episodes of abdominal pain were examined by both zzso and conventional zzso The findings of zzso were compared with zzso and zzso results in the terminal zzso and conventional zzso in the small zzso zzso to the terminal zzso 

In 13 of the 25 patients, inflammation of the small zzso zzso to the terminal zzso was shown by zzso whereas in only 4 of the 25 patients, signs of inflammation of the small zzso zzso to the terminal zzso were shown by conventional zzso all of which were demonstrated by zzso zzso confirmed the findings in 22 of 25 patients in whom zzso and zzso had shown inflammation (16 of zzso or no inflammation (6 of 7) of the terminal zzso 

In symptomatic patients with CD even of low activity, inflammation of the small zzso zzso to the terminal zzso is zzso
