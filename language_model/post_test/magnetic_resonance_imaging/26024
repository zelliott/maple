The kinetic stability of the complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used as a zzso agent in magnetic resonance imaging zzso is zzso by the rates of the exchange reactions that take place with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The reactions predominantly occur through the direct attack of zzso and zzso on the complex zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is relatively slow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and under zzso conditions the release of zzso predominantly occurs through the reactions of the complex with the zzso and zzso zzso To interpret the rate data, the zzso role of a zzso intermediate was assumed in which a zzso zzso of zzso is coordinated to zzso or zzso In the exchange reactions between zzso and zzso smaller amounts of zzso and zzso and their complexes with the zzso acids zzso and zzso have a zzso zzso In a model of the fate of the complex in the body zzso the zzso and the zzso of zzso are regarded as parallel zzso zzso and by 10 h after the intravenous administration the ratio of the amounts of zzso and zzso zzso is zzso From about this time, zzso of the injected dose of zzso is zzso The results of equilibrium calculations indicate that the zzso released from the complex is in the form of zzso
