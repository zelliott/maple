The unusual sensitivity and attraction to auditory stimuli in people with Williams syndrome zzso has been hypothesized to be the consequence of zzso development of brain regions surrounding the zzso zzso zzso zzso surface area, which is determined in part by zzso zzso zzso was examined in 42 zzso and 40 control participants to determine if anomalous zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso participants had significantly reduced zzso asymmetry of the zzso zzso compared to control participants, due to a significant expansion in the size of the right zzso zzso The increased right zzso zzso size was largely due to zzso participants zzso who had a right zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso and failed to ascend into the zzso zzso This zzso pattern is unusual in the right zzso and is more commonly found in the left zzso of typically developing zzso There were no control participants with this type of right zzso zzso zzso zzso The right zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns were also related to a measure of cortical complexity and the amount of right zzso zzso lobe volume, suggesting that intrinsic genetic influences leading to anomalous visual system development in zzso have widespread influences on cortical zzso that are similar in manner to zzso embryonic visual system zzso
