The zzso procedure is the gold standard for the surgical treatment of zzso zzso with proven long-term zzso However, its application has been limited by its complexity and significant zzso The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and safety of performing the zzso procedure using bipolar zzso zzso on the beating heart without zzso zzso 

After median zzso 6 zzso zzso underwent a modified zzso procedure using bipolar zzso zzso The animals survived for 30 zzso zzso function, coronary artery, pulmonary vein zzso and valve function were assessed by magnetic resonance zzso At zzso pacing documented electrical isolation of the pulmonary zzso zzso of zzso zzso was attempted by burst pacing with zzso zzso zzso assessment was performed after zzso 

There were no zzso zzso or zzso zzso At 30 days, zzso zzso was unable to be zzso and pulmonary vein isolation was confirmed by zzso zzso resonance imaging assessment revealed no coronary artery or pulmonary vein zzso Although zzso ejection fraction decreased slightly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was preserved in every zzso zzso assessment showed all zzso to be zzso and there were no significant zzso of the coronary vessels or injuries to the zzso 

Virtually all of the zzso of the zzso procedure can be performed without zzso bypass using bipolar zzso zzso There were no late zzso of the pulmonary zzso Clinical trials of this new technology on the beating heart are zzso
