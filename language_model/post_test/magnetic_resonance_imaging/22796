To compare prenatal zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso with zzso zzso findings and to study the zzso outcome in relation to the level of zzso and head signs on zzso zzso 

A retrospective study of babies referred to a zzso zzso unit with a diagnosis of zzso zzso in the years zzso was zzso The levels of zzso and head signs diagnosed using zzso zzso and zzso were compared with zzso zzso and operative zzso The levels of zzso and head signs diagnosed zzso and zzso were used to study the correlation with neurological outcome at a mean follow-up period of 12 zzso 

Twelve zzso diagnosed and five zzso diagnosed cases of zzso zzso were zzso The level of zzso as identified by zzso ultrasound correlated with that observed zzso in zzso cases and the zzso ultrasound diagnosis of zzso was confirmed zzso in all zzso The level of zzso as identified by zzso zzso correlated with that observed zzso in zzso cases zzso and the zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso was confirmed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso babies were found to have zzso in the immediate zzso zzso studies, of which zzso zzso zzso 10) required intermittent zzso of the zzso at 12 months of zzso Low spinal zzso were associated with increased zzso morbidity when compared to high spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The level of spinal zzso and the presence of zzso did not have any statistically significant correlation with motor functions, morbidity and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a good tool in the diagnosis of zzso zzso We could not demonstrate any advantage of zzso zzso over zzso There is better correlation of zzso than zzso with zzso zzso findings in terms of level of zzso and head zzso Low spinal zzso appear to be associated with increased zzso zzso
