zzso stroke can result from a temporary or permanent zzso of zzso zzso In the zzso stage of the disease cerebrovascular ultrasound can be used to determine the vascular pathology, but the significance of very early findings on ultrasound is zzso The present study aimed to assess the zzso value of zzso zzso within the first hours after stroke for functional zzso 

In a prospective zzso design, patients with clinical signs of zzso zzso stroke were examined by zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Patients were separated into three groups according to the findings: normal zzso artery zzso branch zzso or a zzso zzso The primary zzso was functional outcome at 3 zzso zzso zzso was used to test the association between the ultrasound diagnosis and functional zzso 

zzso patients were identified with moderate to severe clinical deficits (National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso score zzso Of these, 121 zzso had a normal zzso 176 zzso had branch zzso 7 zzso had severe zzso zzso and 57 zzso had a zzso zzso 50 of the 57 zzso patients with zzso zzso were dead or dependent 3 months after zzso An zzso of the main stem of the zzso within 6 h after stroke was an independent predictor for poor outcome zzso 50% of patients with zzso diagnosis of branch zzso and zzso with normal zzso had a good zzso Combination of CT scan without early signs of zzso and a normal zzso resulted in a zzso value of zzso for a good functional zzso 

zzso zzso provides additional functional zzso information in the zzso stage of zzso zzso The technique is practical in a zzso unit, can be used to identify patients with high risk for poor functional outcome, and thus would be an appropriate investigation for future zzso
