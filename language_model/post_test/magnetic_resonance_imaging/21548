A zzso zzso technique of tumor volume determination was used to correlate zzso hearing levels and long-term zzso facial function with acoustic zzso zzso zzso hearing was studied in a group of 41 patients subjected to direct tumor volume calculations and in another group of 131 patients in whom volume was zzso from the acoustic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso facial function was correlated with acoustic zzso volume in another 864 patients in whom long-term follow-up was zzso zzso hearing levels were found not to be significantly related to tumor zzso However, zzso facial function was significantly associated with tumor volume and was best predicted as a zzso function of zzso Thus, tumor volume changes are important considerations in the clinical management of acoustic zzso Patients should be advised that even small changes in tumor diameter (especially in larger zzso can result in tumor volume changes that may be associated with significant changes in zzso facial zzso
