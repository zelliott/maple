zzso zzso approved for the treatment of zzso multiple zzso reduces relapses and disease activity and burden monitored by zzso We assessed the efficacy of early treatment with zzso zzso in delaying onset of clinically zzso multiple zzso 

In this zzso zzso trial, undertaken in 80 sites in 16 countries, zzso patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome with zzso zzso and two or more zzso brain zzso measuring 6 zzso or more, were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous zzso zzso 20 zzso per day zzso or zzso zzso for up to 36 months, unless they converted to clinically zzso multiple zzso The zzso scheme used zzso blocks zzso by zzso and patients and all personnel were masked to treatment zzso The primary zzso was time to clinically zzso multiple zzso based on a second clinical zzso Analysis was by intention to zzso A zzso interim analysis was done for data accumulated from zzso of the zzso study zzso This study was registered with zzso number zzso 

All randomly assigned participants were zzso for the primary zzso zzso zzso reduced the risk of developing clinically zzso multiple sclerosis by zzso compared with zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The time for zzso of patients to convert to clinically zzso disease was prolonged by zzso from 336 days for zzso to zzso days for zzso zzso The most common adverse events in the zzso zzso group were zzso reactions zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 56 zzso zzso and immediate zzso reactions zzso zzso vs 12 zzso 

Early treatment with zzso zzso is zzso in delaying conversion to clinically zzso multiple sclerosis in patients presenting with clinically isolated syndrome and brain zzso detected by zzso
