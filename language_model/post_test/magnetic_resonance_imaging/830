Much behavioral research has shown that the presence of a unique singleton zzso during a task of visual search will typically capture attention and thus disrupt target zzso Here we examined the neural zzso of such zzso capture using functional magnetic resonance imaging in human subjects during performance of a visual search zzso The presence zzso zzso of a salient yet irrelevant color singleton zzso was associated with activity in the superior zzso zzso and frontal zzso These findings imply that the singleton zzso induced spatial shifts of attention despite its zzso as predicted from an zzso zzso Moreover, behavioral interference by singleton zzso was strongly and zzso correlated with frontal zzso These findings provide direct evidence that the frontal zzso is involved in control of interference from irrelevant but zzso zzso
