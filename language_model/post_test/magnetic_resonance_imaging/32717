zzso groove zzso usually presents with zzso zzso This report describes the zzso features of 5 zzso 

All the clinical and zzso features were reviewed zzso and analyzed to identify correlations with the zzso zzso 

zzso was an initial symptom in all cases, but zzso zzso was not inevitable until the disease zzso zzso zzso demonstrated severe zzso zzso zzso findings of biopsy specimens showed no evidence of zzso at the early zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging indicated a zzso mass on zzso images and an zzso to slightly zzso mass on zzso zzso zzso the zzso seemed to be the result of a hard zzso tumor invading the zzso zzso zzso an zzso arising from the groove infiltrated the zzso layer of the zzso zzso No cancer cells were found in the zzso at the early zzso The zzso common zzso duct was involved at the advanced zzso 

We believe that these features resulted from the anatomical characteristics of the groove involvement and that the string zzso of the zzso resulted from invasion of the groove tumor into the zzso layer around the zzso
