Studies were conducted to determine the impact of self-administered cocaine on zzso zzso zzso in four zzso zzso The extent to which external cue conditioning contributed to the effects of cocaine and whether there is zzso of zzso zzso zzso during zzso behavior was also zzso zzso zzso were made at 2 zzso intervals in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso schedule of reinforcement was used, with cocaine availability signaled by a visual zzso Studies examined the effects of cocaine or cocaine cues against a drug-free zzso Large zzso to zzso increases in zzso zzso after a self-administered infusion of zzso zzso cocaine were quite rapid and matched the time course of reported zzso effects in human laboratory zzso To determine if conditioning to external cues contributed to the zzso increases, saline was zzso for cocaine in the infusion, leaving all other visual and auditory stimuli zzso No increase in zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso subdivisions was zzso zzso zzso during extended periods of zzso behavior triggered by a visual cue was determined in both central and zzso zzso This procedure also did not result in any measurable changes in zzso zzso These studies demonstrate rapid and pronounced pharmacological actions of self-administered zzso No apparent zzso component of those actions was associated with external environmental cues, suggesting that cues that trigger zzso behavior in nonhuman primates do not cause zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso
