To determine the incremental zzso of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso in young adults presenting with zzso neurological signs and zzso 

A decision analysis of long-term survival using accuracy data from a diagnostic technology assessment of zzso and CT in patients with suspected multiple zzso information from the medical literature, and clinical zzso 

In the baseline analysis, at zzso likelihood of an underlying zzso disease, zzso use has an incremental cost of zzso for each additional zzso zzso saved compared with zzso for CT zzso As the probability of disease increases, further zzso use becomes a cost-effective alternative costing $30,000 for each zzso zzso zzso If a negative zzso result provides reassurance, the incremental costs of immediate zzso use decreases and falls below $25,000 for each zzso zzso saved no matter the likelihood of zzso 

For most individuals with neurological symptoms or signs, CT imaging is cost-effective while MR imaging is zzso The zzso of zzso use, however, improves as the likelihood of an underlying neurological disease zzso For selected patients who highly value diagnostic information, zzso is a reasonable and cost-effective use of medical resources when even the likelihood of disease is quite low zzso
