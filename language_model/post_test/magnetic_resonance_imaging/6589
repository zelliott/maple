zzso based on the distant zzso field zzso have shown great promise for novel zzso and zzso Unless spatial variation in the zzso zzso zzso is eliminated by relaxation, zzso or zzso techniques by the end of a single repetition, unexpected results can be obtained due to spatial zzso in the steady state zzso zzso This is true even in a homogeneous zzso zzso We have developed an zzso expression for the zzso profile that occurs in zzso sequences when zzso by diffusion is negligible in the zzso zzso The expression has been verified by directly imaging the zzso profile after establishing the steady zzso
