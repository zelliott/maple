zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a relatively new technique for measuring brain function during resting and activated conditions with good spatial and zzso zzso Because of a robust and zzso zzso response to visual stimuli in the zzso cortex, many studies have been directed at visual zzso The methodology has been refined progressively to allow more accurate detection of the small zzso zzso and using zzso mapping zzso of cerebral activity have been displayed in a two-dimensional zzso Several factors zzso the zzso signal have been zzso zzso has been used to define the zzso representation of zzso boundaries and the zzso of higher visual functions in the zzso zzso Motion perception in area middle zzso zzso is zzso but eye movement studies are zzso The activated signal may have significant implications for our understanding of brain zzso but cerebral blood flow and zzso sensitive recordings after prolonged visual stimulation have given conflicting zzso zzso zzso can follow changes in cerebral activity during a progressive zzso illness and measure responses to zzso zzso planning in disorders such as zzso may be zzso
