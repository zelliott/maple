The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance zzso relative cerebral blood volume zzso maps for studying regional zzso changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Ten zzso patients were examined on a zzso T MR zzso Nine patients were investigated zzso and one patient zzso In the nine zzso patients, the dynamic plane was defined zzso through the zzso zzso For the zzso patient, an zzso dynamic plane was defined and the patient was scanned during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed in 8 of the 10 zzso Lower zzso of the left zzso was predicted by zzso maps in seven of the nine zzso zzso The mean ratios of zzso were zzso for left zzso matter and zzso for right zzso zzso The difference between these two ratios is statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso In two of the nine zzso zzso lobe zzso patients, lower zzso areas were observed in the right zzso In the zzso patient, the regional zzso map demonstrated increased blood volume in the zzso In eight of eight patients who underwent PET studies, MR zzso findings were consistent with PET zzso The results show that regional zzso changes in zzso can be evaluated with dynamic zzso MR zzso MR zzso maps are sensitive to characterize seizure zzso both zzso and zzso
