zzso clinical zzso 

To determine zzso treatment methods, and outcome in an institutional series of patients with spinal zzso not related to previous zzso 

The charts of all patients with spinal zzso treated in our institution between January 1993 and December 2002 were reviewed and analyzed with regard to location and extension of the zzso duration of symptoms, zzso status, diagnostic measures, therapy, and zzso 

Fifteen patients were identified with spinal zzso not caused by previous spine zzso There were 11 women and 4 zzso One zzso was located zzso and another zzso All other zzso were zzso with 10 spontaneous zzso Eight zzso were located in the zzso two in the zzso and three in the zzso zzso Two others were situated in the zzso zzso Mean extension was zzso segments zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso between onset of symptoms and surgery was 18 hours zzso zzso zzso for 12 zzso in 2 cases, diagnosis was made after 17 and 36 days, respectively, and then treated by zzso One patient was treated without zzso zzso treatment was accomplished in all cases by zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso in those cases with a larger extension of zzso zzso by an alternating zzso thus reducing the risk of zzso zzso There was no zzso No correlation between time to surgery and outcome was found in this study group, but there was a strong correlation between initial zzso status and outcome after zzso 

zzso derived spinal zzso are zzso In this series, most cases were spontaneous and located in the cervical or zzso region producing severe zzso deficit and zzso Treatment should be surgical zzso in the zzso As most zzso are of great extension, alternating zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso and supports the stability of the spinal zzso zzso is highly dependent from initial zzso zzso
