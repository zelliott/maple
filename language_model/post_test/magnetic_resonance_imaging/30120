The objective of our study was to test the hypothesis that the finding of zzso zzso signal intensity on zzso MR images soon after zzso status zzso is associated with subsequent zzso volume loss and persistent abnormal signal intensity on zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Eleven children zzso age, 25 zzso underwent initial zzso that included zzso zzso lobe imaging within 72 hours of zzso status zzso and follow-up imaging from 3 to 23 months later zzso 9 zzso A zzso blinded to clinical history graded initial and follow-up zzso signal intensity on a scale from 0 zzso to 4 zzso zzso Two blinded observers measured zzso volumes on initial and follow-up MR studies using commercially available software and volumes from 30 healthy children zzso age, zzso zzso zzso signal intensity and zzso volume changes were compared using Kendall zzso correlation zzso 

On initial imaging, zzso signal intensity ranging from 1 zzso zzso to 4 zzso zzso was seen in seven zzso Four children had at least one zzso with moderate or marked signal zzso three children had a zzso with mild or minimal zzso and four children had normal signal zzso The Kendall zzso correlation zzso between signal intensity increase and volume change was zzso zzso zzso zzso Five children zzso with zzso lobe zzso and two with complex partial zzso had zzso volume loss and increased signal intensity on follow-up imaging, meeting the criteria for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso findings of a markedly zzso zzso in children with zzso status zzso was highly associated with subsequent zzso zzso zzso
