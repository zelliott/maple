In this study, we used functional zzso zzso to investigate the pattern of cortical zzso after a simple motor task in patients with migraine and white matter zzso abnormalities on conventional zzso scans of the zzso We also investigated whether the extent of brain zzso was correlated with zzso structural pathology measured using diffusion zzso zzso zzso 

From 15 right-handed patients with migraine and 15 zzso and zzso right-handed healthy volunteers, we obtained the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the last 4 fingers of the right zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo scans, and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence to calculate zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso and cluster zzso We measured the volume, the average mean zzso zzso and the average fractional zzso of all zzso seen on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were also zzso 

Compared with healthy volunteers, migraine patients had a larger relative zzso of the zzso primary zzso zzso zzso and a zzso displacement of the supplementary motor area zzso The shapes of the zzso reflecting the time course for zzso signal intensity changes were similar between migraine patients and controls for all of the cortical areas we zzso Compared with healthy subjects, migraine patients had significantly lower zzso peak height of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which was found to be correlated with the extent of displacement of the supplementary motor area zzso zzso 

This study suggests that functional cortical changes occur in patients with migraine and brain zzso abnormalities and that they might be secondary to the extent of zzso structural zzso
