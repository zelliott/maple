zzso imaging of a zzso slice is zzso The vast difference in dimension between zzso size and the thickness of zzso slices would require an zzso zzso to produce a uniform zzso magnetic zzso field in a zzso plane with minimal zzso In this work a novel zzso zzso designed specifically for imaging a zzso slice was developed and zzso The experimental data demonstrate that the zzso is highly sensitive and capable of producing a uniform B1 field distribution in a zzso region of zzso zzso allowing for the acquisition of high-resolution zzso images and zzso maps from a zzso zzso zzso The image intensity and zzso zzso were directly compared with zzso zzso of the relative iron concentration of the same zzso This work demonstrates the feasibility of using a zzso zzso zzso to image thin slices of zzso diseased tissue to obtain a precise zzso comparison between stained tissue and MR zzso
