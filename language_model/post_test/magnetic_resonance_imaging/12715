Dedicated magnetic resonance imaging zzso protocol can diagnose zzso abnormalities in patients with intractable zzso However, it is not sufficiently sensitive to detect small zzso zzso that may result from infections, tumors, or vascular zzso This study aims to study the impact of the addition of zzso zzso weighted imaging zzso sequence to a dedicated zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with intractable zzso underwent zzso using conventional zzso protocol with addition of zzso zzso zzso of the images with and without these sequences was done for detection of zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso zzso findings were correlated either with zzso or computerized zzso zzso to confirm the presence of zzso 

In 16 patients the sequence gave additional information compared to conventional imaging zzso The sequence helped in better characterization of zzso in all zzso In three patients it helped in detecting the zzso and in another three it appeared useful as it best characterized the zzso Additional zzso were detected in two patients with old zzso zzso Important additional information was supplied in four patients, whereas in the remaining patients zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso sequence should form part of routine zzso protocol as it increases sensitivity by detecting zzso zzso zzso or vascular zzso that may be responsible for the patient's zzso This is especially important in patients from developing countries who have zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso and who undergo only zzso as the imaging zzso for intractable zzso
