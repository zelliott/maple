To investigate dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of advanced zzso lung cancer zzso patients treated with the zzso agent zzso combined with zzso and zzso as zzso zzso 

All patients were enrolled for zzso and zzso zzso zzso before and after the first three courses of zzso combination zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso were zzso for the main zzso zzso zzso analysis was obtained to evaluate changes of the internal tumor composition and for correlation with tumor response measured on zzso 

After three cycles of treatment, 11 patients showed decreased tumor size and a decreased value of all zzso zzso zzso Among these zzso there was a significant decrease of mean and standard zzso of the zzso zzso as well as a decrease of mean of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with larger mean values of rate constant zzso zzso zzso zzso and smaller standard zzso of volume of zzso zzso space fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso before chemotherapy were considered zzso for treatment zzso 

zzso zzso enables a functional analysis of the treatment response of zzso zzso zzso zzso has the potential to predict early treatment response of combined zzso zzso and zzso
