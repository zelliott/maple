To report the zzso characterization of zzso twins with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We studied a twin pair with an zzso 4 gene deletion in the zzso zzso Both twins had clinical and zzso examinations as well as structural zzso and zzso PET zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing was performed followed by zzso zzso in zzso 

Both twins zzso symptoms within 3 years of each other, with early zzso language, zzso and memory zzso zzso and zzso imaging demonstrated a zzso similar topography of findings with clear left zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in both were well below those from a normal population zzso 

Compared with the zzso seen in many families with zzso zzso these zzso twins demonstrated strong clinical, zzso and serum zzso level similarities, demonstrating the importance of shared genetic profiles beyond environmental influences in the symptomatic expression of the zzso
