Recent studies have shown that blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso fluctuations zzso during a zzso exhibit a high degree of correlation with other regions that share cognitive zzso zzso studies of zzso network mapping have focused primarily on major networks such as the default mode network, primary zzso zzso zzso and auditory zzso However, more specific or zzso including those associated with specific motor functions, have yet to be properly zzso We performed independent component analysis zzso in a specific target region of the brain, a process we name, zzso zzso We demonstrated that when zzso is applied to localized zzso data, it can be used to distinguish zzso zzso associated with specific motor functions zzso finger zzso foot movement, or bilateral lip zzso in the primary motor zzso These zzso components generated from localized data can then be used as functional regions of interest to map zzso zzso In addition, this method can be used to zzso zzso connectivity by expanding the localized region and identifying components that show connectivity between the two zzso
