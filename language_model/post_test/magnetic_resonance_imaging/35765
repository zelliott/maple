Forty patients with closed head trauma were evaluated zzso with CT and zzso MR imaging to compare the diagnostic zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso were detected in 38 zzso The severity of injury, as determined by the zzso zzso zzso ranged from 3 to zzso The sensitivities of CT and MR were calculated for all zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injury, cortical zzso zzso zzso injury, primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso diffuse zzso zzso zzso CT and MR zzso and zzso studies were both highly and comparably sensitive in the detection of zzso zzso zzso MR scans, however, were much more sensitive in detecting zzso zzso cortical zzso and diffuse zzso injury constituted zzso of all zzso zzso The sensitivities of the imaging techniques for this combined group of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso MR was also significantly better in detecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso The sensitivities of the diagnostic studies in the detection of zzso zzso were CT zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso was consistently seen with all three imaging studies, but zzso zzso was detected much more frequently with zzso In zzso MR has clear advantages over CT in evaluating closed head zzso Although its sensitivity in detecting zzso zzso is similar to that of CT, it is much better than CT in detecting zzso zzso which are more zzso MR is more useful than CT in zzso primary and secondary forms of injury and directing zzso zzso one advantage over MR is its ability to more rapidly assess unstable patients who may need zzso
