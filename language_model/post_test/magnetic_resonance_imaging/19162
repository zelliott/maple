To validate the ease of deployment and in zzso healing performance of a zzso zzso zzso using a canine zzso zzso aneurysm zzso 

zzso zzso were surgically created in 8 dogs by sewing a zzso patch onto the anterior side of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso System 1) were implanted zzso via the zzso route and deployed at the site of the zzso zzso zzso exclusion and zzso zzso were assessed by zzso after zzso and before animal sacrifice at scheduled periods ranging from 1 week to 3 zzso The zzso specimens were examined with magnetic resonance imaging zzso to study the position of the zzso with respect to the zzso zzso zzso analysis using light zzso and scanning electron zzso was performed to examine the inflammatory response and healing characteristics of the zzso 

Seven of 8 zzso were implanted zzso a bend occurred within the zzso zzso in 1 dog, which led to continued zzso of side zzso This zzso sealed spontaneously within 1 week, and complete exclusion of the zzso in all 8 animals continued throughout zzso At the time of zzso all devices were structurally intact and well positioned in the zzso zzso At 1 week, the zzso surface displayed a thin layer of zzso zzso which was gradually replaced by a zzso internal capsule with zzso cell coverage along both ends of the zzso at 2 and 3 zzso No exacerbated inflammatory reaction due to either the zzso wires or the zzso sleeve was observed after 3 months of zzso 

This short-term in zzso study of a zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the effective exclusion of zzso zzso with a satisfactory healing response and no excessive tissue or inflammatory zzso
