We describe an zzso system for zzso analysis followed by zzso of zzso features for the human cerebral zzso that takes as its starting point zzso zzso zzso This permits zzso between zzso and zzso zzso analysis and extends the functionality of many existing zzso zzso We demonstrate the utility of these operations in individual as well as to group zzso The methodology zzso analyses of cortical zzso data generated by manual and zzso zzso zzso routines (such as the program zzso with the procedures of the zzso program to generate a cortical ribbon of the zzso and perform cortical zzso zzso (including zzso surface area and zzso in individual subjects as well as in subject zzso This system allows the zzso of topographical cortical zzso for zzso data generated from manual and zzso zzso sources other than zzso These zzso can be regionally specific and integrated with systems of cortical zzso that subdivides the zzso into zzso zzso units zzso This system of topographical analysis of the cerebral zzso is consistent with current views of cortical development and neural systems organization of the human and zzso zzso zzso
