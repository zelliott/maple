The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso of zzso zzso assess the frequency of various magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso and emphasize zzso observations not commonly zzso 

A total of zzso consecutive knee MR imaging reports from a 22 month period were zzso reviewed for the presence of zzso zzso Two musculoskeletal zzso reviewed the cases where zzso were zzso A zzso zzso was considered present if zzso increased signal was identified within an enlarged zzso zzso zzso zzso or if a zzso zzso zzso with a clear connection to the adjacent zzso was identified zzso zzso zzso zzso or absence of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal intensity, patient age, sex, location of zzso cyst, presence of zzso zzso and size of the zzso zzso component were zzso All knee imaging examinations were performed on a zzso MR zzso Imaging findings were correlated with zzso reports when zzso 

A total of 167 cases zzso of zzso zzso were diagnosed in 161 zzso Of the 167 zzso 69 zzso were located in the lateral zzso and 98 zzso in the zzso zzso In 6 patients zzso zzso zzso were present in both zzso of the same zzso Twelve zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso zzso Of the total number of zzso zzso 104 zzso had a zzso zzso An isolated zzso zzso was present in 63 zzso zzso One hundred zzso of the zzso zzso components were zzso to fluid on zzso zzso zzso All zzso exhibited abnormal zzso zzso Only 14 zzso of the zzso components were zzso to fluid on zzso zzso zzso The zzso reports of 88 of the 161 zzso patients were available for review and zzso A tear extending to the zzso surface of the zzso was reported to be present in 74 of the 88 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the spectrum of findings and the relative frequency of various MR imaging characteristics as well as common potential pitfalls is important to the accurate diagnosis and management of zzso zzso In particular, controversy exists as to the zzso of zzso surface tears in association with zzso zzso with some authors reporting greater than zzso correlation with zzso Only zzso of zzso were associated with an zzso surface zzso zzso six percent of the zzso signal was zzso to fluid, only zzso of the zzso signal was zzso to zzso
