The zzso zzso occupies the zzso part of the inferior frontal zzso zzso stimulation or damage of this region interferes with language zzso The present study investigated the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso in 108 normal adult human cerebral zzso by means of magnetic resonance zzso The brain images were transformed into a standardized zzso zzso space zzso that of zzso and zzso in order to minimize zzso brain size zzso There was considerable zzso in the shape and location of the zzso zzso across brains and between cerebral zzso There was no significant difference or correlation between left and right zzso zzso matter zzso There was also no significant difference between sex and side of asymmetry of the zzso zzso A probability map of the zzso zzso was constructed by averaging its location and extent in each individual zzso brain into zzso space to aid in zzso of activity changes in functional zzso zzso
