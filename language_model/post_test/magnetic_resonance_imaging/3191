To evaluate the appearance of zzso dynamic zzso of small zzso cell zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso 

zzso patients with 28 small zzso were studied by both conventional spin echo and zzso dynamic zzso for tumor detection and zzso All tumors were detected by zzso CT and confirmed by zzso Dynamic zzso was performed using a zzso fast low angle shot technique after rapid injection of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of a zzso mass was done by the visual analysis of tumor zzso as well as quantitative assessment of the contrast noise ratio zzso and degree of zzso 

With conventional spin echo MR and dynamic zzso 18 and 26 of 28 small zzso were zzso zzso In the dynamic study the zzso zzso contrast was marked at zzso s after administration of zzso zzso The zzso zzso contrast in the dynamic study was more marked than that of zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso zzso 

zzso dynamic zzso is a useful technique for the diagnosis of small zzso especially in a patient with zzso zzso or zzso to zzso contrast zzso
