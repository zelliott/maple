To zzso liver zzso relaxation times before and after oxygen inhalation in patients with and without liver zzso using a 3 zzso zzso zzso 

Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent were zzso zzso zzso patients and 87 patients with zzso B viral liver zzso zzso zzso class A and 15 zzso class B or zzso underwent zzso with a zzso system before and after the supply of zzso oxygen at a rate of 15 zzso by means of a zzso ventilation mask for 3 zzso zzso maps were acquired using three-dimensional zzso zzso echo sequences with two different flip angles zzso and zzso and a fixed zzso zzso zzso zzso Liver zzso values were obtained using a zzso processing tool zzso zzso The mean baseline zzso values of three groups zzso zzso class A, and zzso class zzso were compared using an analysis of zzso zzso Liver zzso value before and after zzso was compared using a paired zzso for each zzso 

The baseline liver zzso value was significantly higher in the control group zzso zzso 136 zzso than in zzso A zzso zzso 143 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso The reduction in the liver zzso value after oxygen inhalation was significant in the control group zzso zzso zzso but not significant in zzso class A zzso zzso zzso and zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The baseline liver zzso relaxation time was significantly different between the patients with and without liver zzso The zzso effect of oxygen on the liver zzso value was significant in the control group but not in the zzso zzso
