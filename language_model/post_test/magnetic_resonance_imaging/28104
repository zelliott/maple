The zzso scans of 57 patients with Ewing or zzso and 34 patients with zzso zzso or zzso fractures were examined in order to determine whether a distinction between benign or zzso zzso is zzso Four criteria were zzso the margin of the bone zzso zzso intensity and zzso of the zzso weighted signal in the bone zzso presence of an zzso structured soft tissue mass and/or soft tissue zzso It was found that central zzso and Ewing's zzso reduced signal intensity of the zzso to become zzso with a zzso zzso In acute zzso zzso and zzso fracture the zzso zzso was not sharply zzso In contrast to patients with bone zzso only one case of zzso showed an zzso structured soft tissue zzso On the basis of these findings we believe that acute zzso zzso can be distinguished with high degree of accuracy from Ewing's zzso and central zzso
