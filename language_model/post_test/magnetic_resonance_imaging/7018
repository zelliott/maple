zzso processing within the human brain takes place within two distinct and parallel zzso the lateral and zzso pain zzso Current knowledge indicates that the lateral system is involved in processing the zzso aspects of pain, and that the zzso system is involved in processing the zzso aspects of zzso zzso differences in brain zzso zzso during zzso processing were studied to further clarify the division of function between the lateral and zzso pain zzso zzso zzso was studied by applying painful zzso laser stimuli of zzso duration zzso to the left and right zzso lower calves of five normal right-handed human zzso The zzso brain activity was measured using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, by determining significant changes in blood oxygen level dependent zzso signal and applying a general linear zzso zzso Volumes of interest were defined for the primary and secondary zzso zzso zzso and zzso the insular cortex, and the thalamus, on individual subjects' high-resolution structural zzso zzso zzso was zzso by comparing the level of zzso between brain zzso within each volume of zzso In zzso no significant zzso difference in zzso was zzso In the zzso zzso was significantly greater in the left zzso than the zzso In both zzso and the thalamus, zzso in response to painful stimulation was significantly greater in the zzso zzso to the zzso which is consistent with these areas being involved in processing the zzso aspects of zzso
