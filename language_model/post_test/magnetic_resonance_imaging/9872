zzso stimuli have been shown to zzso engage initial attention but their sustained effects on neural processing remain largely zzso The present study evaluated whether emotional faces engage sustained neural processing by examining the zzso of neural repetition suppression to repeated emotional zzso zzso suppression of neural function refers to the general reduction of neural activity when processing a repeated zzso zzso processing of emotional face zzso however, should elicit sustained neural processing such that repetition suppression to repeated emotional faces is attenuated relative to faces with no emotional zzso We measured the reduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging signals associated with immediate repetition of neutral, angry and happy zzso Whereas neutral faces zzso the greatest suppression in zzso visual cortex, followed by angry faces, repetition suppression was the most attenuated for happy zzso Indeed, happy faces showed almost no repetition suppression in part of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which play an important role in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that happy faces are associated with sustained visual zzso of face identity and thereby assist in the formation of more elaborate representations of the faces, zzso with findings in the behavioral zzso
