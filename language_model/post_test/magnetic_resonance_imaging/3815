zzso zzso zzso has been used repeatedly in zzso studies to investigate regional gray matter zzso zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso In zzso trials, zzso variations might interfere with the detection of zzso structural zzso thereby potentially limiting the use of zzso Here we evaluated zzso zzso differences and zzso zzso of regional zzso in zzso using zzso zzso and follow up zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data of 248 zzso zzso zzso patients, recruited in two clinical centers, zzso zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso median disease duration 150 zzso zzso were acquired on two different zzso MR zzso zzso volume changes between baseline and year 2 while controlling for age, zzso disease zzso and global zzso volume were zzso The main effect of time on regional zzso volume was larger in data of center two as compared to center one in most of the brain zzso zzso effects of zzso volume reductions occurred in a number of zzso regions of both zzso in particular in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso P corrected zzso zzso zzso effects were found zzso in the zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso and zzso frontal zzso zzso P corrected zzso The differential effects were smaller as compared to the overall effects in these zzso These results suggest that the effects of different scanners on zzso zzso volume differences were rather small and thus allow pooling of MR data and subsequent combined image zzso
