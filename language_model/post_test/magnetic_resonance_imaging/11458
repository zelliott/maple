Eight volunteers underwent zzso during passive listening to click zzso Using a zzso approach, zzso profiles across the frequency band considered zzso zzso were zzso Several cerebral structures outside the zzso pathways and target areas displayed distinct zzso patterns each: zzso profiles resembling zzso zzso zzso or zzso filtered zzso zzso signal series emerged at the level of the anterior zzso zzso like characteristics (center zzso zzso zzso were observed within the left inferior frontal zzso and click train rates zzso 4 zzso yielded enhanced zzso of the right zzso zzso A variety of clinical and experimental data indicate that the left and right cerebral zzso act as zzso and zzso zzso respectively, on auditory input zzso filtering by frequency zzso In light of the present zzso data, the anterior zzso contributes to the assumed double filtering by frequency zzso Furthermore, these zzso areas seem to join up with the right zzso and the left inferior frontal zzso to a network zzso zzso functions within the zzso zzso
