A previous study indicated that adults with attention deficit zzso disorder zzso had a decreased zzso between the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and the default mode network zzso In this study, we investigated whether children with zzso also show a decreased zzso between the zzso and the zzso We also explored the zzso characteristics of the zzso functional connectivity zzso of the zzso with the zzso in children with zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from a zzso scanner in 19 zzso boys with zzso and 23 zzso Compared with normal controls, the zzso in boys with zzso showed a significantly decreased negative zzso with the zzso including the zzso prefrontal zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso strength between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly negative correlation with age in normal controls, but not in boys with zzso This decreased zzso may suggest an abnormal balance or interaction between zzso and intrinsic zzso Our age-related analysis suggested an abnormal development pattern of the zzso interaction in zzso
