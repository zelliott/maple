zzso zzso contributes to clinical disability in the acquired zzso disease multiple zzso zzso zzso occurs during acute attacks, associated with zzso and during the chronic progressive phase of the disease in which inflammation is not zzso To explore the importance of interactions between zzso and zzso in the zzso we zzso the brains of zzso and humans with a zzso zzso in the gene zzso the major zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso previously zzso zzso analyses of the zzso of zzso zzso mice and of autopsy material from patients with zzso zzso zzso were performed to evaluate zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso zzso patients was conducted to measure levels of zzso zzso zzso a marker of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso was identified in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso MRS of zzso patients showed reduced zzso levels, consistent with zzso zzso Analysis of patients' brain tissue also demonstrated a zzso pattern of zzso loss without significant zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs in humans as well as mice lacking the major zzso protein zzso This zzso is zzso similar to that found in the zzso of patients with the inherited zzso zzso zzso but is not associated with significant zzso zzso of zzso zzso interactions thus probably causes this zzso zzso A similar mechanism may be responsible for zzso zzso and clinical disability that occur in patients with multiple zzso
