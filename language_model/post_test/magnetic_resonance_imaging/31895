Prior hypotheses in functional brain imaging are often formulated by constraining the data analysis to regions of interest zzso In this context, this approach yields higher sensitivity than whole brain zzso which could be particularly important in drug development studies and clinical decision zzso Here we systematically examine the effects of different zzso definition criteria on the results zzso from a zzso pharmacological zzso experiment, with the aim of zzso sensitivity and providing a recommended procedure for similar zzso In order to achieve this, we compared different criteria for selecting both anatomical and functional zzso zzso zzso were defined zzso specifically for each subject, zzso at group level, and zzso using a zzso atlas, in order to assess the effects of zzso anatomical zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso both for each subject and at group level, by zzso selecting the zzso with the highest zzso from each study session, and zzso selecting an inclusive union of significantly active zzso across all zzso A single value was used to zzso the response within each zzso For anatomical zzso we used the mean of the zzso estimates zzso zzso of either all zzso or the top zzso active zzso For zzso we used the mean beta value of all zzso zzso the zzso The results were assessed in terms of the achieved sensitivity in detecting the experimental zzso The use of zzso anatomical zzso combined with a summary value calculated from the top zzso fraction of active zzso was the most reliable and sensitive approach for detecting the experimental zzso The use of zzso from individual sessions introduced unacceptable biases in the results, while the use of union zzso yielded a lower sensitivity than anatomical zzso For these reasons, zzso should be employed with caution when it is not possible to make clear anatomical prior zzso
