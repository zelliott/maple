Blind individuals may learn to understand zzso synthetic speech at a rate of up to about 25 syllables per second zzso an accomplishment by far exceeding the maximum performance level of zzso listeners zzso zzso The present study indicates that this exceptional skill engages distinct regions of the zzso zzso zzso brain zzso during listening to zzso (8 zzso and zzso speech (16 zzso was measured in a blind individual and six zzso zzso zzso speech activated zzso and anterior zzso zzso in all zzso Regarding zzso tokens, the controls showed exclusive zzso of zzso regions whereas the blind participant exhibited enhanced left inferior frontal and zzso responses as well as significant zzso zzso of left zzso zzso zzso and right primary visual zzso Since left zzso is known to be involved in zzso processing, this structure, presumably, provides the functional link between the zzso and zzso zzso
