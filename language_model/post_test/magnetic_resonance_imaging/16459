Over the past several years, increased attention has been devoted to understanding regionally selective brain changes that occur in zzso disease and their relationships to zzso zzso Clinical progression is also heterogeneous, and although zzso repeat length influences age of zzso its role, if any, in progression has been less zzso We evaluated progression in zzso disease using a novel zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso Our hypothesis was that the rate of brain zzso is influenced by the age of onset of zzso zzso We scanned 22 patients with zzso disease at approximately zzso zzso individuals were divided into 1 of 3 groups, determined by the relative age of zzso We found significant differences in the rates of zzso of cortex, white matter, and zzso zzso patients who developed symptoms earlier demonstrated the most rapid rates of zzso compared with those who developed symptoms during middle age or more advanced zzso Rates of cortical zzso were zzso zzso with the most rapid changes occurring in zzso zzso zzso and portions of the zzso zzso There were no significant differences in the rates of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Although both zzso repeat length and age influenced the rate of change in some regions, there was no significant correlation in many zzso Rates of regional brain zzso seem to be influenced by the age of onset of zzso disease symptoms and are only partially explained by zzso repeat zzso These findings suggest that other zzso zzso and environmental factors play important roles in zzso in zzso zzso
