We sought to identify central zzso that activate in response to visceral stimuli zzso and zzso We had a particular interest in observing the anterior zzso zzso and frontal zzso in zzso and in patients with zzso disease, including inflammatory zzso disease zzso and irritable zzso syndrome zzso 

zzso underwent zzso balloon zzso to a sensation of stool and to a sensation of pain while undergoing blood zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso were conducted in a zzso zzso whole body magnet with a zzso zzso console and a zzso head zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso slices designed to zzso coverage of areas believed to be responsive to noxious stimulation were zzso zzso were detected by using zzso maps zzso zzso zzso for individual zzso The experimental groups were compared using both an analysis of zzso and profile zzso 

A significantly higher percentage of zzso activated in the anterior zzso zzso over both pain and stool conditions for the control group than for the zzso group and for the zzso group than for the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso of left zzso zzso was greater for the zzso group than for the zzso group and greater for the zzso group than for the controls zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in controls compared with disease groups bordered on statistical zzso Profile analysis of the three groups across six regions of interest revealed that the control and zzso groups were distinguished by different profiles of response zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluation of the data suggests that, among the zzso in the anterior zzso zzso to pain, there are two patterns of response to zzso and zzso This was true for both controls and disease zzso 

zzso controls and subjects with zzso and zzso share similar zzso of zzso to visceral sensations of stool and zzso Both zzso and zzso of particular regions of interest differentiate the three groups, as do profiles of patterned response across six of the regions of interest for the control and zzso zzso
