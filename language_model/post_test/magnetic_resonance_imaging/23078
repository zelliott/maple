The amount of zzso is closely related to survival in brain zzso To enhance zzso especially zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been zzso The aim of this zzso zzso study was to test if zzso 3-D ultrasound likewise can be used for zzso zzso 

16 patients, who underwent surgery for zzso zzso in zzso brain areas, were initially included into this prospective zzso In two patients, the small size of the zzso hindered zzso ultrasound zzso In 14 patients, 3-D ultrasound images were obtained before and after opening of the zzso during zzso zzso prior to evaluation by a blinded investigator for identification of zzso zzso and after zzso zzso Seven patients were zzso to complete zzso removal according to the impression of the surgeon zzso zzso Seven patients were zzso to incomplete zzso removal zzso remnant zzso zzso zzso in these patients, the zzso intentionally left a zzso remnant prior to evaluation by the blinded zzso The zzso remnant was then zzso It was tested if 3-D ultrasound can correctly identify complete and incomplete zzso zzso All patients underwent early zzso zzso 

In two patients (one each of the two zzso the image quality was too poor for a meaningful zzso zzso In the six patients zzso for incomplete zzso zzso 3-D ultrasound correctly identified zzso remnants in four patients zzso In six patients zzso for complete zzso zzso 3-D ultrasound confirmed complete zzso zzso in three zzso In addition, 3-D ultrasound identified correctly one zzso remnant in a patient zzso for complete zzso zzso Thus, the sensitivity for zzso remnant detection increased to zzso (five of seven zzso and that of confirmation of complete zzso removal was 60 % (three of five zzso 

The number of investigated patients is still to low to allow zzso zzso However, the study results suggest, that 3-D ultrasound is especially helpful for detection of overseen brain zzso zzso
