To investigate whether patients with zzso zzso have normal motor unit recruitment in relation to muscle metabolism during exhausting exercise and recovery, and whether the reduced voluntary muscle force normally seen is related to a smaller muscle zzso 

Female patients with zzso and sedentary controls were examined using simultaneous zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and surface zzso zzso during exhaustive zzso exercise of the anterior zzso muscle and during zzso The maximum voluntary contraction force was estimated, and the maximum cross zzso muscle area was evaluated using zzso zzso zzso The sedentary controls were matched to patients for sex, age and, as far as possible, daily physical activity zzso 

Patients with zzso had reduced maximum voluntary contraction force in relation to the sedentary controls, despite having similar muscle zzso In general the zzso relation during exercise and recovery was normal in patients with zzso 

The less extreme changes in motor unit recruitment and metabolism during exhaustive exercise indicated a lower exercise tolerance that could be connected with the lower physical activity zzso
