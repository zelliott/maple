This zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study investigates the balance of negative and positive zzso signals in the zzso A set of visual attention zzso and working memory zzso tasks with graded levels of difficulty was used to zzso separate but overlapping networks that include the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions commonly associated with auditory and emotional zzso Brain zzso zzso signal change and zzso was larger for VA tasks than for zzso tasks, but zzso was larger for zzso zzso zzso increases of blood zzso zzso zzso responses for different levels of task difficulty zzso strongly in the zzso network during VA but less so during zzso The zzso of the zzso network across different cognitive tasks supports the hypothesis that global cerebral blood flow vary across different tasks, but not between different levels of task difficulty of the same zzso The zzso balance of zzso and zzso might allow zzso of resources for the activated zzso
