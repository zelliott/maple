Several recent zzso studies have provided data consistent with functional abnormalities in anterior zzso zzso in zzso stress disorder zzso In our study, we implemented a cognitive zzso paradigm to test the functional integrity of anterior zzso zzso in zzso 

Eight Vietnam combat veterans with zzso zzso Group) and eight Vietnam combat veterans without zzso zzso Group) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while performing the zzso Counting zzso In separate conditions, subjects counted the number of zzso zzso generally negative zzso zzso and neutral zzso words presented on a screen and pressed a button indicating their zzso 

In the Combat versus General zzso comparison, the zzso group exhibited significant zzso blood zzso zzso signal increases in zzso anterior zzso cortex, but the zzso group did zzso 

These findings suggest a diminished response in zzso anterior zzso zzso in the presence of emotionally relevant stimuli in zzso We speculate that diminished recruitment of this region in zzso may, in part, mediate symptoms such as distress and zzso upon exposure to reminders of zzso
