We tested the reliability and construct zzso of the zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scale for the evaluation of zzso knees and zzso and compared the diagnostic performance of zzso and plain film zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR images of knees zzso and zzso zzso were obtained from boys (age range zzso years; mean 11 zzso in two zzso zzso zzso Europe, zzso The MR images were independently read by four blinded zzso on two zzso Number of previous joint zzso and laboratory level of severity of zzso were the reference standards for imaging zzso Both components of the zzso scale demonstrated high zzso and zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso scale, zzso and zzso additive zzso scale, zzso and zzso zzso The correlation between the zzso domain of the zzso scale and patient's age was zzso Otherwise, correlations between A- and zzso and clinical laboratory zzso were zzso The areas under the curve zzso used for discrimination of disease severity were similar for the A- and zzso zzso used for mild disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for severe disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences were noted between the zzso of the zzso and zzso scales used for discrimination of late zzso changes; zzso scales performed better for discrimination of early zzso In conclusion, both zzso scales demonstrated excellent zzso poor zzso zzso and moderate and excellent zzso for discrimination of mild and severe diseases zzso Compared with zzso scores, the zzso scales performed better for discrimination of early zzso zzso
