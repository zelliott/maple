The zzso space is a deep neck space susceptible to a host of disease zzso zzso access to this space is technically difficult and associated with potential zzso An zzso zzso aspiration zzso zzso if proven accurate and safe, would be of great benefit as an alternative diagnostic approach to this zzso This study reports on the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso for diagnostic evaluation of zzso zzso Technical details of needle systems, approach to this space, and reliability of this method are zzso 

This is a prospective study of 14 patients with zzso zzso who underwent zzso zzso biopsy at the University of California at Los Angeles Center for the Health Sciences between October 1989 and October zzso 

A zzso open magnet was used to obtain magnetic resonance images of each zzso zzso After standard skin preparation a zzso needle system was used to reach and sample the zzso In most instances, the zzso was immediately stained and examined by a zzso for zzso before removing the patient from the zzso 

Eleven of 14 zzso patients had diagnostic aspirations; only 2 of these 11 patients required additional surgical biopsy for more specific zzso characterization of their zzso before definitive treatment recommendations were zzso All aspiration procedures were well tolerated and without any zzso 

We have demonstrated that zzso approach to the zzso is zzso safe, and sensitive enough to zzso the need for open zzso in a large percentage of zzso
