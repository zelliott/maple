zzso zzso Although many of the zzso State zzso zzso limitations are well accepted among zzso zzso and other interested clinicians and researchers, its continued use in zzso unsound ways suggests that additional investigation and dissemination of information are sorely zzso The authors aimed to describe the reliability and zzso of the zzso as a measure of cognitive function among healthy older zzso 

The authors examined zzso performance in 124 zzso and zzso zzso older adults zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso All participants were administered an extensive zzso battery composed of measures of attention, executive function, memory, and zzso zzso A subset of 99 participants also underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso reliability was examined among 65 participants who underwent repeat zzso testing over an average zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso correlation for total zzso scores was r S zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso was r S zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for Word Recall was r S zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Total zzso performance correlated significantly with a minority of zzso tests and zzso zzso of white matter disease and brain zzso A subset of zzso of participants demonstrated inappropriate intrusion of zzso Pentagon Copy during another test of zzso zzso 

Overall, zzso scores exhibited ceiling effects, poor zzso zzso limited sensitivity to subtle brain zzso and a high rate of intrusion elsewhere in the zzso zzso Individual zzso items demonstrated poor construct zzso These qualities illustrate the serious limitations of the zzso in detecting individual differences in cognitive function among healthy older zzso
