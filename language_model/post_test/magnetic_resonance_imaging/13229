Blood flow in a steady magnetic field has been of great interest over recent zzso Many researchers have examined the effects of magnetic fields on zzso profiles and zzso pressure, and major studies have focused on steady or zzso zzso In this paper, we present a solution for zzso zzso blood flow with a somewhat realistic zzso pressure wave obtained using a zzso lumped zzso A pressure zzso is derived along a rigid vessel placed at the output of a zzso module which receives the zzso zzso Then, zzso profile and flow rate expressions are derived in the rigid vessel in the presence of a steady zzso magnetic zzso As expected, results showed flow zzso and zzso The zzso of our solution approach allowed a comparison with previously addressed flow cases and calculations presented a good zzso with those well established zzso
