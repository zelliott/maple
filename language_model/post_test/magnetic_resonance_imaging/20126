zzso can readily and effortlessly perceive a rich, stable, and unified visual world from a complex visual zzso Yet our internal representation of a visual object appears to be sparse and zzso How and where in the brain are such fragmented representations organized into a whole zzso Recent studies have accumulated evidence that some global feature integration is zzso at the early stage of visual zzso However, the spatial operating range of the integration still remains zzso The present human functional magnetic resonance imaging study provides support that the global integration process in early visual areas, including even the primary visual area zzso is zzso beyond the separated projection of visual zzso from right and left sides of the fixation to the visual zzso of the zzso cerebral zzso zzso neural responses corresponding to a visual target were significantly enhanced when another target was simultaneously presented at the zzso position in the zzso visual field zzso The result makes a convincing case that the contextual effects involve feedback from higher areas, because there are no direct zzso connections that allow such zzso contextual zzso This enhancement from the zzso zzso may help rapid zzso detection of a circular pattern, which may be special among visual structures because of its ubiquity in natural zzso Early visual areas as well as higher ones may play a more essential role in zzso the unity of the real world than previously zzso
