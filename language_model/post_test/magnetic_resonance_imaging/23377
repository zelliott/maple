Patients with zzso zzso zzso are insulin resistant with an increase in visceral fat mass zzso Whether this holds true when sedentary control subjects zzso are matched for waist has not been zzso zzso replacement therapy zzso results in a decrease in zzso Whether the decrease in zzso is mainly related to a reduction in visceral zzso remains to be zzso The aim was to separately assess visceral and subcutaneous zzso in relation to insulin resistance zzso in zzso patients before and after zzso and in sedentary zzso 

Ten patients with zzso were investigated before and 6 months after zzso zzso zzso matched for age, zzso body mass index, and waist were zzso Exercise capacity was measured as zzso using an incremental work load on a zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso were measured using zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso by the zzso model assessment of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients had a zzso lower zzso but did not have increased subcutaneous and visceral zzso compared with zzso zzso resulted in a similar relative decrease in subcutaneous and visceral zzso Compared with zzso zzso patients showed a lower zzso zzso tended to increase zzso 

zzso for waist and separate assessment of visceral and subcutaneous zzso may be critical in the evaluation of body composition and zzso in zzso patients before and after zzso
