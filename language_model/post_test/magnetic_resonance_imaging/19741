zzso zzso and zzso are common phenomena in zzso and may be responsible for reduced fertility in cases of minimal or mild extent of zzso Since a high prevalence of zzso zzso has been well documented in association with zzso we designed a study to examine whether zzso and zzso are caused by the zzso itself or by the zzso component of the zzso 

A prospective zzso zzso 

University hospital, Department of zzso and zzso Division of zzso Medicine and zzso zzso with 300 in zzso zzso zzso injection cycles and 350 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso subjects with zzso and with zzso proven zzso and patent zzso zzso Thirty-five subjects zzso additionally showed signs of zzso 

All subjects underwent zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso during the subsequent zzso zzso zzso revealed the extent of the zzso component of the disease and the integrity of zzso transport capacity was evaluated by zzso 

zzso of zzso on zzso transport capacity in zzso 

In 35 of the 41 subjects zzso with zzso signs of zzso were detected using zzso zzso Two of six zzso subjects with no zzso zzso I) showed zzso and zzso compared with 14 of 24 zzso women with focal zzso zzso zzso and 10 of 11 zzso women with diffuse zzso zzso showed a failure in transport capacity and two zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso is associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso transport zzso However, zzso is of even more importance, especially when diffuse zzso is zzso Both forms of zzso are commonly found in subjects with mild to moderate zzso We suggest that the extent of the zzso component in subjects with zzso explains much of the reduced fertility in subjects with intact zzso zzso
