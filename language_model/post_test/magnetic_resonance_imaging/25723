To describe the MR findings in the zzso zzso area in children with zzso cell zzso and to define those MR zzso especially associated with the risk of developing diabetes zzso 

The zzso axis was studied by zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR imaging in 14 children with zzso cell zzso (five with diabetes zzso and in 28 zzso controls, ages zzso zzso 

The zzso stalk was thicker in zzso patients (three with diabetes zzso than in controls zzso less than zzso Bright zzso zzso signal was zzso in children with diabetes zzso and in zzso without diabetes zzso 

zzso of the zzso and/or the zzso stalk in the absence of the zzso zzso bright signal is seen in children with zzso cell zzso with overt diabetes zzso Those zzso cell zzso patients without diabetes zzso but showing thickened stalk with or without zzso zzso bright signal could be at high risk to develop diabetes zzso
