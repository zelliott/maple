The classic imaging geometry for zzso zzso is for the collection of zzso projections and the reconstruction of a global image, with the zzso transform as the theoretical foundation that is zzso zzso Recently, interior zzso research has led to theoretically exact relationships between localities in the projection and image spaces and practically promising reconstruction zzso Initially, interior zzso was developed for zzso zzso zzso Then, it was elevated to have the status of a general imaging zzso Finally, a novel framework known as zzso is being developed for a grand fusion of multiple imaging zzso allowing zzso zzso of diversified zzso
