Several lines of research suggest a zzso of reversal learning zzso and punishment processing, and affective zzso in patients with major depressive disorder zzso zzso disorder zzso is also characterized by abnormal reversal learning, and is often zzso with zzso However, zzso distinctions between the disorders are zzso zzso zzso zzso studies comparing zzso and zzso directly are zzso 

Twenty zzso zzso patients with zzso 20 zzso zzso patients with zzso and 27 healthy controls performed a zzso reversal learning task in an zzso design during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Compared with healthy controls, both zzso and zzso patients displayed prolonged mean reaction times zzso but normal zzso In zzso subjects, mean zzso were correlated with disease zzso Imaging results showed zzso zzso in the anterior zzso during punishment processing and in the zzso during reward zzso Moreover, blood oxygen zzso zzso responses in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and the anterior zzso during affective switching showed a linear decrease across controls, zzso and zzso Finally, the zzso group showed blunted responsiveness of the zzso zzso loop during zzso and in the zzso and anterior zzso during affective zzso 

This study shows zzso and zzso functional abnormalities during reversal learning in zzso in the context of generic zzso zzso These data zzso with currently influential models on the zzso of zzso Moreover, this study reports differential neural patterns in zzso and zzso structures on this task between zzso and zzso confirming previous findings regarding the neural zzso of deficient reversal learning in zzso
