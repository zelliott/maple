To systematically assess the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging zzso to differentiate patients with zzso zzso from patients with zzso back pain and healthy volunteers, using a standardized evaluation of MR images of the zzso zzso 

Five readers blinded to the patients and diagnoses independently assessed zzso scans zzso and STIR zzso of the zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso 75 patients with zzso zzso zzso symptom duration zzso 10 zzso 27 patients with zzso inflammatory back pain zzso mean symptom duration 29 zzso 26 patients with zzso back pain, and 59 healthy control zzso all participants were age 45 years or zzso Bone zzso zzso fat zzso zzso and zzso were recorded according to standardized definitions using an online data entry zzso We calculated sensitivity, zzso and positive and negative likelihood ratios zzso for the diagnosis of zzso based on global assessment of the zzso zzso 

zzso utility was high for all 5 readers, both for patients with AS zzso zzso specificity zzso positive zzso zzso and for patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso positive zzso zzso zzso utility based solely on detection of bone zzso zzso enhanced sensitivity zzso for patients with zzso but reduced specificity zzso detection of zzso in addition to bone zzso zzso further enhanced sensitivity zzso without changing zzso A single zzso of the zzso joint on zzso was observed in up to zzso of control zzso 

This systematic and standardized evaluation of zzso zzso in patients with zzso showed that zzso has much greater diagnostic utility than has been documented zzso We present for the first time a zzso definition of zzso zzso for zzso
