We investigated how visual and linguistic information interact in the perception of zzso We borrowed a phenomenon from film theory which states that presentation of an as such neutral visual scene zzso the zzso of fear or suspense induced by a different channel of information, such as zzso Our main aim was to investigate how neutral visual scenes can enhance responses to fearful language content in parts of the brain involved in the perception of zzso Healthy zzso brain activity was measured zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso while they read fearful and less fearful sentences presented with or without a neutral visual zzso The main idea is that the visual scenes intensify the fearful content of the language by subtly zzso and zzso what is described in the zzso zzso levels in the right anterior zzso pole were selectively increased when a neutral visual scene was paired with a fearful sentence, compared to reading the sentence alone, as well as to reading of zzso sentences presented with the same neutral zzso We conclude that the right anterior zzso pole serves a binding function of emotional information across zzso such as visual and linguistic zzso
