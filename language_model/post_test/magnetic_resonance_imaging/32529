zzso responses to unfamiliar non-native zzso varying in the extent to which they can be articulated were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Both superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso areas were activated by passive speech perception, and both distinguished non-native from native zzso with greater signal change in response to non-native zzso Furthermore, zzso motor regions and superior zzso sites were functionally zzso However, only in auditory areas did activity zzso with the zzso of non-native zzso These data suggest that auditory areas are crucial for the transformation from acoustic signal to phonetic code, but the motor system also plays an active role, which may involve the internal generation of candidate zzso zzso These zzso zzso would then be compared to the acoustic input in auditory zzso The data suggest that speech perception is neither purely sensory nor zzso but rather a zzso zzso
