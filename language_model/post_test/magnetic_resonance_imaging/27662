The visual front-end of reading is most often associated with zzso zzso The left zzso zzso zzso seems to be zzso tuned for letter string and word zzso In contrast, little is known of the mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso the processing of character strings regardless of character zzso While the superior zzso zzso has been shown to be involved in multiple letter processing, further data is necessary to extend these results to zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to identify the neural zzso of zzso character string processing independently of character zzso Fourteen skilled adult readers carried out multiple and single element visual categorization tasks with zzso zzso and zzso zzso characters under zzso The role of zzso zzso in multiple element processing was further zzso with a zzso defined anatomical regions of interest zzso Participants activated zzso zzso zzso more strongly for multiple than single element zzso zzso analyses showed that bilateral zzso was more strongly activated for multiple than single element processing, regardless of character zzso In contrast, no multiple element specific activity was found in inferior zzso zzso These results suggests that zzso mechanisms are involved in zzso character string zzso We argue that in general, zzso mechanisms are involved in visual word recognition, as an early step of word visual zzso
