There is a recent trend towards zzso resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and diffusion zzso zzso for brain connectivity zzso as motivated by how estimates from these zzso are presumably two views reflecting the same underlying brain zzso In this paper, we show on a cohort of 60 subjects that conventional functional connectivity zzso estimates based on zzso correlation and anatomical connectivity zzso estimates based on fiber counts are actually not that highly correlated for typical zzso zzso 7 zzso and zzso zzso 32 zzso zzso zzso The zzso correlation can be significantly increased by considering sparse partial correlation and modeling fiber zzso uncertainty, but the resulting zzso correlation is still rather low in absolute zzso We further exemplify the inconsistencies between zzso and zzso estimates by zzso them as zzso into zzso detection and demonstrating significant differences in their detection zzso zzso we illustrate that these inconsistencies can be useful in zzso integration for improving brain connectivity zzso
