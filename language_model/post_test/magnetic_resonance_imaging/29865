Whole brain tissue volume decreases in schizophrenia have been related to both genetic risk factors and zzso zzso zzso zzso however, whether genetic and environmental risk factors in the brains of patients with schizophrenia are zzso reflected in gray or white matter volume change is not zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso brain scans of 11 zzso and 11 zzso zzso twin pairs zzso for schizophrenia were acquired and compared with 11 zzso and 11 zzso zzso healthy control twin zzso 

zzso volume analysis of zzso revealed decreased whole brain volume in the patients with schizophrenia as compared with their zzso and with healthy twin zzso zzso white matter volume was found in zzso twin pairs compared with healthy twin pairs, particularly in the zzso twin zzso A decrease in gray matter was found in the patients compared with their zzso and compared with the healthy zzso 

The results suggest that the decreases in white matter volume reflect the increased genetic risk to develop zzso whereas the decreases in gray matter volume are related to environmental risk zzso Study of genes involved in the zzso of white matter structures may be particularly fruitful in zzso
