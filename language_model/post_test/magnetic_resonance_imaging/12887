zzso of right zzso zzso volume, function and mass has been challenging because of its unique cavity zzso However, it is zzso especially in patients with signs of zzso heart failure and those with zzso heart zzso Thus, many investigations on the RV have been published to this zzso Although clinical investigations of the RV have been focused on the use of zzso zzso zzso progressive development of three-dimensional zzso zzso has made it possible to evaluate the RV in clinical settings zzso 

zzso of newly developed real-time zzso zzso for determining RV volume and function has been reported with the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso A slight but significant zzso of zzso derived RV volumes by zzso zzso methods have been found in multiple recent human zzso One of the zzso studies rightly reported the importance of technical factors, causing the inaccuracy of zzso zzso 

Despite the development of new real-time zzso zzso systems, there still exist limitations in clinical settings due to technical zzso Thus, the combination of conventional zzso and zzso methods and zzso zzso is recommended in the evaluation of the RV at the present zzso
