To study blood flow characteristics through the internal jugular veins zzso at the cervical levels zzso and zzso in the neck of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging at zzso was performed on 323 zzso zzso Phase contrast imaging was used to zzso blood flow at both the zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso flow zzso was zzso by total zzso flow zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso and zzso zzso MR zzso were performed to assess zzso zzso Based on this assessment, the zzso population was divided into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Of all the patients, 100 zzso belonged to the zzso group and 223 zzso belonged to the ST zzso At the zzso and zzso levels, the zzso zzso of the ST group was zzso and zzso zzso This was significantly lower than that of the zzso group, zzso and zzso zzso zzso percent and zzso of the zzso group had a zzso zzso of less than 50% at the zzso and zzso levels, compared to 37% and zzso for the ST zzso The zzso was smaller for the secondary and primary progressive zzso patients than the zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), while the zzso was similar among all zzso zzso 

Total blood flow through the zzso at both the zzso and zzso levels was reduced in the ST group compared to the zzso zzso
