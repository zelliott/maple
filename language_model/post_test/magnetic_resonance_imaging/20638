zzso spike zzso in children can be fixed in specific brain regions or migrate over zzso We analyzed zzso zzso from 463 zzso children to determine outcome differences between those with fixed zzso zzso and those with migrated zzso zzso on at least three zzso over zzso All zzso spike zzso were classified as zzso zzso central, zzso or zzso zzso directions were divided into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cases met the inclusion criteria: 24 zzso zzso and 55 zzso zzso More patients in the zzso than in the zzso group required multiple zzso drugs zzso and had abnormal image findings zzso mental zzso zzso and worse seizure control zzso zzso frequency zzso correlation zzso and the number of prescribed drugs zzso correlation zzso were more significant in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso When we compared only whether the cases were symptomatic or zzso we found the same outcome zzso In comparisons of only idiopathic zzso patients, the zzso group had zzso different outcomes compared with those in the zzso zzso When we compared 16 cases of benign childhood zzso with zzso spikes zzso and 8 zzso syndrome zzso the cases with zzso had more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that outcomes may not correlate as well in zzso cases as they do in zzso zzso zzso zzso warrants more zzso
