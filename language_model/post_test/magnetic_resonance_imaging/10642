We analyzed zzso zzso zzso results from 18 frontal lobe zzso patients who underwent zzso surgery zzso age zzso zzso zzso onset at implanted zzso zzso was defined as the zzso focus in 16 of 18 zzso In two additional patients, the zzso area on zzso magnetic resonance images was defined as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was injected in all patients within 5 s after seizure zzso zzso images were analyzed by three-dimensional zzso surface projection zzso zzso Areas of zzso identified by zzso zzso were zzso with the site of zzso focus in 11 patients zzso zzso zzso and were zzso in 7 patients zzso zzso zzso The zzso group had a higher number of patients with a history of acquired brain damages, such as encephalitis or brain surgery zzso zzso zzso Only 3 of 11 patients in the zzso group showed areas of localized zzso within zzso zzso whereas 8 patients showed areas of zzso extending to other zzso zzso zzso analyzed by 3-D zzso is useful as a mode of zzso evaluation in frontal lobe zzso patients without a history of encephalitis or surgical zzso We caution that rapid seizure spread may result occasionally in areas of zzso extending to adjacent or remote zzso
