zzso cerebral zzso is a devastating event, and its acute findings, as revealed by conventional MR imaging and CT zzso may be zzso We analyzed zzso and conventional MR images of patients with diffuse cerebral zzso to determine their usefulness in establishing the diagnosis during the acute period and in determining the age of zzso 

We reviewed 11 MR imaging studies of 10 patients who had experienced prolonged cardiac zzso All of the patients underwent zzso zzso imaging with low- and zzso B values and zzso zzso MR zzso We considered bright areas on the zzso zzso images to be abnormal when compared with zzso zzso Special attention was given to the cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and white zzso Conventional MR studies also were zzso and abnormalities zzso The medical records of all of the patients were zzso 

Four patients who underwent imaging during the acute period zzso zzso had bright zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bright zzso zzso zzso zzso and bright zzso zzso zzso 1) shown on their zzso zzso For these patients, conventional MR images showed questionable increased zzso signal intensity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), and the results of two studies were judged to be zzso During the early zzso period (24 zzso zzso four patients were zzso and were determined to have an abnormal zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For two of these patients, conventional MR images showed similar zzso and the results of one study were zzso For two patients who underwent imaging during the late zzso period zzso zzso zzso images showed abnormalities mostly confined to white zzso Two patients who underwent imaging during the chronic phase zzso zzso had normal results of their zzso imaging and one had evidence of zzso necrosis revealed by conventional MR zzso 

During the acute period, zzso zzso images showed the abnormal zzso zzso zzso and zzso to a better extent than did conventional MR zzso During the early zzso period, gray matter abnormalities were seen on zzso zzso During the late zzso period, zzso images showed mostly white matter zzso During the chronic stage, the results of zzso imaging were zzso Our findings suggest that zzso images are helpful for evaluating and dating diffuse cerebral zzso and therefore aid in the determination of prognosis and management of these zzso
