To evaluate the clinical value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso and the pelvis in zzso female with symptomatic zzso for the assessment of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso women zzso age: zzso zzso with symptomatic zzso documented by zzso were evaluated with zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the patients underwent zzso zzso for evaluation of the zzso transport zzso zzso findings of the zzso junction zone were correlated with the zzso results, clinical symptoms and zzso transport zzso 

zzso was diagnosed on zzso zzso in 35 zzso zzso patients zzso zzso in 26 patients and diffuse zzso in zzso Patients showing signs of zzso tended to be older than patients without zzso zzso age zzso years zzso zzso zzso and showed a longer history of symptomatic zzso A positive transport capacity in zzso was observed in zzso % zzso of the patients with focal zzso and in only zzso % zzso of patients with diffuse zzso In zzso % zzso of the patients without signs of zzso a positive zzso transport was zzso 

zzso of the zzso is a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of zzso and for planning further zzso Patients with the diagnosis of zzso showed a reduced zzso transport capacity that depended on the severity of zzso changes and might be a possible cause of zzso
