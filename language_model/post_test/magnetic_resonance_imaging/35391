The identification of brain regions generating zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso partial zzso is crucial prior to zzso During zzso zzso this identification can be performed from the analysis of zzso zzso In particular, the presence of zzso zzso often referred to as zzso zzso has long been recognized as a characteristic zzso pattern of the zzso However, to date, there has been no attempt to make use of this specific pattern to zzso evaluate the degree of zzso in recorded zzso A novel quantitative measure that characterizes the zzso of brain structures recorded with depth zzso is zzso This measure, called zzso zzso zzso is based on both spectral zzso of fast zzso replacing the background zzso and zzso zzso of appearance with respect to seizure zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso values were zzso in zzso and lateral structures of the zzso lobe in a group of 17 patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso high zzso values corresponded to structures involved early in the zzso process and producing rapid zzso at seizure zzso In all patients, these high values were obtained in more than one structure of the zzso lobe zzso In the majority of patients, highest zzso values were zzso from signals recorded in zzso zzso In addition, when averaged over patients, zzso values gradually decreased from structure to zzso For lateral zzso higher zzso values were found in patients with normal zzso in contrast with patients with zzso zzso In this former zzso of patients, a greater number of zzso structures was also zzso A statistically significant correlation was found between the duration of zzso and the number of structures disclosing high zzso suggesting that zzso is a gradually evolving process in which the zzso of the zzso lobe tends to increase with zzso
