In the present study we investigated whether there are differences in the zzso zzso moment arm zzso angle relationship between zzso children and adults, and whether the zzso length scales to relevant zzso zzso in the two zzso zzso characteristics and the zzso zzso angle relationships were determined in 20 adults and 20 zzso children of both zzso The zzso characteristics measured were zzso body mass, knee zzso zzso knee zzso zzso knee depth, leg zzso zzso length and zzso zzso The zzso was zzso from magnetic resonance images using the geometric zzso of the zzso zzso method, at every 5 degrees between 55 degrees and 90 degrees of knee zzso zzso degrees is full zzso Adults had a significantly greater zzso length at all joint angles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 90 degrees ; P zzso zzso with the zzso length decreasing from knee extension to knee zzso similarly in both adults and zzso There were no significant and strong correlations between the zzso and zzso measures in adults for any joint zzso In contrast, the zzso correlated and scaled with zzso characteristics for the children zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso at all joint zzso The zzso length in children was most accurately predicted at 85 degrees of zzso from the equation zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso length + zzso zzso leg length zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that the knee zzso mechanism in zzso children should not be considered to be a zzso version of that in zzso
