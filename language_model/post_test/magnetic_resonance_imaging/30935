Diagnosis of zzso right zzso zzso zzso has major implications for the management of patients and their first-degree zzso Diagnosis is based on a set of criteria proposed by the International Task Force for zzso We report our experience in providing a zzso for patients who previously have been diagnosed with zzso 

We studied 89 patients who requested a zzso for diagnosis of zzso at our zzso Each of these patients had been diagnosed with zzso at their initial zzso Each patient was re-evaluated with clinical history, physical examination, and zzso testing at our zzso zzso testing, which included zzso testing, right zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed when clinically zzso Sixty zzso of the 65 patients who had undergone magnetic resonance imaging zzso at an outside institution were reported to have an abnormal zzso consistent with zzso Among these patients, the only zzso identified was the qualitative finding of zzso zzso thinning in 46 zzso On zzso these qualitative findings were not zzso None of these 46 patients ultimately were diagnosed with zzso Among the entire patient group, only 24 zzso of the 89 patients met the Task Force criteria for zzso 

This study demonstrates that the high frequency of zzso of zzso is due to zzso on the presence of zzso zzso thinning on zzso incomplete diagnostic testing, and lack of awareness of the Task Force zzso Diagnosis of zzso cannot rely solely upon qualitative features on zzso
