The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso changes in zzso zzso in mild cognitive impairment zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso over a long-term zzso 

Six zzso patients, ten zzso patients and eight healthy subjects underwent a zzso PET scan at baseline and at 2 and 5 zzso The clinical status of the zzso patients was evaluated every 6 zzso 

The zzso group showed a significant increase in zzso zzso over time zzso with a similar increase from baseline to 2 years zzso per zzso and from 2 to 5 years zzso per zzso Eight zzso patients zzso converted to zzso and two of these patients showed a normal zzso scan at baseline but increased zzso zzso There was an increase in zzso zzso with time in the zzso group zzso but this did not significantly differ from the change in the control zzso 

Our results revealed a significant increase in zzso load even at the time of zzso diagnosis in some of the zzso patients who zzso A positive zzso scan at baseline in zzso patients strongly predicted future conversion to zzso but a negative zzso scan in zzso patients did not exclude future zzso The results suggest that there is wide individual variation in the brain zzso load in zzso and in the course of zzso zzso in relation to the clinical diagnosis of zzso
