Radio frequency zzso phase zzso in the receiver zzso field pattern can zzso flow zzso information in magnetic resonance zzso images in the form of phase zzso These phase variations are not readily observed in MR images because they are relatively small compared to phase variations caused by zzso magnetic field zzso zzso zzso variations, and other zzso However, the phase contributions from these other sources are independent of the receiver zzso zzso the zzso phase zzso zzso flow information can be recovered by zzso images obtained simultaneously using zzso of independent receiver coils and a multiple channel zzso This flow zzso information can be extracted zzso from standard imaging zzso including zzso zzso No additional time is required for the flow study as the flow zzso are made using sequences chosen for optimal imaging, and the images from each zzso are obtained zzso zzso results indicate that sufficient sensitivity is obtained to make flow zzso in the range of zzso commonly found in the carotid arteries and other major zzso In principle, the method works with only two receiver zzso However, additional elements provide additional phase zzso that can be used to increase zzso remove ambiguities in flow direction or zzso calculations, and increase the region over which zzso zzso can be accurately zzso
