The purpose of this study was to develop a method of registering zzso PET with MR zzso images for investigating the correlation of zzso zzso zzso and cerebral blood volume zzso in children with pediatric brain tumors and their relationship with zzso 

zzso children with brain tumors in a phase II study of zzso and zzso underwent brain MR and zzso PET within 2 zzso zzso types included zzso high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso brain stem zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There were 33 cases zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso and both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso PET images were registered to MR images from the last time point of the zzso zzso time series using mutual zzso zzso regions of interest zzso drawn on zzso images were automatically transferred to registered PET zzso The quality of zzso registration was graded zzso zzso 2, very good; 3, good; 4, fair; and 5, zzso by 3 independent zzso zzso rank correlations were used to assess correlation of maximum tumor zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso and maximum zzso zzso zzso to white matter zzso Cox zzso hazards models were used to investigate associations of these parameters with zzso survival zzso 

The quality of zzso registration between PET and MR was good to excellent in 31 of 33 zzso There was no correlation of baseline zzso with zzso zzso rank correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso rank correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated with zzso zzso rank correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and number of events zzso zzso 15 for zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 14 for zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 15 for zzso 

zzso PET and MR zzso images were successfully registered and compared across a spectrum of pediatric brain zzso The lack of correlation between metabolism and zzso may be expected because these parameters characterize different molecular zzso The correlation of zzso and tumor metabolism may be related to an association with tumor zzso More patients are needed for a zzso analysis of these parameters and zzso by tumor zzso
