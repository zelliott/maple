zzso zzso spin tagging approaches were used to construct zzso images of relative cerebral blood flow changes during zzso zzso zzso significant increases in cerebral blood flow were observed in primary zzso zzso in all seven zzso The mean volume of the activated region in the zzso primary zzso zzso was zzso zzso and the mean increase in cerebral blood flow in the activated area was zzso zzso zzso Although the extended spatial coverage is advantageous for zzso studies, the intrinsic sensitivity of the zzso approach is smaller than the intrinsic sensitivity of the zzso zzso spin tagging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Published 1999 zzso zzso
