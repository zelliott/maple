Studies of unilateral finger movement in right-handed subjects have shown zzso patterns of zzso in primary motor zzso Some studies have measured a similar asymmetry in the supplementary motor area zzso but others have zzso To shed more light on the symmetry of function in the zzso we used path analysis of functional zzso data to investigate effective connectivity during a unilateral finger movement zzso We observed a slight asymmetry in task zzso left zzso was equally active during movement of either hand, while right zzso was more active for zzso movement, suggesting a dominant role of left zzso In addition, we tested for a corresponding asymmetry in the influence of zzso on zzso zzso zzso using a path model based on the well-established principle that zzso is involved in motor control and zzso in zzso We observed that the influence of left zzso on left zzso increased during right-hand movement, and the influence of left zzso on right zzso increased during zzso zzso However, there was no significant zzso change in the influences of the right zzso This asymmetry in connectivity implies that left zzso does play a dominant role in unilateral movements of either hand in right zzso The experiment also provides a basis for further studies of motor system connectivity in healthy or patient zzso
