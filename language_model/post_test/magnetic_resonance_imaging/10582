To zzso assess feasibility of zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso measurement method based on zzso fast zzso shot sequences for grading effect of zzso artery zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approved this study, and patients gave written zzso zzso patients zzso male, 39 zzso age range, zzso zzso who were clinically suspected of having zzso underwent contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso shot imaging for measurement of zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso for zzso detection and zzso Degree of zzso was evaluated as high grade zzso zzso low to intermediate grade zzso to zzso zzso or zzso High zzso resolution of the zzso fast zzso shot sequence allowed acquisition of an exact zzso tracing of the contrast agent zzso from which a signal intensity zzso curve was zzso On the basis of this curve, mean transit time zzso of the contrast agent zzso zzso zzso zzso of the curve, maximum zzso and time to zzso peak zzso were calculated with a gamma zzso zzso zzso rank sum test, zzso product moment zzso and paired zzso test were used for statistical zzso 

zzso zzso arteries had high-grade zzso 12 zzso arteries had low- to zzso zzso and 104 zzso arteries had no zzso zzso differences between patients without zzso or with low- to zzso zzso and patients with high-grade zzso were found for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters were correlated with patients' serum zzso levels, and significant correlations were found for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with P zzso zzso 

MR zzso parameters can be used to assess effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso reflect zzso function as measured with serum zzso zzso
