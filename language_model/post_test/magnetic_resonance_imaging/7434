The zzso is of tremendous importance for our daily survival, and yet the functional relationships between various zzso their projection targets, and zzso regulatory areas remain poorly zzso The main reason for this lies in the zzso performance of standard zzso methods in this zzso In particular, zzso signals are much harder to detect in the zzso region compared to cortical zzso Here we describe and validate a new approach to measure zzso of zzso zzso in humans using standard zzso sequences and widely available tools for statistical image zzso By zzso restricting an independent component analysis to an zzso defined zzso mask, we excluded those areas from the analysis that were strongly affected by zzso zzso This allowed us to identify for the first time intrinsic connectivity networks in the human zzso and to map zzso connectivity purely based on functionally defined regions of zzso
