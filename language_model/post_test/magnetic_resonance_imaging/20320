zzso from the American Cancer Society recommend annual breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso screening for women with a projected lifetime risk of zzso based on risk models that use family zzso Because zzso screening is costly and has limited zzso estimates of the numbers of zzso women with zzso breast cancer risk would be zzso 

We used data from the 2000 and 2005 National Health zzso zzso and the National Cancer Institute zzso Breast Cancer zzso Assessment zzso zzso Gail model 2 with a revision for African Americans) to calculate estimates of zzso women by age and zzso categories with a lifetime absolute breast cancer risk of zzso zzso of zzso and lifetime absolute risk of breast cancer were compared across demographic zzso 

We estimated that zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso of women age 30 to 84 years have a lifetime absolute breast cancer risk of zzso which translates to zzso zzso women eligible for zzso zzso The zzso risks are highest for white zzso and lowest for zzso The lifetime risks decrease with age and are generally highest for white zzso lower for African American zzso and lowest for zzso 

We provide national estimates of the number of zzso women who would be eligible for zzso breast screening and zzso of zzso and lifetime risks of breast cancer using the zzso Breast Cancer zzso Assessment zzso 

These estimates inform the potential resources and public health demand for zzso screening and zzso interventions that might be required for zzso zzso
