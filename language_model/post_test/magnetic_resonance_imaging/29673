The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso and removal of unilateral flow of the zzso fold of zzso mechanism in the zzso corner of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

From March 1998 to May 2000, we treated 14 cases of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso were relatively large zzso about 5 zzso in diameter on zzso Conservative treatment for about 1 year, with about 3 aspirations zzso The mean follow-up duration was zzso (24 to zzso zzso We used zzso and zzso criteria for zzso We estimated surgical zzso Patients underwent zzso 6 months and 1 year after zzso zzso range of motion, and recurrence were checked 1 year after zzso 

The average surgical time was 45 zzso to zzso zzso The time to pain elimination and full range of motion was 1 or 2 days after zzso No recurrence was noted in any zzso At the last zzso patients reported no discomfort or pain, and all had free range of zzso zzso zzso and zzso criteria were grade 0 in 0 zzso grade 1 in 3 zzso grade 2 in 10 zzso and grade 3 in 1 zzso At 2 weeks after surgery, criteria were grade 0 in 13 cases and grade 1 in 1 zzso at final follow-up zzso all were grade zzso zzso occurred in 1 zzso However, in cases lost to follow-up and in short-term follow-up cases, technical errors zzso not entering within the zzso in 2 cases, zzso in 1 case, and recurrence in 1 zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso by motorized zzso and removal of the zzso fold of the zzso mechanism is an effective alternative to the open technique of treating zzso zzso
