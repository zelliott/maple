To analyze the pattern of zzso evoked auditory zzso response zzso in auditory zzso spectrum disorder zzso patients and to compare their performances with zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso referral zzso 

Eleven patients with zzso and 9 control subjects with zzso hearing loss who did not have neural zzso 

zzso 

Patients and control subjects each received a cochlear implant zzso and underwent zzso zzso zzso wave V zzso and zzso were measured as zzso zzso The results of zzso were zzso as good response, variable response, or no zzso Speech perception ability was assessed by the categories of auditory performance zzso zzso 

All controls responded to zzso whereas 6 of the 11 zzso patients did not respond to zzso The zzso threshold of the zzso patients was measured almost within the value of disease zzso However, the Wave V zzso displayed variable zzso and the zzso showed a wider distribution compared with the value of the disease zzso The zzso response group among the zzso patients showed relatively good performance after zzso In contrast, the zzso group demonstrated variable zzso although all of them still benefited from zzso 

The data suggested that all zzso patients require zzso and that zzso results can help establish realistic expectations about future zzso Even if electrical stimulation fails to generate sufficiently synchronized signal for zzso zzso zzso provides at least zzso measurable auditory benefit in zzso
