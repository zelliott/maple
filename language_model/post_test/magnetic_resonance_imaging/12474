To accurately zzso liver function using zzso zzso acid zzso MR zzso 

A total of 105 patients with suspicion of a zzso tumor zzso zzso 5 in 56, 6 in 26, 7 in 20, and 8 in 3) who underwent zzso MR imaging and an zzso green retention rate at 15 zzso zzso evaluation were zzso zzso The zzso images were taken at 20 zzso after zzso zzso The quantitative zzso contrast ratio zzso was measured by calculating the signal intensity of the zzso and 12 zzso points consisting of each central zone (near the zzso zzso and peripheral zone (near the zzso zzso in the two main liver zzso 

Each averaged zzso of six points in the central zone or right lobe was significantly higher than that in the peripheral zone or left lobe regardless of zzso zzso The mean zzso of the 12 points was significantly correlated with the zzso and significantly decreased with zzso of the zzso zzso 

The zzso enhancement by zzso is influenced by zzso and zzso zzso This method with consideration of regional differences is valid for zzso of liver function by zzso MR zzso
