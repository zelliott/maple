The zzso zzso is central to zzso zzso The right zzso region is primarily involved in basic quantity processing, while the left zzso region is additionally involved in precise number processing and zzso zzso Little is known about how the 2 regions interact during zzso zzso We hypothesized that functional connectivity between the right and left zzso zzso is critical for zzso processing that engages both basic number representation and learned zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we estimated neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging in participants performing zzso and zzso processing on dot zzso We first found zzso functional connectivity between a right zzso seed and the left zzso zzso in all task zzso As we hypothesized, we found enhanced functional connectivity between this right zzso seed and both the left zzso zzso and neighboring right zzso cortex, particularly during zzso The degree of functional connectivity also correlated with behavioral performance across individual participants, while activity within each region did zzso These results highlight the role of zzso functional connectivity in zzso zzso They suggest that zzso processing depends on zzso between and within the zzso zzso and that this zzso contributes to one's zzso zzso
