This study investigated cortical steady potential changes in 18 subjects while processing a series of zzso zzso items zzso of zzso that became zzso zzso of zzso Two different zzso of induction and withdrawal of control zzso and zzso were dealt with separately in the zzso The DC zzso was recorded from 20 zzso In all experimental conditions the overall slow potential topographical pattern did not zzso However, zzso DC shifts at zzso and left zzso regions were observed during induction of control whereas a generalized zzso DC shift developed during zzso of withdrawal of zzso This zzso shift persisted for the duration of the item zzso resulting in pronounced positive values at zzso zzso The authors assume that zzso lobe activity zzso and/or zzso zzso correlated to zzso processes that was picked up via the linked zzso reference locations contributed essentially to these observed zzso
