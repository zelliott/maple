To evaluate the efficacy of a zzso consisting of repeat assessment in patients planned for zzso zzso zzso in case of zzso visceral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso despite initial zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

In zzso patients with primary and secondary liver cancer, zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with magnetic resonance imaging scans, were zzso zzso zzso deposition was identified in 33 patients zzso zzso repeat zzso Images were reviewed to correlate the site of zzso zzso with zzso gastrointestinal vessels, and repeat zzso served as reference zzso 

At repeat zzso the source of zzso flow was identified and eliminated in 31 of 33 patients zzso In 20 patients zzso successful zzso of zzso vessels was zzso in 13 patients zzso zzso was administered more zzso Afterward, zzso zzso deposition was eliminated in 30 patients zzso 

The zzso of repeat assessment in case of zzso zzso zzso has proven highly effective to eliminate zzso zzso thus decreasing the risk of zzso complications due to zzso visceral zzso zzso
