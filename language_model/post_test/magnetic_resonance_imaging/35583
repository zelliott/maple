Task switching is an important aspect of cognitive control and understanding its underlying mechanisms is the focus of considerable zzso In this paper, we contrast two different kinds of task switching zzso and provide evidence that different cognitive mechanisms zzso switching behavior depending on whether the switch is between sets of rules zzso zzso or sets of features presented simultaneously zzso zzso In two experiments, we demonstrate that behavioral effects zzso 1) and neural recruitment zzso 2) vary with the type of switch zzso While zzso switch costs occurred when the alternative feature set was physically present, rule switch costs were observed even in their zzso Rule switching was also characterized by larger target repetition effects and by greater engagement of the zzso prefrontal zzso In contrast, zzso switching was associated with greater recruitment of the zzso zzso These results provide strong evidence for multiple forms of switching and suggest the limitations of zzso results across shift zzso
