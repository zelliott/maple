The purpose of the present study was to assess the diagnostic usefulness of early zzso zzso zzso and MR zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso Past approaches to stroke diagnosis required a series of diagnostic tests over several days of zzso New magnetic resonance zzso that include zzso and zzso may allow more rapid characterization of stroke zzso However, no previous study has assessed the impact on formal stroke zzso diagnosis of early imaging with zzso 

We analyzed 46 consecutive patients with acute zzso stroke who underwent zzso within 24 hours of zzso zzso diagnoses were rendered with use of the 2 most widely used formal stroke zzso zzso schemes, the zzso and the zzso methods, which were applied to patients after zzso zzso but before zzso zzso zzso and zzso diagnoses were then rendered based on the results of day 1 zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso Final zzso diagnoses at discharge were taken as the gold zzso 

Compared with final diagnoses, zzso zzso diagnoses matched final diagnoses in zzso improving to zzso after zzso alone, zzso after zzso alone, and zzso after zzso plus zzso For the zzso diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso and zzso disease, zzso diagnoses matched final diagnoses in zzso and zzso of patients, respectively, improving to zzso and zzso after zzso zzso zzso diagnoses matched final diagnoses in zzso of patients, improving to zzso after zzso 

The use of zzso within 24 hours of hospitalization substantially improves the accuracy of the diagnosis of early zzso stroke zzso When initial management and clinical trial eligibility decisions are influenced by stroke zzso day 1 zzso zzso is advantageous as a guide to zzso
