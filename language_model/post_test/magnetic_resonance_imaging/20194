zzso within zzso zzso increases the risk for plaque zzso and zzso A functional approach to plaque analysis is the intravenous administration of zzso zzso particles of iron oxide zzso that enables zzso of zzso residing in the zzso In this study, we sought to characterize the age-related inflammatory status associated with zzso zzso progression in zzso mice using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

A total of 24 zzso mice were divided in 4 groups (N zzso 6) and were given a high cholesterol diet from 6 weeks of age to the end of the zzso One group per MR time point was investigated at 10, 16, 24, and 34 weeks of zzso Each MR examination was performed on a zzso T scanner and consisted of baseline and 48 hours zzso administration imaging zzso zzso a zzso contrast agent zzso Paris, zzso with a potential for plaque zzso zzso was zzso wall area zzso were performed on high resolution spin echo zzso zzso zzso zzso images acquired with the same geometry were used to calculate zzso maps of the vessel wall using a zzso zzso zzso A one-way analysis of zzso was performed to characterize the zzso variation of vessel wall area, zzso artifact area, zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR zzso were correlated with the zzso zzso 

A significant increase was found in the zzso wall area from zzso zzso zzso at 10 weeks to zzso zzso zzso zzso at 34 weeks of age zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso signal loss regions, with patterns spanning from focal to the complete disappearance of the vessel wall, were observed on all zzso zzso A significant increase in the size of the zzso artifact was observed from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso at 24 weeks zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso at 34 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso values calculated on the 48 hours zzso images were shorter compared with zzso The decrease was zzso zzso zzso at 10 weeks, 57% zzso zzso at 16 weeks, 57% zzso zzso at 24 weeks, and zzso zzso zzso at 34 zzso zzso correlation test between measurement of zzso wall area performed on both MR images and zzso analysis showed a statistically significant correlation zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso A correlation was also obtained between the signal loss area and the zzso covered area zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso 

This study demonstrated the feasibility of zzso zzso in assessing the inflammatory status related to the zzso progression of the zzso plaque in zzso transgenic mice model of zzso In our experimental conditions, the vascular inflammation peak, for the zzso mice feeding zzso diet is measured between 16 and 24 weeks of zzso
