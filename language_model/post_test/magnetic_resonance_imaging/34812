In zzso images can be collected in a very short time; therefore, high zzso resolution is possible in zzso However, the zzso resolution is limited by a blurred intrinsic zzso response and a finite zzso zzso To determine the upper limit of zzso resolution in a single area during repeated tasks, motor zzso activity was investigated during visually instructed finger zzso Without zzso a sequence of four zzso movements with an execution time of approximately 2 s can be resolved when the delay time between consecutive sequences is at least 3 zzso The zzso response time is constant for each subject, but not among different zzso The zzso resolution can be better when the signal from zzso distinct regions is zzso For a series of experiments involving a visually instructed delayed cued finger movement task with a zzso independently determined, variable delay time, time courses in the motor area are distinct from each other in two experiments if the difference in delay time is as little as 2 zzso The zzso in the visual area due to the presentation of the task serves here as an internal time zzso By comparing a set of zzso time courses in multiple distinct areas, serial neural processing may be zzso
