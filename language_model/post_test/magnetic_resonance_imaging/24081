The authors investigated neural zzso of age-related declines in mental zzso Healthy adult participants zzso 19 to zzso performed a series of zzso mental imagery tasks that varied in apparent difficulty and involved stimuli of varying graphic zzso The volumes of the zzso frontal zzso zzso and zzso visual processing areas were estimated from magnetic resonance imaging zzso The volume of the zzso and the zzso cortex, zzso capacity, and performance on the tasks involving image generation and manipulation were significantly reduced with zzso Further analyses suggested that age-related deficits in performance on mental imagery tasks may stem in part from age-related shrinkage of the prefrontal zzso and age-related declines in working memory but not from age-related slowing of zzso reaction zzso The volume of cortical regions associated with zzso visual information processing did not show a consistent relationship with specific mental imagery zzso
