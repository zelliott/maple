We report on 24 cases of transient bone zzso zzso syndrome in 18 patients who underwent core zzso of the zzso 

Diagnosis was made with the use of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and core biopsy zzso zzso surgery and core zzso were carried out in all patients, and zzso was performed again, 5 years after surgery was zzso 

zzso and lateral zzso zzso were affected in 15 and 7 knees, zzso In all, 6 patients presented with bilateral involvement of the knees zzso transient bone zzso zzso zzso Two of these patients had zzso of the zzso and lateral compartments within the same knee at different times, consistent with zzso regional bone zzso zzso zzso Core biopsy specimens showed areas of bone zzso zzso and vital zzso covered by zzso and zzso zzso Resolution of symptoms and zzso of zzso findings occurred in all patients within 12 weeks after zzso 

zzso bone zzso zzso was found in a high percentage zzso of patients at zzso zzso however, all patients were clinically zzso and signal zzso on zzso had resolved zzso The high zzso of zzso bone zzso zzso the lack of zzso regions in our zzso and the fact that none of these cases progressed to spontaneous zzso seem to further support the contention that bone zzso zzso syndrome of the knee is a distinct zzso 

Level II, diagnostic study; development of diagnostic criteria on the basis of consecutive patients and with universally applied reference gold zzso
