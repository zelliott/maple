Our previous work described the neural processes of motor response zzso during a stop signal task zzso zzso the race model, we zzso the stop signal reaction time zzso to index zzso ability in zzso zzso The zzso motor area zzso which shows greater activity in individuals with short as compared to those with long zzso plays a role in zzso response zzso In contrast, the right inferior prefrontal zzso zzso showed greater activity during stop success as compared to stop zzso Here we further pursued this functional differentiation of zzso and zzso on the basis of an zzso zzso 

Of 65 subjects who participated in four sessions of the zzso we identified 30 individuals who showed a difference in zzso but were identical in other aspects of stop signal performance between the first zzso and last two zzso zzso By comparing regional brain zzso between the two sessions, we confirmed greater zzso but not zzso activity during short as compared to long zzso session within zzso Furthermore, zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso zzso also showed greater activity in association with short zzso 

These results are consistent with a role of zzso prefrontal zzso in controlled action and inferior frontal zzso in zzso zzso We discussed these findings with respect to the process of zzso monitoring and zzso motor control during stop signal zzso
