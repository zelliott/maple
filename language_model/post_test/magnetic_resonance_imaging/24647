Among brain functions, language is one of the most zzso zzso language areas are also some of the most zzso in the zzso An open question is whether the asymmetry in function is linked to the asymmetry in zzso To address this question, we measured anatomical asymmetry in 34 participants shown with zzso to have language dominance of the left zzso zzso and 21 participants shown to have zzso right zzso dominance zzso All participants were healthy and zzso and most zzso were zzso Gray matter zzso volume asymmetry was measured using an automated zzso technique in both zzso and exploratory zzso In the zzso analysis, a significant difference between zzso and zzso was found in the zzso No differences were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all significantly left zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Both the positive and negative zzso findings replicate a previous study using manually labeled zzso in a different cohort zzso zzso zzso Roberts, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso Can the zzso zzso be predicted by brain zzso Journal of zzso zzso 23, zzso zzso The exploratory analysis was accomplished using a new zzso registration that zzso cortical folding patterns across both subject and zzso A small but significant cluster was found in the superior zzso zzso that overlapped with the zzso A cluster was also found in the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the visual word recognition zzso The zzso analysis also makes it possible to zzso the effects of zzso volume, zzso and surface area while removing the effects of zzso For both the zzso and exploratory zzso the difference between zzso and zzso volume zzso was most strongly driven by differences in surface area and not cortical zzso Overall, there were surprisingly few differences in zzso volume asymmetry between zzso and zzso indicating that gross zzso asymmetry is only subtly related to functional language zzso
