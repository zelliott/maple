The mechanical competence of zzso bone is significantly determined, next to material density, by its three-dimensional zzso zzso Recent advances in zzso resonance imaging zzso acquisition and processing techniques allow the zzso zzso structure to be analyzed in zzso at peripheral sites such as the zzso radius and zzso The practicality of zzso zzso virtual bone biopsy zzso for zzso studies of patients hinges on the zzso of the derived structural zzso which largely determine the size of the effect that can be detected at a given power and significance zzso In this paper, the zzso of zzso zzso bone structure measures was examined by performing repeat studies in six healthy subjects in whom the zzso aspects of the radius and zzso were scanned with a zzso zzso sequence at 137 zzso 137 zzso 410 zzso zzso zzso Bone volume fraction zzso and digital zzso analysis zzso structural parameters including the zzso bone zzso ratio zzso and zzso erosion index zzso were evaluated after subjecting the raw images to a cascade of processing zzso The average zzso of variation was zzso and was comparable for the two zzso sites and for all parameters zzso The reliability expressed in terms of the zzso correlation zzso ranged from zzso to zzso in the radius and zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso analysis based on simulations suggests zzso patient motion, primarily zzso to be the chief source of zzso followed by failure to accurately match the analysis volumes in repeat zzso
