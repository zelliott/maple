There has been vast interest in determining the feasibility of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso as an accurate method of imaging brain function for patient zzso The assessment of zzso as an accurate tool for zzso zzso largely depends on the software used to process the time series zzso The performance evaluation of different analysis tools is not reliable unless truths in motion and zzso are zzso Lack of valid truths has been the limiting factor for comparisons of different zzso Until now, currently available phantom data do not include comprehensive accounts of head zzso While most zzso studies assume no zzso motion during the time series acquisition in zzso data acquired using a zzso and zzso zzso imaging zzso each slice is subject to a different set of motion zzso In this study, in addition to known three-dimensional motion parameters applied to each zzso included in the time series zzso are geometric distortion from field zzso and spin zzso effect as a result of zzso head zzso We investigated the effect of these head zzso artifacts and present a validation of the mapping zzso zzso zzso for motion correction and zzso detection against the known zzso zzso was zzso and showed better performance in comparison with other widely used zzso data processing software, which zzso for head motion with a zzso realignment zzso Furthermore, improvement in signal detection was observed with the zzso of the geometric distortion correction and spin zzso effect compensation features in zzso
