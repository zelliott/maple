The clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso is often difficult due to varied clinical zzso In 4 patients with zzso confirmed zzso characteristic imaging findings and correlations with zzso features were zzso Furthermore, imaging findings in zzso were compared with zzso confirmed progressive zzso zzso zzso for a differential zzso 

Four patients with zzso confirmed zzso were zzso We evaluated the area of the zzso in the zzso plane, zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso on MR imaging and compared them with zzso zzso Then, MR imaging findings in zzso were compared with those in 13 patients with zzso 

On MR imaging, 3 patients had zzso cerebral zzso extending to the central zzso On zzso zzso the mean zzso zzso area was 66 zzso being markedly smaller than normal, but there was no significant difference between zzso and zzso All patients had zzso abnormalities of the zzso zzso primary zzso zzso however, no diffuse zzso zzso in the zzso existed in the 13 patients with zzso In 3 patients, zzso images showed zzso high signal intensity in the zzso zzso zzso these areas showed characteristic zzso MR imaging zzso changes also existed in 4 patients with zzso however, zzso nucleus zzso was more severe in zzso than in zzso 

In cases with zzso zzso zzso and zzso changes in the zzso zzso the differential diagnosis distinguishing zzso from zzso based on MR imaging alone was zzso White matter zzso and zzso zzso can be useful for a differential zzso
