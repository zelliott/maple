Miniature zzso routinely enhance small volume nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and zzso however, no such techniques exist for zzso We present an zzso zzso for diverse clinical applications, with a zzso zzso zzso The design is loosely based on zzso depth electrodes, in which a flexible tube serves as the zzso and a metal zzso is inserted into the tube during zzso The goal is to provide enhanced zzso ratio zzso of structures that are not easily zzso by surface zzso The first-generation zzso was designed for zzso up to 2 zzso and provided initial zzso for zzso zzso we zzso the design to minimize the influence of lead zzso and to thereby double the length of the zzso depth (4 zzso The second-generation design represents an estimated zzso improvement of over zzso as compared to the original design when extended to 4 zzso zzso zzso indicate that the device is stable for up to 24 h in body temperature zzso We evaluated the zzso and zzso heating of the device at zzso The zzso zzso can differentiate fat and water peaks, and resolve zzso zzso
