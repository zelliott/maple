Prospective consecutive zzso 

To evaluate the post-traumatic disc zzso and range of motion 10 years after zzso fixation without fusion for zzso burst fractures with neurological zzso 

Early clinical results of zzso fixation without fusion for zzso burst fractures were zzso However, the long-term results have not been reported, and post-traumatic disc zzso and preservation of zzso motion have not been zzso 

Twelve patients who had zzso burst fractures and associated incomplete neurological deficit, zzso treated within 4 days of admission and had their implants removed within 1 year, were zzso followed for at least 10 zzso Following indirect reduction and zzso screw zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the fractured zzso was zzso 

zzso alignment was improved from a mean zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso by operation, but was found to have slightly deteriorated to zzso at the final follow-up zzso With respect to back pain, 8 patients did not report back zzso Three reported occasional minimal pain, and 1 reported moderate zzso None reported severe pain or needed daily zzso of zzso disc zzso the shape of the disc adjacent to the fractured vertebra had not changed from the zzso to the 10-year zzso magnetic resonance image zzso Although signal intensity of the disc had decreased by 1 grade from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso the intensity had not changed from the zzso zzso zzso to the 10-year zzso zzso At the 10-year zzso zzso zzso revealed that a mean range of motion at the disc adjacent to the fractured vertebra was zzso zzso zzso 

This unprecedented 10-year follow-up study demonstrated that zzso indirect reduction, zzso zzso zzso and zzso screw fixation does not require fusion to a segment, thereby preserves zzso motion without resulting in post-traumatic disc zzso
