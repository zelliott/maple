The development of the ability to process spoken and written language depends upon a network of left zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso The present study explored features of brain organization in children with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso who commonly present with precocious development of word reading skills and preservation of vocabulary and grammar zzso 

Eight children with zzso were compared with 15 zzso and zzso zzso typically developing controls on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Children with zzso showed reduced magnetic activity in left inferior zzso regions during spoken word recognition and zzso reading zzso We also noted reduced surface zzso in inferior zzso and zzso zzso regions in zzso and increased gray matter volumes in left middle frontal regions and zzso complexity in left zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso 

A complex pattern of changes in cortical zzso and zzso may serve as evidence for structural and functional brain reorganization ensuring preservation of language and decoding abilities in children with zzso
