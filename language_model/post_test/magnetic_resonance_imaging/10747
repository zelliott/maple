zzso MR imaging zzso has been used to probe zzso zzso function in people with zzso zzso disease zzso A previous zzso study in healthy individuals demonstrated zzso of the zzso zzso during a zzso zzso The current study was designed to examine the relative sensitivity of zzso compared with that of behavioral testing and zzso zzso in detecting early neurodegenerative changes related to zzso disease zzso 

zzso participants were assigned to two groups based on estimated years to diagnosis of manifest disease: close zzso years and far zzso zzso Age at disease onset was estimated using a zzso equation based on the number of zzso zzso zzso The zzso task required participants to determine whether a specified zzso was shorter or longer than a standard zzso of 1200 zzso 

Participants in the close group performed more poorly on the zzso discrimination than did control zzso however, no differences were observed between far participants and control zzso Similarly, close participants had reduced bilateral zzso volume relative to that of control subjects, whereas far participants did zzso On functional imaging, close participants had significantly less zzso in zzso regions zzso zzso than control zzso far participants had an intermediate degree of zzso In contrast, far participants had zzso in zzso zzso structures zzso cingulate, zzso motor zzso relative to close and control zzso 

zzso of zzso prefrontal regions compensated for reduced zzso participation during time discrimination in zzso This pattern of brain zzso may represent an early zzso marker of zzso zzso
