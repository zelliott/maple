This study describes a quantitative method to estimate the migratory capacity of neural stem cells zzso using magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso were labeled with zzso and injected zzso into the corpus zzso of the normal rat zzso Control subjects received either free zzso or zzso labeled zzso zzso were scanned after initial injection and at 1 zzso Image sets were zzso compared zzso and analyzed zzso to determine migration zzso 

zzso receiving injections of viable cells had a significantly greater spread of the zzso after 1 week than either control group zzso zzso The speed of migration for viable zzso was significantly higher than that of controls along the corpus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso speeds estimated from zzso and imaging were significantly zzso 

This study provides a quantitative assessment of zzso neural stem cell migration that is clearly distinguishable from zzso zzso
