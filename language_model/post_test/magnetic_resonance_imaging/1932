To compare pulse sequences in revealing zzso bleeding from the zzso to zzso zzso 

We injected zzso zzso of zzso blood into the brain of 8 zzso MR imaging was performed immediately after zzso creation and then at determined intervals up to 9-12 zzso All images were zzso by two zzso After the last MR investigation, the brain was fixed in zzso The last MR images were compared to the fixed brain sections and to the zzso zzso 

zzso GE zzso both conventional zzso and zzso zzso revealed the zzso zzso as zzso in all but 1 case, which was negative from the second day zzso (a rabbit with zzso zzso blood zzso The signal patterns remained unchanged during the zzso The zzso sizes and shapes corresponded well to gross zzso Blood in the zzso fluid zzso space was detected with zzso GE sequences in a great majority of the examinations during the first 2 zzso The cases with the smallest injected volume of blood were zzso zzso sequences were rather zzso The zzso sequence often revealed blood in zzso spaces but not in the zzso 

zzso GE sequences are capable of revealing very small zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso phase, and blood in zzso spaces during at least the first 2 zzso
