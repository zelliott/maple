The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pattern of disc zzso and to investigate the associated symptoms in cases of zzso zzso It is well known that the zzso of degenerative zzso associates with disc zzso followed by facet zzso and zzso zzso zzso which result in severe spinal canal zzso But zzso zzso is known to have a different zzso In zzso zzso zzso bulging is easily identified, and canal zzso is comparatively zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso has a different pattern of disc zzso from degenerative zzso We studied the type, zzso of disc zzso and clinical symptoms related to zzso zzso 

This study included 132 patients with zzso zzso who had undergone an operation in the last 4 zzso Among them, 120 patients were zzso zzso The mean age was zzso years, and the sex ratio was 1 to zzso zzso to zzso The disc zzso type was identified according to the zzso of zzso 

There were 78 patients zzso with zzso to zzso zzso and 42 patients zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso patients zzso had only zzso bulging without disc zzso and 38 patients zzso had zzso bulging with disc zzso Among the 38 patients with disc zzso there were: zzso zzso 1 patient zzso zzso + zzso zzso 1 patient zzso zzso + zzso zzso 2 patients zzso zzso zzso 7 patients zzso zzso + zzso zzso 25 patients zzso and zzso zzso 2 patients zzso zzso extreme lateral disc zzso zzso zzso was seen in 36 patients, which was zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso In 26 out of 36 patients zzso the zzso was matched to the exact location of the extreme lateral disc zzso In all cases, the extreme lateral disc zzso migrated upward slightly, about one slice (2 zzso according to zzso zzso 

As expected, zzso bulging without disc zzso was the most common type in zzso zzso However, in cases of disc zzso extreme lateral disc zzso occasionally zzso therefore, every zzso zzso patient should be examined carefully for extreme lateral disc zzso with zzso zzso CT or zzso especially when the patients complain of zzso zzso
