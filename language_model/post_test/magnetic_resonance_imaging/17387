The aim of this study was to compare the cerebral regions associated with sexual zzso between zzso and zzso women by using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

Ten zzso and 10 zzso women underwent zzso on a zzso MR scanner using the blood oxygen level dependent zzso To identify the activated brain regions associated with sexual response, brain zzso was assessed during 1 minute of a zzso film, followed by 4 minutes of an erotic zzso 

The overall zzso ratios of the zzso women were greater than those of the zzso women by approximately zzso on zzso The zzso zzso association areas, and zzso lobe showed greater enhancement of signal zzso in zzso zzso However, signal enhancement in the zzso of the corpus zzso and superior frontal zzso was dominant in zzso zzso 

The activated brain center associated with visually evoked sexual zzso showed qualitative and quantitative differences between zzso and zzso zzso
