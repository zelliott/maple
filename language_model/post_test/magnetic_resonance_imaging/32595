zzso delivery of zzso stem cells zzso prepared from adult bone zzso reduces zzso size and ameliorates functional deficits in rat cerebral zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is zzso to impaired zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso contributes to the therapeutic benefits of zzso delivery in cerebral zzso we compared the efficacy of systemic delivery of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso gene zzso A permanent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso was induced by zzso vascular zzso with a zzso zzso and zzso were zzso injected into the rats 3 h after zzso zzso size was assessed at 3 and 6 zzso and 1, 3, 4 and 7 days using MR imaging and zzso zzso outcome was assessed using the limb placement test and the treadmill stress zzso Both zzso and zzso reduced zzso volume, induced zzso and zzso functional improvement compared with the control sham group, but the effect was greater in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed an increase in zzso in both zzso groups, but a greater increase in the zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso contributes to zzso and zzso in cerebral zzso and cellular delivery of zzso to the brain can be achieved by intravenous delivery of zzso
