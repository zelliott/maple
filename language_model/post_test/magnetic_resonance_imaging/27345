To review the outcomes of patients with zzso zzso treated at a zzso referral zzso 

A retrospective review of a series of 72 patients with zzso treated at the Royal National zzso Hospital zzso between 1980 and 2009, with a median follow up of 4 years zzso zzso 

Forty patients were primary zzso and 32 more had operations at the referring zzso Five were treated zzso 48 patients were treated by operation alone and 19 patients underwent surgery supplemented by zzso zzso zzso was seen in 24 of the operation alone group and 10 in the operation and zzso therapy zzso The rate of recurrence was lower with complete zzso However, complete zzso was impossible in some cases because of extension into the chest or spinal canal, or involvement with the zzso vessels and zzso or zzso zzso 

We suggest that operative zzso should seek to preserve function and that supplementary zzso therapy may reduce the risk of zzso although zzso margin appears to be the most important zzso The aggressive, zzso zzso of deep zzso and the associated genetic zzso identified, clearly distinguish them from the superficial zzso and makes their treatment more difficult and dangerous, especially where vital structures are zzso
