zzso mechanisms of spinal zzso injury and repair requires a reliable experimental zzso We have developed a new device that produces a partial damage of spinal zzso white matter by means of a precisely adjusted stream of air applied under high zzso This procedure is less invasive than standard zzso or zzso models and does not require surgical removal of zzso zzso We investigated the effects of spinal zzso injury made with our device in 29 adult rats, applying different experimental zzso The rats were divided into three groups in respect to the applied force of the blast zzso zzso outcome and zzso effects of the injury were analyzed during zzso zzso The zzso were also examined by means of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The weakest stimulus produced transient zzso zzso with no zzso visible in spinal zzso zzso scans, whereas the strongest was associated with permanent neurological deficit accompanied by pathological changes resembling zzso zzso zzso data revealed that our apparatus provided a spinal zzso injury animal model with structural changes very similar to that present in patients after moderate spinal zzso zzso
