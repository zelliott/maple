The purpose of this study was to clarify zzso changes of carotid wall enhancement using dynamic magnetic resonance zzso and to correlate its findings with pathological zzso zzso carotid arteries of 84 consecutive patients were studied with a zzso T MR zzso using phased array zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images zzso second scan zzso with fat zzso were repeated zzso times after the injection of contrast zzso We evaluated the presence and thickness of zzso inner rims and zzso outer rims of the carotid wall, zzso changes of outer rim enhancement, and their changes in relation to pathological zzso zzso inner rims and enhanced outer rims were clearly zzso in zzso zzso of our zzso Enhancement of the outer rim was minimal in early zzso and gradually zzso Patient age had a significant correlation with outer rim zzso In the portions with large zzso zzso inner rims were disrupted or zzso A marked zzso of the outer rim was observed in one patient with zzso The outer rims adjacent to zzso tumors were often zzso Our study suggests that dynamic MR images of the cervical carotid artery can uniquely demonstrate zzso of the wall zzso The outer rim of the artery shows relatively rapid enhancement, and its thickness zzso with zzso
