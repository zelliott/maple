zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recording provides a means for acquiring high zzso resolution zzso data and high spatial resolution zzso data of the brain in the same experimental zzso zzso wire zzso (not metallic zzso zzso with carbon wire zzso are suitable for simultaneous zzso recording, because they cause less zzso zzso heating and zzso artifacts than metallic zzso These characteristics are especially desirable for recording the zzso in high field zzso zzso zzso wire zzso are also comfortable to wear during long recording zzso However, carbon zzso have high zzso zzso compared to widely used zzso zzso zzso electrodes, which may cause slow zzso zzso This paper introduces a zzso zzso recording system with carbon wire zzso and a circuit that suppresses the slow zzso zzso The system was tested for the zzso zzso zzso heating, zzso artifact, and zzso and was also evaluated in a simultaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso
