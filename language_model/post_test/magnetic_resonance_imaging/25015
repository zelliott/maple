We investigated the relationship between the enhanced patterns acquired by dynamic zzso and the tumor cell proliferation estimated by zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso Thirty patients with primary oral SCC underwent dynamic contrast enhanced zzso using a three-dimensional fast imaging with zzso zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation of all surgical specimens was evaluated using zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The relationship between the dynamic zzso parameters zzso zzso and maximum zzso zzso and the zzso labeling index was statistically analyzed using zzso zzso The time contrast index zzso of all cases showed a rapid and high zzso zzso The zzso labeling index showed a significant correlation with maximum zzso and maximum zzso gain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The assessment of zzso parameters may provide valuable information for tumor cell proliferation of the patients with oral zzso
