The anatomy of the human zzso joint region has been investigated mainly under the conditions of dental zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso the topographical situations in other functional positions such as wide-open mouth, zzso and lateral zzso The respective mouth positions were adjusted before fixation and controlled by magnetic resonance zzso The zzso joint regions were embedded in zzso zzso and cut serially in the zzso or the frontal zzso 

The zzso disc lies with its intermediate zone between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso process, and thus adapts the articulating surfaces of the bones perfectly to each zzso zzso enlargement of the zzso cushion is seen, whereas the loss zzso tissue on the anterior side of the joint appears completely zzso 

The disc lies with its intermediate zone between the zzso of the zzso process and the zzso zzso On the lateral side it appears to be compressed between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso cushion is moderately zzso The anterior compartment of loose zzso tissue is smaller than in zzso 

On the working side the zzso disc is in a stabilized position between the zzso joint zzso The balancing zzso is in a zzso position with the zzso cushion reaching into the zzso half of the zzso zzso 

zzso appears as the position with the highest mechanical stress upon the zzso zzso
