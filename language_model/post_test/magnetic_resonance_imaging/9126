A zzso zzso zzso has been reported in as much as 50% of the patients affected by zzso zzso zzso No guidelines for timing and zzso of diagnosis and treatment have been zzso We present the preliminary results of a multidisciplinary protocol carried out at our zzso 

zzso zzso patients underwent spinal magnetic resonance imaging zzso All zzso patients underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and neurological examination at baseline and, if normal, at 5 and 10 years of zzso zzso when zzso or zzso abnormalities were detected the follow-up was individually tailored at shorter zzso 

zzso patients had a zzso zzso zzso Based on the results of zzso zzso and neurological status, four patients were untethered, eight are possible candidates, nine are stable, and four were excluded because of incomplete zzso 

zzso zzso is frequent in zzso zzso Because neurological deficits secondary to zzso can contribute to neurological zzso we recommend routine zzso examination and a multidisciplinary program of follow-up in cases of zzso zzso results suggest the combined use of zzso and zzso could represent a useful adjunct to clinical examination in patients in whom a zzso and zzso approach is preferred to the zzso zzso
