Renal damages after zzso shock wave zzso zzso were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging zzso including zzso dynamic zzso in 37 patients with zzso stone by spin echo methods zzso and zzso zzso and small tip angle zzso echo method zzso zzso zzso percent of the patients had changes in the zzso findings after zzso The frequently observed findings were zzso fluid collection zzso loss of zzso junction zzso and increased signal intensity of muscle and other adjacent tissue zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso showed low intensity band which suggests zzso zzso from the zzso into the zzso zzso In all cases the low intensity band became unclear after zzso because of zzso zzso due to zzso zzso including zzso dynamic zzso is considered to be a good procedure for evaluation of zzso damages due to zzso
