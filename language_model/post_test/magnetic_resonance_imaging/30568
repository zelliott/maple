To identify zzso of zzso weakness among persons with zzso knee zzso zzso 

zzso zzso individuals zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso grade IV knee zzso zzso zzso strength zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso were measured using a burst zzso zzso Muscle composition zzso muscle zzso area zzso and fat zzso zzso were zzso using magnetic resonance zzso zzso strength zzso was zzso zzso differences were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso analysis was applied to identify zzso of zzso An alpha level of zzso was zzso 

The zzso limb was significantly weaker, had lower zzso and had smaller zzso than the zzso zzso zzso explained zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso explained zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso in the zzso zzso 

Both reduced zzso and zzso contribute to muscle weakness in persons with knee zzso Similar to healthy elders, the best predictor of strength in the zzso zzso limb was largely determined by zzso whereas zzso was found to be the primary zzso of strength in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso may undermine the effectiveness of zzso strengthening programs in targeting zzso weakness in the zzso zzso
