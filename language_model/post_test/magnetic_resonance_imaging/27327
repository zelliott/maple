To evaluate the value of magnetic resonance dynamic zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso in the differentiation of benign and zzso musculoskeletal zzso 

zzso patients with zzso confirmed musculoskeletal tumors were examined with zzso and zzso Using single shot spin echo zzso imaging sequence and different b values of 400, zzso 800 and 1000 zzso we obtained the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of the zzso zzso values were measured before and after zzso with a b value of 600 zzso The zzso fast acquired multiple phase enhanced fast zzso zzso recalled echo sequence was obtained for zzso of the entire zzso The zzso intensity curve zzso dynamic zzso zzso maximum slope of increase zzso positive enhancement zzso signal enhancement ratio, and time to peak zzso were also zzso 

zzso showed no significant difference between benign and zzso tumors when the b value was 400, zzso zzso or 1000 zzso and it was not significantly different between benign and zzso tumors in both zzso and zzso with b value of 600 zzso zzso were classified into four types zzso showed rapid progression and gradual zzso zzso showed rapid progression but had no or slight zzso type 3 showed gradual zzso and type 4 had no or slight zzso Most zzso of zzso or zzso were zzso whereas most zzso of type 3 or type 4 were zzso When using zzso and type 2 as the standards of zzso the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was zzso and zzso zzso The types of zzso showed significant difference between benign and zzso musculoskeletal zzso When using zzso zzso zzso zzso as the standard of zzso the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was zzso and zzso zzso When using zzso as the standard of zzso the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was zzso zzso zzso Positive enhancement integral and signal enhancement ratio showed no significant difference between benign and zzso musculoskeletal zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are valuable in zzso benign from zzso musculoskeletal zzso zzso has the highest diagnostic zzso and zzso has the highest diagnostic zzso The mean zzso value are no significant difference between benign and zzso zzso
