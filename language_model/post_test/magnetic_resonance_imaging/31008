The aim of this study was to review seizure outcome, imaging zzso used, and complications following surgery in patients with zzso who had undergone zzso zzso surgery at our zzso 

Data from patients with zzso who had undergone surgery between April 1999 and October 2001 were zzso During this time period, 116 operations were performed in 109 patients with medically zzso zzso Among these patients, 22 were selected to undergo zzso zzso surgery primarily on the basis of whether they had no zzso visible on conventional magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso multiple zzso or one very large zzso that could not be completely zzso without the risk of significant zzso zzso A fourth group of patients in whom there was a single zzso in the eloquent cortex, a location associated with a significant risk of zzso zzso was also included in the zzso This latter group was assessed with the aid of zzso grid zzso that were zzso to the MR image and were used zzso to minimize zzso position zzso Other imaging zzso used included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso MR imaging, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso computerized zzso zzso zzso with MR imaging zzso After zzso images were then downloaded onto an zzso surgical system and the zzso area was then zzso The mean patient age was 33 years zzso zzso zzso and there was a mean follow up of 27 months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used were as zzso nine PET scans, seven zzso zzso grids, four zzso studies, one zzso MR image, and one combined zzso zzso zzso outcome was excellent in 17 patients zzso and not excellent in five zzso or favorable in 19 zzso and zzso in three zzso Six patients zzso had a transient neurological deficit, one patient zzso a permanent major deficit, and three patients zzso a permanent minor zzso Five patients zzso had a transient psychiatric problem zzso 

zzso zzso surgery offers a new perspective in surgery for zzso zzso imaging zzso previously zzso and often localized a seizure focus, but did not provide enough anatomical information to zzso the zzso zone confidently and zzso The zzso of these zzso to a zzso MR image and their incorporation into an zzso system has allowed surgeons to offer surgery to patients who may not previously have been considered eligible, with outcomes comparable to those in patients with more straightforward zzso zzso
