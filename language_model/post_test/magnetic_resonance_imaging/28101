To evaluate a new zzso zzso index of obstruction in patients with native zzso or zzso 

32 patients zzso age 20, range 3 zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to investigate the descending zzso The cross zzso area of the obstruction was compared with the area of the abdominal zzso as an index of obstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to record the zzso in the zzso jet and in the abdominal zzso According to the continuity equation the ratio of these zzso should equal the ratios of the cross zzso zzso The zzso and zzso half time of the zzso curve were zzso 

There was a close correlation between the zzso index of obstruction and the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of this ratio in detecting a zzso index equal to or less than zzso were better than those obtained with zzso only or the combination of zzso and zzso half zzso 

The new zzso zzso ratio correlated closely with an anatomical index of zzso It was easy to record in most patients and it avoided difficulties about the choice of instantaneous or peak to peak zzso and whether or not to subtract zzso zzso for the calculation of zzso
