To show the ability of magnetic resonance zzso zzso to zzso the pancreatic zzso after zzso stimulation in order to distinguish between zzso zzso and reduced output in chronic zzso 

zzso images were acquired in a zzso scanner using a zzso zzso and a heavily zzso standard zzso zzso zzso Thirty-one patients zzso zzso zzso who routinely underwent zzso for suspected zzso zzso zzso zzso recurring abdominal pain zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso 6 and suspected zzso zzso zzso 2) were zzso During the investigation 1 zzso zzso zzso were administered zzso zzso volume of fluid, start of zzso achievement of a plateau of zzso and a combined score of these parameters zzso zzso were assessed and zzso zzso and specificity were calculated for these zzso 

27 patients had no pancreatic pathology, and four suffered from chronic zzso Patients without pancreatic disorders produced a mean pancreatic fluid volume of 183 plus minus 86 zzso whereas patients with chronic zzso zzso 61 zzso 39 zzso zzso started after a mean time of 95 zzso 94 seconds (no pancreatic zzso and 62 zzso 13 seconds zzso zzso The zzso score achieved a high accuracy in the detection of chronic zzso 

Our study demonstrated the feasibility of measuring pancreatic output by zzso after stimulation with zzso Moreover, a distinction between normal zzso and patients with chronic zzso is zzso
