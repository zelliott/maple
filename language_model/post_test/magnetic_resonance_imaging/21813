We report clinical findings and zzso activities in adrenal zzso in 2 cases of zzso zzso studies revealed an zzso level of plasma zzso and a diminished zzso rhythm of plasma zzso A significant increase in plasma cortisol levels in response to zzso stimulation was observed in both zzso After the administration of zzso in one case, urinary zzso of zzso zzso significantly increased, although the plasma zzso level did not zzso zzso zzso showed large masses in both adrenal zzso and bilateral zzso was identified on adrenal zzso The totals for the bilateral adrenal zzso were 98 g and 105 zzso respectively, and the left adrenal was larger than the right in both zzso zzso content in the zzso measured by high performance liquid zzso zzso showed that the cortisol content was definitely lower than that in zzso zzso zzso and even in normal zzso The activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated in one case, and all of them were reduced in the zzso Especially that of zzso was remarkably zzso These data suggest that cortisol production in zzso is inefficient, and that the cause of zzso syndrome may be related to the marked increase in the number of cells or bulk of the zzso
