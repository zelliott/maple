zzso surgery for magnetic resonance imaging zzso patients has a less favorable zzso 

zzso of zzso abnormal zzso zzso patterns and their potential contribution to assessment of the topography of the zzso zone zzso is addressed in zzso patients with frontal lobe zzso 

Between September 1998 and July 2005, 12 zzso frontal lobe zzso patients underwent zzso with zzso follow-up of longer than 1 year zzso zzso zzso Original software zzso zzso trained on a database of normal volunteers was used to determine which zzso had zzso out of the normal range zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pattern, zzso zzso seizure control, and zzso were zzso 

At last zzso 8 of 12 patients zzso were Engel class I (7 zzso and 1 zzso 2 class II, and 2 class zzso Small focal cortical zzso was zzso diagnosed in 9 of the 12 patients zzso including 7 of 8 zzso patients zzso A zzso pattern was found to be in the zzso area in 9 patients zzso in the zzso frontal lobe out of the zzso in 2, and limited to the zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso patterns appear to be associated with the topography of the zzso in zzso frontal lobe zzso and may have a useful role in zzso zzso Small focal cortical zzso not detected with zzso is often found on zzso examination, particularly in the depth of the zzso part of the superior frontal zzso and intermediate frontal zzso suggesting a specific zzso critical zone in these zzso
