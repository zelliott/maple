Except for purely zzso methods, statistical methods depend on assumptions about the distribution of the data zzso While these assumptions are easily checked for a single zzso zzso with diagnostic zzso in the zzso zzso model used with functional zzso zzso it is zzso to check with a massive number of zzso In previous work we have demonstrated how to diagnose model assumptions and zzso for zzso zzso models using a working assumption of independent zzso our work depended on images and time series of summary statistics that, when simultaneously viewed zzso identify problem scans and zzso In this article we extend our previous work to account for zzso zzso in zzso models and show how analogous methods can be used on group models where multiple subjects are zzso We apply these methods to the zzso zzso Image Analysis Contest zzso data and find several anomalies, but none that appear to invalidate the results for that zzso With the group zzso data we find one subject (and possibly two more) that demonstrate a different pattern of zzso None of our conclusions would be arrived at by simply looking at images of zzso statistics, demonstrating the importance of model assessment through exploration of the data and diagnosis of model zzso
