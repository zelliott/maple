zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yields numerous zzso that zzso a range of zzso values scattered in the zzso This preliminary study evaluated the significance of this range of zzso 

zzso images were obtained by zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso for 13 zzso Pixel values of the resulting zzso were divided into two groups: group I with zzso and group II with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso were determined, and zzso with surgical outcomes and scalp and invasive zzso findings was zzso 

In 10 of 13 cases, group I zzso showed good zzso with zzso scalp zzso In addition, group I zzso corresponded well to invasive zzso findings in nine of 10 zzso Group I zzso had bilateral zzso in seven of 13 zzso In 10 of 13 cases, group I zzso corresponded well to regions of surgical zzso Of these 10 patients, nine showed good zzso with scalp zzso eight showed good invasive zzso zzso and eight were seizure free after zzso zzso group II zzso had good zzso with zzso scalp zzso in only five of 13 cases, and invasive zzso findings, in only five of 10 zzso Group II zzso had bilateral zzso in 10 of 13 zzso All 10 cases underwent unilateral surgical zzso and all had good surgical zzso In six of 13 cases, group II zzso showed zzso with surgical zzso Of these six zzso four had poor zzso with scalp zzso one had poor zzso with invasive zzso and five had good surgical zzso zzso and specificity for seizure zzso of Group I zzso were zzso and zzso respectively while sensitivity and specificity of Group II zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate that zzso with zzso of zzso zzso values show good zzso with seizure zzso whereas zzso of zzso may zzso Therefore zzso zzso differences may improve the specificity and zzso value of zzso zzso
