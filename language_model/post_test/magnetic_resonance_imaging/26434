The relationship between bleeding and subsequent anemia zzso and the occurrence of stroke has not been sufficiently zzso The purpose of the present study was to zzso the characteristics of stroke associated with zzso 

We studied 16 consecutive patients with acute stroke associated with anemia zzso level on admission zzso or zzso zzso and compared their stroke zzso with those of 32 control zzso 

The cause of anemia was upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 11 patients zzso in zzso zzso in 2, and zzso zzso in 1), bleeding from a zzso in 2, zzso cervical bleeding in 1, zzso probably related to medication in 1, and chronic blood drainage in zzso At least 10 patients had a history of recent zzso week), active zzso Clinical and imaging studies showed that all the patients had zzso and none had zzso zzso Thirteen patients had zzso in the region of the middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso region in 2; zzso cortical area in zzso zzso area in 5, and zzso artery region in 1), 2 had anterior cerebral artery zzso region zzso and 1 had zzso zzso All 11 patients who underwent vascular imaging studies showed significant zzso and/or zzso of the internal carotid artery zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1), or the zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the different stroke zzso zzso vessel zzso zzso small vessel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso more frequent in patients with stroke associated with zzso than in the controls, even though the demographics and risk factors were similar in each zzso 

The close zzso relationship between the bleeding and the onset of stroke, as well as the predominance of the zzso zzso in the zzso group as compared to controls, suggest that zzso may zzso zzso cerebral zzso A zzso zzso enhanced zzso or a combination of these appears to be the zzso zzso
