The objective of this study was to investigate zzso position during different degrees of disk zzso The degree of disk displacement was evaluated on zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images of 76 zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso and was classified into three grades (1 to zzso To establish zzso position, the zzso superior and zzso joint spaces were measured on corrected zzso The possible relationship between zzso position, indicated by the zzso of joint space and successive degree of disk zzso was compared by a one-way zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The anterior joint space was significantly larger in grades 1, 2, and 3 disk zzso than in grade 0 pointing to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso joint space was significantly smaller in grades 1 and 2 compared with grade zzso When the degree of the disk displacement becomes severe zzso grade 3 disk zzso the zzso joint space tends to increase to a similar distance as in a normal healthy joint pointing to a more normal zzso zzso
