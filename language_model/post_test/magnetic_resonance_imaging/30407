To zzso compare in zzso the diagnostic accuracy for zzso zzso zzso of standard zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging versus that of zzso DE MR imaging with and without breath holding and/or cardiac zzso with zzso findings or absence of surgical creation of zzso as the reference zzso 

This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use zzso 21 zzso were zzso with one standard and two zzso DE MR techniques in four conditions: condition 1, breath holding and steady zzso 2, zzso holding and steady zzso 3, breath holding and irregular heart zzso and 4, zzso holding and irregular heart zzso Images were zzso and scored for diagnostic zzso image quality, and observer zzso zzso zzso and diagnostic accuracy for zzso detection were calculated for each technique and clinical condition zzso The zzso paired zzso and zzso tests were used for zzso 

Fifteen dogs had zzso Among conditions zzso differences were not significant zzso zzso zzso data were pooled and referred to as group zzso zzso 1 was group zzso zzso image quality, and observer confidence, respectively, for standard DE MR imaging were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in group A but only zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in group B zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso scores for zzso techniques were unaffected by respiratory motion and/or zzso zzso techniques had higher accuracy zzso and zzso vs zzso better image quality zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and greater confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso for each) than standard DE MR zzso In group A, standard performed better than zzso DE MR zzso 

Standard DE MR imaging is appropriate for zzso detection with breath holding and regular heart rhythm, while zzso techniques are appropriate with an irregular heart rhythm and when breath holding is not zzso
