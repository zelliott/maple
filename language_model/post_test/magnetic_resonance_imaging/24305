Much recent interest surrounds the use of action zzso which is observing another individual performing a motor task, in stroke rehabilitation, to promote motor recovery by engaging similar brain regions to action zzso This may be especially useful in individuals with limited zzso Here, we assess how cortical motor activity during action observation is affected by stroke and by zzso motor zzso 

We used functional zzso to compare brain activity during right and left hand action observation in right-handed nondisabled participants and participants who were right-handed before left zzso zzso All participants performed the same actions after their functional zzso 

zzso participants show greater bilateral cortical motor activity when observing actions made using the left hand, whereas participants with stroke show greater zzso cortical motor activity when observing actions made using the right zzso hand zzso zzso For both groups, action processing is modulated by motor zzso cortical motor activity is greater when observing the hand with lower motor scores zzso zzso Furthermore, for stroke, the extent of zzso activity zzso with zzso volume zzso in a pattern that suggests zzso zzso 

We found that action observation activates specific motor plans in damaged motor circuits after stroke, and this activity is related to motor capability to perform the same zzso zzso motor activity during action observation may be relevant to motor learning, and to motor zzso in stroke zzso
