Language dominance research using functional zzso has made important contributions to clinical zzso Nevertheless, although recent zzso studies demonstrated zzso zzso by human voice perception, the influence of voice perception in terms of language dominance has not been adequately zzso We aimed to accurately clarify language dominance for zzso processing in the zzso zzso by focusing on human voice zzso 

Thirty normal right-handed subjects were scanned by functional MR imaging while listening to sentences zzso reverse sentences zzso and identifiable zzso sounds zzso We investigated cerebral zzso and the distribution of individual zzso Index under 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso contrast, including human voice perception, revealed zzso zzso in the anterior zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso including zzso processing, showed zzso zzso in the inferior and middle frontal zzso and middle zzso zzso The zzso contrast, without the influence of human voice perception, showed no zzso zzso in the right zzso zzso or zzso zzso was observed in 22 of 27 subjects zzso under the zzso contrast in the zzso zzso Although 9 of 27 subjects zzso showed symmetrical or zzso zzso under the zzso contrast in the zzso zzso all subjects showed zzso zzso under the zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso by human voice perception could mask zzso zzso by zzso zzso This finding suggests that the influence of human voice perception should be adequately taken into account when language dominance is zzso
