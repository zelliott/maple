The zzso energy economy excessively favors zzso spontaneous neural activity over zzso evoked activity, presumably to maintain its internal zzso Emerging hypotheses capable of explaining such an investment zzso that the zzso intrinsic functional architecture encodes a blueprint for its repertoire of responses to the external zzso Yet, there is little evidence directly linking intrinsic and zzso activity in the zzso Here we relate differences among individuals in the magnitude of zzso activity during performance of an zzso zzso task, to spontaneous zzso phenomena observed during zzso Specifically, we focused on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso measures obtained during rest successfully predicted the magnitude of zzso activity in a variety of regions that were all activated during performance of the zzso zzso In these regions, higher zzso zzso at rest predicted higher zzso zzso zzso zzso measures obtained during rest were also found to have robust zzso value for zzso In zzso zzso regions, zzso zzso predicted not only the speed and consistency of performance but also the magnitude of the behavioral zzso effect embedded in the zzso zzso These results support the emerging hypothesis that the zzso repertoire of responses to the external world are represented and updated in the zzso intrinsic functional zzso
