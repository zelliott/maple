A major impetus in functional zzso development is to enhance sensitivity to changes in neural zzso One way to improve sensitivity is to enhance contrast to noise ratio, for instance by increasing field strength or the number of receiving zzso If these parameters are zzso there is still the possibility to zzso scans by altering speed or signal strength zzso ratio zzso We here demonstrate a very fast zzso zzso by combining a three-dimensional zzso zzso of echo shifting with a train of zzso pulse sequence with a commercial zzso head zzso and sensitivity zzso zzso zzso uses time zzso by means of echo zzso Moreover, zzso scans can accommodate zzso in two directions, reducing scan time zzso The present zzso sequence achieves full brain coverage within 500 zzso We compared this with a two-dimensional zzso echo zzso imaging zzso scan with identical brain coverage on 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso frequency range and zzso for thumb movement and visual zzso zzso were zzso zzso show improved zzso zzso across the brain for zzso compared with zzso The percentage signal change and relative standard zzso of the noise were smaller for zzso zzso for brain zzso as reflected by zzso was consistently higher for zzso and this seemed to be mainly due to the increased number of observations within a fixed time zzso We conclude that zzso accelerated with zzso in two directions can be more sensitive to zzso signal changes than the widely used zzso when a fixed amount of time is available for functional zzso zzso
