To develop and evaluate a zzso tool to zzso zzso zzso volumes on the basis of zzso and to apply it in patients after zzso transplantation zzso zzso CT zzso was employed as a reference zzso providing split zzso lung zzso Lung volumes derived from pulmonary function test results served as clinical parameters and were used as the zzso zzso 

Eight patients zzso age, 54 zzso with zzso and six patients zzso age, 58 zzso with idiopathic pulmonary zzso All patients were evaluated following zzso zzso was performed during inspiration zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 10 zzso For correlation with zzso zzso images were reconstructed in zzso orientation to match the same zzso zzso zzso lung was determined by zzso zzso of zzso zzso was performed on a zzso scanner using a zzso fast zzso shot sequence in zzso orientation covering the whole lung after inhalation of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso gas followed by normal room air for the rest of the tidal zzso Lung zzso on zzso was done using different zzso 

In zzso patients, zzso showed excellent correlation zzso zzso zzso with vital capacity, while CT correlated zzso zzso zzso with total lung zzso zzso correlated well with CT zzso zzso zzso for zzso and native zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed a good correlation zzso zzso zzso with the zzso lung volume from zzso zzso thresholds in zzso reveal differences between zzso and zzso lung areas with a different distribution in zzso and zzso 

zzso is superior to CT in zzso to demonstrate zzso lung areas that participate in gas zzso In fibrosis, zzso and CT have a similar zzso The decrease pattern and the zzso ratio between ventilation of native and transplanted lungs will have to be investigated as a new surrogate for the zzso follow-up in patients undergoing zzso
