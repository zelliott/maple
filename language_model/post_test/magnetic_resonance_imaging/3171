We investigated the zzso findings of five patients with primary zzso of the inferior zzso zzso zzso comparing zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso presentation ranged from an zzso zzso with obstruction of the zzso to a tumor mass extending from the media zzso into the surrounding zzso tissue with only slight zzso into the zzso The zzso were associated with late or few zzso zzso zzso findings could not be zzso In cases with an zzso growth a zzso zzso zzso tumor with an zzso contrast zzso is characteristic in CT zzso Additional information was provided by zzso zzso with zzso involvement showed homogeneous intermediate signal intensity zzso on zzso and mixed zzso zzso on zzso zzso In cases with predominantly zzso growth, both CT and zzso demonstrated the zzso to be zzso and allowed to differentiate between tumor extent and obliterating zzso Modern imaging zzso allow an early and accurate zzso diagnosis resulting in a higher rate of surgical zzso and improvement of zzso
