The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of demographic factors (age of zzso sex and years of education) on the distribution of cortical thickness in a large sample of patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso The study participants consisted of 193 zzso patients and 142 controls with no cognitive impairment zzso that were measured with cortical thickness across the entire zzso The effects of demographic factors on cortical thickness were analyzed by applying linear zzso after controlling zzso zzso Older individuals in zzso group showed more cortical thinning in zzso zzso association zzso and zzso than younger zzso Early onset zzso was associated with cortical thinning in the zzso zzso whereas late onset zzso was associated with cortical thinning in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso group demonstrated sex-related differences in cortical zzso although those differences were not present in the zzso zzso While the education effect was absent in zzso individuals, high levels of education in the zzso group correlated with cortical thinning in the frontal and zzso association zzso Our results show that zzso with earlier onset and higher education had suffered more pronounced cortical zzso in specific parts of the brain than their counterparts, which may be related to cognitive reserve zzso
