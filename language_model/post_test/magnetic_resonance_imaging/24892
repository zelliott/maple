Bone stress injuries are common in track and field zzso zzso of risk factors and correlation of these to magnetic resonance imaging zzso grading could be helpful in determining recovery zzso 

To examine the relationships between zzso grading of bone stress injuries with clinical risk factors and time to return to sport in collegiate track and field zzso 

zzso study zzso Level of evidence, zzso 

A total of 211 male and female collegiate track and field and cross-country athletes were followed zzso through their competitive zzso All athletes had zzso history, physical examination, and zzso zzso obtained zzso An additional questionnaire was completed regarding nutritional behaviors, zzso patterns, and prior injuries, as well as a zzso diet zzso zzso X-ray zzso was performed at baseline and each year of participation in the zzso Athletes with clinical evidence of bone stress injuries had plain zzso If zzso findings were negative, zzso was zzso Bone stress injuries were evaluated by 2 independent zzso utilizing an zzso grading zzso The zzso grading and risk factors were evaluated to identify zzso of time to return to zzso 

Thirty-four of the athletes (12 men, 22 zzso sustained 61 bone stress injuries during the zzso study zzso The mean prospective assessment for participants was zzso zzso In the multiple zzso model, zzso grade and zzso bone mineral density zzso emerged as significant and independent zzso of time to return to zzso Specifically, the higher the zzso grade zzso zzso zzso and lower the zzso zzso zzso zzso the longer the recovery zzso zzso of the bone injury at predominantly zzso sites of the zzso neck, zzso bone, and zzso was also associated with a prolonged time to return to zzso Female athletes with zzso and zzso had bone stress injuries of higher zzso grades compared with zzso athletes zzso zzso zzso 

Higher zzso grade, lower zzso and skeletal sites of zzso zzso bone structures were associated with a delayed recovery of bone stress injuries in track and field zzso zzso of these risk factors, as well as nutritional and zzso factors, can be clinically useful in determining injury severity and time to return to zzso
