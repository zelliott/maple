The aim of this study was to use quantitative zzso transfer zzso imaging to assess the different pathological zzso of tissue damage in multiple sclerosis zzso and examine whether the zzso parameters may be used to explain the disability in zzso zzso zzso zzso Thirteen patients with zzso and 14 healthy controls were prescribed conventional zzso and quantitative zzso imaging at zzso zzso A zzso model of zzso (where A refers to the free pool and B to the zzso zzso was fitted to the data yielding a zzso relaxation rate zzso a relative size F of zzso pool, zzso relaxation times zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the two pools and a forward exchange rate zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso was also zzso The mean zzso parameters of the normal appearing white matter zzso and of zzso in patients, and of white matter in controls were zzso zzso parameters were significantly different between zzso and zzso in patients, and between the zzso and the white matter of controls (with the exception of zzso zzso and the zzso Two models were investigated using ordered zzso regression, with the expanded disability status scale zzso as the dependent zzso In the first one, mean zzso zzso parameters and zzso load were entered as explanatory zzso in the second one, mean zzso variables within zzso and zzso load were entered as explanatory zzso zzso zzso zzso was the zzso most significantly associated with zzso in zzso This zzso might represent a weighted average of the relaxation times of spins with different molecular zzso and therefore its variation could indicate a change in the balance between zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso load significantly predicted disability only when combined zzso This might reflect the complex interaction between zzso zzso zzso inflammation and zzso loss taking place within zzso
