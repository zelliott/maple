zzso with fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited zzso and learning problems, are known to be impaired in executive zzso The current study is the first to investigate the performance of females with fragile X on a cognitive interference task utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Fourteen females with fragile X and 14 zzso healthy controls were zzso while they performed a counting zzso interference zzso Compared to controls, females with fragile X appeared to have longer reaction times during the interference condition of the task, and adopted a strategy trading speed for zzso zzso with fragile X also had a significantly different pattern of zzso than zzso Whereas controls showed significant zzso in the zzso frontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso females with fragile X showed more extensive zzso in the anterior region of the prefrontal cortex, and failed to show expected zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso analyses revealed that females with fragile X had reduced zzso in the left zzso zzso thought to be involved in modulating zzso zzso zzso with fragile X also demonstrated a markedly different pattern of zzso from zzso These findings suggest that deficits in cognitive interference processing during the counting zzso task observed in females with fragile X may arise from inability to appropriately recruit and zzso lateral prefrontal and zzso zzso
