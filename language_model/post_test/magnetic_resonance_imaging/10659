The Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso or zzso criteria zzso zzso zzso are widely used to measure response in tumors, but there are few studies evaluating these criteria in brain zzso We compared linear and zzso zzso in adult high-grade zzso enhancing zzso to determine the agreement between zzso in defining responses and in their subsequent relation to zzso We hypothesized that the zzso zzso criteria maybe suitable for response assessment in adult high-grade zzso zzso size on zzso scans in 104 patients with high-grade enhancing zzso treated on clinical trial protocols was measured by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso product of the two longest perpendicular zzso zzso (three zzso product of the longest perpendicular diameters in one plane and the longest zzso diameter to that zzso enhancing volume zzso and total volume zzso A total of 388 zzso zzso zzso scans (104 baseline and zzso follow-up zzso were zzso zzso analysis zzso and zzso was performed with commercially available zzso zzso and zzso correlations zzso were high for all zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was excellent zzso zzso zzso among all zzso except for zzso zzso zzso zzso Patient response rates ranged from zzso to zzso Median zzso survival zzso and six-month zzso survival zzso were not significantly different among the methods zzso zzso months to zzso months and zzso to zzso zzso zzso analyses of response at two months using linear methods predicted overall survival with hazard ratios of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest high zzso among zzso zzso TV, and zzso but not zzso methods in assessing enhancing tumor progression and in zzso zzso and zzso in adult brain tumor zzso The tumor response at two months assessed by linear methods correlated better with overall zzso Thus, linear methods are comparable to zzso methods, but simpler to implement for routine clinical use and for designing clinical trials of brain zzso
