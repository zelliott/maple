The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of magnetic resonance zzso contrast agents on zzso outcome and zzso size in a rat stroke zzso zzso cerebral zzso was induced in 80 rats using an zzso zzso technique of the middle cerebral zzso Four hours after zzso 64 animals (4 groups of 16 each) received zzso zzso in a single zzso zzso or triple zzso zzso clinical dose or the zzso zzso iron oxide particles contrast agent NC zzso in a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical dose, zzso Sixteen animals received zzso saline zzso zzso zzso score and body weight were recorded every 8 zzso zzso hours after vessel zzso zzso size was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither the normal nor the triple clinical dose of zzso or NC zzso in the single or double dose had any statistically significant effects on zzso volume, zzso body weight, or zzso outcome zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso injection of zzso and the zzso zzso iron oxide particles NC zzso in clinically relevant doses does not significantly affect zzso volume and clinical outcome of acute cerebral zzso
