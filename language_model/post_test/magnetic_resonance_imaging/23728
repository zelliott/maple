zzso CT images are often unable to zzso the extent of possible cochlear obliteration after meningitis or after zzso bone zzso The exact zzso of this extent, however, is crucial for cochlear implant surgery zzso Thus MR imaging of zzso pathology is becoming an increasingly significant imaging zzso 

The clinical relevance of the zzso zzso interference in steady zzso MR sequence is explained using 5 selected cases of different inner ear zzso 

Two of the examined patients had zzso inner ear signals, whereas in 3 cases zzso rendered relevant information about partial or total cochlear zzso 

These clinical examples illustrate how the ideal fluid and tissue contrast of zzso make this new technique suitable as a primary tool for evaluating inner ear obliteration before cochlear implant zzso
