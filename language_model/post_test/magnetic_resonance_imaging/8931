This study was undertaken to investigate the in zzso effect of zzso labeling with iron oxide zzso for zzso on zzso zzso insulin zzso and gene zzso zzso rat zzso were labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso a clinically approved zzso contrast zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso The iron content of labeled zzso was found to increase in a zzso zzso More than zzso of the zzso were labeled with 100 zzso zzso We confirmed the zzso of iron oxide zzso within zzso zzso by insulin zzso As the concentration of zzso increased, zzso values as determined by zzso zzso on a zzso zzso MR scanner zzso zzso of 100 zzso in a medium containing 100 zzso zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso provided sufficient contrast for zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the viability of labeled zzso was not different from that of zzso zzso No statistical difference was observed between labeled zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in terms of the ability to zzso insulin, as determined by the zzso stimulation zzso We also evaluated the effect of iron oxide incorporation on the gene expressions in zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in labeled zzso was significantly elevated zzso zzso zzso fold zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso fold zzso zzso p zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso fold zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso of an important zzso factor for insulin gene transcription, zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased in labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso fold zzso zzso p zzso zzso The findings of this study indicate that zzso provides a satisfactory means to image zzso and has no deleterious effect on zzso function or gene zzso
