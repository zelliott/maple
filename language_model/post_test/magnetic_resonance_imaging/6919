The majority of cases of combined anterior zzso hormone zzso zzso reported in Japanese patients have zzso zzso This study describes for the first time a zzso zzso of the zzso gene in two Japanese siblings with zzso born to zzso zzso 

Two siblings were growth retarded at 3 years of age and developed zzso zzso function tests showed combined zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The size of their zzso zzso decreased with age, as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The zzso gene was zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso followed by direct zzso Both children were zzso for a novel single base deletion at zzso 53 zzso while their parents were zzso This zzso if zzso predicts the production of a protein lacking the zzso zzso required for DNA zzso suggesting that the zzso was the direct cause of zzso in these zzso 

zzso is the first reported Japanese zzso gene zzso In Japan, zzso zzso appears to be a less frequent cause of zzso than does zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients of Caucasian and European zzso
