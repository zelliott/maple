The traditional view that the zzso is involved only in the control of movements has been changed zzso It has been suggested that the human zzso is involved in zzso and zzso Likewise, besides cortical activity in zzso and visual areas, an increased global zzso of the zzso has been revealed during zzso reading in blind zzso Our purpose was to investigate whether there is zzso zzso during zzso reading by blind subjects other than zzso zzso related to finger zzso Early blind and normal sighted subjects were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during zzso reading, tactile discrimination of nonsense dots, dots forming zzso and finger zzso The experiments were done in block zzso Echo zzso imaging sequences were carried out on a zzso MR zzso All blind individuals reading zzso showed robust zzso of the zzso and lateral aspects of zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso but more predominately on the right zzso Additionally, zzso was present in the zzso zzso within zzso IV, zzso and zzso predominantly on the zzso zzso nonsense dots did not reveal any zzso of zzso I, but did reveal zzso within the zzso part of zzso IV, zzso and zzso predominately on the zzso Analysis of sighted subjects during reading of printed text revealed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso I zzso predominantly on the zzso zzso analysis of dots representing symbols revealed an zzso in zzso IV and VIII and in right zzso II but not in zzso zzso In conclusion, parts of zzso zzso during zzso reading in blind subjects zzso within zzso IV, zzso and zzso overlap with the known hand representation within the zzso and are likely related to the zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso during zzso reading within bilateral zzso I may be due to language processes or inner speech similar to those found during text reading in normal sighted zzso Object recognition did not account for zzso I zzso
