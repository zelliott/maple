the purpose of the present study was to directly compare the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection of coronary artery zzso 

both imaging zzso have emerged as potential zzso coronary imaging zzso however, zzso zzso patients to radiation and zzso contrast zzso 

one hundred zzso consecutive patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso CT before zzso X-ray zzso The diagnostic accuracy of the 2 zzso for detecting significant coronary zzso zzso 50% zzso diameter zzso in segments zzso zzso zzso diameter was compared with quantitative invasive coronary zzso as the reference zzso 

in the zzso analysis zzso and CT zzso showed similar diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 75 to zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 80 to zzso p zzso zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso 76 to zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 80 to zzso p zzso zzso and specificity of zzso zzso zzso 63 to zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 70 to zzso p zzso zzso zzso All cases of left main or zzso disease were correctly diagnosed by zzso and CT zzso In the zzso analysis zzso and CT zzso were similar in their ability to identify patients who subsequently underwent zzso the area under the zzso characteristic curve was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for CT zzso 

zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso CT zzso similarly identify significant coronary zzso in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease scheduled for zzso coronary zzso However, CT zzso showed a favorable trend toward higher diagnostic zzso
