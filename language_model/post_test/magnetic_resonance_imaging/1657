Several models for the application of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso have recently been reported, most of them zzso Two fundamental issues need to be zzso optimal use of the scanner to ensure a wide base for research, development and clinical application, and an zzso model that zzso such zzso 

While in our setting the zzso project was initiated by the zzso the need for wider use of the facilities was zzso since the beginning of the planning phase in zzso An zzso model was developed that allowed for development of zzso applications, zzso imaging, and zzso interventions and for the research and development work of the zzso A zzso zzso T MR scanner was installed in a dedicated operating room zzso zzso to this scanner is the ability to turn off the zzso allowing for normal OR activities and devices, and to turn on the magnet as needed with a relatively short zzso ramp up zzso A staged surgical technique was zzso allowing for transfer of data to the zzso outside the scanner during zzso In zzso zzso was used as one part of a zzso system that included ultrasound imaging, zzso cortical stimulation during awake procedures, zzso and two zzso 

34 zzso cases included 27 brain zzso zzso 5 brain zzso zzso 1 zzso of an zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso The scanner could also be used for normal clinical imaging where obese patients, children, zzso patients and zzso control examinations were the major zzso The zzso performed 110 interventions, including bone and abdominal zzso nerve root zzso and local pain therapies, with the optical needle tracking system under continuous zzso zzso The zzso model allowed frequent use of the facilities for both neurosurgery and zzso and continuous development of the zzso zzso ultrasound was used in 20 zzso zzso and in two open brain zzso This resulted in reduction of the number of MR imaging sessions during zzso Five of the 27 zzso were performed as awake zzso with cortical zzso For two of the zzso zzso and depth zzso registrations were zzso Furthermore, various zzso instruments and devices were zzso 

zzso zzso is an imaging tool that can be useful especially in the context of zzso A scanner that can be turned off during surgery is particularly appropriate for zzso The concept of joint use of such facilities with other clinicians is mutually zzso
