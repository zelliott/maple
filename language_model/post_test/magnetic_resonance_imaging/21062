The zzso model of speech processing includes a zzso stream that maps auditory to motor features at the zzso level rather than at the zzso zzso However, the literature on gesture is an invitation to revise this model because it suggests that the zzso zzso of the zzso route is a major site of zzso zzso Here we investigated zzso mapping using zzso pairs that were either zzso or zzso Using zzso in 28 subjects, we found that zzso and zzso activity during auditory processing of single action words was modulated by the prior audiovisual context in which the words had been zzso The zzso signal was suppressed following repetition of the auditory word alone, and further suppressed following repetition of the word accompanied by a zzso gesture zzso zzso + grasping zzso zzso repetition suppression was not observed when the same action word was accompanied by an zzso gesture zzso zzso + zzso We propose a simple model to explain these zzso auditory and visual information zzso onto zzso zzso where it is represented in a comparable format to determine zzso between speech and zzso This ability of the zzso route to detect audiovisual semantic zzso suggests that its function is not restricted to the zzso zzso
