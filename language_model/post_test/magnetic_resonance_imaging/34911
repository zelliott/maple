Using statistical methods the reconstruction of zzso zzso zzso zzso images can be improved by high-resolution anatomical information obtained from magnetic resonance zzso zzso We implemented two approaches that zzso MR data for PET zzso The anatomical MR information is modeled as a zzso distribution of the PET image and combined with the distribution of the measured PET data to generate the a zzso function from which the expectation zzso zzso zzso with a maximum a zzso zzso zzso is zzso One zzso zzso uses a Gibbs function to model interactions between neighboring zzso within the anatomical zzso The other zzso applies a zzso function with the same mean for all zzso in a given anatomical zzso A basic assumption of these methods is that the zzso is zzso distributed inside anatomical zzso zzso and phantom data are investigated under the following aspects: count density, object size, missing anatomical information, and zzso of the anatomical zzso Compared with the maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso the results of both zzso show a large reduction of noise with a better zzso of zzso Of the two zzso tested, the zzso method is superior in noise reduction (up to zzso Regarding incorrect a zzso information the zzso zzso is very sensitive, whereas the zzso zzso proved to be stable with a small change of recovery zzso between zzso and zzso
