To evaluate zzso of a simplified method for measuring zzso zzso parameters in patients with cancer and to explore effects of treatment with a putative zzso zzso 

A total of 19 patients enrolled on treatment trials with the putative zzso agent zzso underwent contrast enhanced zzso and 11 had a second examination eight weeks post zzso zzso media concentration as a function of time was calculated using changes in signal and literature baseline zzso values in normal muscle or liver reference zzso zzso zzso zzso including the area under the contrast concentration zzso time curve zzso were calculated for zzso in normal liver and muscle, and in zzso 

The zzso of variation for zzso parameters in normal tissue were zzso to zzso No significant changes were detected in normal liver over two months of zzso In tumors and muscle, a significant decrease in the zzso and maximum contrast concentration was zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso parameters utilizing a method based on known zzso values in a reference tissue is low enough to detect changes in tumors during zzso Use of this method as a zzso marker should be further zzso
