This paper presents and demonstrates a method for using magnetic resonance imaging to measure local pressure of a fluid zzso a porous zzso The method is tested both in a zzso system of packed zzso gel and in saturated zzso glass zzso experiencing fluid zzso The fluid used contains zzso gas in the form of zzso average diameter gas filled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suspended in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cellulose with zzso zzso studies at zzso T demonstrate relative magnetic resonance signal changes of zzso per bar in bulk fluid for an echo time zzso zzso and zzso in consolidated porous media for zzso zzso over the range zzso bar for a spatial resolution of zzso zzso and a zzso resolution of 30 zzso The stability of this solution with relation to applied pressure and methods for improving sensitivity are zzso
