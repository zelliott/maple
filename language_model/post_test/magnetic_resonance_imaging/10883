A variety of imaging zzso can be used in muscle zzso These range from plain zzso to conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso This review places these imaging methods into their relevant clinical contexts on the basis of the best available research zzso 

Plain zzso have limited roles in imaging patients with muscle zzso An exception is identifying zzso in patients with zzso there is some evidence that effective early treatment may reduce its frequency and zzso zzso has been used in several centers but it appears to have limited zzso zzso though successfully used in a number of units, is relatively little used, though the evidence suggests it would be sensible if this method were adopted more zzso zzso is currently the key imaging zzso It is useful in diagnosing zzso diabetic muscle zzso and inflammatory zzso Its main proven value is identifying the best sites for biopsy in early zzso though it can help differentiate between different forms of muscle disease when there is diagnostic zzso The area of most intense ongoing original research is zzso which can show the zzso of normal and abnormal zzso Changes in the ratios of zzso zzso and zzso particularly during exercise provide insights into the zzso consequences of muscle diseases and may, in the future, suggest alternative therapeutic zzso 

zzso resonance imaging is a useful adjunct when diagnosing muscle zzso It is particularly useful to identify suitable sites for muscle zzso zzso may be equally zzso though there is less supporting evidence from existing zzso MRS is the area in which most current novel research is zzso
