In a zzso prospective study, 58 patients with zzso underwent systematic cerebral and abdominal zzso within 7 days following zzso zzso zzso zzso modified zzso and therapeutic plans were established by two experts just before and after zzso and then zzso zzso was initially classified as zzso in 29 patients, possible in 27, and excluded in zzso zzso detected cerebral zzso in 47 patients zzso zzso zzso in 25, zzso in 32, and silent zzso in zzso and abdominal zzso in 20 patients zzso Based solely on zzso results without taking zzso into account, experts upgraded zzso diagnostic zzso in 8 out of 29 zzso zzso zzso cases either to zzso in 6 or to possible in zzso This upgrading was exclusively due to cerebral zzso in four patients and to cerebral and/or abdominal zzso in four zzso Experts modified zzso therapeutic plans in 11 zzso out of the 58 patients, based solely on cerebral zzso including modification of surgical plans in six zzso zzso Overall, early zzso led experts to modify zzso and/or therapeutic plans in 16 zzso zzso 

zzso identified cerebral and/or abdominal zzso zzso in many patients with zzso but more frequently zzso Both cerebral and abdominal zzso findings affected diagnosis, but only cerebral zzso affected clinical management zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Protection des zzso zzso de France zzso
