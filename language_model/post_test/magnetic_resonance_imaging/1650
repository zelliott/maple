zzso including zzso sequences zzso has demonstrated its high sensitivity for acute zzso zzso zzso In this study we examined the sensitivity of different zzso sequences for the detection of acute zzso and isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of 45 consecutive patients with signs and symptoms of zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were zzso The time between the onset of symptoms and the first zzso varied between 2 hours to 7 days with a median of 2 zzso zzso repeats were performed in 4 patients in whom the clinical zzso zzso had not been detected zzso zzso zzso and size were evaluated for different zzso and zzso zzso An acute zzso or zzso zzso as defined by the clinical condition could be identified in all patients by comparison of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso were the largest, followed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were small in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were reliably identified beginning 12 hours after the onset of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso zzso varied within the first 24 hours and their overall visibility was worse than that of other zzso zzso corresponding to their small zzso However, regardless of zzso zzso none of the 3 zzso examined within the first 5 hours after the onset of symptoms could be zzso These zzso were demonstrated in follow-up zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso and zzso zzso can reliably be zzso by a combination of zzso and zzso images beginning 12 hours after the zzso zzso However, sensitivity seems to be lower earlier than 12 hours after zzso and for zzso zzso zzso
