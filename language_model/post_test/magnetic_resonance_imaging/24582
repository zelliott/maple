We present an extension of the Linear Mixed zzso zzso modeling approach to be applied to the zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposed method, called zzso zzso or zzso builds on the flexible zzso framework and exploits the spatial structure in image zzso We zzso zzso for the analysis of cortical surface zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso a zzso brain zzso zzso Image zzso analysis software zzso We validate the proposed zzso method and provide a quantitative and objective empirical comparison with two popular alternative methods, using two brain zzso zzso obtained from the Alzheimer's disease zzso initiative zzso and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies zzso Our experiments revealed that zzso offers a dramatic gain in statistical power and zzso of findings, while providing good control of the false positive zzso
