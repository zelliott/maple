We report a case of a typical zzso from a patient with zzso sporadic zzso lateral sclerosis associated with zzso type 1 zzso Our report reinforces the conventional zzso appearance associated with each condition and the associated abnormalities on a clinical and advanced imaging techniques zzso The zzso signal intensity was useful for detecting upper motor zzso zzso based on zzso tract signal intensity, while diffusion zzso imaging parameters were limited to this zzso Our description reinforces the relevance of the zzso zzso transfer sequence to demonstrate zzso tract zzso and corroborate an zzso lateral sclerosis diagnosis in an individual zzso when there is a potential concurrent zzso lateral sclerosis mimic zzso To our knowledge, this is the first description of the zzso MR techniques zzso to distinguish the impact of zzso lateral sclerosis from zzso 1 zzso
