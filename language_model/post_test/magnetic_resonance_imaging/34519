To evaluate the influence of zzso cycle and age on zzso contrast medium enhancement in magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the zzso 

Dynamic zzso fast zzso shot, three-dimensional breast MR imaging was performed with high zzso and spatial resolution zzso zzso in 10 zzso zzso cycle evaluations and zzso studies were performed in 44 patients aged zzso years with a regular cycle zzso age, zzso zzso and in 103 patients aged zzso years zzso age, zzso zzso zzso A region of interest was placed in each zzso of the breast for evaluation of zzso zzso zzso with complete zzso or zzso and patients who received hormonal therapy were excluded zzso Analysis of zzso was zzso 

zzso contrast medium enhancement in cycle days zzso zzso mean enhancement at minutes zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than that in cycle days zzso zzso mean, zzso P zzso or zzso zzso zzso medium enhancement in patients aged zzso years zzso enhancement, zzso was significantly higher than that in patients aged younger than 35 years or older than 50 years zzso enhancement, zzso P zzso zzso 

Patients showed statistically significantly lower zzso enhancement in zzso cycle days zzso than in days zzso Patients aged zzso years yielded higher zzso enhancement than did younger patients and older zzso
