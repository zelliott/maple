zzso transformations for grasping have been associated with a zzso network in the monkey zzso The human zzso of the zzso monkey region zzso has been identified as the anterior part of the zzso zzso zzso whereas the putative human equivalent of the monkey frontal region zzso is located in the zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from animal studies suggest that monkey F5 is involved in the selection of appropriate hand postures relative to the constraints of the zzso In humans, the functional roles of zzso and zzso appear to be more complex and the relative contribution of each region to grasp selection remains zzso The present study aimed to identify zzso in brain areas sensitive to the difficulty level of tool object - hand posture zzso zzso healthy right handed participants underwent zzso while observing pictures of familiar tool objects followed by pictures of hand zzso The task was to decide whether the hand posture matched the functional use of the previously shown zzso zzso were manipulated for level of zzso Compared to a picture matching control task, the tool object - hand posture matching conditions zzso showed increased zzso in several left zzso regions of the superior and inferior zzso zzso (including zzso the middle zzso zzso and the inferior zzso zzso zzso of hard versus easy conditions selectively modulated the left inferior frontal zzso with peak activity located in its zzso part zzso area zzso zzso We suggest that in the human brain, zzso is involved in the matching of hand posture zzso in accordance with visual and functional zzso
