zzso zzso of the surface of the cerebral zzso may be related to abnormal cortical folding zzso and therefore may indicate underlying zzso of cortical development zzso Using magnetic resonance imaging zzso analysis, we examined cortical zzso in patients with juvenile zzso zzso zzso 

zzso data was collected for 24 patients with zzso and 40 demographically matched healthy zzso zzso an automated cortical surface reconstruction method, was applied to compare cortical zzso between patients and zzso Areas of anomalous cortical zzso were defined as regions of interest zzso to contrast regional cortical zzso such as surface area, average zzso and mean zzso between patients and zzso 

In patients with zzso changes to cortical zzso were detected in several zzso In the left hemisphere, these were in insular and zzso zzso zzso pole, and middle zzso and zzso zzso In the right hemisphere, changes were detected in insular cortex, inferior zzso zzso and zzso Further analysis of zzso revealed that these changes are related to differences in surface area rather than average cortical zzso In addition, mean zzso abnormalities were detected in the zzso zzso the left zzso cortex, and right inferior zzso zzso 

The zzso findings in this study suggest that structural abnormalities in zzso extend beyond zzso frontal lobe regions of the zzso These may be indicative of areas of subtle cortical folding zzso related to early disruption of cortical zzso
