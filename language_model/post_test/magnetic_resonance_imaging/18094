The major advance in zzso cancer management over the past 20 years has been the zzso of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and zzso of zzso residual zzso detected on magnetic resonance imaging zzso after zzso cancer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of the pelvis was performed on patients following zzso zzso A multidisciplinary team zzso evaluated the images with regard to residual zzso and zzso zzso Only zzso above the level of the zzso perpendicular to the zzso was regarded as zzso residual zzso after partial zzso zzso zzso records, standardized photographs and clinical records were zzso The pathology and zzso findings were evaluated independently in a blinded zzso 

zzso residual zzso was identified in 54 zzso per zzso of 136 zzso There was agreement with the pathology findings in 88 patients zzso per zzso zzso zzso was more frequent in patients treated with partial zzso zzso zzso per zzso than those who had total zzso zzso zzso per zzso or zzso zzso (13 per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso findings both showed that the zzso zzso margin after partial zzso zzso was less than 5 zzso in more than three-quarters of patients, and less than 3 zzso in more than zzso
