We developed a new model for in zzso zzso zzso zzso based on dynamic zzso in zzso As zzso has been implicated in the zzso of zzso we examined whether it reduced zzso zzso in mice, and whether such a reduction could be detected with our zzso zzso 

Mice at 16 days of gestation were injected zzso with saline or zzso zzso A conventional zzso zzso was then injected IV, and a zzso zzso zzso Fast zzso sequence was acquired for 200 zzso Signal intensity was measured on all the images and converted into contrast agent tissue zzso in the maternal left zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso model was developed using zzso and zzso modeling zzso Mean blood flow zzso was calculated from a transfer zzso 

Twenty-six mice were zzso yielding a total of 55 zzso zzso of zzso zzso (29 in the control group and 26 in the zzso zzso Mean zzso blood flow zzso was significantly lower in the zzso group zzso zzso of zzso than in the control group zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso reduces zzso zzso in zzso Our zzso dynamic model might be useful for detecting and investigating abnormal zzso blood flow, thereby avoiding the need for invasive procedures and animal zzso
