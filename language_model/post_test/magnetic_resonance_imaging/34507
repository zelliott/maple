zzso has been applied to the investigation of zzso for 12 zzso The principle role of zzso is in the definition of structural abnormalities that zzso seizure zzso zzso sclerosis may be reliably identified, quantitative studies are useful for research and, in zzso cases, for clinical zzso A range of zzso of cortical development zzso may be zzso In patients with zzso partial zzso who are candidates for surgical treatment, a relevant zzso is identifiable using zzso in zzso it is likely that subtle zzso or zzso accounts for the majority of the zzso The proportion of zzso cases will decrease with improvements in zzso hardware, signal acquisition techniques and zzso zzso zzso zzso is used to identify the cerebral areas that are responsible for specific cognitive zzso and is of importance in planning zzso close to eloquent cortical zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso provides a means of investigating cerebral zzso and some zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso compounds may be estimated using zzso zzso Reduction of the ratio of zzso is a feature of cerebral regions that include zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and the effects of zzso drugs on these, may be zzso zzso of high energy zzso compounds, zzso zzso and pH may be assessed using zzso In general, zzso zzso are associated with an increase in zzso increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso promises to be a useful method for investigating cerebral metabolism in zzso PET may provide data on regional cerebral blood flow zzso zzso metabolism and the binding of specific zzso to zzso zzso of functional and structural imaging data is necessary for adequate zzso The hallmark of an zzso focus is an area of reduced zzso zzso identified using zzso zzso that is commonly more extensive than the underlying anatomical zzso The clinical role of zzso requires zzso in the light of the advances in structural imaging with zzso zzso zzso are used to investigate specific zzso zzso and zzso receptors have been studied zzso zzso zzso zzso binding is commonly seen at an zzso focus, in a more restricted distribution than an area of zzso zzso increases and decreases in zzso zzso binding have been demonstrated in zzso in areas that appear normal on zzso indicating the widespread nature of the zzso It has been found that zzso receptors are increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dynamic studies of zzso binding are possible using zzso for example the release of cerebral zzso zzso has been implied at the time of serial zzso The main use of single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is to produce images reflecting zzso zzso studies alone are not zzso A strength of zzso is the ability to obtain images related to zzso at the time of zzso zzso zzso recording is zzso zzso scans need to be considered in comparison with an zzso scan and an zzso zzso must be cautious, but may yield data that is useful in the investigation of patients for possible surgical zzso
