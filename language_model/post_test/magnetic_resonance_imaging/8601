We zzso with functional zzso how zzso processing for visual objects zzso in the human brain by measuring zzso responses to stimulus zzso Two concentric zzso frames of slightly different sizes were presented such that the smaller frame was shown first, followed by the larger dominant frame, with zzso intervals of 0, 50 and zzso The functional zzso response at zzso decreased along the zzso visual zzso The response at zzso zzso zzso was suppressed after a zzso area at which the response at zzso zzso zzso was highly suppressed already and the responses at 0, 50 and zzso zzso intervals showed a zzso dependence on those zzso zzso These observations show a way of progression of the information processing along visual object recognition zzso
