zzso studies have shown for decades that humans are sensitive to risk when making zzso More recently, brain activities have been shown to be correlated with risky zzso But an important gap needs to be zzso How does the human brain learn which decisions are zzso In cognitive zzso reinforcement learning has never been used to estimate reward zzso a common measure of risk in economics and zzso It is thus unknown which brain regions are involved in risk zzso To address this question, participants completed a decision-making task during zzso They chose zzso from four decks of cards and each selection was followed by a zzso zzso zzso reward and risk differed among the zzso zzso aim was to maximize zzso zzso and reward prediction errors were calculated after each payoff based on a novel reinforcement learning zzso For reward prediction error, the strongest correlation was found with the zzso response in the zzso For risk prediction error, the strongest correlation was found with the zzso responses in the zzso and inferior frontal zzso We conclude that risk and reward prediction errors are processed by distinct neural circuits during reinforcement zzso Additional analyses revealed that the zzso response in the inferior frontal zzso was more pronounced for risk aversive participants, suggesting that this region also serves to inhibit risky zzso
