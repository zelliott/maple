The aim of this study was to assess the performance and value of breast ultrasound in women with familial risk of breast zzso 

From an initial zzso of 245 women with positive family history who had breast cancer surveillance zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso between November 1994 and February 2001, 179 subjects with follow-up data were zzso zzso women had breast ultrasound done with zzso correlation available from 48 breast zzso performed in 42 zzso 

The sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The specificity of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the imaging zzso with intermediate sensitivity, zzso negative zzso value zzso and cancer detection zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso zzso and accuracy of combined zzso and ultrasound were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results did not differ significantly from zzso Almost two-thirds of the breast zzso were performed under ultrasound zzso 

Although breast ultrasound screening per zzso was not assessed in this study, zzso of these results to zzso screening of high familial risk women would come at a better specificity to zzso albeit with a zzso decrease in sensitivity but at a fraction of the cost of zzso zzso also provides the advantage of convenient imaging guidance for zzso zzso ultrasound following zzso would match zzso in sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and should not be ignored in these zzso
