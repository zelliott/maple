The aims of this study were to determine fractional zzso zzso and the zzso density index zzso in the cervical spinal zzso of patients with multiple sclerosis zzso by using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to identify possible differences between zzso patients and zzso 

We studied 27 patients with zzso - nine with primary progressive zzso nine with secondary progressive zzso and nine with zzso zzso disease - and 18 healthy individuals as zzso Conventional and zzso sequences with diffusion zzso applied in 32 directions were zzso The results were compared between healthy controls and patients, between healthy controls and individual forms of zzso and between the three forms of zzso zzso analysis was performed by analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso in the three zzso of patients and in controls showed a statistically significant zzso Using the zzso test, we found results from both zzso and zzso groups were different from zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso was significant both in healthy controls and in zzso patients evaluated as a single zzso zzso Despite the small group of patients, these findings suggest that zzso associated with zzso is a sensitive zzso for assessing spinal zzso damage in patients with zzso
