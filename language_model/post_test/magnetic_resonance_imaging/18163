To discuss the relevant techniques as well as the recent evidence that enhance the understanding of the reader on the applications of cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso in zzso zzso valve replacement zzso With different cardiac imaging zzso available as well as the advent of zzso it is important to define when zzso can be helpful in the zzso zzso 

The topics of interest covered in this review are zzso evaluation of zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso for access planning, zzso zzso zzso zzso and the potential role of delayed enhancement assessment in patients undergoing zzso 

zzso is a complementary zzso in the assessment of zzso zzso The ability of zzso to assess the zzso significance of zzso zzso and other zzso as well as to assess accurately the left zzso ejection fraction and vascular zzso makes this technique well zzso The roles of delayed enhancement for zzso zzso in the evaluation of zzso candidates and zzso assessment in the zzso patient are promising, but still yet to be fully zzso
