zzso implant surgery has become very important issue during recent years, mostly thanks to zzso of dentistry and software planning of dental implants zzso The aim of this study was to compare zzso and zzso surgical techniques for implant placement through zzso and zzso zzso 

The experiment was made in five domestic zzso Nine weeks following domestic pigs teeth zzso implants were placed, on the right side using surgical technique zzso and zzso on the left zzso Digital dental zzso were applied to determine primary dental implant stability quality zzso At certain zzso not later than three months, the experimental animals were sacrificed, and just before it, control zzso were applied to measure dental implants zzso 

zzso analysis showed that zzso bone zzso in the first 4 weeks following placement implants with zzso and zzso surgical techniques was zzso After the 3 months, mean value of zzso bone zzso of the implants placed using zzso zzso was zzso zzso and of those placed using zzso zzso was zzso zzso In relation to the primary dental implant stability in the first and second week there was an expected decrease in zzso values, but it was less expressed in the dental implants placed using the zzso zzso In the third week the zzso values were increased in the dental implants placed by using both techniques, but the increase in zzso implant placement was higher zzso zzso than in zzso implant placement zzso zzso The upward trend continued in a zzso period, and after 3 months the dental implant stability values in the implants placed using zzso technique were higher than the primary stability for zzso zzso and in the implants placed using zzso technique were higher comparing to the primary stability for zzso zzso zzso 

Based on the results of zzso and resonance frequency analyses it can be concluded that the zzso technique in surgical implants zzso leads to better zzso
