The zzso form of mild cognitive impairment zzso is likely a precursor of zzso disease zzso Both verbal and visual memory tests are used in the diagnosis of zzso however, it is unknown which type of test is superior at predicting the underlying zzso changes associated with zzso In this study, we compared the topography of cortical thinning among 3 zzso of patients with zzso 33 patients with zzso verbal memory impairment zzso 35 with zzso visual memory impairment zzso and 56 with both verbal and visual zzso impairment zzso and 143 patients with normal zzso As a result, patients with zzso showed cortical thinning in the left anterior and zzso zzso regions compared with individuals with normal zzso while those with zzso did not show significant cortical zzso The cortical thinning areas of zzso group overlapped those of zzso but were more widespread involving the bilateral zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso and zzso are more likely to be a precursor of zzso than zzso and that zzso may be more advanced zzso than zzso on the spectrum from zzso to zzso
