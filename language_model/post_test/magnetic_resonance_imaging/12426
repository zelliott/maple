We aimed to determine the association between the zzso characteristics of stroke zzso and zzso major depression among survivors in zzso zzso This is in the background of a paucity of information on the zzso correlation of zzso emotional responses among African zzso 

We studied 30 stroke survivors receiving zzso The zzso characteristics of the stroke zzso were documented using computerized zzso or magnetic resonance imaging scans in the acute phase of the zzso While the presence of major depressive disorder meeting criteria in the fourth edition of the zzso and zzso Manual was assessed using the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in zzso zzso between 3 months and 2 years zzso The association between zzso characteristics and depression was explored using zzso zzso zzso 

Nine zzso stroke survivors met criteria for major depressive zzso There were significant differences in their zzso The differences in the zzso types approached the set level of significance in survivors with or without major depressive zzso There were however no differences when considering zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Being female, but not the zzso characteristics was strongly associated with zzso major depressive disorder 

zzso characteristics documented in the acute phase of stroke could not predict the occurrence of major depressive disorder during rehabilitation in this zzso The occurrence of depression among stroke survivors may ultimately be determined by a combination of zzso
