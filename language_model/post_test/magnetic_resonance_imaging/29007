In breast cancer, diagnosis of a small internal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of less than 10 zzso in size has been zzso Our purpose was to zzso evaluate zzso findings of small zzso zzso in comparison with dissected zzso

Regarding the presence of zzso zzso there was a significant difference between zzso with a major diameter of 5 zzso or more and those of less than 5 zzso zzso Using the zzso criterion zzso or zzso zzso as zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso sensitivity, and zzso zzso There were no significant differences in the zzso zzso zzso
