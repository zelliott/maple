To examine the ability of zzso imaging for evaluating tumor size in mouse brain at high zzso 

zzso of healthy and zzso nude mice were zzso at zzso and zzso zzso imaging was performed with zzso and zzso zzso zzso with alternating phase and the zzso reconstruction method were used in zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso was evaluated in healthy and in zzso brain zzso 

zzso artifact was correctly suppressed in zzso images thanks to the method zzso The zzso ratio zzso and zzso were comparable in zzso and zzso images at zzso but acquisition was around 4 times shorter with zzso zzso was well detected at zzso with zzso but zzso between tumor and healthy tissue was low at zzso 

zzso is efficient and fast to perform brain imaging at zzso Multiple zzso acquisitions with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reconstruction allow suppression of zzso zzso zzso regions were well detected and the method allows zzso studies of tumor zzso
