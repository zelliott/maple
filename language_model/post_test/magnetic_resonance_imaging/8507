An increase in the common carotid artery zzso thickness zzso is generally considered an early marker of zzso This zzso study assessed the zzso and plaque score as vascular risk factors in patients with zzso stroke and type 2 zzso 

Brain MR imaging and carotid zzso were performed in 133 subjects with type 2 zzso zzso was measured at both zzso zzso in the variables between case and control subjects were compared zzso To determine the independent factors related to zzso and plaque score, we performed zzso multiple zzso zzso 

Sex, current smoking zzso history of hypertension, and zzso zzso zzso levels differed significantly between the case and control zzso zzso and plaque score in patients with diabetes and acute zzso stroke were significantly greater than in patients with diabetes who were zzso The crude odds ratios suggested that zzso and plaque score are risk factors of acute zzso stroke in patients with type 2 zzso However, when we adjusted for cerebrovascular risk factors, zzso and plaque score did not remain significantly associated with acute zzso zzso 

Increased zzso and plaque score are associated with acute zzso stroke in patients with type 2 zzso The higher zzso and plaque score found in zzso stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes seem to be induced by cerebrovascular risk zzso zzso to prevent zzso stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes, strict control of zzso hypertension, smoking, and low zzso together with monitoring of zzso and carotid zzso may be zzso
