Active transport requires the zzso of zzso zzso and release with a switch in the access of the zzso binding site to the two sides of the zzso Both the transfer and switch aspects of the zzso have been subjects of magnetic resonance studies in zzso The results for zzso transfer indicate that the Schiff base of the zzso is hydrogen bonded before, zzso and after its zzso This suggests that the initial complex zzso of the Schiff base zzso in such a way that the Schiff base carries its immediate zzso partner with it as it zzso during the first half of the zzso If so, zzso acts as an zzso hydroxide pump rather than as an zzso zzso zzso The studies of the access switch explore both zzso and zzso zzso Combined with evidence from functional studies of zzso and other forms of zzso the results suggest that maintaining access to the zzso side of the protein after zzso involves twisting of the zzso and that the decisive switch in access to the zzso side results from relaxation of the zzso when the constraints on the Schiff base are released by decomposition of the complex zzso
