It can be clinically difficult to distinguish depressed individuals with bipolar disorder zzso and major depressive disorder zzso To examine potential zzso of difference between the two disorders, the current study examined differences in the functioning of zzso neural regions during a dynamic emotional faces zzso 

During functional magnetic resonance imaging, healthy control adults zzso zzso and depressed adults with zzso zzso and BD zzso performed an implicit zzso task in which they identified a color label superimposed on neutral faces that zzso morphed into one of four emotional faces zzso fearful, sad, zzso We compared neural zzso between the groups in an zzso zzso and at the zzso zzso 

Adults with zzso showed significantly greater activity than adults with BD in the left zzso to the anger condition zzso zzso of zzso analyses (at zzso zzso revealed that adults with BD showed greater activity to sad faces in zzso regions, primarily in the left hemisphere, whereas individuals with zzso demonstrated greater activity than those with BD to displays of anger, fear, and zzso Many of the observed zzso differences represented abnormalities in functioning compared to zzso 

We observed a zzso between depressed adults with BD and zzso in the processing of emerging emotional zzso Those with BD showed greater activity during zzso zzso zzso faces, whereas those with zzso showed greater activity for zzso zzso fear, anger, and zzso zzso Such findings may reflect markers of differences between BD and zzso depression in underlying zzso zzso
