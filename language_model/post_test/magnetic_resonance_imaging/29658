To compare high resolution zzso examinations of inner ear structures at zzso T and at 3 zzso 

zzso bones were measured zzso in 3 healthy volunteers in a zzso T and in a 3 T zzso using the respective one channel head zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The same zzso zzso echo sequence zzso was employed at a zzso size of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso was determined zzso 

An zzso of 8 could be achieved for the zzso at 3 T in zzso zzso The zzso at 3 T was, on average, a factor of zzso higher than that at zzso T despite the fact that the zzso angle had to be drastically reduced zzso zzso 42 degrees instead of alpha zzso 70 degrees at zzso zzso due to the limit of the specific zzso rate zzso 

The MR representation of the inner ear is clearly improved at 3 zzso To obtain the same zzso at zzso T approximately the double measuring time would be required, connected with reduced patient comfort and an increased risk for a displacement of the head during the high resolution zzso
