To determine the relative performances of MR zzso and duplex zzso zzso in the evaluation of the portal zzso system in patients with portal hypertension, we compared two-dimensional zzso MR zzso and duplex zzso zzso in 60 sequential patients with zzso All 60 subsequently underwent liver zzso 

MR imaging and duplex zzso zzso were performed on the same day, and in all patients the imaging findings were validated at surgical zzso Five transplantation candidates had surgical zzso zzso in zzso at the time of zzso MR images were acquired during zzso and flow in the portal vein was evaluated with zzso zzso MR zzso zzso included color zzso and zzso gated zzso images of the portal zzso MR zzso and zzso were analyzed independently and zzso for zzso of the portal zzso zzso of surgical zzso and grade and distribution of zzso collateral zzso Scores on both imaging techniques were compared by using zzso zzso 

MR zzso showed all five cases of portal vein zzso and all 55 cases of patent portal zzso zzso showed three of five cases of portal vein zzso and 52 of 55 cases of patent portal zzso The techniques concurred in assessing flow direction in 54 zzso of 60 patients, and both procedures enabled detection of zzso portal vein zzso in one zzso We found a significant correlation zzso zzso zzso between the grades of gastric zzso detected with MR zzso and surgery but no significant correlation between the grades seen on zzso and found at zzso zzso zzso in four of five patients and shunt zzso in one were correctly assessed on MR zzso whereas three of these zzso were not visible on zzso 

Our results show that MR zzso is more reliable than duplex zzso zzso for evaluating the portal zzso system in patients with portal hypertension caused by zzso
