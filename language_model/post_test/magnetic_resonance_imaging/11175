zzso zzso testing (the Wada zzso has been used to zzso language and identify patients who may be at risk for memory impairment after zzso zzso The goal of this study was to determine the zzso of the Wada test in the assessment of pathological conditions of the zzso among candidates for zzso zzso The authors examined the correlation between the functional integrity of the zzso measured using the Wada test, and quantitative measures of zzso pathology, determined by obtaining zzso zzso of the zzso with the aid of magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

The authors reviewed the relationship between memory scores on the Wada test and zzso volumes measured on zzso MR images in 76 patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the treatment of medically zzso zzso lobe zzso The data were analyzed with respect to their usefulness in zzso the seizure focus and predicting the long-term zzso memory zzso Right and left zzso volume zzso did not correlate with one another zzso zzso zzso Similarly, following a left carotid artery injection of zzso the patients' right zzso memory was not significantly related to their left zzso memory on the Wada test zzso zzso On the other hand, the patients' right zzso memory significantly correlated with their right zzso volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and their left zzso memory significantly correlated with their left zzso volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Both right and left zzso memory scores correlated with the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso both p zzso zzso zzso of a seizure focus based on zzso zzso results was significantly related to zzso based on the results of the Wada test zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The disparity between the Wada memory scores on zzso and zzso sides was significantly and zzso related to the change in verbal memory following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso ratio also significantly and zzso correlated with the change in verbal memory after surgery zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The Wada memory test may be a valuable method of measuring the functional integrity of the zzso The systematic study of MR zzso zzso data and zzso zzso data may increase our understanding of the location of zzso memory and the selection of eligible candidates for zzso zzso
