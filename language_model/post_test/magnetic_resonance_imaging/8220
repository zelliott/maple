zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is increasingly being used for animal studies studying the transmission of zzso zzso Application of noxious mechanical stimuli is widely used for animal and human assessment of pain zzso Any accessory hardware used in animal imaging studies must, however, be sufficiently small to fit in the magnet bore diameter and be zzso We have developed a system that can apply mechanical stimuli simultaneously with zzso This system consists of a standardized instrument to deliver mechanical stimuli zzso zzso and a zzso mechanical zzso These components were integrated with a computer console that controlled the period of stimuli to match acquisition zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso zzso did not influence zzso signal to noise zzso Mechanical stimulation of the zzso significantly increased blood oxygen level dependent zzso signal intensity in several zzso regions involved in the processing of zzso information in the rat zzso zzso for multiple zzso This system can be applied to both animal and human imaging studies and has a wide range of applications for studies of zzso zzso
