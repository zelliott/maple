To describe the magnetic resonance imaging zzso appearances of tears of the zzso muscle and zzso in patients with rotator cuff tears and without a prior history of shoulder zzso 

zzso tears diagnosed on MR examinations were zzso recorded between February 2003 through June zzso The images of these patients were then zzso reviewed to determine the location of the zzso zzso the presence of rotator cuff tears, zzso zzso muscle zzso degree of zzso head zzso zzso zzso changes involving the zzso of the zzso and the presence of zzso or zzso signal intensity in the zzso muscle and zzso subcutaneous zzso 

There were 24 zzso patients with zzso zzso nine men and 15 zzso The age range was 54 to 87 zzso zzso zzso The right side was involved in 20 cases, and the left in four zzso Fifteen patients had full thickness and nine had partial thickness tears of the zzso zzso pain was the most common presenting zzso The physical examination revealed a zzso in the region of the zzso in two zzso zzso patients had tears in the muscle belly near the zzso zzso and five had zzso of the zzso from the zzso zzso Full thickness rotator cuff tears were present in all of the patients, and 22 patients had associated muscle zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal was present in 15 zzso 

Tears of the zzso muscle or zzso is an unusual finding, but they can be seen in patients with chronic massive rotator cuff zzso zzso thickness tears tend to involve the zzso of the zzso muscle and zzso Associated findings such as intramuscular zzso or zzso in the zzso muscle belly and subcutaneous zzso or zzso signal zzso the zzso in a patient with a rotator cuff tear should raise the suspicion of a zzso zzso
