Little is known about the genetic contribution to individual differences in neural networks zzso zzso zzso In this functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso twin study, we found a significant genetic influence on brain zzso in neural networks supporting zzso working memory zzso Participants zzso zzso networks responded faster than individuals relying more on zzso brain zzso There were genetic influences on brain zzso in zzso brain circuits that were zzso for zzso working memory tasks as zzso This suggests that differences in zzso might be related to brain zzso patterns that differ zzso among zzso
