Our aim was to describe a child with an incomplete form of zzso syndrome who presented profound zzso fluid zzso folate zzso and his response to zzso acid supplementation 

zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso with zzso detection and zzso DNA deletions by southern zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed with normal blood folate values and decreased zzso folate ratio, suggesting a transport zzso across the zzso zzso zzso acid treatment was established, and after 1 year clinical response to zzso supplementation was zzso with almost normal white matter zzso 

The clinical response after zzso therapy highlights the need for the study of cerebral folate zzso in patients with zzso disorders and white matter zzso
