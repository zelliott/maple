Superior zzso zzso is a rare movement disorder thought to be caused by vascular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso display of such zzso zzso by magnetic resonance imaging has been zzso The goal of this study was to assess the presence of zzso contacts in patients with superior zzso zzso using a specific magnetic resonance imaging zzso A total of 6 patients suffering from right superior zzso zzso underwent detailed zzso examination, which showed zzso or zzso eye zzso All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging, using a magnetic resonance imaging zzso transform constructive interference in zzso sequence in combination with magnetic resonance imaging time of flight magnetic resonance zzso both before and after the administration of zzso With this zzso the zzso nerve could be zzso on 11 of 12 sides zzso zzso contact was detected at the root exit zone of the symptomatic right zzso nerve in all 6 patients zzso No zzso contact was identified at the root exit zone of the zzso left zzso nerve in any of the 5 left nerves zzso In conclusion, superior zzso zzso can result from zzso contact at the root exit zone of zzso zzso and therefore should be considered among the zzso zzso zzso
