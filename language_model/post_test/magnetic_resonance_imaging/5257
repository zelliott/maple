In this study, we proposed the new reconstruction techniques for magnetic resonance imaging zzso using filtered back projection zzso or simultaneous reconstruction technique zzso We converted the zzso which was acquired by conventional zzso schemes from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates and created the zzso The linear zzso and the zzso zzso were used in the zzso The accuracy of the reconstructed image using projection was evaluated by the relative error in comparison with the standard image which was reconstructed by the two-dimensional zzso transform zzso with conventional Cartesian zzso The relative error reconstructed both zzso and zzso from projection with zzso zzso is zzso The maximum value of standard image is zzso zzso is zzso and zzso with iteration 100 is zzso and with iteration 200 is zzso The minimum value of both the standard image and the others is about zzso zzso there is no margin between the standard image and the reconstructed image from projection with zzso or zzso
