Our objective was to study the frequency of anterior zzso ligament on MR imaging and to make a zzso according to its zzso sites on MR zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR images of the knee were zzso evaluated in 229 subjects without significant zzso zzso or total zzso of the anterior cruciate zzso By using zzso zzso images, the ligament was classified into three types according to its zzso sites zzso zzso between anterior horns of zzso and lateral zzso type B: between anterior horn of zzso zzso and anterior margin of lateral zzso type zzso between anterior margins of zzso and lateral zzso On zzso images location of the ligament was determined with respect to a line drawn between anterior of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso notch to look for a relation between its type on zzso images and location on zzso zzso Separately, zzso was made in 36 patients to verify the MR assessment of the presence of the zzso zzso zzso ligament was found in zzso of the zzso Type B was the most common group zzso zzso resonance imaging has a sensitivity and a specificity of 67 and zzso respectively, in the detection of the zzso zzso A and C had a statistically significant location zzso and zzso respectively, to the master line on zzso zzso In zzso the ligament was either zzso zzso or flat zzso in zzso zzso zzso MR images can help identify anterior zzso zzso
