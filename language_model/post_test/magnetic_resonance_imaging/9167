zzso values have been effectively used to evaluate the amount of zzso the zzso and zzso zzso and the amount of zzso zzso However, the reliability and zzso of this measurement have yet to be zzso In addition, the information that is available concerning zzso values in normal individuals has been limited to small series of zzso We recruited 200 patients that underwent MR imaging of the zzso junction zzso for unrelated zzso None of the patients had evidence of abnormalities at the zzso Two senior spine surgeons then measured the zzso of these patients in a blind manner on three separate zzso The zzso values ranged from zzso degrees to zzso degrees , with an average value of zzso degrees , and a zzso confidence zzso from zzso degrees to zzso degrees zzso Overall, the zzso had excellent zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso also had excellent zzso zzso based on both the age and gender of the patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At the same time, the zzso also demonstrated excellent zzso reliability based on gender zzso zzso zzso while good zzso reliability based on patients age zzso zzso zzso No significant correlation between the actual zzso values and the patients' gender zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso or zzso series used zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrated that zzso values obtained from zzso zzso MR images were a highly reliable and zzso zzso The data reported in this study can be used as baseline parameters for normal zzso
