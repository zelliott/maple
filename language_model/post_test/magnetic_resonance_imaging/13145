zzso connections, providing the zzso for functional networks, exist whether or not they are functionally active at any given zzso However, it is not known to what extent brain regions are continuously interacting when the brain is zzso zzso In this work, we identify the major explicit zzso networks by carrying out an zzso zzso network analysis of thousands of separate zzso maps derived from the zzso database of functional imaging studies, involving nearly 30,000 human zzso zzso we extract the major zzso networks in the resting brain, as zzso with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 36 subjects at zzso The sets of major brain networks, and their zzso into zzso show close correspondence between the independent analyses of resting and zzso brain zzso We conclude that the full repertoire of functional networks zzso by the brain in action is continuously and zzso zzso even when at zzso
