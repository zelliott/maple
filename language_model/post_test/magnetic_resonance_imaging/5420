zzso resonance imaging zzso is an important tool for cardiac research, and it is frequently used for resting cardiac zzso However, research into zzso stress cardiac evaluation is zzso 

We aimed to design a portable and relatively inexpensive zzso cycle zzso capable of continuously measuring zzso workload while patients exercise to maintain target heart zzso 

We constructed and tested an zzso cycle zzso for a zzso T zzso zzso zzso and zzso exercise images (at 110 beats per zzso were successfully obtained in 8 healthy zzso 

The zzso cycle zzso constructed by our research group enabled cardiac assessments at fixed heart rates, while continuously recording power output by directly measuring pedal force and crank zzso
