The currently required surgical procedure for zzso zzso zzso is a limiting factor and several groups are therefore investigating zzso zzso Our zzso system consists of a zzso right zzso zzso zzso and two or three zzso zzso placed zzso An optimal location for these SC zzso is important to obtain the lowest possible zzso threshold zzso by allowing a more homogeneous current distribution within the zzso An empirical approach consists of placing randomly the SC zzso to find out the lowest possible zzso A mathematical approach is to calculate the SC zzso locations for an optimal electric field distribution by using magnetic resonance images of zzso zzso and a specially designed computer zzso Our recent experimental results are based on a series of 15 pigs weighing between 60 and 102 zzso zzso ranged between 10 and 26 zzso We conclude that an zzso system with a right zzso zzso and two or three subcutaneous zzso can be zzso to reach a zzso for pigs with zzso body weights which is compatible with the energy capabilities of our zzso zzso
