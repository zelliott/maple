The aims of this study are to assess the extent of zzso movement on consecutive zzso examinations in patients with zzso zzso and to define potential safety volumes around the zzso that may avoid zzso zzso during pelvic zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso and zzso cancer who underwent zzso examinations of the pelvis before and during zzso were included in the zzso The position of the zzso was zzso determined on two consecutive zzso and zzso zzso weighted zzso examinations of the zzso zzso movement was determined in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Safety volumes were calculated by computing elliptical volumes based on the derived zzso and zzso reference zzso 

30 patients with a zzso zzso were zzso Both zzso could be identified on the zzso examinations in all zzso The safety volumes around the zzso encompassing zzso and zzso of zzso movement were 11 and 25 zzso zzso and 24 and 54 zzso zzso for the left and right zzso zzso 

Adding a safety volume around the zzso may reduce the high radiation dose to the zzso This could potentially avoid zzso zzso reducing significant fertility zzso
