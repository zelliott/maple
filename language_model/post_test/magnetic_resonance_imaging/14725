zzso are zzso in the zzso the development and the regulation of the inflammatory response to bacterial zzso zzso are zzso and increasingly recruited in septic zzso from the early zzso of infection and the zzso is supposed to zzso once efficient removal of the pathogens is zzso The ability to identify in zzso zzso activity in an infected joint can therefore provide two main zzso early detection of acute zzso and monitoring of zzso In zzso zzso detection of zzso can be performed with magnetic resonance imaging using iron zzso such as zzso zzso iron oxide zzso After zzso or zzso administration, zzso are specifically zzso by activated zzso and, due to their magnetic properties, induce signal changes in zzso presenting zzso zzso A quantitative evaluation of the zzso is zzso as the area with signal loss zzso of dark zzso observed on zzso echo MR images after particles injection is correlated with the amount of iron within the tissue and therefore reflects the number of zzso zzso We present here a protocol to perform zzso imaging using zzso MR imaging in an animal model of septic arthritis, allowing an initial and zzso in zzso zzso evaluation of zzso zzso and an assessment of therapy zzso
