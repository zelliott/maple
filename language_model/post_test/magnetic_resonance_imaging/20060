zzso delivery of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso could facilitate their zzso in zzso cancer cells in peripheral zzso zzso zzso and bones and enhance the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso of zzso hormone releasing hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso were tested in human breast cancer cells in zzso and were found to be dependent on the zzso expression of the target cells, the time of incubation and showed zzso zzso In zzso with zzso cells, the highest iron zzso was zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso at 4 degrees C resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso with the same zzso zzso or zzso decreased the iron zzso in each zzso zzso were poorly incorporated by zzso zzso and zzso cells from breast cancer zzso were targeted in zzso in a nude mouse zzso zzso specifically accumulated in cells of human breast cancer zzso The amount of zzso in the lungs was directly dependent on the number of zzso cells and amounted to zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso accumulated in the liver, showed poor affinity to the zzso and were not zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso compartment of the target cells and formed zzso zzso did not accumulate in zzso of normal zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso may serve as a contrast agent for MR imaging in zzso and increase the sensitivity for the detection of zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso bones and peripheral zzso
