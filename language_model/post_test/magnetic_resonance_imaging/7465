The goal of this study was to establish zzso resonance imaging zzso reference ranges for spinal zzso in normal zzso Forty dogs zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 dogs per zzso underwent spinal zzso zzso were performed on zzso zzso images at the level of the 4th zzso vertebra zzso the 9th zzso vertebra zzso and the 3rd zzso vertebra zzso Spinal canal diameter zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso at the level of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso at the level of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso at the level of zzso There were significant differences zzso in spinal canal diameter between zzso Mean spinal zzso diameter zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso at the level of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso at the level of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso at the level of zzso There were no significant differences in spinal zzso diameter between zzso Spinal zzso canal ratio varied significantly, ranging from zzso zzso at zzso to zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso These findings are important when using zzso to evaluate patients with suspected diffuse spinal zzso zzso
