Gas exchange is the primary function of the lung and the transport of oxygen plays a key role in pulmonary physiology and zzso 

zzso oxygen is zzso zzso so that an increase in oxygen concentration results in zzso zzso relaxation time and thus increasing signal intensity in zzso weighted zzso The calculation of zzso maps may allow deeper insights into relaxation zzso zzso maps based on a snapshot zzso sequence obtained during the inhalation of various oxygen zzso allow the creation of an oxygen transfer function, providing a measurement of local oxygen zzso zzso weighted single shot zzso sequences demonstrate the signal changing effects during inhalation of pure zzso 

The average of the mean zzso values over the entire lung during inspiration was zzso zzso the average of these values during expiration was zzso zzso zzso maps of patients with zzso and lung zzso show fundamentally different values and respiratory dependence compared to healthy zzso zzso enhanced MR has the potential to assess reduced diffusion capacity and decreased transport of oxygen in patients with zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso published in the literature indicate that zzso mapping and oxygen enhanced MR are promising new methods in functional imaging of the zzso
