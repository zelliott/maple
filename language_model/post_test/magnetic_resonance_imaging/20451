Our previous results revealed a positive correlation between zzso dysfunction and cortical zzso in children with zzso This finding implied an zzso between zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso Thus, we used an animal model to characterize zzso functional changes in response to altered zzso zzso 

Adult male New Zealand rabbits weighing zzso to zzso zzso underwent surgical zzso volume reduction zzso or sham operation zzso We performed conventional fill zzso and zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging in each group 4 weeks zzso During scanning zzso stimulation was provided by zzso filling up to zzso of maximum zzso We then compared zzso zzso zzso 

zzso revealed zzso dysfunction in animals with altered zzso zzso zzso function was markedly altered in the reduced zzso volume vs the sham operated group, mainly as significantly increased maximum zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso water, p zzso and markedly decreased zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging results revealed zzso of 2 zzso regions, including in 1) the zzso zzso gray and 2) the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gray was significantly decreased in the reduced zzso vs the sham operated group with a corresponding decrease in signal size zzso vs zzso signal size zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in zzso of the zzso zzso between the groups zzso vs zzso signal size zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso zzso centers can be evoked by zzso zzso In response to zzso dysfunction the zzso zzso gray shows zzso during zzso zzso suggesting that it has an important role in zzso dysfunction zzso
