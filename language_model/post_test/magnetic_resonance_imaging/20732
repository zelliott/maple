zzso semantic processing of words leads to enhanced memory zzso zzso of processing zzso The left inferior prefrontal zzso zzso and the left zzso are known to be involved in this zzso We tested the hypothesis that different semantic zzso processes contribute zzso differently to memory zzso In a memory experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared three different zzso tasks: a zzso zzso an zzso decision, and a size comparison zzso zzso memory was tested zzso We hypothesized that the size comparison task would activate brain areas involved in the processing of object features and that this would be associated with successful memory zzso zzso showed that the size comparison task led to significantly better memory zzso than the two other zzso As with the zzso decision task, it led to stronger zzso of the zzso and left zzso than the zzso zzso Both regions also had stronger zzso for later remembered than for zzso zzso The size comparison task additionally led to stronger zzso in the left anterior zzso zzso which was also associated with successful memory zzso We conclude that different types of semantic processing affect memory zzso based on distinguishable brain zzso
