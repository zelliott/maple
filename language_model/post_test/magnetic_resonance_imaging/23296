Recovery of function following zzso in the nervous system requires zzso changes in surviving zzso Here we investigate whether changes in cerebral zzso are correlated to spinal zzso zzso and recovery of functionality in individuals with incomplete spinal zzso injury zzso 19 chronic zzso individuals and 7 zzso controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while performing rhythmic zzso of the zzso A significant negative correlation was found between the zzso in the zzso motor zzso and bilateral zzso zzso zzso on one hand and the functional ability of the zzso participants measured by the clinical motor score on the zzso There was no significant correlation between zzso in any other cerebral area and the motor zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso correlated to the zzso of the spinal zzso in the zzso direction, where the zzso tract is located, but not in the zzso zzso There was a tendency for a negative correlation between cerebral zzso in zzso S1, zzso and zzso and the zzso of motor evoked zzso in the zzso anterior muscle zzso by zzso magnetic zzso but this did not reach statistical zzso There was no correlation between motor score or spinal zzso dimensions and the volume of the cortical motor zzso The observations show that zzso of descending tracts in the lateral part of the spinal zzso results in increased zzso in zzso motor and sensory areas, which may help to compensate for the functional deficit following zzso
