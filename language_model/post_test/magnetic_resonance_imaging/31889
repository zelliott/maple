Fast, parallel word recognition, in expert readers, relies on sectors of the left zzso zzso zzso collectively known as the visual word form zzso This expertise is thought to arise from zzso learning mechanisms that extract zzso features from the input zzso The zzso expertise hypothesis leads to two zzso zzso parallel word recognition, based on the zzso visual system, should be limited to words displayed in a familiar format zzso horizontal words with normally spaced zzso zzso words displayed in formats outside this field of expertise should be read zzso under supervision of zzso zzso attention zzso We presented adult readers with words that were progressively zzso in three different ways zzso zzso letter zzso and displacement to the visual zzso zzso we identified degradation thresholds above which reading difficulty increased zzso with the zzso emergence of a word length effect on reading zzso reflecting serial reading zzso zzso zzso were correlated with reading difficulty in bilateral zzso and zzso regions, reflecting the strategies required to identify zzso zzso A core region of the zzso zzso was engaged in all modes of zzso Furthermore, in the zzso pathway, word degradation led to an amplification of zzso in the zzso visual word form area, at a level thought to zzso single zzso We also found an effect of word length restricted to highly zzso words in bilateral zzso zzso Those results clarify when and how the zzso parallel visual word form system needs to be supplemented by the deployment of zzso serial reading zzso
