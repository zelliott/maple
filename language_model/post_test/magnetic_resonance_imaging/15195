Studies on working memory zzso dysfunction in schizophrenia have reported several functionally zzso brain areas including the lateral prefrontal cortex, superior zzso areas and the zzso However, less is known about the relationship of zzso cerebral zzso zzso and diagnostic zzso Using a novel zzso and zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we studied healthy control subjects zzso and partially zzso zzso zzso meeting zzso criteria for schizophrenia zzso and major depressive disorder zzso Due to the zzso technique, we excluded incorrectly performed trials, thus controlling for zzso zzso zzso Compared with controls, patients with schizophrenia showed less zzso in zzso and zzso regions at high cognitive load zzso Compared with patients with depression, schizophrenic patients showed less prefrontal zzso in left inferior frontal zzso and right zzso In patients with zzso a lack of zzso of the superior zzso zzso was found compared to both healthy controls and patients with zzso Thus, we could not confirm previous findings of impaired lateral prefrontal zzso during zzso performance in schizophrenic patients after the exclusion of incorrectly performed or omitted trials in our functional zzso However, superior zzso zzso dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia may be regarded as zzso finding in terms of psychiatric diagnosis zzso
