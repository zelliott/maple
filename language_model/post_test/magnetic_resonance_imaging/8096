zzso in the zzso zzso gene have recently been reported as a cause of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We performed a clinical, zzso and molecular genetic study of two families with zzso and the same novel zzso in zzso Age of onset ranged from 35 to 75 years and all individuals progressed to a severe zzso syndrome with a mean disease duration of approximately 6-10 zzso zzso clinical presentations included language zzso zzso change or zzso Seven total zzso in the families (five in Family 1, two in Family 2) showed gross and microscopic evidence of zzso loss in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All cases with material available for zzso had zzso and zzso zzso positive, zzso negative inclusions that stained best with an zzso to the zzso zzso In addition, all but one had evidence of distinctive zzso zzso Two cases in Family 1 also had zzso zzso pathology, one with diffuse zzso inclusions and zzso and unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso persons in both families had the same zzso in zzso zzso A zzso construct showed that this zzso alters zzso of zzso 7 and results in reduced zzso message in zzso A single zzso zzso in these two families was associated with variable clinical presentations consistent with the zzso zzso All cases had zzso zzso inclusions and most had additional zzso zzso Two cases had zzso zzso These findings suggest a link between zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
