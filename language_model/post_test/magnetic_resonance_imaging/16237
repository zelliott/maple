To estimate differences in the associations of zzso and zzso zzso volumes and zzso with memory function in the early and late stages of cognitive impairment by relating these measures to memory function in persons with and without zzso who underwent detailed brain imaging and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analyses were used to relate zzso zzso volume, zzso zzso zzso zzso volume, and zzso zzso to zzso of memory zzso The same measures were related to language function as a reference cognitive zzso

No association was noted between zzso zzso volume or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso volume was strongly associated with worse performance in total recall, and lower zzso zzso zzso was associated with lower performance in delayed zzso Excluding persons with zzso disease, the association of zzso zzso zzso with memory measures was stronger, whereas the association between zzso volume and total recall became zzso 

In the early stages of zzso disease or in persons without zzso with worse memory ability, functional and zzso zzso zzso contributes to memory zzso whereas in the later zzso functional and structural changes play a zzso
