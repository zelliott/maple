zzso and zzso of the cerebral zzso were studied in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso mouse model with zzso at an age range of 10 to 17 zzso zzso blood volume, and average vessel geometry were assessed in the brain and compared to zzso controls zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the MR relaxation times zzso zzso and zzso were measured to detect potential pathological changes that might be associated with zzso plaque zzso Both decreased zzso and decreased blood volume were observed in the zzso zzso in zzso mice as compared to zzso A significant decrease in zzso and zzso was found in the frontal zzso and in the zzso zzso confirmed plaque zzso in the zzso and in the zzso In zzso our data indicate a reduced blood supply of zzso mice in the zzso zzso that parallels the findings in cortical regions of patients with zzso
