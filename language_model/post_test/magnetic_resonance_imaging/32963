Cancer is a zzso disease by zzso Current imaging studies usually ignore zzso zzso in imaging zzso We zzso that zzso tumor zzso with imaging techniques can provide useful information about cancer biology and potentially serve as novel imaging zzso In this retrospective study, we identify a potential imaging marker, the zzso fraction zzso that zzso tumor zzso in zzso cellular zzso We demonstrate its application on a test population of 22 women with stage zzso zzso negative breast cancer receiving zzso combination zzso zzso Early change in zzso zzso is assessed with dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging at the end of zzso 2 and associated with zzso zzso Its performance is compared with other established zzso imaging zzso zzso tumor volume and volume zzso by statistical and graphic zzso We demonstrate that a significant zzso difference in zzso can be detected between good zzso zzso zzso and poor zzso zzso zzso responders, despite the limited population zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are not statistically zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis also shows that zzso is a good predictor for zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while predictions made with the established zzso zzso are not significantly better than random zzso We conclude that zzso has the potential of being a better zzso zzso for therapeutic response zzso Our findings support our zzso that zzso tumor zzso with imaging techniques can provide additional information that can serve as novel zzso
