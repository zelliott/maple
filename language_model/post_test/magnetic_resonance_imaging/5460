Although there is evidence of emotion perception deficits in zzso spectrum disorder zzso research on this topic has been mostly confined to perception of emotions in zzso Using behavioral measures and zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we examined whether such deficits extend to the perception of bodily expressed zzso We found that individuals with zzso in contrast to zzso zzso individuals, did not exhibit a differential pattern of brain zzso to bodies expressing fear as compared with emotionally neutral zzso zzso and zzso individuals showed similar patterns of zzso in response to bodies engaged in emotionally neutral actions, with the exception of decreased zzso in the inferior frontal zzso and the anterior zzso in zzso We discuss these findings in relation to possible abnormalities in a network of cortical and zzso mechanisms involved in social zzso and emotion zzso Our data suggest that emotion perception deficits in zzso may be due to compromised processing of the emotional component of observed zzso
