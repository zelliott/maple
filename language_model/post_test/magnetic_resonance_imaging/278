The aim of this study was to assess potential quality assurance zzso issues in the diagnosis and characterization of zzso masses on pelvic zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso 

Images from 128 women who had zzso during a zzso period with CT and/or MR studies within 5 years of surgery (145 CT scans from 103 women and 49 MR studies from 42 women, with 17 having both MR and CT zzso were reviewed by three zzso who assigned zzso scores of 0 (no zzso zzso 1 zzso issue with minimal impact on clinical zzso or 2 zzso issue with potential impact on clinical zzso The difficulty of diagnosis was assigned a score of 0 zzso difficult diagnosis to zzso 1 zzso but possible to make the zzso or 2 zzso should be zzso The zzso of zzso zzso issues was calculated using total CT and MR pelvic examinations performed on women during the zzso 

zzso zzso issues were identified in 28 women in 17 of 145 CT studies zzso and 12 of 49 MR examinations zzso in women having zzso surgery (17 of zzso zzso of female pelvic CT studies and 12 of zzso zzso of female pelvic MR studies performed in the time zzso zzso included missed zzso zzso misidentified as zzso fat described in the zzso but not seen zzso zzso status of patient not considered, ultrasound correlation not recommended, and confusion of right and left zzso 

Errors in CT and MR studies regarding the diagnosis and characterization of zzso masses in a highly enriched population of women undergoing zzso surgery are zzso zzso of the types of zzso issues found in CT and MR studies of zzso masses should aid in decreasing future zzso
