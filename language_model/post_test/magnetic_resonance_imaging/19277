The zzso basis for the striking decrease of attention to novel events following frontal lobe injury is poorly zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso were recorded from patients with frontal lobe damage and matched subjects, who controlled the duration of viewing of background, novel and target zzso zzso lobe patients did not differ from normal controls in terms of age, education, estimated zzso or zzso However, they were judged to be more zzso as measured by self-report and zzso zzso Patients with frontal lobe damage exhibited markedly reduced zzso of the novelty zzso response and the duration of viewing of novel zzso In contrast, injury to the frontal zzso had a limited impact on zzso zzso and zzso responses zzso duration and reaction zzso to target zzso A strong correlation was found between measures of apathy and both attenuated zzso zzso and viewing duration in response to novel but not target zzso zzso in zzso of the novelty zzso response explained a large portion of the zzso associated with duration of viewing of novel zzso After controlling for the influence of zzso zzso there was no association between frontal lobe injury and reduced viewing of novel zzso The results of this study suggest that frontal lobe damage leads to diminished visual attention to novel events through its disruption of neural processes underlying the novelty zzso zzso These processes appear to regulate the allocation of zzso resources and early exploratory zzso and are not limited to immediate zzso zzso zzso to the frontal zzso may prevent the generation of a signal which indicates that a novel event in the environment requires additional attention due to its potential zzso zzso The disruption of these processes is likely to contribute to the apathy observed in patients after injury to the frontal zzso
