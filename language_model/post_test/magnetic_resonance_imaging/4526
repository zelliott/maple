In the clinical application of zzso PET studies with zzso optimal PET images are required when the high activity of a nearby zzso might affect the activated zzso 

To determine the optimal time for data acquisition of PET images, we performed serial dynamic PET zzso in five patients with cerebral zzso zzso zzso All zzso were closest to the motor zzso and the zzso task was opponent finger movement zzso to the zzso zzso PET and MR images were zzso for zzso of activated zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso and normal zzso from the dynamic PET data demonstrated a zzso in peak time and significant zzso increase in the zzso during the early zzso zzso of the initial PET data provided better contrast in activated zzso without affecting the calculated cerebral blood flow of other zzso 

Delayed data acquisition can avoid interference of the zzso zzso with the activated zzso
