In 1980, Human T cell zzso virus type 1 zzso was the first zzso human zzso to be zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family, the zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso Three molecules have been identified for binding and/or entry of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An efficient transfer of the virus from an infected cell to a target cell can occur through the formation of a viral zzso and/or by zzso zzso As for all zzso zzso zzso possesses three major zzso zzso pol and zzso zzso the structural and zzso zzso zzso encodes also some regulatory and zzso proteins including the tax protein with transforming activities and the zzso protein which plays a role in the proliferation and maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso is present throughout the world with clusters of high zzso including mainly Southern Japan, the Caribbean region, areas in South America and in zzso zzso The worldwide zzso infected population is estimated to be around zzso zzso zzso has three modes of zzso zzso mother to child, mainly linked to prolonged zzso zzso zzso mainly occurring from male to female and zzso contaminated blood zzso zzso possesses a remarkable genetic zzso zzso is the zzso agent of mainly two severe zzso a zzso T zzso cell zzso of very poor zzso named Adult T cell zzso zzso and a chronic zzso named Tropical zzso zzso Associated zzso zzso The lifetime risk among zzso carriers is estimated to be around zzso to zzso zzso mainly occurs in adults, with a mean age at onset of zzso years and it is more common in women than in zzso Blood zzso is a major risk factor for zzso zzso zzso zzso is mainly defined as a chronic zzso zzso and minor sensory zzso The onset is insidious with often gait zzso and urinary zzso In more than zzso of the cases, the neurological features zzso zzso and/or zzso of the lower zzso urinary zzso zzso lower zzso muscle zzso and in around 50% of the cases, sensory disturbances with low back zzso Central functions and zzso nerves are usually zzso The clinical course is generally progressive without zzso High levels of zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso are present in blood and zzso fluid zzso A high zzso zzso load is frequently observed in the zzso zzso to moderate increase of proteins may be present in the zzso However, zzso production of specific zzso zzso index provides additional data to support the zzso Brain white matter zzso on magnetic resonance imaging are zzso A mild zzso of the zzso spinal zzso can also be zzso zzso it is characterized by a chronic inflammation with zzso zzso zzso and mild zzso zzso zzso The cells are mostly zzso in early disease and mostly zzso in latter zzso zzso tract damage with zzso and zzso loss, mainly in the lower zzso spinal zzso are zzso zzso zzso is still poorly understood and viral and host factors as the zzso load and the cellular immune response play a major role in disease zzso zzso can be associated with other zzso associated symptoms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso remains disappointing and symptomatic treatment remains still the mainstay of zzso
