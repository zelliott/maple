zzso working memory zzso abnormalities represents a fundamental challenge in schizophrenia research given the impact of cognitive deficits on life outcome in zzso In prior work we demonstrated that zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso was related to successful zzso resistance during zzso in healthy controls, but not in zzso Although understanding the impact of regional functional deficits is critical, functional connectivity abnormalities among zzso within zzso networks may constitute a final common zzso for zzso zzso zzso this study tested the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with functional connectivity abnormalities within zzso networks during distraction conditions in zzso 28 patients and 24 controls completed a delayed zzso zzso task that included transient visual distraction during the zzso maintenance zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity zzso specifically during the maintenance phase in the presence or absence of zzso zzso revealed that patients failed to zzso zzso during zzso presentation in both cortical and zzso zzso Specifically, controls demonstrated reductions in zzso between zzso and the extended zzso when distraction was zzso zzso patients failed to demonstrate a change in zzso with the amygdala, but showed greater connectivity with zzso zzso While controls showed more positive zzso between zzso and other prefrontal cortical regions during zzso zzso patients failed to exhibit such a zzso Taken together, these findings support the notion that observed zzso resistance deficit involves a breakdown in zzso between zzso and distributed regions, encompassing both zzso zzso and control region zzso
