zzso deficits occur early in Alzheimer's disease zzso and are considered more responsive to zzso therapy than characteristic memory zzso We zzso that neural responses in zzso during zzso processing would be impaired relative to controls, yet partially susceptible to improvement with the zzso inhibitor zzso We studied 16 mild zzso patients and 17 zzso healthy controls, using zzso to enable zzso zzso comparisons of effects of zzso on zzso and zzso related brain zzso plus zzso comparisons for zzso zzso viewed face or building stimuli while performing a shallow zzso zzso of zzso or a deep zzso zzso age of depicted face or zzso zzso zzso subjects performed slower than controls in both tasks, while zzso benefited the patients for the more demanding zzso zzso zzso zzso minus building, and vice zzso zzso signals in zzso and zzso zzso zzso were attenuated in patients relative to controls, but increased following zzso By contrast, zzso responses in zzso zzso were not impaired in zzso and showed decreases following zzso for both zzso zzso responses in right zzso and prefrontal zzso were diminished in zzso but improved following zzso A similar pattern of group and treatment effects was observed in two zzso cortical regions that showed zzso enhancement of zzso for the deep versus shallow zzso Finally, for the healthy group, zzso decreased stimulus and zzso effects, partly due to an exaggeration of selectivity during the shallow relative to deep zzso The differences in brain zzso between groups and treatments were not attributable merely to performance zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso can improve both zzso and zzso responses in functionally affected zzso and zzso regions in zzso while zzso the normal pattern of responses in many of the same regions in healthy zzso
