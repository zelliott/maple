To investigate the zzso relaxation times for zzso rat lung zzso we measured zzso and zzso at 11 different times during the zzso zzso time zzso A zzso analysis of zzso was used to determine zzso fast zzso and zzso slow zzso In addition, we measured water content and correlated changes in the relaxation times with pathological zzso The correlation indicates the zzso zzso Shortly after zzso the zzso zzso zzso for 1/3 of the samples became zzso and there were no noticeable pathological changes observed using light zzso zzso During radiation zzso zzso and zzso were zzso This accompanied acute zzso changes and inflammatory cell zzso zzso Finally, during radiation zzso zzso shortened and collagen zzso We observed no significant correlation between relaxation time changes and water content changes throughout the zzso time zzso
