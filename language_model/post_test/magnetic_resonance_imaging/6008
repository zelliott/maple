zzso is a zzso zzso that acts at zzso receptors to influence zzso zzso throughout the central nervous zzso A great deal is known about the behavioral effects of this drug in humans and laboratory animals, but little is known about zzso specific effects on zzso in zzso 

We evaluated how acute administration of zzso affected levels of zzso zzso zzso and other brain zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso at 4 T was employed to measure the effects of zzso on brain chemistry in 19 healthy zzso Participants underwent scanning following acute oral administration of a therapeutic dose of zzso (10 zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso from single zzso within the anterior zzso zzso and thalamus, a series of questionnaires were administered periodically throughout the experimental session to assess zzso mood zzso 

zzso reduced zzso levels in the thalamus, but not the zzso There were no treatment effects with respect to other zzso zzso zzso ratings of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were increased relative to zzso as were ratings on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso scales of the zzso Research Center zzso Moreover, there was a significant correlation between the decrease in zzso and zzso 

zzso engendered primarily zzso effects and the correlation between reduced zzso zzso and zzso may be a function of zzso interaction with zzso receptors in the zzso projecting through the zzso system to the zzso
