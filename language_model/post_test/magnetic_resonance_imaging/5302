Various schizophrenic symptoms are suggested to be linked to a dysfunction of the brain reward zzso Several studies have found zzso in the reward processing in patients with zzso however, most previous findings might be zzso by medication zzso 

Thirty-one zzso schizophrenia patients and 31 zzso and zzso healthy control subjects were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing a zzso of the monetary incentive delay zzso The task zzso made it possible to separate overall zzso zzso as zzso zzso into behavioral zzso zzso where a predicted reward requires zzso and zzso anticipation (the anticipation of a zzso significant zzso Furthermore, the evaluation of monetary gain and loss was zzso 

During reward zzso patients had a significant zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso during presentation of salient zzso This signal zzso in zzso zzso was correlated with the degree of positive zzso Signal zzso was most pronounced for behavioral zzso and zzso for value zzso Furthermore, patients showed a changed zzso pattern during outcome evaluation in right prefrontal zzso 

Our results suggest that changes during reward anticipation in schizophrenia are present from the beginning of the zzso This supports a possible involvement of reward disturbances in the zzso of zzso The most pronounced changes were seen in relation to overall zzso In zzso zzso these changes were associated with the degree of positive zzso
