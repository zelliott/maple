The natural history and growth pattern of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso are not well zzso This study was designed in order to get insight into the growth rate of zzso and to suggest recommendations for their zzso 

Patients with well-documented zzso discovered or minimally symptomatic zzso who underwent yearly surveillance zzso were zzso using a linear mixed zzso The growth rate and the effects of different fixed factors zzso personal history of other zzso zzso zzso pattern, clinical zzso zzso zzso and random factors (age and zzso diameter at the time of zzso on zzso growth were zzso 

Study population consisted of 145 zzso zzso overall mean growth rate was zzso zzso but the growth curve analysis showed a different trend between the first 7 years after the baseline evaluation zzso rate of zzso zzso and the subsequent period (years 7 to 10, growth rate of zzso zzso zzso Tests for fixed effects demonstrated that an zzso pattern and a personal history of other zzso are significant zzso of a more rapid mean zzso growth zzso and zzso growth rates of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso growth significantly increased with age zzso zzso zzso 

Overall, zzso grow slowly, and an initial zzso approach is feasible in all the zzso or minimally symptomatic zzso The zzso zzso a history of other zzso zzso and patients' age impact on zzso zzso In any case, a significant growth is unlikely to occur before 7 years from the baseline zzso zzso size at the time of diagnosis should not be used for zzso zzso
