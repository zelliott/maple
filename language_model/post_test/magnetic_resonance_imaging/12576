To compare the imaging methods for identifying the various zzso variations of the zzso surfaces at the zzso zzso 

Thirteen zzso zzso were examined by plain neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso were performed, and the parameters that defined the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso types were investigated, with dissection being used as the definitive measure of zzso The dissection findings were compared to the results of each imaging technique to determine the accuracy of zzso determination from each zzso 

zzso type was the most accurately identified zzso zzso amongst all imaging zzso zzso type was most accurately determined from zzso zzso A zzso with a small, zzso zzso facet zzso zzso could be differentiated only by zzso zzso and zzso zzso type could not be determined accurately using any of the imaging zzso zzso zzso type was most accurately determined from zzso zzso However, flat and zzso zzso could not be routinely differentiated from zzso zzso zzso type was most accurately determined from zzso CT zzso 

zzso identification of zzso bone zzso is required to improve our understanding of zzso mechanics and zzso Not all zzso features can be identified zzso zzso zzso is required to differentiate types of zzso and to differentiate zzso zzso zzso provides the most accurate identification of zzso type, and zzso CT provides the best method of zzso zzso zzso
