We describe the use of zzso informed basis functions zzso in the analysis of zzso functional imaging zzso zzso are used to specify an zzso informed spatial model that embodies anatomical knowledge for the statistical analysis of zzso zzso In a previous communication, we showed how zzso can be used to incorporate prior anatomical constraints in single subject functional magnetic resonance image zzso analyses to augment their anatomical zzso In this paper, we extend zzso such that it can be applied to zzso studies using zzso or zzso The key concept is that, after spatial zzso a zzso cortical surface can be used to generate a forward model of signal sources for all zzso By zzso the zzso signal in this zzso zzso and then projecting it back into the zzso one effectively extracts functional activity that is smooth, within and only zzso the cortical sheet while attenuating other components unrelated to the zzso process of zzso The ensuing procedure can be considered as a highly zzso zzso zzso informed zzso or zzso It is shown that this procedure offers various advantages compared to existing conventional methods for the analysis of zzso studies, in particular it is more sensitive to underlying zzso
