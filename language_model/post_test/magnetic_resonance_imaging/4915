To evaluate the value of three-dimensional zzso whole brain zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on CT zzso zzso data in patients with zzso cerebral zzso 

Thirty-five patients who had suffered stroke with anterior circulation within 3 hours underwent zzso CT zzso scanning and zzso zzso zzso a zzso software, was zzso to process the raw zzso data and a zzso image of the brain was zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was performed 6 hours after CT zzso The volume and quantity of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso were compared with zzso imaging zzso 

The numbers of cerebral zzso detected by zzso zzso and zzso were 40, 38 and 16, zzso The results of zzso analysis between zzso and zzso with MR were zzso and zzso and a paired zzso analysis for the measurement of zzso volume between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso that were not detected by zzso volumes less than zzso zzso 

zzso zzso CT has the potential to assess the full extent of an zzso stroke at an early stage, whereas zzso is limited to the detection of small zzso The zzso zzso CT technique based on zzso data requires no additional radiation exposure or contrast medium injection, and can be performed in a short period of zzso
