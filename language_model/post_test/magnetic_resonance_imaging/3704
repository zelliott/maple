Previous research on artificial grammar has indicated that the human ability to zzso sentences or letter strings according to zzso relies on two types of zzso One is a superficial, zzso understanding of a grammar the other is the knowledge of rules and critical features underlying a zzso The fundamentally different characteristics of these systems permit an analysis of zzso characteristics zzso which measures the extent to which each type of knowledge is used in zzso zzso Furthermore, violations of a grammar can be divided into zzso and local zzso The present study is the first to combine the use of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Based on previous zzso studies, it was hypothesized that judgments based on rule knowledge, as extracted from individual zzso zzso involve the left inferior frontal zzso zzso whereas similarity would involve right zzso as well as left zzso zzso With regards to violation types, it was hypothesized that zzso violations would recruit the zzso part of the left zzso as well as the zzso zzso whereas local violations would zzso activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that for greater reliance on rule knowledge, a zzso part of the left zzso was activated for zzso items, whereas other zzso areas show a differentiated response for zzso for individuals less zzso on zzso The right zzso was related to zzso items as a function of zzso zzso are discussed with regards to possible error detection systems and differentiated efficiencies for respective zzso zzso
