To investigate the use of a complex zzso echo zzso acquisition and an zzso moving average zzso model for simultaneous zzso and zzso zzso for the assessment of liver iron content zzso in patients with iron zzso 

Fifty magnetic resonance imaging zzso exams with magnitude and phase zzso images were processed using the zzso model, which provides zzso field zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was calculated by measuring the zzso between the liver and the right zzso abdominal muscle from the field zzso The relationship between zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso was determined using linear zzso zzso zzso 

zzso measured from zzso is highly correlated to the zzso with the zzso method zzso dry zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of wet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The field zzso in the liver is correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

By using the zzso model on complex zzso images, both zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be made zzso The zzso measurement can be used to help verify zzso zzso in the assessment of iron zzso
