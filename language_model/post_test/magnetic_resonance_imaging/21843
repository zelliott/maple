zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso magnetic stimulation zzso represent different approaches to mapping the motor zzso zzso identifies areas of zzso changes during task performance while zzso provides zzso data concerning the zzso and density of cortical zzso Here we define the spatial correlation between zzso and zzso maps and compared them with direct electrical cortical stimulation zzso We performed zzso at zzso T on 3 normal subjects and 2 patients with mass zzso near the central zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence during the performance of a motor zzso We also performed focal zzso with surface zzso recordings from the muscles primarily involved in the zzso zzso We zzso the stimulation sites in real time with the zzso maps using a zzso zzso zzso In both patients we also performed zzso of the zzso during surgery under local zzso zzso maps were validated by the zzso data both zzso and zzso Our results suggest that regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso to areas of highest zzso density as demonstrated by zzso zzso
