Although early sensory zzso is organized along dimensions zzso by zzso zzso little is known about the organization of higher areas in which different zzso are zzso We investigated zzso integration in human superior zzso zzso using recent advances in parallel imaging to perform functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at very high zzso These studies suggest a functional architecture in which information from different zzso is brought into close proximity via a zzso distribution of zzso followed by integration in the intervening zzso
