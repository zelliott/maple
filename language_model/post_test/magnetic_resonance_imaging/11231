Human faces provide important signals in social interactions by zzso two main types of information, individual identity and emotional zzso The ability to readily assess both, the zzso and consistency among emotional expressions in different individuals, is central to one's own interpretation of the imminent zzso A zzso design was used to systematically test the interaction of either constant or variable emotional expressions with constant or variable facial identities in areas involved in face processing using functional magnetic resonance zzso 

Previous studies suggest a zzso role of the zzso in the assessment of emotional zzso Here we extend this view by showing that this structure activated to faces with changing identities that display constant emotional zzso Within this condition, zzso zzso was dependent on the type and intensity of displayed emotion, with significant responses to fearful expressions and, to a lesser extent so to neutral and happy zzso In contrast, the lateral zzso zzso showed a zzso pattern of increased zzso to changing stimulus features while it was also zzso responsive to the intensity of displayed emotion when processing different facial zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso might serve to detect constant facial emotions in different individuals, zzso its established role for detecting emotional zzso
