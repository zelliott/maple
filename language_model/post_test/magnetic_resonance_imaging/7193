In this paper, I described clinical and basic problems on neurology of the aged zzso These studies have been done in various institutions with many zzso 1) A PET study revealed some age differences on zzso zzso or zzso But these results are not so rigid in which much of individual variations should be considered in zzso zzso age is not always compatible to biological zzso 2) zzso zzso in the brain artery were found in zzso of 1200 routine autopsy series of the aged zzso zzso with external diameter exceeding 6 zzso had been fatally zzso in 14 zzso of 18 zzso 3) Variations of the zzso crossing are found responsible for bizarre clinical zzso zzso component was more prominent in the right zzso zzso consequently, right zzso tracts including zzso and lateral one seemed to have more extensive representation in the spinal zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso study showed a reduced zzso in the area 4 or area 4-6 of the ALS zzso 5) I introduced a new simplified zzso zzso which is useful for detection of subtle zzso zzso 6) Cases with central zzso zzso and those of zzso syndrome were presented with an emphasis on their zzso zzso 7) zzso syndrome showing zzso persistent zzso block is not rare in the aged, in which we have already had some useful therapeutic zzso 8) zzso complicated with neurodegenerative disease was discussed on its clinical and chemical features of mental zzso In zzso zzso acid reduced significantly than in the control and L-dopa was effective in some zzso 9) zzso and zzso zzso were presented and discussed on their zzso mechanism according to our recent studies with review of zzso
