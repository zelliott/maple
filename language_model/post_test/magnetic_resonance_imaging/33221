zzso zzso which are currently approved for clinical zzso use, provide zzso well below their theoretical limit, and they also lack tissue zzso Recently, the geometrical confinement of zzso zzso contrast agents zzso within porous structures has been proposed as a novel, alternative strategy to improve zzso without chemical modification of the zzso Here, we have characterized and zzso the performance of zzso zzso obtained by loading zzso zzso zzso into the pores of zzso zzso silicon zzso zzso with three different pore sizes were zzso and at zzso they exhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso pores and zzso zzso zzso for 30 - zzso zzso No enhancement in zzso was observed for larger pores zzso Using an zzso compound, zzso , and mathematical zzso it was demonstrated that the zzso enhancement is due to the increase in zzso correlation times zzso zzso on the pore zzso and diffusion correlation times zzso mobility of the water zzso as the pore sizes zzso It was also observed that extensive CA zzso on the outer surface of the silicon particles zzso the advantages offered by zzso zzso Upon incubation with zzso cells, the zzso did not demonstrate significant zzso for up to zzso post zzso at different zzso zzso In addition, the zzso showed complete degradation after zzso of continuous agitation in zzso zzso These data support and confirm the hypothesis that the geometrical confinement of zzso zzso compounds into porous structures offers zzso zzso with enhanced zzso (up to 6 times for zzso zzso , and 4 times for zzso ) and, zzso improved stability, reduced toxicity and tissue zzso
