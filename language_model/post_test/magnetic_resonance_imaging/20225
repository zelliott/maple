Little is known about the zzso mechanisms underlying zzso decisions and how they are modulated by social factors such as perceived group zzso The present study investigates the neural processes preceding the willingness to engage in costly helping toward zzso and zzso zzso Soccer fans witnessed a fan of their favorite team zzso zzso or of a rival team zzso zzso experience zzso They were subsequently able to choose to help the other by enduring physical pain themselves to reduce the other's zzso Helping the zzso member was best predicted by anterior zzso zzso when seeing him suffer and by associated self-reports of zzso zzso In contrast, not helping the zzso member was best predicted by nucleus zzso zzso and the degree of negative evaluation of the zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso can motivate costly zzso whereas an zzso signal in nucleus zzso reduces the propensity to zzso
