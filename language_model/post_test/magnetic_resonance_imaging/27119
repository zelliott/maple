Chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso zzso is a versatile imaging technique for measuring zzso properties via dilute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is implemented with a long zzso zzso zzso followed by fast image acquisition to obtain the steady state zzso zzso Nevertheless, the sensitivity, scan time, and spatial coverage of the conventional zzso zzso method may not be zzso Our study proposed a segmented zzso labeling scheme that includes a long primary zzso zzso module to generate the steady state zzso contrast and repetitive short secondary zzso zzso module immediately after the image acquisition so as to maintain the steady state zzso contrast for zzso acquisition and signal zzso The proposed zzso zzso method was validated zzso with a zzso pH phantom and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the proposed sequence was evaluated for imaging zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso which showed similar contrast as conventional zzso zzso transfer zzso In sum, a fast zzso relaxation zzso zzso zzso sequence was developed, with significantly improved sensitivity and suitable for in zzso zzso
