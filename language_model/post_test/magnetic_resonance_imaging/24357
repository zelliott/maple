To test the hypothesis the warning effect is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of the motor system, we conducted functional zzso using a zzso task with visual and auditory warning zzso For zzso zzso trials, the auditory warning stimulus was presented for zzso during which visual cues were presented that prompted either Go or zzso zzso The same format was used for zzso zzso zzso Both auditory and visual warning cues shortened the reaction time for the Go zzso The warning cues activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso network, and motor cortical areas including the zzso motor area zzso the bilateral zzso zzso cortex, and the left primary motor zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso matched the difference between its zzso by zzso and by zzso Thus, the zzso was primed by the warning zzso The same zzso zzso effect was observed for the zzso zzso zzso consistent with its role in movement preparation and zzso Similar but less prominent Go zzso zzso was observed in the zzso Thus, the warning effect represents the zzso of the motor control zzso by the zzso zzso system, from the selection and preparation of the movement to its zzso
