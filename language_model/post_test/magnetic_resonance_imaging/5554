A visual task for semantic access involves a number of brain zzso However, previous studies either examined the role of each region separately using zzso approach, or analyzed a single brain network using zzso connectivity zzso We zzso that these brain regions construct several functional networks underpinning a word semantic access task, these networks being engaged in different cognitive components with distinct zzso zzso In this paper, zzso independent component analysis zzso was used to reveal these networks based on functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data acquired during a visual and an auditory word semantic judgment zzso Our results demonstrated that there were three zzso independent components zzso corresponding to various cognitive components involved in the visual zzso Furthermore, zzso separation on the auditory task showed consistency of the results with our hypothesis, regardless of the input zzso
