Although zzso morbidity and mortality are less than in the past, the risk of zzso and zzso brain damage has not been zzso In order to zzso zzso zzso and zzso care, it is necessary to detect factors responsible for brain damage and obtain information about their zzso zzso of the timing of zzso infections and circulatory abnormalities would enable zzso and zzso to improve prevention in zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been criticized as being too indirect a sign of fetal condition and as having various technical zzso though its reliability seems to be improved by association with pulse zzso fetal blood pH and zzso zzso is particularly useful to determine the timing of zzso brain zzso zzso ultrasound has been used to determine the type and evolution of brain zzso zzso resonance has also been used to detect zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities and timing on the basis of standardized assessment of brain zzso Advances in the interpretation of zzso zzso have also made this technique useful for determining the timing of brain zzso zzso red blood cell count in zzso blood has been recognized as an important indication of the timing of zzso zzso and even abnormal zzso and zzso counts may be used to establish zzso zzso zzso blood pH and base excess are well-known markers of fetal zzso but are best combined with heart rate and blood zzso Other markers of fetal and zzso zzso useful for determining the timing of brain damage are zzso of zzso and markers of zzso stress in zzso blood and zzso zzso zzso in blood and zzso fluid may indicate zzso or zzso zzso The determination of zzso and protein zzso has also been zzso zzso and zzso can therefore now rely on various methods for monitoring the risk of brain damage in the zzso and zzso zzso
