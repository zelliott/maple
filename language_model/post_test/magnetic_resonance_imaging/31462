zzso patterns, such as melodies, consist of two levels of zzso a global level, zzso the pattern of ups and downs, or zzso and a local level, zzso the precise intervals that make up this zzso An influential zzso model suggests that these two levels of processing are zzso linked, with processing of the global structure occurring within the right zzso in advance of local processing within the zzso However, the predictions of this model and its anatomical basis have not been tested in zzso normal zzso The present study used zzso and required participants to listen to consecutive pitch sequences while performing a zzso zzso zzso zzso when different, either preserved zzso or violated zzso the zzso of the sequence preceding zzso When the zzso for the local and global conditions were contrasted directly, additional zzso was seen for local processing in right zzso zzso and zzso superior zzso zzso zzso The presence of additional zzso for local over global processing supports the zzso view that the global structure of a pitch sequence acts as a zzso on which the local detail is subsequently zzso However, the zzso of zzso seen in the present study, with global processing occurring in left zzso and local processing occurring zzso differed from that predicted by the zzso zzso A zzso of the individual zzso data on which the zzso model is based revealed that the zzso data equally well support the zzso scheme suggested by our zzso While the present study supports the zzso view of local and global processing, there is an evident need for further research, both in patients and zzso normal individuals, before an understanding of the functional zzso of local and global processing can be considered zzso
