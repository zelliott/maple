The zzso zzso of any zzso including zzso cartilage, has a structure that allows it to meet the physical demands placed upon that zzso zzso the structure of zzso cartilage is not zzso There is considerable variation from one joint to the next and even within a particular joint surface, probably reflecting a zzso zzso This structure has a strong influence on zzso zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso zzso relative to the main magnetic field zzso provides tissue zzso Images obtained with adequate resolution can exploit this contrast and demonstrate the structure of zzso zzso resonance imaging is thus capable of providing a detailed description of the structure of joint surfaces, information that is difficult to obtain even with zzso zzso
