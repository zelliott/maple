The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a direct relation can be demonstrated between zzso zzso defects detected during zzso stress test zzso by cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso and impairment of coronary zzso zzso function in patients with cardiac syndrome X zzso 

Despite the fact that coronary zzso dysfunction has been shown in most patients with zzso the zzso origin of zzso remains zzso No previous study assessed whether a strict relation exists between abnormalities in zzso zzso and coronary zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso patients zzso age 58 zzso 7 years, 7 zzso and 10 healthy control subjects zzso age 54 zzso 8 years, 4 zzso underwent zzso zzso study by zzso zzso at rest and at peak zzso zzso dose 40 zzso zzso flow response zzso to zzso zzso zzso in 90 zzso in the left anterior descending zzso coronary artery was assessed by high-resolution zzso zzso and expressed as the ratio between coronary flow zzso at peak zzso and at zzso 

At peak zzso zzso zzso defects on zzso were found in 10 zzso patients zzso but in none of the control subjects zzso zzso zzso The zzso to zzso in the zzso coronary artery was lower in zzso patients than in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso defects in the zzso territory on zzso had a lower zzso to zzso compared with those without zzso defects in the zzso territory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A significant correlation was found in zzso patients between zzso to zzso and a zzso zzso zzso score on zzso in the zzso territory zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Our data zzso show zzso zzso zzso defects on zzso and reduced zzso in the zzso coronary artery territory in zzso patients, thus giving strong evidence that a dysfunction of coronary zzso resulting in zzso zzso abnormalities is present in these zzso
