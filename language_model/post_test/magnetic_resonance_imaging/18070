Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with zzso depression zzso and zzso depression zzso differed at neural zzso However, it remains unclear if these two zzso of depression differ in the zzso zzso This study was undertaken for two purposes: zzso to explore the differences in zzso coordination between these two zzso by using the zzso zzso connectivity zzso zzso and zzso to determine if the difference of zzso coordination can be used as a zzso to differentiate zzso from both zzso and healthy subjects zzso 

zzso patients with zzso 22 with zzso and 19 HS participated in the zzso Data of these participants were analyzed with the zzso and zzso functional connectivity zzso zzso 

Compared to the zzso group, the zzso group showed significantly lower zzso values in the zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso middle zzso and zzso zzso Lower zzso values were also observed in the zzso group in the zzso zzso relative to the HS zzso However, the zzso group had no significant change in zzso value in any brain region compared to the HS zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso values in the zzso zzso had zzso function distinguishing patients with zzso from patients with zzso as well as those participants in the HS zzso 

Lower zzso values of patients with zzso relative to those with zzso and those in the HS group in the zzso zzso appeared to be a unique feature for patients with zzso and it may be used as an imaging zzso to separate patients with zzso from those with zzso or zzso
