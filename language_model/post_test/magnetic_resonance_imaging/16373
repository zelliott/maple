We examine the performance of approximate models zzso of the head in solving the zzso inverse zzso The AM are needed when the zzso zzso is not zzso We simulate the electric potential distribution generated by cortical sources for a large sample of zzso subjects, and solve the inverse problem with zzso zzso comparisons are carried out with the distribution of the zzso zzso We propose several new zzso These are the average of many individual realistic zzso models, such as zzso models or lead zzso We demonstrate that the lead fields of the AM should be calculated considering source moments not constrained to be normal to the zzso We also show that the imperfect anatomical correspondence between all zzso is the most important cause of zzso zzso Our average models perform better than a random individual model or the usual average model in the zzso zzso We also show that a zzso based on race and gender or head size before averaging does not significantly improve the zzso Our average models are slightly better than an existing AM with shape guided by measured individual zzso positions, and have the advantage of not requiring such zzso Among the studied models, the Average Lead Field seems the most convenient tool in large and zzso clinical and research studies demanding zzso source zzso when zzso are zzso This AM does not need a strict alignment between head models, and can therefore be easily achieved for any type of head modeling zzso
