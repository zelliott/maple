Metallic implants used in zzso zzso vascular clips, shunt valves, and metallic surgical wire for zzso induce distortion of magnetic resonance zzso The image deformation usually zzso to small areas of signal suppression in its immediate vicinity, when the implant is zzso The image deformation is more pronounced when the implant is zzso but more important, as is the case with some strongly zzso aneurysm clips, the magnetic field may cause movement of the zzso zzso it is zzso to refrain from magnetic resonance imaging in patients zzso zzso aneurysm clips, as the movement in the magnetic field may be zzso
