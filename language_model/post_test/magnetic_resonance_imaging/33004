The zzso goal was to design and evaluate a robot dedicated to middle ear zzso zzso for dimensions, forces, and zzso were collected, based on the zzso zzso The robot structure has a compact geometry with 3 linear and 3 zzso zzso It is remotely piloted via a zzso interface under operative zzso zzso to reach anatomical targets, to perform zzso and to place zzso in a model of zzso was evaluated by 6 zzso Multiple anatomical targets in the middle ear could be successfully reached without damaging surrounding zzso The robot could be used under operative microscope with minimal visual field impairment or jointly with a zzso zzso through the external auditory canal to perform zzso in zzso bone zzso zzso could be inserted in the zzso zzso The assistance robot is the first zzso with 6 degrees of freedom, a zzso structure, and dimensions zzso for zzso middle ear zzso
