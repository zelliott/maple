zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the visual zzso with an zzso resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed using a simple visual stimulus resulting in clear maps of zzso A collapsing filter was used to compare these high-resolution images with zzso images collected during the same zzso A good correspondence between the zzso and zzso functional maps was found with respect to the center of zzso of zzso However, only zzso of the size of activated areas in the zzso experiment was observed at high resolution, which was partly caused by the difference in zzso zzso The high-resolution images produce signal changes much higher than the zzso images due to reduced partial volume zzso Additionally, the high-resolution functional maps were compared with detailed anatomical and zzso zzso The activated areas were predominantly observed at zzso vessels within the zzso with a diameter on the order of the zzso zzso
