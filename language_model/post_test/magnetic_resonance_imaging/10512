In zzso zzso surgery patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 23), this study compared clinical, zzso and zzso features to discern potential mechanisms for zzso zzso zzso outcomes and structural zzso zzso measured affected and zzso cerebral zzso volumes for zzso and zzso cases, including zzso twins where one sibling had zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso determined zzso and white matter cell zzso and sizes in zzso and autopsy cases, including the zzso side of a zzso zzso zzso By zzso the affected zzso was larger and the zzso side smaller in zzso compared with zzso zzso The affected zzso side showed enlarged abnormal deep zzso and white matter structures and/or zzso zzso in the zzso white matter in zzso of cases, suggestive of excessive zzso zzso and zzso zzso examination of the affected zzso side revealed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and balloon cells in zzso of zzso Compared with autopsy cases, in zzso children zzso cell zzso on the affected side were increased in the molecular layer and upper zzso zzso to zzso decreased in lower cortical layers zzso and increased in the white matter zzso to zzso Deep zzso matter zzso abnormalities and/or zzso white matter zzso correlated with the presence of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso decreased zzso cell zzso in lower cortical layers and a positive history of infantile zzso zzso seizure control was associated with decreased zzso zzso in the molecular zzso In young children with zzso and zzso these findings indicate that there are bilateral cerebral zzso abnormalities and zzso zzso is a likely explanation for poorer zzso seizure control and cognitive zzso In addition, our findings support the hypothesis that zzso zzso probably involves zzso zzso that affect each developing cerebral zzso differently with more zzso than expected on the zzso zzso
