A zzso zzso complex is reported for imaging pH by zzso using zzso chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso zzso zzso of a single zzso zzso between pH 6 and zzso results in an zzso zzso shift in the water exchange zzso peak that is easily detected by zzso Collection of two zzso images at two slightly different zzso zzso provides a direct zzso of solution pH without the need of a concentration zzso
