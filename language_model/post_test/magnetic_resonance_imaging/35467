Clinical efficacy of zzso therapy in premature newborns depends on the efficiency of delivery of zzso drug to the zzso zzso To study the influence of various zzso physical, and zzso factors on zzso delivery in zzso zzso it is crucial to have appropriate in zzso models, which are currently not zzso We therefore constructed the premature infant nose zzso zzso an upper airway model corresponding to a premature infant of zzso zzso age by three-dimensional zzso reconstruction of a zzso magnetic resonance imaging scan and subsequent zzso zzso was realized by visual comparison and comparison of total airway zzso To study the feasibility of measuring zzso deposition, zzso was zzso through the cast and lung dose was expressed as percentage of nominal zzso The airway volumes of the initial magnetic resonance imaging and validation zzso zzso scan showed a relative zzso of zzso Lung dose at low flow (1 zzso was zzso and zzso at high flow (10 zzso p zzso zzso zzso provided an zzso accurate surrogate of the upper airways of a zzso premature infant, making the model suitable for future in zzso zzso
