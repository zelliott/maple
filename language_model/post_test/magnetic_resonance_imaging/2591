To improve the spatial resolution of human zzso zzso we developed a new high resolution zzso method based on the improved estimate of the realistic surface zzso zzso The novelty of this method consisted in the zzso of the local scalp resistance that was assumed to be zzso zzso to the local scalp thickness measured from magnetic resonance images of the zzso zzso The local scalp thickness was then multiplied by the zzso estimate of the potential over a realistic magnetic zzso model of the zzso scalp zzso The new method was applied on human zzso and zzso zzso the zzso estimate at a constant scalp thickness being used as a zzso The zzso scalp thickness was significantly zzso zzso zzso higher in the zzso areas zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to the zzso estimate at constant scalp zzso the improved zzso estimate enhanced the spatial detail of both zzso and zzso zzso
