The aim of this study was to measure and zzso zzso effects to auditory stimulation within the auditory zzso of 11 depressed patients with major depressive disorder compared to 11 healthy zzso zzso was zzso by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso employing a block design zzso stimulation with sine zzso A zzso of patients zzso zzso 5) presented the following abnormal zzso zzso zzso significantly lower zzso after the first stimulation block zzso zzso zzso missing characteristic signal zzso to repeated acoustic stimulation and a marked zzso after each stimulation zzso This abnormal pattern may indicate functional deficits in auditory processing occurring with depression, but our results need be confirmed in a larger, more homogeneous patient zzso This paradigm may be a useful tool for assessing cortical dysfunction in mood zzso
