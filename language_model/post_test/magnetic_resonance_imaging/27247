Human zzso unlike even closely related zzso exhibit a remarkable capacity for language zzso Yet how the underlying anatomical network matures remains largely zzso The classical view is that of a largely immature brain zzso only a few islands of maturity in primary zzso This view has favored a description of learning based on bottom-up zzso and has tended to discard the role of frontal regions, which were assumed to be barely functional early zzso Here, using an index based on the zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso we have zzso maturation within the linguistic network in zzso zzso to zzso zzso Our results show first that the zzso superior zzso zzso zzso and not the inferior frontal area, is the less mature zzso zzso A significant difference of maturation in the zzso favoring the right side is an early testimony of the distinctive zzso development of this structure observed during the whole zzso Second, zzso of maturation in zzso area were correlated with zzso in the zzso zzso and in the zzso segment of the zzso zzso suggesting that an efficient zzso zzso zzso might provide infants with a zzso loop zzso much earlier than zzso
