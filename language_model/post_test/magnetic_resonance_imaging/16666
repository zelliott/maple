When volume coils are used for zzso imaging of the human head at 7 zzso wavelength effects in tissue cause a variation in intensity, that is typically brighter at the center of the head and darker in the zzso Much of this image zzso can be attributed to variation in the effective transmit zzso field, which falls by zzso 50% to the left and right of center at zzso in the zzso Because most of this zzso loss occurs in the periphery of the brain, we have explored use of actively controlled, zzso loop elements to locally enhance the transmit zzso field in these zzso When tuned to zzso above the zzso frequency, these elements provide strong local enhancement of the zzso field of the transmit zzso Because they are tuned zzso some volume zzso zzso results, but zzso loading of the zzso mode remains dominated by the zzso By digitally controlling their frequency zzso the field enhancement of each inner element can be placed under active zzso Using an array of eight digitally controlled elements placed around a zzso head zzso we demonstrate the feasibility of improving the zzso zzso of a zzso volume zzso without the need for multiple radio frequency transmit zzso
