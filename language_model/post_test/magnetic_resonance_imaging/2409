The major attraction of zzso zzso imaging is reduced acquisition time; however, careful review of the literature reveals many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bright fat zzso reduced magnetic zzso and increased motion zzso Our aim was a zzso blinded comparison of zzso and conventional spin echo zzso in the cervical zzso Both sequences were performed in 43 patients (19 males and 24 zzso mean age 45 years, range zzso zzso zzso patients were studied at zzso T and 15 at zzso zzso Typical sequence parameters were: at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Time saved on the zzso was used to increase the zzso and the number of zzso Two zzso evaluated the images for pathology, zzso disc signal intensity, zzso zzso zzso and image zzso Ten patients had zzso zzso 2 (20 zzso were missed on zzso In 4 of 10 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso the degree of zzso was apparently exaggerated on zzso The mean degree of confidence for the zzso sequences was zzso and for the zzso zzso where 1 is zzso For cervical spine imaging, zzso should be preferred to zzso
