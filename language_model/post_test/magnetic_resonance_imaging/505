To compare the performance of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso versus conventional zzso in assessing acute inflammatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in patients with established and active zzso zzso using the zzso Research zzso of Canada zzso zzso zzso This study is zzso zzso zzso against the current zzso standard for assessing active inflammatory zzso of the zzso zzso in patients with zzso 

zzso zzso patients with clinically active disease zzso zzso zzso Disease zzso Index score zzso fulfilling the modified New York criteria were scanned by zzso and conventional zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso were scored independently in random order by 3 readers blinded to patient zzso Active inflammatory zzso of the zzso zzso were recorded on a Web-based zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso were used to compare scores for zzso and conventional zzso for each reader, whereas zzso correlation zzso zzso were used to compare zzso zzso 

The zzso correlation zzso between zzso and conventional zzso per zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The mean sum scores for conventional versus zzso zzso were statistically significantly higher for all 3 readers, although all patients showing inflammatory zzso on conventional zzso also demonstrated them on zzso zzso The zzso were zzso zzso and zzso for conventional zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso for the 3 possible reader zzso 

zzso and conventional zzso scores show a strong correlation and comparable reliability for the detection of inflammatory zzso of the zzso zzso
