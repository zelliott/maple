zzso pulmonary zzso zzso has deleterious effects on right zzso zzso function in repaired zzso of zzso zzso However, there are little data regarding right zzso zzso tract zzso zzso dysfunction in response to chronic zzso and on both RV and zzso volumes and zzso 

We zzso identified consecutive patients with zzso who were referred for magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso zzso detected on zzso between 2003 and zzso Patients had zzso and a zzso patch procedure zzso zzso 30, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso resulting from zzso pulmonary zzso treated with surgical or zzso zzso zzso zzso 30, zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso and the zzso groups were well matched for age at zzso age at repair surgery in zzso or initial zzso in zzso duration of exposure to zzso body surface area, heart rate, zzso zzso net forward pulmonary artery flow, and main and branch pulmonary artery zzso Severe zzso zzso were identified in both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso 37% zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso RV and zzso zzso volumes were similar for both zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso volume zzso 137 zzso 6 zzso vs 128 zzso 5 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso volume zzso 72 zzso 2 zzso vs 67 zzso 2 zzso P zzso zzso zzso RV mass was also similar between groups (95 zzso 5 g vs 81 zzso 6 zzso respectively, P zzso zzso However, zzso RV and zzso zzso volumes were consistently higher in zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso volume zzso 70 zzso 5 zzso vs 54 zzso 3 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso volume zzso 29 zzso 1 zzso vs 22 zzso 1 zzso P zzso zzso zzso These changes were reflected in lower zzso zzso function in patients with zzso when compared with zzso zzso ejection zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 59% zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso ejection zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 67 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso Although RV zzso plane zzso excursion was not significantly different between the groups zzso zzso zzso the RV zzso tract was considered zzso in only 50% of patients with zzso compared with zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso RV volumes and function were similar when only patients with zzso RV zzso tracts were zzso 

RV zzso tract patch dysfunction in repaired zzso is responsible for higher zzso volumes and thus lower global measures of zzso zzso zzso These findings were not evident in cases of zzso treated with zzso with comparable amount of zzso These observations highlight the importance of the initial repair surgery in zzso for late zzso
