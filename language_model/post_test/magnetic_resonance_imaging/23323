zzso is a leading cause of death zzso zzso are key components of vascular zzso which contributes to the development and complications of zzso zzso an iron storage and transport zzso has been found to accumulate in zzso in human zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso could serve as an intrinsic zzso to target delivery of imaging agents to vascular zzso to detect high-risk zzso zzso Here we show that engineered human zzso protein zzso either zzso to the fluorescent zzso zzso or zzso a zzso zzso are taken up in zzso by zzso in zzso zzso carotid arteries and can be zzso by zzso and magnetic resonance zzso These results indicate that human zzso can serve as a zzso platform to image vascular inflammation in zzso
