Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso Parkinson's disease zzso patients have particular difficulty in producing zzso in a word generation zzso Two alternative explanations for this deficit have been zzso the zzso theory zzso as action zzso and the zzso theory zzso as zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso theory by exploring the zzso zzso of zzso word zzso 

zzso functional magnetic resonance with a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to explore brain activity during two overt oral language tasks, zzso object naming zzso and generation of zzso zzso in 14 zzso zzso patients using a common set of object zzso The objects used were either man-made objects zzso or zzso biological objects zzso zzso and tasks were zzso across zzso zzso data were analyzed using zzso 

zzso times in zzso were significantly longer than in the other three conditions zzso zzso zzso The distribution of brain activities associated with each condition resembled that reported in previous studies on healthy subjects using similar zzso a comparison between zzso and ON revealed slight differences located above all in the zzso and prefrontal zzso particularly as regards zzso Furthermore, we found positive correlations between the severity of the motor deficit (as assessed by the zzso Parkinson's Disease zzso zzso - zzso zzso and brain activity, particularly during zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso left frontal zzso left supplementary motor area zzso and right superior zzso zzso 

The direct comparison in our study of brain activity during the production of zzso and of object names did not reveal any major zzso However, our results point to a relationship between motor system dysfunction in zzso and the extent of zzso in verb generation, a task which implies in-depth processing of semantic representation of zzso
