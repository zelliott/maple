To assess the MR imaging zzso presenting symptoms, age and nerve distribution of zzso zzso 

A computer search was performed of the term zzso zzso through the musculoskeletal section MR imaging results at our institution from June 7, 1996 to January 21, 1998 followed by a search of the terms zzso zzso median zzso surrounding fat, increased fatty zzso zzso and zzso MR images and medical files were zzso reviewed by two experienced musculoskeletal zzso for imaging zzso nerve and age distribution as well as for history of zzso In addition three consultation cases from outside institutions were added for determination of image zzso 

Ten zzso zzso were zzso eight in the median zzso one in the zzso nerve and one in the zzso zzso Mean age was zzso years zzso zzso years, zzso 21 zzso Imaging characteristics were zzso zzso structures representing thickened nerve zzso surrounded by evenly distributed fat, high signal intensity on zzso sequences and low signal intensity on zzso zzso The amount of fat zzso however, distribution in eight cases zzso was predominantly between nerve fibers rather than surrounding them zzso All had a zzso appearance on zzso planes and a zzso appearance on zzso planes that was not seen in any other type of median nerve zzso zzso during the study zzso 

The MR imaging characteristics of zzso zzso are zzso obviating the need for biopsy for zzso
