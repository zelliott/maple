zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is useful in staging zzso and cervical zzso but there are no data on its contribution to assessing deep zzso We evaluated the contribution of this zzso technique to diagnosis of zzso ligament zzso zzso 

In this retrospective study, two zzso who were blinded to the surgical and zzso results, compared the results from conventional zzso and zzso zzso with those from conventional plus zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso zzso in 100 symptomatic zzso zzso statistical analyses including sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values, accuracy and positive and negative likelihood ratios were zzso Kappa for zzso agreement was zzso 

Conventional MR images for the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso and zzso sensitivities of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso for senior and junior readers, zzso The combination of conventional and zzso zzso zzso MR images revealed zzso of zzso and zzso sensitivities of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso for senior and junior readers, zzso When conventional zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared with conventional zzso use only, significant differences in diagnostic zzso were observed for right zzso zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging can improve the success of conventional zzso for assessment of zzso zzso Further prospective studies are required before this new MR protocol is performed routinely for suspected pelvic zzso
