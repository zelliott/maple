Chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso zzso has been shown capable of detecting dilute zzso zzso and abnormal tissue zzso zzso and thus, may serve as a complementary imaging technique to the conventional zzso zzso zzso imaging, however, is also dependent on experimental parameters such as the power, zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso As a result, its sensitivity and specificity for zzso properties such as pH is not zzso In this study, the dependence of zzso contrast on experimental parameters was solved and an zzso compensation zzso was proposed that zzso the zzso measured zzso contrast from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposed zzso was verified with both zzso simulation and experimental zzso from a zzso pH zzso and showed that pH derived from the compensated zzso imaging agrees reasonably well with zzso zzso within zzso pH zzso In sum, our study zzso the use of a correction zzso to compensate zzso imaging from zzso zzso zzso effects for accurate zzso of the chemical exchange rate, and demonstrates the feasibility of pH imaging with zzso zzso
