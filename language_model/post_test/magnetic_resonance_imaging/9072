This study was performed to evaluate the structural and functional cardiac changes in pediatric high altitude pulmonary hypertension zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso Ten patients with infantile zzso zzso 12 to 24 zzso and eight healthy zzso children zzso zzso underwent zzso and Echo zzso All participants were born and living in the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The studies were performed at the Children's Hospital located in zzso zzso zzso zzso The right and left zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso wall thicknesses were calculated directly from the zzso zzso The mean pulmonary zzso pressure zzso was measured using zzso zzso was significantly higher in the zzso group than in the control group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in the zzso patients when compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Mean zzso in the zzso group was significantly higher than in the control group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and was positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Right zzso ejection fraction was significantly lower in the zzso group when compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso however, left zzso ejection fraction was similar in both zzso These results indicate that zzso infantile zzso leads to right zzso zzso in these zzso These structural cardiac changes may lead to right zzso dysfunction and right heart zzso however, left zzso function is zzso
