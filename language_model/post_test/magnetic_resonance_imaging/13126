Little is known about how the human brain processes multiple relevant information zzso competing for zzso The present study aimed at specifying the interaction of the lateral prefrontal zzso zzso with zzso sensory brain regions during concurrent stimulus processing of two relevant stimuli zzso zzso in a classical zzso zzso In detail, we tested whether zzso processing is independent of the task relevance of zzso as has been zzso in cognitive theories on zzso zzso Using functional zzso zzso Imaging, we tested two neural mechanisms that might reflect effects of zzso relevance on zzso processing at different zzso zzso The results indicate that: zzso activity zzso in zzso regions in the inferior zzso zzso were similarly affected by the zzso overlap between the two stimuli when zzso was relevant or irrelevant and zzso only when zzso was relevant in the dual task, significant increases in the functional zzso between zzso regions and zzso regions in the zzso zzso were present at high zzso zzso No similar effects were found for zzso zzso These findings suggest that concurrent stimulus processing in dual tasks is zzso by transient changes in functional zzso for stimuli with relatively higher priority zzso
