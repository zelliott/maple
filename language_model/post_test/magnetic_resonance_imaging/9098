Fraternal twin studies on normal subjects have demonstrated low zzso zzso correlation zzso estimates for frontal brain regions zzso zzso zzso Here we aimed to investigate the zzso estimates of the frontal brain regions in fraternal subjects zzso for zzso syndrome zzso We sought to identify regional brain similarities between siblings zzso for zzso as an exploratory step towards the identification of potential brain structures involved in the zzso zzso The identified brain structures may then serve in subsequent molecular genetic and linkage zzso In addition, we zzso cortical thickness and zzso clinical severity scores to assess the relation between zzso clinical symptoms and cortical zzso Sixteen sibling pairs zzso for zzso were scanned using a zzso T magnetic resonance imaging scanner (age range zzso mean zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso was assessed using the fully automated zzso pipeline at the Montreal Neurological zzso zzso was assessed using the Children's zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Yale Global zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We report high zzso estimates for fraternal siblings zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso in the middle zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed significant negative correlations in the right zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the left zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso Since previous findings have concluded that normal fraternal siblings are less alike in frontal zzso the present findings may be attributed to zzso We speculate that the high zzso between siblings and the negative correlation between zzso symptoms severity and cortical thickness zzso are related to the disturbances in the maturation of the zzso cortical neural system that mediate zzso zzso Such delayed maturation may consequently contribute to the development of zzso by releasing motor and vocal tics from regulatory zzso These findings may have important genetic zzso
