Human memory systems contain zzso mechanisms for evaluating their zzso People can change their learning strategy on the basis of confidence in their performance at that zzso However, it has not been fully understood how the brain is engaged in reliable rating of confidence in past recognition memory zzso We measured the brain activity by zzso while healthy subjects performed a visual short-term recognition memory test and then rated their confidence in their answers as high, middle, or zzso As shown zzso their behavioral performance in the confidence rating widely zzso some showed a positive zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso while others did zzso Among brain regions showing greater activity during rating their confidence relative to during a control, zzso task zzso brightness of zzso only a zzso part of the right zzso zzso exhibited higher activity as the confidence level better correlated with actual recognition memory zzso These results suggest that zzso in the right zzso zzso is key to a reliable, retrospective rating of confidence in short-term recognition memory zzso
