To develop a zzso zzso framework to analyze the dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso data for assessment of response of brain zzso to radiation zzso 

Twenty patients with 45 zzso brain zzso had zzso scans prior to whole brain radiation therapy zzso and at the end of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso images covering the whole brain were acquired on a zzso scanner with approximately 5 s zzso resolution and a total scan time of about 3 zzso zzso zzso from all zzso of the 45 brain zzso were zzso and then temporally zzso A zzso zzso that is constructed from the aligned zzso zzso of all zzso of the 45 zzso obtained prior to zzso is processed by principal component analysis to generate the principal components zzso Then, the projection zzso maps prior to and at the end of zzso are created for each zzso Next, a pattern recognition technique, based upon zzso zzso is used to delineate the tumor zzso relating to the value of the significant projection zzso The relationship between changes in different tumor zzso and treatment response was evaluated to differentiate responsive from stable and progressive zzso Performance of the zzso tumor zzso was also evaluated by receiver operating characteristic zzso analysis in prediction of zzso zzso and compared with zzso tumor zzso 

The projection zzso maps of the first three PCs contain almost all zzso information in zzso zzso of brain zzso The first projection zzso related to the area under zzso curves, is the major component to determine response while the third one has a complimentary zzso In zzso analysis, the area under curve of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were achieved for the zzso and zzso tumor zzso in response zzso 

The zzso zzso of a brain zzso could predict tumor response to therapy similar to the zzso one, while the former is determined more rapidly for clinical decision-making zzso
