To determine whether zzso transfer imaging can improve visibility of contrast enhancement of multiple sclerosis zzso 

zzso enhancing and 63 zzso zzso in 10 patients with multiple sclerosis were evaluated to calculate zzso ratios on conventional zzso and zzso zzso transfer zzso The signal intensity of the zzso and the background zzso zzso were measured on zzso zzso and zzso zzso transfer images zzso zzso zzso zzso and on zzso zzso and zzso zzso transfer zzso Mean zzso ratios was calculated for all zzso 

The zzso ratio was significantly higher for enhancing and zzso zzso on zzso zzso transfer images than on conventional zzso zzso For enhancing zzso the zzso ratio was significantly higher on zzso zzso zzso transfer images, 32 zzso 2 compared with 21 zzso 2 on conventional zzso zzso Fifty of the 59 enhancing zzso were seen on both the zzso and the zzso zzso transfer zzso Nine enhancing zzso were seen only on the zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso In addition, of 63 zzso zzso seen on zzso zzso and zzso zzso transfer images, 16 were not seen on the conventional zzso zzso Seven of the 63 zzso zzso and 7 of the 59 enhancing zzso had high signal intensity on the zzso zzso zzso transfer images suggestive of zzso zzso a finding not seen on the conventional zzso zzso zzso 

zzso transfer improves the visibility of enhancing multiple sclerosis zzso because they have a higher zzso ratio than conventional zzso zzso zzso High signal intensity on both zzso and enhancing zzso noted only on zzso zzso zzso transfer suggests a zzso signal was zzso If zzso transfer is used in multiple sclerosis patients, a zzso zzso transfer image is zzso
