To characterize and compare zzso zzso and liver zzso of zzso zzso cancer zzso by means of quantitative liver zzso zzso 

Liver zzso was assessed in 26 zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso Six zzso zzso zzso index zzso mean transit time zzso distribution volume zzso total blood flow zzso zzso blood flow zzso and portal blood flow zzso calculated in tumor zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso 

The values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher in the zzso than in the zzso group, whereas zzso was significantly higher in the zzso zzso There was no significant difference in zzso zzso blood flow was higher than portal blood flow in the zzso group, while portal blood flow was slightly higher than zzso blood flow in the zzso zzso 

The present work describes the use of dynamic zzso to zzso assess liver zzso which in the future may help studying liver zzso on the basis of their zzso zzso
