zzso cortical zzso zzso is a common cause of zzso human zzso zzso has frequently been discussed as a zzso zzso of zzso sclerosis complex zzso because of the zzso and zzso resemblance of zzso areas to zzso in zzso zzso or a zzso predisposition in terms of increased zzso in the zzso genes have been presumed to influence the zzso of zzso A detailed zzso analysis of these patients has not been performed so zzso 

In this study, 33 patients with zzso (among them 23 with zzso type 2 and 4 patients with zzso zzso were investigated zzso clinically as to zzso manifestations, retinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso genetically by considering zzso brain tissue and blood using single strand zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of the zzso and zzso zzso 

In the clinical zzso no subtle features of zzso could be detected in this large group of patients with zzso pointing to the fact that this is a different patient group without clinical zzso Several sequence zzso were found in the zzso and zzso genes in both zzso brain tissue and blood of zzso patients, however, in similar zzso to that of the normal zzso Moreover, most of these sequence zzso were zzso 

This study shows that zzso zzso zzso not caused by zzso in the zzso genes and seems not to be promoted by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot be regarded as a zzso zzso of zzso
