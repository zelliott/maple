zzso radio frequency zzso sequences composed of a train of short zzso zzso of the same kind were zzso in order to obtain selective zzso of zzso with short zzso relaxation times for zzso transfer zzso It is demonstrated that the sequences regarded allow a good adaptation to different requirements for zzso transfer examinations on zzso zzso The sequences presented here provide relatively strong zzso of zzso with very short zzso relaxation times zzso approximately less than 50 zzso whereas signals from zzso with long zzso to be recorded are hardly influenced in a broad frequency zzso The sequences are especially advantageous for applications in pulse files with limited numbers of support zzso
