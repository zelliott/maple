Recent studies of sprinters and distance runners have suggested that variations in human foot proportions and zzso muscle moment arm zzso to the level of sprint performance or running zzso Less clear, however, is whether differences in muscle moment arm are zzso by altered zzso paths or by variation in the zzso of ankle joint zzso Previous zzso of these differences have relied upon assumed joint zzso and zzso of bone geometry made zzso such that they would be affected by the thickness of the zzso soft zzso Using magnetic resonance imaging, we found that trained sprinters have shorter zzso moment arms zzso zzso zzso and longer zzso bones zzso zzso zzso than zzso The shorter moment arms of sprinters are attributable to differences in the location of the zzso of rotation zzso zzso zzso rather than to differences in the path of the Achilles zzso A simple computer model suggests that increasing the ratio of zzso to zzso length permits more zzso muscle work during zzso that occurs at rates expected during the acceleration phase following the sprint zzso
