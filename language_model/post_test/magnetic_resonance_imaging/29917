The surgical removal of a zzso zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso in an en bloc package zzso the risk of local recurrence due to residual zzso zzso awareness of good surgical techniques has created much interest in the anatomy involved in total zzso zzso surgery, with particular focus on the zzso planes and nerve zzso and their relationship to the surgical planes of zzso Clear zzso depiction of these relationships is of value in determining tumor zzso The aim of this study was to describe the zzso appearance of these zzso zzso zzso AND zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed using a zzso system in zzso sections and in patients before they underwent total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were compared with zzso obtained in zzso to establish criteria for zzso of the structures relevant to anterior zzso of the zzso 

zzso zzso depicted a number of structures of importance in total zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which forms the boundary of the surgical zzso plane in total zzso zzso was identified, and the zzso zzso zzso reflection, and zzso zzso were also zzso zzso 1-2 zzso in diameter were zzso because the contrast resolution afforded by zzso fast zzso imaging permitted depiction of the inferior zzso nerve zzso and the zzso planes within the zzso zzso 

zzso landmarks important to the performance of zzso cancer surgery, in particular the zzso zzso may be defined on zzso and are of potential importance in the staging of tumors, assessing zzso planning surgery, and selecting patients for zzso zzso zzso
