To assess the mechanisms underlying the inappropriately low plasma zzso levels reported in septic zzso 

Prospective case zzso 

A zzso general medical intensive care unit at a university zzso 

zzso shock zzso 

In three consecutive patients with septic zzso plasma zzso levels, circulating zzso activity, zzso sensitivity, and zzso zzso content were zzso Plasma zzso concentration was unexpectedly within normal range in two patients zzso zzso and zzso zzso and increased in one (16 zzso In all cases, zzso activity was zzso zzso sensitivity was zzso and the high signal intensity of the zzso lobe of the zzso zzso on zzso magnetic resonance images was zzso zzso resonance imaging and plasma zzso levels zzso after recovery from shock in the patient who zzso 

These data suggest that in septic zzso inappropriately low plasma levels of zzso are at least partly related to a depletion of zzso stores in the zzso
