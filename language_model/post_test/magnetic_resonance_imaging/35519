To clarify the imaging characteristics of zzso which are the most common zzso mixed zzso and zzso tumors zzso of the zzso 

We zzso reviewed MR findings of 17 zzso confirmed cases with zzso including the size, growth pattern, signal intensity, contrast enhancement, and zzso spread in each zzso 

The maximum tumor diameter was zzso zzso zzso 88 zzso Nine cases zzso showed zzso with a stalk and eight cases zzso showed broad-based zzso zzso None of them showed invasive zzso Fourteen cases zzso were zzso and three cases zzso were zzso to zzso on zzso images zzso An extremely high intensity area suggesting zzso zzso was seen in only two zzso In 15 cases zzso more than half of the tumor showed higher signal intensity than the outer zzso on zzso Eight of the 16 cases zzso had an zzso area, whereas 13 cases zzso had a strongly enhanced zzso zzso extension was observed in only two cases zzso at initial zzso 

zzso zzso reveal a spectrum of imaging findings with a high signal on zzso with a prolonged intense enhancement being the most common imaging zzso
