We propose and validate the hypothesis that we can use differential shape properties of the zzso surfaces to recover dense field motion from standard three-dimensional zzso image sequences zzso and zzso zzso measures of left zzso regional function can be further zzso from the point correspondence zzso The zzso zzso results are validated on two zzso First, the motion zzso are compared to those of implanted zzso markers of a canine model in two imaging zzso where zzso accuracy is zzso Second, the zzso of using motion parameters zzso length and thickness zzso for detecting zzso injury area is tested by comparing zzso derived results to zzso analysis zzso zzso of zzso zzso where the achieved zzso zzso correlation value is zzso
