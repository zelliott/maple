Our aim was to perform zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the shoulder as a zzso examination and to evaluate its value on the basis of zzso as a gold zzso 

Fifteen men and 16 women with planned zzso for chronic zzso or traumatic tear of the rotator cuff zzso zzso zzso zzso or traumatic zzso instability zzso traumatic tear of the rotator cuff with zzso instability zzso or zzso zzso zzso underwent plain zzso CT in neutral position and zzso zzso injection of a mixture of zzso and zzso contrast agents zzso at zzso and zzso 350 at zzso in 20 zzso of saline zzso CT zzso scans in zzso and zzso and zzso zzso scans in the neutral position were zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated separately and jointly zzso in different blinded sessions, giving a 0-3 score to the agreement of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso 

The injected volume of the solution ranged from 10 to 24 zzso No side effects were zzso zzso obtained a score of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso differences were found for zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was no significant difference for zzso versus zzso 

zzso and zzso can be performed as a zzso zzso zzso seems to give more information than zzso or zzso zzso
