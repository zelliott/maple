Complex regional pain syndrome zzso in zzso patients is clinically distinct from the adult condition in which there is often complete resolution of its signs and symptoms within several months to a few zzso The ability to compare the symptomatic and zzso condition in the same individuals makes this population interesting for the investigation of mechanisms underlying pain and other symptoms of zzso We used zzso to evaluate zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso zzso with zzso affecting the lower zzso Each patient underwent two scanning zzso once during an active period of pain zzso and once after symptomatic recovery zzso In each session, mechanical zzso and zzso zzso stimuli were applied to the affected region of the involved limb and the corresponding mirror region of the unaffected zzso Two fundamental zzso analyses were zzso zzso zzso analysis for zzso state and zzso state for brush and cold for the affected and unaffected limbs in each zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis for zzso in affected and unaffected limbs in zzso or zzso zzso We zzso zzso in the zzso state, stimuli that evoked mechanical or cold zzso produced patterns of zzso zzso similar to those reported in adult zzso zzso in the zzso state, stimuli that evoked mechanical or cold zzso produced significant decreases in zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso of zzso pain zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in regions such as the zzso zzso and zzso lobe may explain some zzso symptoms in zzso including movement disorders and zzso zzso in the zzso state, significant zzso differences persisted despite nearly complete elimination of evoked zzso zzso although zzso stimuli to the unaffected limb were perceived as equivalent in zzso and zzso states, the same stimulus produced different patterns of zzso in the two states, suggesting that the zzso zzso responds differently to normal stimuli applied to unaffected zzso Our results suggest significant changes in zzso zzso in patients with zzso
