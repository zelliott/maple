To compare an zzso water selective balanced zzso free zzso sequence zzso with conventional magnetic resonance zzso sequences in imaging cartilage of zzso zzso 

Flip angles of zzso and zzso zzso sequences were zzso in three zzso zzso the knees of 10 patients with generalized zzso were zzso using zzso and zzso zzso and conventional MR imaging zzso We calculated zzso ratios zzso between cartilage and its surrounding zzso to zzso analyze the various zzso Using dedicated software we zzso in two other patients, the accuracy of cartilage volume zzso with zzso sections of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso efficiency between cartilage and its surrounding zzso using zzso was zzso with a zzso degrees flip zzso zzso zzso was higher in zzso than in conventional zzso zzso times higher compared to zzso zzso echo zzso images, zzso compared to zzso zzso fast spin echo zzso images, and zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso The mean difference of cartilage volume measurement on zzso and zzso sections was zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso 

A zzso sequence is superior to conventional MR imaging sequences in imaging cartilage of the knee in patients with zzso
