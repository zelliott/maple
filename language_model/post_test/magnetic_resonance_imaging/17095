The zzso zzso of metal zzso magnetic zzso has attracted attention for biological applications because of the high zzso of the zzso zzso However, most of the synthetic methods have limitations in terms of zzso and economics because of the demanding synthetic conditions and low zzso Here, we show that well controlled zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by a zzso method, simply by mixing zzso with zzso as a carbon zzso Various zzso metal ratios were used to determine the compositional dependence of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso electron zzso indicated that the particle sizes were 7 zzso In order to test the capability of zzso zzso zzso as magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agents, these zzso were zzso in water by the zzso physical zzso of sodium zzso zzso
