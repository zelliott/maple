Although zzso motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease zzso are attributed to dysfunction of zzso zzso early clinical zzso features are more likely to be associated with other zzso zzso We enrolled 52 zzso zzso zzso patients and 52 zzso and zzso healthy controls and used zzso functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate zzso of the functional brain network in zzso focusing in particular on the functional connectivity of the zzso zzso Relative to healthy controls, the zzso patient group showed reduced functional connectivity in zzso and zzso zzso Although the deceased functional connectivity within cortical zzso areas was only evident in the most affected zzso zzso reduced functional connectivity with zzso regions was prevalent throughout the zzso No increased functional connectivity was found in this zzso By studying a cohort of zzso zzso zzso patients, we ruled out the potential zzso effect of prolonged zzso medication use on the functional integration of neural zzso We demonstrate decreased functional integration across neural networks involving zzso zzso cortex, and zzso regions in these patients and zzso that the prevalent zzso in zzso zzso is associated with some early clinical zzso features in zzso This study offers additional insight into the early functional integration of neural networks in zzso
