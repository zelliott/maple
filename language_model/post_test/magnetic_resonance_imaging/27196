Diagnosis of transplant rejection requires tissue biopsy and zzso zzso Here, we describe a new zzso F zzso approach for zzso zzso of organ rejection via the zzso host zzso For this, we employed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso known to be zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso from zzso or zzso from zzso mice were zzso transplanted into zzso zzso zzso were applied zzso followed by zzso zzso F zzso at zzso T 24 h after zzso zzso H images showed a similar position and anatomy of the graft in the abdomen for both zzso However, corresponding zzso F signals were only observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso enabled us to detect the initial immune response not later than 3 days after surgery, when conventional parameters did not reveal any signs of zzso In zzso the observed zzso F signal strongly increased with time and correlated with the extent of zzso In separate experiments, zzso was used to demonstrate the ability of zzso F zzso to monitor zzso zzso Thus, zzso can serve as positive contrast agent for the early detection of transplant rejection by zzso F zzso with high spatial resolution and an excellent degree of specificity due to lack of any zzso F zzso
