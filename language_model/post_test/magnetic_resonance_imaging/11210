The purpose of this pilot study was to examine possible zzso effects of prenatal methamphetamine zzso exposure on the developing brain and on zzso zzso children zzso and zzso control subjects zzso were evaluated with zzso Global brain volumes and regional brain structures were zzso Ten zzso and nine zzso children also completed zzso zzso zzso children scored lower on measures of visual motor integration, attention, verbal memory and long-term spatial zzso There were no differences among the groups in motor skills, short delay spatial memory or measures of zzso zzso Despite comparable whole brain volumes in each group, the zzso children had smaller zzso zzso zzso smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso right: zzso smaller zzso volumes zzso zzso right: zzso and a trend for a smaller zzso zzso zzso The reduction in these brain structures correlated with poorer performance on sustained attention and delayed verbal zzso No group differences in volumes were noted in the thalamus, zzso or the zzso In zzso compared with the control group, children exposed to zzso zzso exhibit smaller zzso volumes and associated zzso zzso These preliminary findings suggest prenatal zzso exposure may be zzso to the developing zzso
