We describe magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso findings in a patient with chronic progressive radiation zzso zzso An 81-year-old man with zzso cancer underwent zzso Four years later he developed a progressive neurological deficit below the zzso level of the spinal zzso Neurological examination revealed zzso zzso zzso findings showed an area of high signal intensity on zzso images of the zzso spinal zzso On the basis of clinical and zzso findings, we diagnosed his condition as zzso zzso performed thirteen months after onset of neurological signs revealed mild zzso of the spinal zzso detected on zzso images and an area of high signal intensity within the spinal zzso detected on zzso zzso zzso examination revealed findings consistent with radiation zzso We speculate that the area of high signal intensity within the spinal zzso detected on zzso images might be a result of proliferation of small vessels, which was discovered upon zzso
