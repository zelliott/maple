This study used zzso to record zzso activity in a group of 17 patients with chronic zzso Two methods, residual zzso and residual zzso were used to bring about transient changes in spontaneous zzso intensity in order to measure dynamic zzso zzso in individual zzso In residual zzso a positive correlation was seen between zzso intensity and both zzso zzso zzso and gamma band zzso zzso zzso in auditory cortex, suggesting an increased zzso input and cortical gamma response, respectively, associated with higher zzso zzso zzso zzso patients exhibiting residual zzso demonstrated an inverse correlation between perceived zzso intensity and auditory zzso gamma zzso (with no zzso zzso that cannot be explained by existing zzso zzso zzso power changes were also identified in a variety of cortical regions, most commonly zzso zzso regions in the default mode network, zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso These were highly variable across patients in terms of areas and frequency bands involved, and in direction of power zzso We suggest a model based on a local circuit function of cortical zzso zzso as a process of mutual zzso that might suppress abnormal cortical activity in zzso The work implicates auditory zzso zzso zzso as a fundamental intrinsic mechanism for attenuating phantom auditory zzso
