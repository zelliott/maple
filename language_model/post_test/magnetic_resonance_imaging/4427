We assessed the anatomical findings and auditory comprehension of six patients with zzso motor zzso due to medical zzso of the left frontal zzso All patients were right-handed and were initially mute for several hours after the zzso and they exhibited mild zzso of the right lower zzso Their spontaneous speech was sparse and not zzso and sometimes accompanied by zzso but their articulation was normal and repetition was zzso They had difficulty in recalling zzso A diagnosis of zzso motor zzso was made on the basis of their clinical zzso All patients were found to have an zzso in the left zzso frontal region by zzso and/or zzso We administered the Western zzso Battery and 50 line drawing pointing task in order to evaluate auditory zzso Based on the results we concluded that there is no impairment of auditory comprehension of single words when zzso are limited to the superior frontal zzso but that zzso extending to the middle frontal zzso interfere with auditory comprehension of single zzso Our observations indicate that the middle frontal zzso plays an important role in auditory comprehension of single zzso All of the patients displayed impaired auditory comprehension of sentences even when their zzso were strictly limited to the zzso frontal zzso This suggests that the zzso frontal lobe plays some role in the auditory comprehension of zzso
