To correlate findings in neurological examination, zzso nervous system function, and brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with chronic zzso zzso 

Neurological findings of 64 patients from a hospital cohort were correlated with disease stage zzso to Los zzso zzso and with signs of zzso nervous system function zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, 27 subjects with no cardiac dysfunction zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso were correlated with zzso nervous system variables using zzso correlation zzso and zzso zzso 

There was a significant correlation between the presence and number of white matter zzso in zzso and the respiratory zzso zzso zzso There was no correlation between disease stage and zzso nervous system zzso 

There is a significant correlation between zzso nervous system dysfunction and the presence of white matter zzso in patients with chronic zzso disease without cardiac zzso The zzso of such zzso is unknown, but cardiac zzso could be zzso As hypertension was frequent in our sample and also correlated to zzso zzso studies excluding zzso patients are needed to confirm our zzso
