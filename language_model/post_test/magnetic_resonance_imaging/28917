zzso of our study was to zzso the dose, scan delay and sequences for use in MR studies with an oral contrast agent zzso zzso Milan, zzso to obtain positive or negative contrast enhancement in the zzso zzso 

In zzso 10 zzso zzso with increasing zzso zzso zzso of the agent, containing 200 zzso zzso ammonium zzso were studied with a zzso T magnet zzso zzso The zzso by acquiring zzso STIR and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Signal intensity was compared by using a zzso In zzso 16 volunteers were examined with the same sequences at 20 minutes and 2 hours after the oral administration of zzso g of the product diluted in 600 zzso zzso Images were analyzed by two zzso and scored on a 4-point scale based on signal zzso results were compared with zzso zzso 

In zzso MR signal was always zzso on zzso images, as well as on zzso zzso and zzso images at zzso lower than 45 zzso zzso signal was seen on zzso zzso and zzso images at higher zzso and on STIR sequences at zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso exhibited positive enhancement on zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso images 20 minutes after contrast agent administration at zzso lower than 45 zzso At 2 hours, zzso zzso were zzso on zzso zzso and zzso images at zzso zzso zzso STIR images showed zzso zzso zzso at both 20 minutes and 2 hours after zzso zzso contrast agent zzso zzso analysis showed a statistically significant superiority zzso zzso zzso of zzso STIR images in providing negative zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso ammonium zzso being a positive or negative contrast agent according to its zzso permits to tailor the dose to zzso zzso zzso zzso
