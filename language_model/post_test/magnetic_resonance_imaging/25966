After surgical zzso of a brain tumor or infection of the zzso fluid zzso elevated levels of blood zzso or protein zzso are seen in the patient's zzso zzso In fast zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso signal is zzso by an appropriate choice of the inversion recovery time zzso to improve the contrast between tissue structures adjacent to zzso zzso With contaminated zzso however, the zzso relaxation time zzso may change significantly, which results in an incomplete suppression in the zzso images, if standard inversion times are zzso In this work, a fast zzso zzso measurement pulse sequence with integrated zzso calculation that allows determination the optimal zzso value in 15 zzso is zzso The method was tested in five patients after surgical zzso of a brain zzso where zzso zzso with and without contrast agent was performed to identify remaining tumor fragments at the margin of the zzso zzso
