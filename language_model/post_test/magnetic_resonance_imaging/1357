We propose two expression forms of zzso zzso sequence magnetic resonance images using the imaging parameters of recovery time zzso echo zzso zzso echo number zzso from 1 to N zzso of zzso An echo image can be expressed as a form of zzso zzso zzso and the other image zzso by summing consecutive echo images numbered from zzso to zzso zzso less than or equal to zzso less than zzso less than or equal to N) as a form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images are weighted by zzso zzso or zzso density and show the better zzso representation and contrast resolution of brain tumor zzso The difference of signal zzso among the zzso is enhanced on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images with the increased zzso zzso The calculated zzso images are also zzso These forms zzso the scanning conditions and image characteristics and make easy to be compared with the spin echo zzso
