The zzso process for boiled and frozen edible vegetables was traced by a dedicated zzso for food zzso The zzso system is small, with a zzso zzso magnetic field, and can be placed in an ordinary research room with a light air zzso Images of green zzso broad beans, zzso asparagus and zzso were measured by the zzso method zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso s and 1 s repetition zzso The images appeared along with the zzso time, and signals zzso covered the sliced plane of the samples in the thawed zzso Information about the zzso process and tissue structures of the materials was obtained during transit zzso zzso The zzso zzso were examined with increased signal intensity, which were divided into two zzso The signal increased zzso and saturated for zzso and asparagus but exhibited convex zzso for zzso broad beans and zzso The small zzso was stable, its handling was simple, and the internal structures of food materials could be accurately identified, although the zzso of the images was insufficient for determining precise textural fluctuations of tissue zzso We conclude that the devised zzso is useful for examining the quality of frozen foods and for zzso research into frozen zzso
