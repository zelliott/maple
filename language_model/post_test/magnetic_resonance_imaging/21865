To determine whether Parkinson's disease and multiple system zzso each has a distinct pattern of zzso abnormalities and whether a zzso evaluation could be useful in the differential diagnosis between the two zzso 

Sixty two patients (30 with Parkinson's disease and 32 with multiple system zzso underwent a complete zzso evaluation and zzso zzso 

Of the zzso patients zzso had normal zzso findings with normal zzso zzso zzso had delayed or incomplete pelvic floor zzso zzso had zzso with zzso zzso and zzso had zzso with zzso zzso associated with incomplete pelvic floor zzso zzso patients with a normal zzso pattern had significantly less severe disease and a shorter duration of disease in years than those who had abnormal zzso Patients with zzso had significantly higher severity of zzso All the patients with multiple system zzso had zzso with zzso Two zzso patterns were zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and incomplete pelvic floor relaxation (in zzso zzso with zzso correlated neither with the severity nor with the duration of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that all the zzso patients had normal zzso zzso whereas 24 of the 32 patients with multiple system zzso had zzso zzso 

zzso evaluation and zzso zzso are both useful tests in the differential diagnosis between Parkinson's disease and multiple system zzso zzso findings may be abnormal before patients with multiple system zzso reach an advanced stage of the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso muscles become abnormal as the disease zzso in multiple system zzso but not in Parkinson's zzso
