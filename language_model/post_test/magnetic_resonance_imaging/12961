zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of cortical thickness and volume have shown age effects on large areas, but there are substantial discrepancies across studies regarding the zzso and magnitude of zzso These discrepancies hinder understanding of effects of aging on brain zzso and limit the potential usefulness of MR in research on healthy and pathological age-related brain zzso The present study was undertaken to overcome this problem by assessing the consistency of age effects on cortical thickness across 6 different samples with a total of zzso zzso A zzso zzso procedure zzso was used to calculate cortical thickness continuously across the brain zzso The results showed consistent age effects across samples in the superior, middle, and inferior frontal zzso superior and middle zzso zzso zzso inferior and superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The strongest effects were seen in the superior and inferior frontal zzso as well as superior parts of the zzso zzso The inferior zzso lobe and anterior zzso zzso were relatively less affected by zzso The results are discussed in relation to leading theories of cognitive zzso
