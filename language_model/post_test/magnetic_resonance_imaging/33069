The aim of this study was to evaluate pelvis and lower limb muscle zzso scans of 46 patients affected by Becker muscular zzso zzso subdivided according to disease severity, ranging from clinically zzso patients to patients who had lost zzso We found a distinct pattern on muscle imaging characterized by prominent involvement of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso biceps zzso long head, zzso and zzso This pattern was consistent in all the 25 symptomatic zzso zzso changes in the same muscles were found in 13 of the 21 zzso zzso The other 8 zzso patients had a normal zzso The severity of muscle involvement was significantly correlated with zzso Our results suggest that a distinct pattern of muscle involvement can be detected in zzso The early identification of muscle changes in a proportion of zzso patients may be useful as an additional tool in the diagnostic zzso
