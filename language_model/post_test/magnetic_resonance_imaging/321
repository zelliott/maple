To perform spinal zzso patients are usually placed in the lateral zzso position with the knees drawn up to the stomach, the legs fully zzso and the neck zzso to curve the back zzso Because the nerve roots of the zzso zzso have considerable mobility in the zzso space, the position of the zzso zzso in the lateral zzso position may be different from that in the zzso zzso However, the zzso position of the zzso zzso in the lateral zzso position with fully zzso legs has not been carefully zzso In the present study, we zzso measured the movement of the zzso zzso in the zzso space by changing positions, using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

After obtaining the approval of the hospital ethics committee and written informed zzso 12 healthy volunteers zzso 34 years zzso 10 zzso zzso 169 zzso zzso 9 zzso weight, 65 zzso zzso 10 zzso were studied with zzso and their positions were changed as zzso the zzso position, lateral zzso position without fully zzso legs, and lateral zzso position with fully zzso zzso The movement of the central point of the spinal zzso and zzso zzso by changing position was zzso 

The spinal zzso and zzso zzso were observed in the zzso side of the zzso space in each zzso The movement to the zzso side by changing position from the zzso to the lateral zzso position was significant zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The most obvious shift was observed at the zzso zzso zzso The fully zzso legs significantly moved the spinal zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso side of the zzso space and created a free space in the zzso zzso The movement to the zzso side by the fully zzso legs was significant zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The most obvious shift was observed at the zzso zzso zzso 

The present study using zzso showed zzso movement of the spinal zzso and zzso zzso due to changing zzso The most obvious movements by changing from zzso to lateral zzso position and fully zzso legs were observed at the zzso and zzso levels, zzso
