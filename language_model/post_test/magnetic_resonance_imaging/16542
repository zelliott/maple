zzso zzso zzso zzso are clinically and genetically zzso disorders associated with diverse neurological and zzso features that occur before the age of zzso Currently, zzso in more than 20 genes have been identified, but approximately half of the zzso patients remain genetically zzso In this report, we describe a Japanese family in which two siblings have slow progression of a type of zzso with zzso zzso Using zzso sequencing combined with zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso XIV zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso by a zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso was highly expressed in human fetal and adult brain tissue as well as in the mouse brain (especially in the zzso In an zzso zzso system, the zzso zzso showed zzso zzso different from that of the zzso An zzso analysis clearly showed that zzso is specifically localized to zzso cells of the zzso in humans and zzso zzso are associated with zzso of zzso zzso (including synaptic zzso indicating that the zzso of the zzso machinery by the zzso zzso may represent a distinct zzso associated with human neurodegenerative zzso
