The lateral prefrontal zzso is critical for the control and organization of information in working zzso In certain situations, effective reorganization can zzso task difficulty, suggesting a zzso between lateral prefrontal activity and basic memory zzso In a verbal working memory task, we investigated the enhancement of performance that occurs when incoming information can be reorganized into zzso groups or zzso In the zzso zzso volunteers heard and repeated a sequence of zzso zzso structured zzso encouraging zzso were compared with zzso random zzso Though structured sequences were easier to remember, zzso showed increased lateral prefrontal zzso for these zzso Specifically, both the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso were activated zzso for the structured sequences during zzso When visual stimuli that can be zzso using spatial structure are used, similar results are zzso These results demonstrate that cognitively less demanding tasks may elicit greater lateral prefrontal zzso Thus, the lateral prefrontal zzso appears to play a general role in zzso zzso information from memory, in order to zzso zzso
