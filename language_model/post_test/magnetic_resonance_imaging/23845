zzso transfer zzso imaging has been successfully applied to patients with multiple sclerosis zzso showing zzso zzso subtle changes in the zzso white matter, and a better correlation with zzso in comparison with conventional magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging is a fairly simple technique, which allows a quantitative analysis with high spatial resolution to delicate structures like the zzso nerve and spinal zzso In the spinal cord, zzso imaging can be applied as a contrast zzso zzso Using the zzso ratio zzso two studies have reported a mild, but zzso reduction in zzso ratio in the cervical spinal cord, compared with healthy zzso In one study, clinical disability correlated independently of zzso zzso with zzso which may relate to preliminary findings of a correlation between zzso loss and zzso in the spinal zzso In the zzso zzso two studies reported strongly decreased zzso in affected nerves, even in the absence of zzso on conventional zzso unaffected nerves showed values similar to white matter in the zzso In one study, zzso was significantly correlated with zzso zzso but not with zzso In conclusion, zzso imaging provides a quantifiable zzso that can be applied with high spatial resolution to delicate structures, such as the spinal zzso and the zzso zzso Further work is needed to correlate zzso zzso with pathology and, most importantly, with the functional zzso Such relationships being established, a quantitative technique such as zzso could be useful in monitoring disease progression in zzso
