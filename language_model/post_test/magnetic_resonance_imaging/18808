A new class of zzso zzso bearing negative surface charges is zzso These zzso zzso show a high affinity for the cell membrane and, as a consequence, are captured by cells with an efficiency three orders of magnitude higher than the widely used zzso iron oxide zzso The surface coating of zzso particle with zzso strongly reduces the non specific interactions with the plasma membrane as well as the overall cell zzso and at the same time restores the ability to induce specific interactions with targeted cells by the zzso on the particle surface of a specific zzso zzso of cellular particle zzso for different cell lines are zzso using two new complementary zzso zzso and zzso Spin zzso
