The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that, within a specific cortical unit, fractional changes in cerebral blood flow zzso and cerebral zzso rate of oxygen consumption zzso are coupled through an zzso relationship during zzso zzso This aim was achieved by simultaneously measuring relative changes in these quantities in human primary visual zzso zzso during graded stimulation with patterns designed to selectively activate different populations of zzso zzso zzso visual zzso was delineated individually in each subject by using zzso zzso zzso zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso in conjunction with blood zzso zzso and zzso zzso was used to monitor zzso and zzso The stimuli used included zzso diffuse zzso chromatic zzso zzso high zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso patterns containing both color and zzso contrast modulated at different zzso zzso zzso responses to each pattern were graded by varying zzso and/or color zzso zzso For all stimulus types, fractional changes in blood flow and oxygen zzso were found to be zzso coupled in a consistent ratio of approximately zzso The most potent stimulus produced zzso and zzso increases of 48 zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso respectively, with no evidence of a plateau for oxygen zzso zzso of zzso zzso yields from the observed zzso increases and comparison with the maximum possible zzso zzso contribution indicate that elevated energy demands during brain zzso are met largely through zzso zzso
