The purpose of this study was to compare zzso zzso MR imaging with zzso clearance of zzso for measuring normal zzso blood zzso A reliable technique for evaluation of zzso zzso would be useful for studying zzso vascular diseases and the effects of zzso zzso of zzso blood flow based on zzso clearance of zzso are limited in that the zzso are not studied zzso zzso resolution is poor, and normal zzso function is zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained simultaneously in 10 healthy adult volunteers, with the imaging planes oriented perpendicular to the left and right zzso arteries in order to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso was 150 zzso zzso of 10 zzso and 100 zzso zzso of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso images of the abdominal zzso above and below the origins of the zzso arteries were obtained in six zzso In these cases, zzso blood flow was determined by measuring the difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso For all volunteers, zzso clearance of zzso was determined immediately after MR zzso 

Renal blood flow zzso determined by using zzso zzso MR imaging were in close agreement with those determined by using clearance of zzso At a zzso zzso of 150 zzso the mean difference was 69 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to 169 zzso At a zzso zzso of 100 zzso the mean difference was 39 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to 177 zzso zzso flow zzso using zzso zzso MR imaging appeared to be less reliable for determining zzso blood flow than zzso in the individual zzso zzso with a mean difference of zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to 231 zzso compared with zzso blood flow determined by using clearance of zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso MR imaging is a promising technique for zzso measurement of zzso blood zzso zzso agreed closely with those obtained by using clearance of zzso In addition, the MR technique is faster, can be used to measure unilateral or bilateral zzso blood flow, and does not depend on zzso zzso
