Previous studies in schizophrenia have shown a strong relationship between memory deficits and a poor clinical zzso However, no previous study has identified the functional neural zzso of memory zzso in relation to zzso 

To determine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso patterns differed between individuals that later achieved zzso zzso those who did zzso 

zzso participants with zzso schizophrenia were divided into two groups after 1 year of treatment as per the 2005 zzso in schizophrenia consensus zzso We then examined zzso zzso using three contrasts zzso zzso zzso strategy, zzso unrelated zzso related image pairs, and successful zzso unsuccessful memory zzso among 15 participants who had achieved zzso zzso group), 27 who had not zzso zzso and 31 healthy controls zzso zzso 

Participants in the zzso group displayed a positive zzso in the zzso zzso compared with those in the zzso group when zzso related zzso no significant differences between the two groups were identified for the other zzso From the zzso data, compared with the zzso and control groups, the zzso group demonstrated an inability to zzso related images and displayed worse recognition memory zzso 

This is the first study to identify differential neural zzso between individuals with zzso schizophrenia that later achieved zzso zzso those who did zzso The zzso and functional results together add to the growing evidence relating a poor clinical outcome in schizophrenia to zzso zzso
