The zzso diffusion zzso zzso an image processing technique derived from physics, was applied to zzso sodium magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine the possibilities of image enhancement by zzso We compared six different zzso of AND zzso Besides the qualitative good results on phantom zzso quantitative analyses on zzso of human kidney yielded major improvements in noise reduction and other quality zzso the noise zzso the standard zzso in the image background) could be reduced to zzso of its original value, while linear filters zzso zzso zzso achieved a reduction to zzso Besides that, less than zzso of structures and zzso are lost when using AND zzso Comparing the different zzso the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional AND filter outperformed the zzso and zzso AND zzso We envision that by using these AND zzso quantitative analysis of sodium zzso of kidney could be zzso
