zzso zzso a temperament identified in early childhood, is often associated with zzso attention and affective processing, particularly in response to zzso zzso studies find that the manifestation of zzso attention and affective processing often zzso with zzso Yet, childhood behavioral zzso continues to predict zzso brain function into zzso This suggests that adults with childhood behavioral zzso may engage zzso processes to effectively regulate zzso zzso However, it is unknown whether zzso in brain function reflect compensation for attention bias to emotional stimuli generally, or to threatening contexts more zzso The present study tests these zzso 

Adults with and without a history of stable childhood behavioral zzso completed an zzso task in the context of threatening and zzso stimuli while undergoing functional magnetic resonance zzso Participants were asked to identify the gender of fearful zzso and happy zzso faces, while ignoring both the face emotion and zzso zzso zzso attention control, zzso or zzso zzso attention control, zzso gender zzso 

When fearful faces were present, adults with stable childhood behavioral zzso exhibited more activity in zzso cingulate, and zzso prefrontal zzso for HAC trials compared with zzso trials, relative to those without behavioral zzso When happy faces were present, the opposite zzso pattern zzso No group differences in behavior were zzso 

Among adults, stable childhood behavioral zzso predicts zzso but not zzso responding when attention control is engaged in discrete emotional zzso This suggests a mechanism by which adults may compensate for the behavioral manifestation of zzso attention zzso
