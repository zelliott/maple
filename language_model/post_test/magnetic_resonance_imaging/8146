A considerable body of evidence supports the notion that zzso zzso lead to zzso deficits, including zzso in zzso executive tasks and verbal zzso Studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and anatomical tracing in primates provide evidence for a zzso zzso as the functional zzso of zzso The present zzso study explores the zzso pattern during an zzso zzso task in patients with an isolated zzso zzso To determine each patient's cognitive zzso zzso tests of zzso and attention were carried zzso We conducted zzso in nine patients and nine healthy zzso controls while they performed a zzso task in a zzso In both groups we found bilateral zzso in a widespread zzso network, consisting of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso 44, zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso motor area zzso 6) anterior zzso zzso zzso Relative to healthy controls, patients with isolated zzso zzso demonstrated significantly more pronounced zzso in the zzso and the angular zzso during the zzso zzso The significant increase in zzso in the zzso zzso areas of the zzso patients could be attributed to a zzso recruitment to maintain task zzso We conclude that zzso zzso affect remote cortical regions that are part of a putative zzso zzso
