To examine the relationship between the zzso E zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso and white matter zzso on magnetic resonance imaging in late-life zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging study using zzso and zzso zzso zzso scans and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso population of elderly patients zzso chosen from a clinical case register of consecutive referrals to old age psychiatry zzso 

Twenty-five subjects with zzso disease (by criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association; mean age, zzso zzso 22 subjects with zzso with zzso bodies zzso zzso mean age, zzso zzso and 24 subjects with vascular zzso (by criteria of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Association International pour la zzso et zzso en zzso mean age, zzso zzso were zzso zzso were well matched for age, sex, duration of illness, and cognitive zzso 

The zzso zzso was determined using the zzso chain reaction method, and zzso zzso lobe zzso and white matter zzso zzso and deep white zzso were visually rated using standardized zzso 

In all subjects with zzso no significant associations were noted between zzso zzso status and zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso does not determine zzso zzso lobe zzso or white matter zzso as measured by magnetic resonance imaging in patients with zzso disease, vascular zzso or zzso with zzso zzso Although zzso zzso may modify the risk for acquiring zzso this finding provides further evidence that zzso zzso does not influence pathological processes zzso
