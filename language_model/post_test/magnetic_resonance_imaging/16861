Despite advances towards understanding the molecular zzso of the neurodegenerative zzso the mechanisms linking molecular changes to zzso and zzso changes to clinical symptoms remain largely zzso zzso is a distinctive feature of the brain and the integrity of functional network dynamics is crucial for normal zzso A better understanding of network disruption in the neurodegenerative zzso might help bridge the gap between molecular changes, pathological changes, and zzso Recent findings on functional network disruption as assessed with zzso or intrinsic connectivity functional zzso and zzso and zzso have shown distinct patterns of network disruption across the major neurodegenerative zzso These network abnormalities are somewhat specific to the clinical syndromes and, in Alzheimer's disease and zzso zzso network disruption tracks the pattern of pathological zzso These findings might have practical implications for diagnostic zzso allowing earlier detection of neurodegenerative diseases even at the zzso stage, and tracking of disease zzso
