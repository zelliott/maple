Changes of the major zzso zzso in zzso have not been systematically zzso We investigated the zzso differences of the zzso in patients with varying types of zzso to determine whether specific zzso features may help in distinguishing zzso zzso 

MR imaging of 124 patients was zzso zzso Patients were classified as having zzso zzso and zzso according to cortical zzso few patients had genetic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and HC were recorded, and the overall shape was regarded as zzso zzso zzso a thin flat zzso body with a vertical zzso and a convex upward zzso body, compared with zzso zzso zzso between zzso characteristics and cortical patterns were analyzed by using the zzso Carlo simulation of zzso extension to m zzso zzso table, and Fisher exact tests as appropriate zzso zzso zzso 

Patients were classified as having zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The most common zzso zzso anomaly was zzso with an absent zzso a small inferior zzso and a small zzso An angled zzso zzso was found to be significantly associated with zzso as was an excessively convex upward zzso body with zzso zzso with an enlarged zzso was found in all cases of zzso 

zzso patterns of the zzso anomalies were associated with certain types of zzso zzso anomalies were more common than those of the zzso or zzso zzso variations of zzso may be useful as an imaging criterion in zzso the groups of zzso and may give insight into the processes causing these zzso
