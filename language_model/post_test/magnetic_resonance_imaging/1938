zzso zzso is a critical factor when considering efficacy and safety of zzso intervention after zzso zzso This study tested whether magnetic resonance imaging could identify tissue for zzso transformation after the onset of zzso zzso zzso subjected to zzso stroke with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment were zzso with magnetic resonance imaging using the inverse of the apparent forward transfer rate for zzso transfer zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso stroke either were treated with zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso or 4 hours zzso zzso zzso after stroke onset or were not treated zzso zzso zzso From these groups, at total of 17 rats had zzso zzso zzso progressing to zzso and adjacent to the site of zzso was analyzed to identify magnetic resonance imaging markers that characterize zzso zzso The zzso maps of zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging showed greater sensitivity in the detection of tissue destined for zzso transformation compared with the apparent diffusion zzso of water zzso and zzso In tissue not destined to undergo zzso zzso zzso maps and zzso magnetic resonance imaging exhibited small increases in zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity in the area encompassing the territory supplied by the middle cerebral zzso In contrast, large increases in zzso and in signal intensity in the zzso magnetic resonance images were detected in the region where gross zzso was confirmed zzso The values of zzso zzso and signal intensity in the zzso magnetic resonance images were significantly higher in the region destined for zzso transformation zzso P zzso or zzso zzso zzso hours after zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso zzso hours; zzso magnetic resonance imaging, P zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso transformation zzso region or in the zzso zzso regions after onset of zzso Of these methods, zzso shows the most sensitivity in the detection of zzso transformation soon after zzso The zzso data suggest that zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging are potentially important zzso for detecting tissue destined for zzso zzso
