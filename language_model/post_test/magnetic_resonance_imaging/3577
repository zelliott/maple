To determine zzso zzso agreement, and zzso agreement for zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso dogs with first-time zzso disk zzso zzso 

Prospective evaluation zzso 

24 dogs with zzso zzso zzso 

Each dog underwent zzso and zzso Images obtained with each zzso were independently evaluated and assigned standardized scores in a blinded manner by 3 zzso zzso were compared with surgical zzso zzso and zzso agreements were assessed via zzso zzso zzso was assessed as the percentage of dogs for which zzso 2 of 3 zzso recorded findings identical to those determined zzso 

zzso agreement was substantial for site zzso zzso zzso and side of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso magnetic resonance images and was substantial for site zzso zzso zzso and fair for side of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso for site between each zzso and surgical findings was near perfect zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso agreement was substantial for site zzso zzso zzso and moderate for side of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for site and side was zzso when results for zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were zzso zzso of zzso was zzso and zzso for site and side, zzso 

zzso between imaging results and surgical findings for identification of zzso zzso sites in zzso dogs was similar for zzso and zzso However, zzso appeared to be more accurate than zzso and allowed evaluation of zzso zzso mass zzso
