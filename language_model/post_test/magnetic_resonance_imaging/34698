The most important rendering methods applied in medical imaging are surface and volume rendering zzso Each approach has its own advantages and zzso Fast zzso methods are able to support real-time interaction and zzso The underlying zzso however, is dependent on intensive image processing to extract the object zzso In contrast, volume zzso is not necessarily based on extensive image processing and zzso No data reduction to geometric zzso such as zzso is zzso zzso the process of volume rendering is currently not operating in real zzso In order to provide the zzso diagnosis with additional information as well as to enable simulation and zzso treatment planning we developed a new hybrid rendering method which combines the advantages of surface and volume zzso and zzso the limitations of these zzso We developed a common data representation method for both zzso A zzso module enables the construction of a data volume by zzso as well as the calculation of object surfaces by semiautomatic image interpretation and surface zzso The hybrid rendering system is based on transparency and texture mapping zzso It is embedded in a zzso open system which enables the support of new application fields such as virtual reality and zzso The efficiency of our new method is described for 3-D zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso
