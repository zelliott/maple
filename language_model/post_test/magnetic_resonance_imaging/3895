To apply zzso to compare the utility of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging for the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso in patients with cervical zzso 

zzso literature search and manual reviews of article zzso 

Studies selected included at least 20 patients with zzso zzso described diagnostic criteria for zzso zzso zzso and presented data to allow calculation of contingency zzso 

zzso by 2 investigators, zzso for stage of disease zzso vs zzso and for zzso zzso location zzso vs zzso 

zzso studies met the inclusion criteria for zzso 17 for CT, and 10 for MR zzso zzso receiver operator characteristic analysis showed no significant differences in the overall performance of zzso CT, and MR zzso There was, however, a trend toward better performance for MR imaging than for zzso or CT, both globally and when zzso for stage of disease or for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of clinical utility showed only moderate increases in positive zzso probability of zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso test results had a greater impact and, depending on the clinical setting, decreased the probability of zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso to zzso to zzso zzso 

The zzso CT, and MR imaging perform similarly in the detection of zzso zzso zzso from cervical zzso As CT and MR imaging are less invasive than zzso and also assess local tumor extent, they should be considered the preferred zzso to clinical evaluation of invasive cervical zzso
