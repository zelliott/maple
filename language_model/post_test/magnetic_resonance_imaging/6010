zzso area zzso 10, which occupies the frontal pole zzso of the human brain, has been proven to play a central role in the executive control of cognitive zzso Previous in zzso zzso studies of the zzso have been limited by the lack of an accepted boundary of its zzso zzso We studied the zzso gray matter volume in 23 healthy subjects who were zzso zzso and zzso to 23 zzso zzso schizophrenia subjects in the age span zzso years, using a zzso and functionally valid zzso definition of its zzso boundary that we proposed recently (John, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A proposal for zzso zzso of the frontal zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we examined the relationship between zzso volume and age in both healthy and schizophrenia subjects to examine evidence for a possible differential relationship between these variables across the zzso A major finding of the study was the absence of a zzso difference in frontal pole gray volumes between the healthy and schizophrenia zzso However, a more complex finding emerged in relation to age zzso The healthy participants showed an inverse relationship of zzso gray volume with age, even after taking total brain volume differences into zzso But this age effect was completely absent in the schizophrenia zzso Moreover, all the zzso measures in schizophrenia subjects showed substantially higher range, zzso zzso and zzso when compared to those of healthy zzso These findings have implications in understanding the possible role of zzso in the zzso of zzso
