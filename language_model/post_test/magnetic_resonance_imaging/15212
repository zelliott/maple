This study examined zzso changes prior to zzso zzso in the zzso of patients with zzso From a database of 143 zzso studies, we selected the 16 data sets that showed both strong zzso zzso in the original analysis and only a single spike type in the zzso zzso were then analyzed using seven model zzso zzso 3 or 1 s before the event, or 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 s after zzso An zzso was calculated using a zzso method for all zzso seen in each zzso The results showed that seven data sets had zzso that peaked 1 s after the event or earlier, indicating a zzso change starting prior to the spike seen on the scalp zzso This is surprising since the zzso change is expected to result from the zzso For most of the data sets with early zzso zzso the maximum zzso in all of the statistical maps was when the model zzso peaked 1 s after the event, suggesting that the early zzso was at least as important as any later zzso We suggest that this early activity is the result of zzso changes occurring several seconds prior to a surface zzso event, but that these changes are not visible on the zzso This is the first report of a zzso response occurring several seconds prior to an zzso event seen on the scalp and could have important implications for our understanding of the generation of zzso zzso
