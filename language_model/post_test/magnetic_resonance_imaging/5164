The precise temperature for optimal zzso in infants with zzso zzso is zzso Our aim was to assess systemic effects of zzso cooling to 35 zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso in a zzso model of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso male zzso aged zzso h underwent zzso zzso and were zzso to zzso or cooling to zzso temperature zzso 35 zzso zzso zzso or 30 zzso during zzso h after insult zzso zzso 7 in each zzso HR, zzso and zzso were recorded zzso 

Five animals cooled to 30 zzso had fatal cardiac zzso During 30 zzso zzso heart rate zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although mean zzso blood pressure zzso did not vary between groups, more fluid zzso were needed at 30 zzso than at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso use was higher at 30 zzso than at zzso or 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Base deficit was increased at 30 zzso at 12, 24, and 36 h zzso all other groups zzso zzso zzso pH was zzso at 36 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso was higher for the 30 zzso group at 12 h zzso the zzso and 35 zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower at 12 h in the 30 zzso group zzso the zzso zzso and 35 zzso zzso There was no difference in cortisol level between zzso 

zzso to 30 zzso led to zzso zzso and more cardiac arrests and deaths than cooling to zzso zzso or 35 zzso zzso zzso should be zzso
