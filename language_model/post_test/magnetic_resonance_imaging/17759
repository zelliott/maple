zzso signal strength in zzso is low when compared with zzso Thus, image zzso volumes must be relatively large in order to produce a sufficient zzso ratio zzso The measurement of sodium in cartilage is hindered by zzso with signal from the adjacent fluid zzso zzso recovery can be used to zzso signal from fluid, but reduces zzso The purpose of this work was to zzso inversion recovery sodium zzso to enhance cartilage zzso while zzso zzso zzso relaxation was first measured for knee cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fluid zzso zzso zzso zzso in nine healthy subjects at zzso zzso The rapid relaxation of cartilage in relation to fluid permits the use of a zzso inversion pulse to zzso zzso the fluid zzso zzso of inversion pulse length were performed to yield a cartilage zzso enhancing combination of parameters that zzso zzso The simulations were validated in a phantom and then in zzso zzso zzso was measured and the effect of zzso during the soft inversion pulse was assessed with zzso Soft inversion recovery yielded twice the zzso and much improved sodium images of cartilage in human knee with little zzso signal from zzso
