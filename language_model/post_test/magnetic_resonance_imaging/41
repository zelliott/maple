Recent advances in magnet technology have enabled the construction of zzso magnets zzso and zzso that can accommodate the human head and zzso Despite the intrinsic advantages of performing zzso imaging at zzso increased zzso ratio zzso and spectral resolution, few studies have been reported to zzso This limitation is largely due to increased power deposition and zzso zzso To overcome these limitations, we used an zzso zzso array with a short TE (15 zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso phase and zzso mapping and zzso schemes, the zzso zzso array provided both improved efficiency zzso less power for equivalent peak zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso in comparison to a zzso electromagnetic zzso volume zzso To minimize the echo time to measure zzso compounds such as zzso we developed a short TE sequence utilizing a zzso selective zzso pulse followed by a broadband zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were suppressed with an inversion recovery pulse and zzso The short TE sequence enabled zzso of a variety of zzso including zzso in both a control subject and a patient with a Grade II zzso
