The zzso shafts of zzso contain bundled zzso whereas extending growth cones contain zzso zzso zzso suggesting that localized zzso of zzso proteins zzso at the transition zone may bundle these filaments during zzso zzso zzso is thought to lead to zzso zzso but specific molecular pathways have remained zzso We find that zzso a zzso 1 zzso targeting zzso is responsible for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 297 selectively at the zzso of growing zzso leading to zzso Loss of activity at the zzso is evident as an impaired zzso zzso along the zzso These findings suggest that zzso restricted zzso zzso zzso through zzso is important in organization of the zzso zzso
