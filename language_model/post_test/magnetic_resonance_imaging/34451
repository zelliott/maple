zzso exists regarding the cortical representation of the zzso region in zzso The most plausible explanation for zzso sparing in zzso zzso is dual blood supply to the zzso zzso However, bilateral cortical representation has also been zzso 

To determine the representation of the zzso region in the primary human visual zzso 

A case series zzso magnetic resonance imaging to the visual field defects of 6 patients with zzso lobe zzso 

Four patients with zzso zzso defects demonstrated unilateral sparing of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, 2 patients with central zzso defects showed isolated involvement of the zzso zzso One patient also demonstrated 5 degrees of field sparing along the horizontal zzso 

On the basis of zzso the findings of magnetic resonance imaging and visual field defects in patients with zzso lobe injury, we conclude that the zzso region is unilaterally represented in the primary human visual zzso and that a major portion of the zzso zzso is dedicated to the central 10 degrees of zzso The horizontal zzso of the visual field is represented deep within the zzso banks at the zzso zzso
