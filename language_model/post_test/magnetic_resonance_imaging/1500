zzso zzso fiber tracking potentially can give information about in zzso brain zzso However, this technique is difficult to validate due to the lack of a gold zzso zzso tracking reliability will depend on the quality of the data and on the zzso of the zzso zzso Information about the effects of various anatomical and image acquisition parameters on fiber tracking reliability may be used in the design of imaging sequences and of tracking zzso In this study, tracking was performed on two different simulated models to study the effects on tracking quality of zzso zzso zzso fiber zzso background zzso step size, and zzso Tracking was also performed on volunteer data to assess the relevance of the simulations to real zzso Our results show that, in general, tracking with high zzso and high zzso using zzso and a low step size gives the most reliable zzso zzso volume effects are shown to have a zzso effect when the background is zzso and when tracking narrow zzso The results derived from real data show similar trends and thus support the findings of the zzso These simulations may therefore help to determine which structures can be tracked for a given image zzso
