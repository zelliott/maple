Sex steroids affect cognitive function as well as emotion processing and zzso They may also play a role in the zzso of zzso However, the effects of sex steroids on zzso and zzso brain zzso in schizophrenia are poorly zzso Our aim was to determine the extent to which circulating testosterone relates to brain zzso in men with schizophrenia compared to healthy men during zzso zzso We assessed brain zzso in 18 men with schizophrenia and 22 zzso healthy men during an emotional zzso task using zzso and measured total serum testosterone levels on the same zzso We performed an zzso analysis to assess the relationship between serum testosterone and brain zzso focusing on cortical regions involved the emotional zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced accuracy was observed when participants responded to neutral zzso while zzso responses to negative zzso Healthy men showed a robust increase in zzso of the middle frontal zzso when zzso responses to negative zzso but there was no significant association between zzso and serum testosterone level in healthy zzso Men with schizophrenia showed a less pronounced increase in zzso when zzso responses to negative zzso however, they did show a strong inverse association between serum testosterone level and zzso of the bilateral middle frontal zzso and left zzso Additionally, increased accuracy during zzso of response to negative words was associated with both higher serum testosterone levels and decreased zzso of the middle frontal zzso in men with schizophrenia zzso We conclude that zzso hormone levels, even within the normal range, may play an enhanced zzso role in determining the neural and zzso response during zzso processing in zzso
