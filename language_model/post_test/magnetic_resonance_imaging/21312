zzso decision-making zzso the transformation of graded sensory signals into zzso zzso Often, there is a direct mapping between these judgments and specific motor zzso However, when zzso zzso are zzso neural activity underlying decision-making cannot be separated from neural activity reflecting motor zzso Several human zzso studies have reported changes in brain activity associated with zzso zzso Nevertheless, to date it has remained unknown where and how specific choices are zzso in the human brain when motor planning is zzso from the decision zzso We addressed this question by having subjects judge the direction of motion of dynamic random dot patterns at various levels of motion strength while measuring their brain activity with zzso We used zzso decoding analyses to search the whole brain for patterns of brain activity zzso subjects' zzso To zzso the decision process from motor planning, subjects were informed about the required motor response only after stimulus zzso zzso of zzso signals in early visual and inferior zzso zzso predicted subjects' zzso choices irrespective of motor zzso This was true across several levels of motion strength and even in the absence of any coherent stimulus zzso We also found that the cortical distribution of zzso brain signals depended on stimulus zzso While visual zzso carried most zzso information for strong motion, information in zzso zzso decreased with increasing motion zzso These results demonstrate that human visual and inferior zzso zzso carry information about the visual decision in a more abstract format than can be explained by simple motor zzso Both brain regions may be zzso involved in zzso decision-making in the face of strong and weak sensory zzso
