This article presents a zzso approach to the soft tissue tumors zzso zzso character diagnosis using magnetic resonance zzso imaging applied to a large zzso zzso 

To develop and test an automatic zzso of zzso into benign or zzso by using classical MR imaging findings and zzso zzso 

A database of 430 patients zzso benign and 38% zzso from several European zzso zzso There were 61 different zzso zzso with benign and 25 with zzso zzso Three zzso methods zzso neural networks, support zzso machine, zzso zzso were applied to learn the discrimination between zzso and zzso based on a defined MR imaging findings zzso After the systems had learned by using training samples (with zzso zzso the clinical decision support system was tested in the diagnosis of 128 new zzso zzso 

An zzso efficacy was obtained in a zzso set of tumors using the zzso zzso The best results were obtained with a zzso artificial neural zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso discrimination is accurate by using zzso methods based on classical MR image zzso This objective tool will assist zzso in zzso zzso
