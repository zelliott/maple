The episodic buffer zzso formation and maintenance of zzso zzso representations based on information in different codes from different zzso zzso based on zzso units, engages zzso brain regions, while maintenance engages frontal zzso Using a hybrid zzso design, that allows separate analysis of transient and sustained zzso an zzso task and an experimental group of 13 hearing native zzso with experience of Swedish Sign Language and Swedish since birth, we investigated binding of zzso signs and words in working zzso zzso show that the transient component of these functions is supported by a zzso network of zzso regions including the right middle zzso zzso possibly relating to binding of zzso loop representations with semantic representations in long-term memory, as well as a zzso network, in line with predictions of a functional relationship between loop and zzso The left zzso was engaged in transient and sustained components of buffer processing, possibly reflecting the meaningful nature of the zzso Only a minor role was found for executive functions in line with other recent zzso A novel representation of the sustained component of working memory for audiovisual language in the right inferior zzso lobe may be related to perception of zzso facial zzso Previous findings of sign and speech loop representation in working memory were zzso and zzso Together, these findings support the notion of a module that mediates between codes and sources, such as the episodic zzso and further our understanding of its zzso
