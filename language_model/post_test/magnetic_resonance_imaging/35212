A recently introduced method called zzso zzso Imaging with zzso zzso is a fundamentally different approach to zzso which is particularly well suited to imaging objects with extremely fast zzso relaxation zzso The method exploits a zzso zzso pulse and virtually simultaneous signal acquisition in a zzso zzso zzso of the spin system response with the zzso pulse function is used to extract the signals of zzso With zzso image quality is highly dependent on producing uniform and broadband spin zzso These requirements are satisfied by using zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso family zzso zzso This article describes the experimental steps needed to properly implement zzso zzso in zzso In addition, properties of zzso zzso in the rapid passage, linear region are investigated, followed by an analysis of the zzso after inserting the zzso needed for zzso zzso and zzso Finally, compact expressions are presented to estimate the zzso and flip angle of the zzso zzso as well as the relative energy deposited by the zzso zzso
