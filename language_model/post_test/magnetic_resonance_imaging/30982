zzso of mice, through breeding or the disruption of normal genetic zzso are widely used to model human zzso zzso are an invaluable aid in understanding the impact of such zzso by providing a standard for zzso We have developed a digital zzso of the adult zzso mouse brain as a comprehensive framework for storing and zzso the myriad types of information about the mouse zzso Our zzso was constructed using several different imaging zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging, classical zzso and zzso Along with raw and zzso images, it contains database management systems and a set of tools for comparing information from different zzso The framework allows facile correlation of results from different animals, investigators or laboratories by establishing a zzso representation of the mouse brain and providing the tools for the zzso of independent data into the same space as the zzso This tool will aid in managing the increasingly complex and zzso amounts of information about the zzso zzso It provides a framework that encompasses genetic information in the context of anatomical imaging and holds tremendous promise for producing new insights into the relationship between zzso and zzso We describe a suite of tools that enables the independent entry of other types of data, facile retrieval of information and straightforward display of zzso Thus, the zzso becomes a framework for managing complex genetic and zzso information about the mouse zzso The zzso and associated tools may be zzso at zzso
