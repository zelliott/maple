To determine whether zzso development in primates is zzso by local retinal mechanisms, the authors examined the effects of zzso form deprivation on zzso growth and the pattern of peripheral zzso in zzso zzso 

Beginning at approximately 3 weeks of age, nine infant monkeys were reared wearing zzso zzso zzso that eliminated form vision in the zzso field zzso field zzso zzso Control data were obtained from the zzso fellow eyes, 24 normal zzso and 19 monkeys treated with zzso zzso zzso development was assessed by zzso performed along the zzso axis and at zzso of 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 zzso Central zzso dimensions and eye shape were assessed by zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging, zzso 

zzso form deprivation altered zzso development in a regionally selective manner, typically producing zzso in the treated zzso In particular, six of the zzso monkeys exhibited substantial amounts zzso to zzso zzso of relative zzso in the zzso field that were most obvious at the 15 degrees and 30 degrees zzso field zzso The other three zzso monkeys exhibited small amounts of relative zzso in the treated zzso The zzso in peripheral refraction were associated with local, zzso zzso in zzso chamber depth in the treated zzso 

The effects of form deprivation on zzso development and eye growth in primates are zzso by mechanisms, presumably zzso that integrate visual signals in a zzso restricted manner and exert their influence zzso
