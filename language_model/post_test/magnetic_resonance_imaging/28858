Many tasks require rapid and fine-tuned adjustment of motor performance based on incoming sensory zzso This process of zzso adaptation engages two parallel zzso neural zzso involving the zzso and zzso zzso zzso How these distributed circuits are functionally coordinated has not been shown in zzso The zzso and zzso zzso show very similar convergence of zzso organization, which presents an ideal zzso model for the study of parallel processing at a systems zzso Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the zzso zzso of brain activity during a tactile discrimination zzso We found that, whereas the prefrontal zzso maintained a high level of zzso output activities in the zzso and zzso zzso showed different zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activity significantly correlated with the activity of the supplementary motor area but not with that of the primary motor zzso in contrast, zzso zzso activity was more strongly associated with the activity of the primary motor zzso than with that of the supplementary motor zzso These results demonstrate temporally zzso activity in the zzso and zzso zzso implicating functional independence in the parallel zzso zzso This further supports the idea of zzso dynamic reconfiguration of large-scale neural zzso
