zzso stability becomes compromised with advancing age, but the neural mechanisms contributing to instability have not been fully zzso zzso this quantitative zzso and zzso study of sex differences across the adult age range examined the association between components of zzso control and the integrity of brain structure and function under different conditions of sensory input and stance stabilization zzso The groups comprised 28 healthy men (age zzso zzso and 38 healthy women (age zzso zzso who completed balance platform testing, cognitive assessment, and structural zzso The results supported the hypothesis that excessive zzso sway would be greater in older than younger healthy individuals when standing without sensory or stance zzso and that introduction of such aids would reduce sway in both principal directions zzso and zzso and in both the zzso and zzso components of zzso control even in older zzso zzso reduction with stance stabilization, that is, standing with feet apart, was greater in men than women, probably because older men were less stable than women when standing with their feet zzso Greater sway was related to evidence for greater brain structural zzso changes, zzso as zzso and zzso enlargement and white matter zzso zzso In women, poorer cognitive test performance related to less sway reduction with the use of sensory zzso Thus, aging men and women were shown to have diminished zzso control, associated with cognitive and brain structural zzso in unstable stance conditions and with diminished sensory zzso
