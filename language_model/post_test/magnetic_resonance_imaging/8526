It was investigated whether the cortical activity during tasks requiring focused or divided attention is reduced in multiple sclerosis patients with prominent deficits zzso and increased in patients without impairment zzso in these specific attention zzso 

Six zzso patients with attention deficits, six zzso zzso patients, and zzso zzso and zzso healthy control subjects were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The experimental paradigm consisted of visual tasks requiring focused or divided zzso 

Performance accuracy and reaction times were impaired in zzso zzso This zzso showed reduced zzso within superior and inferior frontal zzso during focused zzso Under conditions of divided attention decreased activity was found within middle and inferior frontal zzso inferior zzso structures, and zzso zzso No zzso activity was zzso zzso patients did neither differ in behavioral data nor in cortical activity in attention related structures from control zzso 

The study found evidence for the neural correlate of zzso deficits in zzso zzso In patients with specific attention deficits, reduced cortical activity in prefrontal and zzso areas, which are associated with attention and executive control, reflects the patients' reduced performance on a behavioral zzso Our findings also suggest impaired zzso zzso control on sensory structures in these zzso In patients without verifiable attention deficits a normal functioning of structures relevant for executive attention was zzso zzso activity in these structures as a marker of reorganization in less pronounced stages of the disease was not zzso
