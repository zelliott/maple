zzso disease zzso significantly affects the prognosis and treatment of pediatric patients with zzso or primitive zzso tumor zzso zzso of zzso for zzso cells, detection of zzso on spinal magnetic resonance imaging zzso or both are the methods routinely used to diagnose zzso A recent study suggested zzso correlation between zzso and zzso findings in children with zzso To determine the zzso of this hypothesis, we compared the rate of detection of zzso between concurrent zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso performed at diagnosis in patients with zzso or zzso 

As a part of diagnostic staging, 106 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with zzso or zzso were evaluated with concurrent zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso zzso was examined for the presence of zzso cells and spinal zzso was reviewed independently for the presence of zzso 

Thirty-four patients zzso were diagnosed with zzso based on zzso zzso spinal zzso or zzso There were 21 zzso zzso Nine patients zzso with positive zzso had negative zzso zzso Twelve patients zzso with positive zzso zzso had negative zzso The exact zzso upper bounds on the proportion of patients with zzso whose disease would have gone zzso using either zzso zzso or zzso as the only diagnostic zzso were calculated at zzso and zzso zzso 

With the use of either zzso zzso or spinal zzso alone, zzso would be missed in up to zzso to zzso of patients with zzso or zzso Thus, both zzso zzso and spinal zzso should routinely be used to diagnose zzso in patients with zzso or zzso
