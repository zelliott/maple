zzso zzso virus 1 zzso zzso that lack the zzso gene are unable to replicate in the central nervous system but maintain replication competence in dividing cell zzso such as those found in brain zzso We have previously demonstrated that a zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso prolonged survival of zzso mice in zzso models of brain zzso We hypothesized that zzso would be suitable for use in clinical trials for patients with zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we zzso compared the efficacy of zzso to three other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso models of brain tumors, zzso examined the safety and zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso and zzso determined whether zzso zzso produced by zzso was capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso are summarized as zzso zzso zzso demonstrated superior zzso activity in two different zzso brain tumor models compared to three other genetically engineered zzso zzso zzso no significant clinical or magnetic resonance imaging evidence of toxicity was observed following direct zzso of zzso into the right frontal zzso of zzso zzso zzso there was no zzso evidence of disease in zzso zzso 1 month or zzso years following direct zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso activates zzso zzso zzso in zzso We conclude that the safety and zzso efficacy of zzso warrants the advancement of a zzso virus expressing zzso to phase I clinical trials for patients with zzso zzso zzso
