To determine whether abdominal zzso zzso can be used for evaluation of Crohn's disease zzso compared with zzso zzso and to determine patient preference for zzso as opposed to zzso 

Twenty patients scheduled for zzso underwent zzso At zzso disease severity was graded and the Crohn's Disease zzso Index of zzso zzso was zzso zzso grading (by two zzso was compared with zzso grading and zzso Patient experience and preference were zzso 

In respectively 10 zzso 1) and 13 patients zzso 2) exact agreement between zzso and zzso grading was zzso In respectively 10 and 7 patients zzso and zzso grading differed one zzso No statistically significant correlation was found between zzso grading and zzso Between zzso wall thickness and zzso weak to moderate correlations were found, and between zzso wall enhancement and zzso weak correlations were zzso All patients preferred zzso over zzso 

It is feasible to perform abdominal zzso zzso using orally administered contrast medium for evaluation of CD, and this method can be considered a zzso alternative to zzso
