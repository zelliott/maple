As a special lecture at the 96th Annual Congress of the Japanese zzso Society in 1992, we presented experimental and clinical studies on eye movement using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso is more valuable than X-ray CT in defining external muscle anatomy in the orbit in a variety of pathological changes, and is free from the danger of zzso zzso mode zzso which was originally developed to observe cardiovascular function, was zzso zzso for observation of eye zzso We invented two methods to produce a series of zzso In the first method, zzso moving eye zzso the subjects were asked to perform 256 or 512 vertical and horizontal eye movements in synchronization with a sound zzso In the second, zzso fixed eye zzso the subjects were asked to gaze at individual points in a 5 to 7 point sequence as indicated by the zzso In both methods zzso data was generated and the resulting series of photographs were observed in zzso mode on a television zzso zzso the zzso generated photographs in zzso mode enables direct observation of the movement of the eye, zzso nerve and zzso muscles within the zzso The moving eye method was more accurate in its portrayal of the actual movement of the eye, but the large number of eye movements, at least 256 movements, required about 5 minutes, and caused physical and mental fatigue for the zzso The fixed eye method did not show actual movement of the eye, but was less fatiguing than the former method, and avoided several of its zzso A large number of zzso cases such as zzso zzso zzso zzso fracture of the zzso wall, foreign bodies in the orbit, zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined using the fixed eye method of zzso mode zzso Using this technique, anatomical changes, such as zzso or zzso and the functional state demonstrated by the contraction and relaxation of the zzso muscles could be zzso zzso of the zzso muscles, an effective treatment for zzso zzso was zzso and a new surgical procedure was developed for zzso zzso The measurement of the zzso thickness and weight of the zzso muscles from the zzso photographs allowed for more accurate zzso The three zzso zzso method of zzso is very valuable for diagnosis in the orbit and is expected to contribute to future zzso
