We have developed four methods to generate a zzso dimension image and have applied them to the brain zzso We have adopted four types of scanning methods, zzso zzso zzso and zzso to estimate the zzso zzso The first three methods show almost the same zzso dimension images and their values were between two and zzso In the zzso method, we were able to obtain the images in which the edge of a narrow region including zzso and scalp surrounding the brain was selectively enhanced in the zzso zzso This is found to be a new zzso zzso We could remove the surrounding structure of the brain by using these filtered images and detect the edge of the brain surface zzso The brain surface data can be used for various applications such as three-dimensional surface display and registration of zzso brain zzso
