zzso zzso with zzso spikes zzso the most common childhood zzso syndrome, is a zzso disorder with a genetic zzso Despite its signature zzso pattern and distinct focal motor seizure zzso little is known about the underlying brain zzso zzso and the corresponding cognitive zzso Given the motor manifestations of zzso in zzso we zzso that zzso networks in zzso involve a distributed zzso zzso 

We investigated zzso differences and shape zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a group of children with zzso and zzso zzso (N zzso 3) compared to healthy controls (N zzso zzso We correlated specific zzso volumes in zzso that were significantly different from those in healthy controls with performances in executive zzso 

Children with zzso demonstrated significantly zzso zzso which was selective among the zzso regions zzso Shape analysis showed zzso zzso of the left zzso and bilateral zzso with zzso expansion in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were linked to better cognitive performances on two complementary executive function zzso 

Children with zzso showed zzso volume and shape in zzso regions that are critical for both motor processing and executive zzso It is of importance to note that the zzso appears to be cognitively zzso as enlargement was associated with improved cognitive zzso The zzso abnormalities and their cognitive effects are evident in a group of children with zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the structural brain anomalies occurred before the diagnosis of zzso
