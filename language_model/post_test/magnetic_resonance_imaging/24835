zzso zzso has shown that the brain organizes into several independent networks of spontaneously zzso regions during zzso rest zzso zzso Previous research has suggested that 1 such network, the default mode network zzso shows diminished recruitment of the zzso with zzso lobe zzso zzso This work seeks to zzso how zzso recruitment into the zzso varies by zzso of zzso zzso 

The authors addressed this issue using functional zzso to assess zzso zzso connectivity in 38 participants zzso control participants, 7 patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 8 patients with zzso and zzso zzso Independent component analysis was conducted to identify zzso brain networks from control zzso zzso The zzso was identified and deconstructed into its individual regions of interest zzso The functional connectivity of these zzso was analyzed both by zzso zzso vs right) and by zzso to the zzso focus zzso vs zzso 

This attempt to replicate previously published methods with this data set showed that patients with zzso zzso had reduced connectivity between the zzso zzso zzso and both the left zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso zzso while patients with zzso zzso showed reduced connectivity between the zzso and right zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso by zzso significantly diminished functional connectivity was observed between the zzso and zzso of both zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in patients with zzso compared with control zzso zzso analyses showed the reduced zzso recruitment of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to be independent of clinical variables including zzso zzso seizure frequency, and duration of zzso The graph theory metric of strength (or mean absolute zzso showed significantly reduced connectivity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with zzso compared with controls zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso after correction for false discovery zzso Finally, these zzso zzso in strength were observed in patients with zzso that corresponded to zzso of zzso zzso zzso of patients with zzso had weaker zzso zzso strength zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso of patients had weaker zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrated that zzso brain regions by the zzso to their zzso focus increases the power of statistical approaches for finding zzso differences in brain zzso Using this approach, the authors showed zzso to selectively diminish connectivity of the zzso and zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso This approach may prove to be a useful method for determining the seizure onset zone with zzso and could be broadly applied to other neurological disorders with a zzso zzso
