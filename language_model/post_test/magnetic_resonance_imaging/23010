zzso represents the best treatment for potentially zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso The zzso potential of zzso may be hampered because the extent of burn is difficult to estimate by zzso We zzso that zzso zzso zzso would enable a more accurate assessment of zzso zzso 

We performed open zzso surgery in an operating room equipped with a unique, retractable zzso zzso Patients were selected because it was anticipated that zzso (with or instead of zzso was likelihood and that zzso might be helpful in making zzso zzso After baseline zzso zzso were further assessed by ultrasound at the time of open zzso zzso were zzso and/or zzso and further imaging confirmed the margins of the zzso 

Nine patients underwent the zzso 1 with zzso zzso 4 with zzso zzso and 4 with zzso liver zzso In 4 patients, zzso had an effect on zzso In 5 individuals, there were zzso zzso and 1 patient who was never zzso had a local zzso 

zzso zzso could potentially impact operative decision-making when zzso extensive zzso Its ability to prevent local zzso must be zzso Moreover, the role of this technology in the overall treatment zzso must be zzso
