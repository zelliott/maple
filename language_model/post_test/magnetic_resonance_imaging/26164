In the early 1980s, diagnosing zzso zzso zzso in zzso by using zzso zzso was possible for the first zzso Our purpose was to investigate the possibility of diagnosing zzso in the acute stage by using MR zzso We evaluated early MR features of zzso brain injury in zzso with zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso to determine the added value of MR imaging over zzso alone for early diagnosis of brain zzso 

In a prospective study, infants who showed zzso and/or zzso on zzso underwent MR imaging during the zzso zzso 

Fifty infants were classified according to the highest zzso grade up to the day of MR zzso 23 infants had zzso grade 1 zzso zzso 1 week), 15 had zzso grade 2 zzso zzso or zzso 1 week), four had zzso grade 3 zzso localized zzso and eight had zzso grade 4 zzso zzso zzso none had zzso grade 5 zzso zzso on the day of MR zzso Overall, the additional information provided by MR imaging (over zzso zzso consisted of the depiction of zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso and severity of the zzso varied from isolated zzso zzso to extensive zzso throughout the white zzso the latter were followed by zzso zzso at autopsy in two zzso In nine of the 12 infants with zzso zzso MR images showed more numerous or more extensive zzso In addition, in two zzso MR images showed zzso not present on zzso In zzso of the zzso MR imaging provided no additional zzso in these children, all but one had zzso on zzso whereas MR images showed no abnormalities or a zone of mild zzso signal zzso 

MR imaging can depict the precise site and extent of zzso brain injury at an earlier stage and allows a wider differentiation of zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered to be rare, but was present in zzso of our study zzso
