Research employing aversive conditioning zzso has zzso the zzso involved in acquiring and diminishing fear zzso However, the factors underlying individual differences in fear acquisition and zzso are not presently well zzso In this study, we explored whether the magnitude of zzso acquired fear responses and the zzso of these responses via 2 fear reduction methods were correlated with structural differences in brain regions involved in affective zzso zzso and structural magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained from experiments exploring extinction retention and intentional cognitive zzso Our results identified 2 regions in which individual variation in brain structure correlated with subjects' zzso zzso zzso previous results, increased thickness in zzso prefrontal zzso was correlated with the degree of extinction zzso Additionally, subjects with greater thickness in the zzso zzso exhibited larger zzso responses during zzso The data suggest a trend toward a negative correlation between zzso volume and fear acquisition zzso There was no significant correlation between fear reduction via cognitive regulation and thickness in our prefrontal regions of zzso Acquisition and regulation measures were zzso suggesting that while certain individuals may have a propensity toward increased expression of zzso fear, these responses can be diminished via both extinction and cognitive zzso
