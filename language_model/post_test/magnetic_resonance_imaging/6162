zzso enhanced ultrasound has recently been introduced and is recommended in daily practice in many circumstances, mainly for the detection and characterization of focal liver zzso Also, contrast enhanced ultrasound has the potential of becoming the primary zzso zzso preceding CT or zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso in patients with zzso detection of liver zzso in zzso patients and guidance and assessment of the outcome of zzso tumor zzso zzso Recently, a new imaging technique that combines in zzso zzso ultrasound with CT or zzso has been introduced in clinical zzso zzso virtual zzso uses a magnetic positioning system attached to the ultrasound probe in order to calculate the spatial position and to display both imaging methods in zzso zzso include an increased diagnostic confidence, direct comparison of the zzso using different imaging zzso more precise monitoring of zzso procedures and reduced radiation zzso We describe the role of real-time zzso and real-time virtual zzso in the assessment of zzso liver zzso
