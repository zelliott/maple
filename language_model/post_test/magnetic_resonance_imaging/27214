zzso zzso storage in muscle zzso lipids zzso and liver zzso lipids zzso coexists with impaired zzso flux through zzso zzso zzso in certain zzso with increased risk of type 2 zzso Because women with a history of zzso diabetes zzso zzso have elevated zzso lipids and diabetes risk, we tested whether deteriorated energy metabolism contributes to these zzso 

A total of 23 zzso zzso zzso and eight women with normal zzso metabolism during pregnancy with similar age, body mass, and physical activity underwent oral zzso tolerance tests zzso and intravenous zzso tolerance tests at 4-5 years after zzso zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were considered to indicate insulin zzso zzso were further zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured with zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso had zzso higher fat mass and zzso lower insulin zzso zzso zzso was lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and related to plasma zzso after adjustment for body fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistant women zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso were doubled zzso zzso zzso in zzso and insulin resistant women, and correlated positively with body fat mass zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso with insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso show increased liver fat but only slightly lower muscular insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso This suggests that zzso of zzso zzso storage represents an early and zzso zzso in this zzso
