A magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique for the assessment of zzso and zzso components of human skeletal muscle is zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso reliability for repeated zzso from the same MR image are zzso Twenty zzso MR images from the right lower leg were obtained from 30 healthy young men and women zzso age zzso years, zzso zzso The anatomical zzso area zzso zzso the zzso area of zzso components zzso zzso the zzso zzso area zzso zzso zzso minus zzso zzso and the relative amount of zzso zzso of the ankle zzso muscle compartment were determined for each slice using a computer-based image analysis zzso zzso for repeated zzso of the slice with the largest zzso for the 30 subjects was analyzed by two zzso on two different zzso zzso reliability on both occasions, assessed by the zzso correlation zzso zzso was excellent for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (between zzso reliability was excellent for the two zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Altman analyses did not identify any clinically relevant bias in the zzso zzso errors were zzso within subjects zzso of variation zzso was less than zzso for zzso and less than zzso for zzso It is concluded that repeated zzso of zzso and zzso components of the ankle zzso muscle zzso obtained from the same MR image, are highly zzso
