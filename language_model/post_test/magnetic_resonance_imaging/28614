Several zzso are presented that address the issue of brain and/or zzso size reductions in zzso Separate zzso were conducted for brain size zzso zzso 27 zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso or zzso size zzso zzso zzso For each zzso the weighted composite effect size zzso was tested for statistical significance (the direction of the effect size was negative if patients with schizophrenia had smaller structure size than zzso The influence of several potential zzso of effect size zzso methods, region, zzso was individually zzso The composite effect sizes for studies of brain, zzso and zzso measures were d zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso d zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and d zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the review found evidence for a small, but statistically significant reduction in brain and zzso size in zzso but no evidence for a reduction in zzso zzso Studies based on zzso image slices had significantly larger effects zzso zzso zzso than the studies based on zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In zzso the findings clearly support a small yet highly significant reduction of brain and zzso size in zzso
