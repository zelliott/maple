The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a dedicated software tool for automated and zzso volume measurement in zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso breast zzso with zzso zzso (27 benign, 69 zzso were re-evaluated by different volume measurement zzso Volumes of all zzso were extracted automatically zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and compared with manual zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso reference measurement zzso and volume estimates based on maximum diameter measurement zzso Compared with zzso as reference method zzso zzso and zzso underestimated zzso volumes by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, with significantly different accuracy for benign zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was best for zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is more accurate for volume assessment of breast zzso than zzso and zzso Volume measurement is less accurate for zzso than benign zzso
