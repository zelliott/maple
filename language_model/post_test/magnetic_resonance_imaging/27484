Chemical species separation techniques in image space are prone to incorporate several zzso Some of these are signal zzso in borders and geometrical zzso from field zzso These errors come from zzso zzso time zzso In this work, we present a new approach for chemical species separation in zzso with simultaneous zzso of field map and zzso zzso formulated entirely in zzso In this approach, the time map is used to model the phase zzso from zzso zzso and also the zzso zzso due to zzso Our technique fits the signal model directly in zzso with the acquired data minimizing the zzso with an zzso zzso Standard two zzso zzso echo sequences in the zzso and head were used for demonstrating the zzso With this approach, we were able to obtain excellent zzso for the species, the field zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results do not suffer from geometric zzso derived from the chemical shift or the field zzso zzso as the zzso map is well zzso the species signal in borders is correctly zzso Considering zzso time variations in a complete signal model in zzso for separating species yields superior zzso of the variables of interest when compared to existing zzso
