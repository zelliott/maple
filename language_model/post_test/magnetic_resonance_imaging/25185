zzso of central zzso zzso zzso found in high density in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exerts an zzso effect in various experimental seizure zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso zzso binding is reduced in human zzso zzso PET imaging was performed using the zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso lobe zzso and normal zzso 

zzso and PET were performed using zzso and zzso in 10 controls and in 12 patients with zzso lobe zzso confirmed on zzso zzso patients also underwent zzso zzso Using quantitative PET image analysis, regional values were obtained for zzso volume of distribution zzso cerebral blood flow zzso and zzso cerebral zzso rate zzso zzso volume zzso was also measured with zzso zzso V PET and MR measures were compared within patients and controls using paired zzso grouped comparisons were made with two sample zzso 

Lower zzso V was found zzso than zzso to the zzso focus in inferior zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso regions of patients zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso 52 zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso V was zzso lower in zzso and zzso lower in the zzso zzso region of patients than zzso In zzso mean zzso V asymmetry index zzso was significantly greater than mean zzso and mean zzso zzso Mean zzso V zzso in zzso was greater than mean zzso zzso but the difference was not zzso 

These findings support the hypothesis of reduced zzso zzso binding in zzso lobe zzso zzso
