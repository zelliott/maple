The objective of our study was to compare zzso with zzso for the evaluation of zzso muscle zzso and fatty zzso 

zzso shoulders in 39 patients who had undergone shoulder zzso for the assessment of rotator cuff disease were evaluated blindly with zzso zzso muscle zzso was zzso assessed by calculating the occupation ratio zzso surface area of the zzso muscle belly divided by that of its zzso This was done by zzso on zzso the equivalent of the zzso view on zzso zzso zzso was assessed by evaluating zzso muscle zzso compared with that of the zzso muscle and zzso zzso The occupation ratio and fatty zzso of the zzso muscle on zzso were compared with these findings on zzso 

zzso ratios calculated on zzso images ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and correlated with the ratios calculated on zzso (R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All 20 shoulders with no fatty zzso on zzso had normal zzso and a zzso pattern on zzso Eight of the 10 shoulders with mild fatty zzso on zzso had an effaced zzso pattern and mild zzso on zzso In 13 of the 15 shoulders with moderate to severe fatty zzso on zzso the zzso pattern was absent and marked zzso was present on zzso 

Our study suggests that there is a good correlation between zzso and zzso for the assessment of zzso muscle zzso and fatty zzso
