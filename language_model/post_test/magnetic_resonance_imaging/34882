The zzso zzso zzso was studied with regard to its zzso and zzso as well as its utility in evaluating brain zzso function in primates before and after zzso zzso treatment using zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma analysis of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso during PET scanning enabled kinetic analysis of zzso zzso A separate study examined brain zzso metabolism in zzso monkeys zzso 60 or 120 zzso after zzso zzso Almost zzso of total plasma zzso activity was associated with zzso and zzso 120 zzso after zzso zzso The zzso signal accumulated zzso in zzso areas such as zzso and zzso This bilateral zzso signal was disrupted after unilateral zzso artery zzso zzso infusion which reduced zzso zzso zzso A three compartment three kinetic rate constant model for zzso zzso revealed reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso after unilateral zzso although a further decrease was not evident after intravenous zzso zzso was the major zzso species in all brain regions except in zzso where zzso was zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso was most concentrated in zzso areas whereas lower levels occurred in areas containing few zzso zzso These data demonstrate preferential zzso metabolism and zzso retention in zzso tissue and support the use of zzso to evaluate normal and abnormal zzso zzso
