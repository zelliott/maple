Our objective was to identify clinical zzso of progressive white matter zzso 

We evaluated 133 infants of zzso weeks of gestation at birth from 2 university zzso zzso underwent zzso twice, initially when in stable condition for transport and again at zzso age or before transfer or zzso Two zzso who were blinded to the clinical course graded zzso white matter injury severity by using a validated zzso Potential risk factors were extracted from medical zzso 

Twelve zzso zzso had progressive white matter zzso In the zzso analysis of 10 newborns without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infection and chronic lung disease were associated with progressive white matter zzso Exposure to multiple episodes of zzso infection significantly increased the risk of progressive white matter zzso Of the 11 zzso with zzso infection, zzso (4 zzso had progressive injury, compared with zzso (6 zzso of those with zzso zzso Of the 35 infants with chronic lung disease, zzso (6 zzso had progressive injury, compared with zzso (4 zzso of those without chronic lung zzso After adjustment for zzso age at birth, the association between infection and white matter injury persisted, whereas chronic lung disease was no longer a statistically significant risk zzso 

zzso zzso infection is an important risk factor for progressive white matter injury in premature zzso This is consistent with emerging evidence that white matter injury is attributable to zzso precursor zzso to zzso zzso and zzso
