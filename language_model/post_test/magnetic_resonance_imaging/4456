The value of zzso weighted zzso sequences with selective fat suppression zzso in the detection and differential diagnosis of focal liver zzso was compared to zzso sequences and conventional zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso sequences at zzso 

In 50 patients with focal liver zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were zzso Two independent readers evaluated the sequences with regard to the image quality, fat suppression, and the number and zzso of liver zzso zzso analysis was performed by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

From a total of 118 liver zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso sequence showed zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso liver zzso was zzso higher on the zzso sequence compared to the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso With the exception of zzso zzso there was no significant difference of zzso in benign zzso on both zzso zzso 

With regard to zzso detection the zzso sequence is superior to the zzso sequence without fat suppression, whereas it is inferior to the zzso sequence in the differential diagnosis of benign and zzso zzso
