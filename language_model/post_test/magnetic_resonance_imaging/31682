zzso experiments have identified several brain regions that appear to play roles in motor zzso Here we apply a novel zzso zzso approach to explore the dynamic interactions of brain zzso regions as zzso coherent functional zzso We acquired zzso zzso signal during explicit motor sequence learning task to characterize the zzso functional changes in the early phase of motor zzso zzso practiced a zzso visually zzso fixed motor sequence during 15 consecutive 30 s practice blocks zzso with similarly cued random sequence zzso zzso Independent zzso Analysis zzso zzso the data into statistically independent zzso zzso Two components were identified that represented zzso zzso The first component showed decreasing activity of a zzso network during task zzso The other exclusively related to sequence learning blocks showed zzso in a network including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Variation in expression of this component across individual subjects correlated with differences in zzso Relative zzso also were found in patterns similar to those described previously as zzso zzso zzso Some of these zzso components also showed zzso and zzso zzso and were related to the behavioral zzso The zzso zzso within these networks suggests that their elements are functionally zzso Their anatomical zzso and correlation with behavioral measures also suggest that this approach allows characterization of the interactions of functional networks relevant to the zzso zzso value for zzso zzso methods such as zzso lies in the potential for generating hypotheses regarding functional anatomical networks underlying specific zzso
