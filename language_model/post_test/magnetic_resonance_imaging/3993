Twenty-five schizophrenic patients diagnosed by zzso underwent zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were measured using an auditory zzso zzso zzso and zzso volumes of the superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso structure were measured from zzso zzso images using the level of the zzso body as an anatomical zzso Principal component analysis of zzso zzso and zzso disclosed two zzso independent factors each: overall zzso and zzso and zzso from zzso and anterior recordings, zzso zzso volumes consisted of four zzso independent factors: left superior zzso volume, anterior zzso zzso volume, right superior zzso volume, and zzso zzso zzso zzso The factor score of the zzso zzso from zzso recordings correlated with the factor score of zzso changes in the anterior zzso zzso zzso The present study failed to replicate a previously reported association between auditory zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso Furthermore, the factor score of the zzso zzso was correlated with the severity of clinical ratings of zzso zzso and positive thought zzso These findings demonstrate that the information processing dysfunction of schizophrenia indicated by reduced zzso zzso is associated with structural zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
