To evaluate the zzso zzso networks in a homogeneous group of patients with acute mild traumatic brain injury zzso and to identify zzso in functional connectivity induced by zzso 

Thirty-five patients with acute zzso and 35 healthy control subjects, matched in age, zzso zzso and education, underwent zzso zzso zzso weighted imaging, zzso and zzso symptom zzso We ensured the zzso of the patient group by limiting the injury mechanism to zzso zzso zzso in functional connectivity were analyzed by using zzso independent component analysis, which is not biased by a zzso region zzso 

We found a decrease in functional connectivity within the zzso network in the zzso zzso At the same time, patients showed deficits in zzso speed as well as in speed of information zzso We propose that although disorders in motor function after zzso are rarely reported, injury still has an effect on motor zzso which in its turn may also explain the reduction in speed of information zzso Further, we found a cluster of increased functional connectivity in the right zzso network in the zzso zzso We suggest that this abnormal increased connectivity might reflect increased awareness to external environment and explain excessive cognitive fatigue reported by patients with zzso It might also zzso the physical zzso symptoms, such as headache and increased sensitivity to zzso 

We proved that zzso functional connectivity is altered early zzso 4 weeks) after zzso suggesting that changes in functional networks zzso the cognitive deficits and zzso complaints reported by patients with zzso
