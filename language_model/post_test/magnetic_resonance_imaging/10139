The neural networks associated with processing zzso word zzso were investigated in normal adults using zzso zzso listened to sets of three adjectives and decided whether the last two had a similar zzso One condition required zzso the literal meaning of the middle word zzso zzso whereas the other condition required zzso its zzso or zzso meaning zzso zzso zzso comparison of the zzso zzso literal condition showed reliable activity only in left prefrontal and zzso zzso These results argue against a selective role of the right zzso zzso in zzso zzso word zzso In line with a growing literature, these findings suggest that prior reports of greater zzso involvement for zzso language might reflect the increased complexity of figurative language rather than an zzso specialization for understanding zzso
