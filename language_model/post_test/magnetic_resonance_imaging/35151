A distinct type of zzso rotator cuff tear has been observed in overhead athletes, characterized by partial failure of the zzso of the zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso with zzso zzso We present a technique of zzso zzso repair using zzso mattress zzso designed for the management of zzso zzso zzso zzso After tear evaluation and preparation, the torn rotator cuff zzso is held in a reduced position with a zzso through an zzso rotator zzso portal while viewing zzso Two spinal needles are then placed zzso through the full thickness of the torn and intact rotator zzso A zzso zzso is passed through each needle, retrieved out the anterior portal, and used to shuttle a single zzso zzso 2 zzso through the zzso creating a mattress zzso Multiple mattress zzso can be placed as dictated by tear size and zzso with zzso retrieval and knot securing then proceeding in the zzso zzso We have adopted this approach with the goals of zzso zzso the rotator cuff zzso and zzso the area of zzso zzso while preventing significant zzso to the anatomy of the rotator cuff zzso which could lead to motion deficits, internal zzso and potential tear zzso
