zzso has recently been introduced as a promising method of monitoring the transplanted pancreatic zzso zzso with zzso iron oxide zzso However, the traditional zzso see zzso approach frequently yields ambiguous results because of the negative contrast of the zzso particles on the background of other body zzso This obstacle could be overcome with the use of a novel method known as zzso steady state free zzso zzso generating positive contrast in the presence of zzso zzso 

In zzso we achieved exact zzso and clear positive contrast zzso of human zzso zzso zzso Using the proposed method we demonstrated the ability to detect even a single pancreatic zzso against a homogeneous zzso 

In zzso experiments in rats confirmed reliable and accurate zzso of transplanted zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso technique could successfully zzso zzso human and rat pancreatic zzso yielding a positive zzso
