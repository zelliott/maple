To investigate the MR findings of zzso zzso and the zzso area of zzso of the zzso head zzso for each of the zzso zzso 

zzso hips in 29 patients (15 female, 14 zzso mean age 38 years, range zzso zzso were zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo pulse sequences zzso zzso zzso recalled echo pulse sequences zzso and fat suppression zzso zzso followed by zzso enhanced fat suppression zzso zzso were all obtained with the aid of a zzso surface zzso 

While a normal fat intensity area with a zzso band on zzso zzso zzso was seen in 16 of 16 stage 1 zzso nine of 11 stage 2 zzso four of 17 stage 3 zzso and none of five stage 4 hips, all hips showed peripheral rim enhancement on zzso zzso This enhancement band on zzso corresponded to zzso findings of zzso zzso bone, repaired zzso and zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso zzso was also clearly demonstrated as a zzso high-intensity area outside this enhancement band on zzso in two stage 2 zzso 12 stage 3 zzso and one stage 4 hip zzso In cases at stage 2 or more advanced stages with homogeneous or zzso low intensity on zzso zzso the zzso process both inside and outside the zzso zzso including bone zzso zzso was detected clearly on zzso zzso
