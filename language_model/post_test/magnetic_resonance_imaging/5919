zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inherited zzso zzso that leads to retinal zzso cell zzso and reduced visual acuity during the early decades of life, is mainly associated with zzso in the zzso zzso Here we report a novel zzso zzso associated with a new zzso zzso gene zzso 

The patient, a 62-year-old woman, was referred for zzso painless, and severe visual loss in her right zzso Acute visual loss in her left eye occurred a year after initial zzso zzso confirmed the diagnosis of isolated zzso bilateral zzso zzso We performed DNA sequencing of the entire coding sequence and the zzso junctions of the zzso zzso and we searched for the zzso DNA zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso by sequencing entirely zzso zzso zzso respiratory chain complex activity and zzso zzso were investigated in skin zzso from the patient and zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 27 of the zzso zzso resulting in an zzso acid change zzso in the zzso This zzso which affects a highly zzso zzso zzso has not been previously reported, and was absent in 400 control zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis did not reveal any zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or any zzso zzso The investigation of skin zzso from the patient revealed a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a larger proportion of short zzso than in zzso 

The presence of an zzso zzso indicates that this zzso zzso acute case of zzso zzso is related to zzso and to a zzso energetic zzso This suggests that the zzso screening of the zzso gene would be justified in zzso cases of zzso nerve zzso with no evident zzso
