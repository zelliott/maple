We introduce a fast technique, based on the principles of the zzso zzso zzso measurement zzso to rapidly acquire the data for accurate maps of zzso in three zzso The acquisition time has been shortened considerably by zzso the acquisition of the zzso phase zzso zzso Using this technique, the data for a 256 zzso 128 zzso 32 zzso zzso measurement can be acquired in zzso zzso zzso zzso made in zzso with zzso between 200 and 1200 zzso had an accuracy of zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso made in normal brain using the fast zzso sequence corresponded well with zzso fast zzso zzso
