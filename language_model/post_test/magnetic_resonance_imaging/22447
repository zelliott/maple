zzso language functions are largely zzso by standard techniques such as the zzso test and cortical zzso Language studies in which zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging are used to record data while the patient performs zzso tasks have enabled researchers to perform independent brain mapping for zzso and frontal language functions zzso is used for zzso and zzso imaging for frontal zzso In this case report, the authors describe a right-handed patient in whom a zzso insular zzso was zzso The patient had a zzso receptive language area, but expressive language function was identified in the left zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed in 20 right-handed patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso for careful comparison with and interpretation of this patient's zzso In these tests, all patients were asked to generate zzso related to zzso presented nouns zzso zzso for zzso imaging, and to categorize as abstract or concrete a set of visually presented words consisting of three Japanese letters for zzso imaging and zzso The most prominent display of zzso imaging zzso by the zzso task was observed in the left inferior and middle frontal zzso in all participants, including the patient presented zzso zzso zzso identified with the zzso categorization task were concentrated in the superior zzso and zzso zzso in the left zzso in all control zzso In this patient, however, the right superior zzso region demonstrated significantly stronger zzso on zzso and zzso imaging with the zzso categorization zzso zzso zzso of the language functions was successfully mapped with these two imaging zzso and was validated by the modified zzso test and the zzso neurological zzso The authors describe detailed functional profiles obtained in this patient and review the cases of four previously described patients in whom zzso language functions were zzso
