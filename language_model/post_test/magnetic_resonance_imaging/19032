zzso stimulation of the zzso nucleus constitutes a therapeutic advance for severely disabled patients with Parkinson zzso 

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuous bilateral zzso stimulation of the zzso nucleus in patients with Parkinson zzso 

A prospective study of patients with Parkinson disease treated at a university zzso 

zzso were implanted zzso in the zzso nucleus of 23 consecutive patients with Parkinson disease who responded well to zzso but had severe motor zzso There were 16 men and 7 women zzso zzso zzso age, 53 zzso 2 zzso who had a mean zzso zzso disease duration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso magnetic resonance imaging, combined with zzso zzso recordings and zzso 

Six months after surgery, motor zzso zzso motor zzso zzso and the daily dose of zzso equivalent decreased significantly by zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared with the zzso zzso No significant morbidity was observed, except transient depression in 4 zzso 

The beneficial effects of zzso stimulation depend on zzso the criteria used for patient selection, zzso the precision with which the zzso nucleus is targeted zzso on the zzso magnetic resonance imaging and the zzso zzso and clinical zzso and zzso the long-term zzso adjustment of stimulation zzso
