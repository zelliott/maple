zzso zzso swelling with pitting zzso due to altered zzso drainage has been reported in some patients with zzso arthritis zzso The zzso usually affected the upper limbs in an zzso pattern and was resistant to zzso We describe 2 additional zzso The zzso swelling and pitting zzso responded promptly and completely to zzso in the first patient but persisted in the zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso revealed a zzso zzso in the hand without zzso in the first patient, and impaired zzso drainage without zzso sheath involvement in the zzso We conclude that 2 different mechanisms, characterized by a different response to therapy, may be associated with the same clinical picture of zzso swelling with pitting zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso are useful in defining the structures involved and in predicting the zzso
