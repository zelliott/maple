Previous studies have shown that zzso bone zzso zzso not seen on zzso bone zzso zzso might be present on zzso PET scans or at zzso zzso we evaluated the effect of zzso or zzso zzso PET zzso zzso imaging on the management of patients with newly diagnosed lung zzso 

zzso patients with small cell lung cancer or locally advanced zzso cell lung cancer were zzso examined with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso column, and zzso zzso zzso and all available imaging methods, as well as the clinical course, were used as reference zzso zzso with and without zzso and zzso PET were compared using a zzso scale for receiver operating characteristic zzso curve zzso 

Twelve patients had zzso zzso produced 6 zzso zzso produced 1 zzso and zzso PET produced no zzso The area under the zzso curve was zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The areas under the zzso curve of zzso PET and zzso zzso by zzso were not significantly different, and both zzso methods were significantly more accurate than zzso zzso As a result of zzso or zzso PET imaging, clinical management was changed in 5 patients zzso or 6 patients zzso zzso 

As indicated by the area under the zzso curve analysis, zzso PET is the most accurate zzso imaging zzso for screening for zzso zzso performed zzso imaging is zzso is zzso and improves the accuracy of zzso
