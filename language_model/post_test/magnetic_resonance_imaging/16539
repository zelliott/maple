to evaluate the role of childhood intelligence and white matter zzso zzso in the prediction of the trajectory of fluid intelligence in healthy old people from age 78 to zzso 

zzso follow-up study from 1999 to zzso 

a university teaching hospital in Aberdeen, zzso 

a total of 106 volunteers born in 1921, with childhood intelligence records at 11, recruited zzso to a follow-up zzso 

participants underwent brain zzso in zzso to obtain zzso of brain zzso using zzso scale and a test of fluid intelligence zzso Progressive zzso on three occasions between 1999 and zzso 

in a zzso growth model, we found a significant association between childhood intelligence and the zzso but not the zzso of fluid cognitive ability in late zzso Similarly, baseline zzso score was associated with the intercept of late life cognitive ability, but not the zzso Age at imaging was associated with slope but not zzso There was no significant association between sex and intercept or slope of late life cognitive zzso 

results suggest that brain zzso measures of zzso zzso to cerebrovascular disease) and childhood intelligence significantly contribute to late life fluid cognitive ability but not to the trajectory of age-related change in fluid zzso We also show that age is associated with the cognitive trajectory from 78 to 81 years, even within our narrow age range zzso This may be a consequence of the recruitment pattern, with those having greater zzso burden, and who subsequently declined, being recruited later in the zzso
