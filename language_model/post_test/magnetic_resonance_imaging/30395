zzso zzso models express the zzso zzso zzso level zzso signal as a zzso zzso functional of the zzso sequence of local neural zzso Several models have been proposed for both the neural activity and the zzso We compare two such combined models: the original balloon model with a zzso neural model zzso zzso Turner, & Price, zzso and an extended balloon model with a more sophisticated neural model zzso zzso zzso & Liu, zzso We learn the parameters of both models using a zzso approach, where the distribution of the parameters zzso on the data is estimated using zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso Using a zzso zzso procedure zzso Anderson, & Hansen, zzso we compare the zzso abilities of the models as well as their zzso for both synthetic and real data, recorded from two different visual stimulation zzso The results show that the simple model is the better one for these zzso
