zzso of the cerebral zzso is dependent on cerebral blood flow zzso The assessment of cerebral zzso in patients with acute stroke, in a clinically relevant time frame, could be of utmost importance for patient selection before zzso zzso In individual patients, quantitative mapping of zzso to indicate the severity and potential zzso of zzso damage can be used to predict which brain tissue will be salvaged with zzso or die without it zzso as well as which brain tissue is already zzso Recent investigations of zzso CT have shown major advances in the assessment of acute stroke zzso zzso CT offers a number of practical advantages over other cerebral zzso imaging methods as it can be performed immediately after zzso CT, and used, in general, to exclude cerebral zzso It is fast zzso procedure time zzso zzso and does not require specialized computer zzso The accuracy of cerebral zzso maps has been demonstrated for normal and decreased zzso value by comparison with xenon CT used as a gold zzso zzso CT zzso and zzso maps provide a potential zzso ratio zzso (or zzso Stroke zzso defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso This index is correlated with the improvement of the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso in case of zzso zzso Also, the size of the zzso area zzso + zzso is correlated with the zzso score on hospital zzso Further studies may demonstrate the use of zzso CT for the assessment of zzso dynamics in zzso brain zzso zzso CT is now ready to be used in clinical trials as a decision-making tool to tailor more precisely the zzso therapy to the individual zzso
