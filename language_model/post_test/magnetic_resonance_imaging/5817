zzso of zzso zzso muscle positions is of increasing interest in wide spectrum of clinical zzso zzso zzso relative positioning of the zzso muscles between the zzso zzso and the left zzso free wall is of zzso A zzso method for determination of zzso muscle positions has not been zzso In this study a new zzso wall arc zzso zzso method for measuring zzso muscle positions is zzso The zzso of the zzso method between zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso and between observers is zzso 

Twenty subjects with structurally normal hearts in whom both zzso and ECHO were performed in 2007 were included in the zzso zzso muscle positions were determined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of the methods was assessed by calculating correlation zzso and the mean difference from zzso 

The zzso correlation of the zzso method was zzso zzso zzso zzso for both zzso zzso The mean difference of zzso from agreement was zzso for the superior and zzso for the inferior zzso zzso The zzso correlation was zzso zzso zzso zzso for superior and zzso zzso zzso zzso for inferior zzso zzso The mean zzso difference from agreement was zzso for superior and zzso for inferior zzso zzso 

The zzso method may be applied in wide range of both scientific and clinical medical fields as a zzso method for determination of zzso muscle positions with the benefit of zzso of relative zzso muscle positions both from the zzso and the free zzso
