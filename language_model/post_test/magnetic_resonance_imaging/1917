To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso in detecting soft zzso zzso and zzso injury after multiple ligament knee injury, including knee zzso 

A retrospective search was performed for patients presenting with reported knee dislocation from May 1993 through May 2000 who underwent both zzso and surgical zzso zzso patients met these criteria (15 men and six zzso age range 14 to 75 years; mean zzso zzso zzso resonance diagnoses of soft tissue and zzso injury were compared with the patients' operative zzso zzso of the zzso vessels was performed in zzso of our zzso patients, and the results of these studies are zzso 

Multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and neural injuries were zzso There was excellent correlation zzso zzso zzso between the magnetic resonance and operative findings with regard to the size and location of zzso Regarding zzso tears, the type zzso bucket, zzso split, zzso zzso and location correlated well with zzso All ten nerve injuries noted on magnetic resonance were confirmed at zzso Six of our patients had both conventional zzso and zzso with 100 percent agreement between the zzso In one patient an zzso zzso in the zzso artery was seen on zzso and confirmed on conventional zzso zzso 

zzso is an accurate method of assessing soft zzso zzso and neural damage after knee zzso Our early experience with zzso zzso zzso is encouraging with complete agreement between the zzso and conventional zzso in patients who had both zzso
