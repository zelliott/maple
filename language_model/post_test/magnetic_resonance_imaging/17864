zzso zzso zzso zzso and acute phase zzso may be increased before arthritis becomes clinically zzso suggesting that the processes underlying zzso arthritis zzso start zzso Whether local inflammation occurs in the zzso phase is zzso zzso we studied the small zzso of zzso positive zzso patients for local zzso zzso 

Imaging was performed using zzso T zzso zzso zzso hand or foot zzso of 21 zzso positive zzso patients without clinical arthritis were zzso For comparison, hand and foot zzso of 22 zzso positive zzso patients and 19 symptom free controls were zzso Within zzso positive zzso patients, painful and symptom free joint regions were zzso zzso was performed according to the zzso zzso in zzso Clinical Trials zzso zzso Arthritis zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed on joint region level and focused on inflammation zzso plus bone zzso zzso 

The mean combined inflammation scores of the zzso zzso zzso of controls, painful zzso of zzso positive zzso patients and zzso positive zzso patients were zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso Likewise, the mean combined inflammation scores of the wrist were zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso and that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso At the zzso zzso the combined inflammation score was significantly correlated with C zzso protein and zzso zzso rate levels zzso and zzso zzso 

The present data suggest that local zzso inflammation occurs in zzso positive zzso zzso
