zzso image analysis is important for studies of cartilage changes in knee zzso zzso This study describes an evaluation of a zzso cartilage zzso software tool capable of zzso paired images for potential use in zzso studies of knee zzso We describe the methodology behind the analysis and demonstrate its use by determination of zzso analysis precision of duplicate knee magnetic resonance imaging zzso data zzso 

zzso knee MR images of 12 subjects with a range of knee health were evaluated from the zzso Initiative zzso pilot MR zzso Each subject was removed from the magnet between the two zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slice zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso zzso images were obtained on a zzso zzso Trio MR system with a USA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of one zzso series was first performed and then the corresponding zzso series was segmented by viewing both image series zzso in two adjacent zzso After manual registration of the series, the first zzso cartilage outline served as an initial estimate for the second zzso We evaluated zzso measures of the bone and cartilage surface area zzso and zzso cartilage volume zzso and mean thickness zzso for zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed using the zzso square zzso of variation zzso zzso 

For the paired zzso zzso zzso % ranged from zzso to zzso for zzso from zzso to zzso for zzso from zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso to zzso for zzso 

zzso image analysis improved the measurement precision of cartilage zzso Our results are in agreement with other publications supporting the use of paired analysis for zzso studies of knee zzso
