The aim of this work is to investigate and compare cardiac zzso density zzso weighted fast field echo zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging with standard cardiac zzso imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT zzso as well as zzso 

Two human zzso zzso underwent cardiac zzso and zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The cardiac zzso images were compared to each other as well as to zzso and autopsy zzso 

For the first case, cardiac zzso exhibited a focal region of low signal in zzso zzso and zzso zzso images, surrounded by a signal intense rim in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not appear to identify any focal zzso zzso inspection identified a blood zzso zzso confirmed this to be a zzso with an adhering zzso zzso In the second case, a zzso zzso with heart zzso was identified in all zzso images, located at the anterior wall of the left zzso zzso excluded additional zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso images, it occurred zzso while resulting in small clustered zzso spots in zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso and zzso zzso 

Presented initial results have shown zzso zzso to be a valuable imaging sequence in addition to traditional zzso zzso imaging for blood clots and zzso zzso with clearer contrast between affected and healthy zzso
