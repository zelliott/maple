The zzso mechanisms and neural zzso of Absolute zzso (AP) are not fully zzso The aim of this zzso study was to examine the neural network underlying zzso using a pitch memory experiment and contrasting two groups of musicians with each other, those that have zzso and those that do zzso 

We found a common zzso pattern for both groups that included the superior zzso zzso zzso extending into the adjacent superior zzso zzso zzso the inferior zzso zzso zzso extending into the adjacent zzso zzso zzso the zzso part of the inferior frontal zzso zzso the zzso motor area zzso and superior lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso differences were seen in the left zzso during the early zzso phase of the pitch memory task (more zzso in zzso zzso and in the right superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the early zzso phase zzso zzso and later working zzso zzso phase of the pitch memory task (more zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso trends were seen in the zzso zzso (more in zzso zzso and the zzso (more anterior zzso in the zzso group and more zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

Since the increased zzso of the left zzso in zzso musicians was observed during the early zzso zzso phase and since the zzso has been shown to be involved in categorization tasks, its zzso might suggest that zzso musicians involve categorization regions in tonal zzso The increased zzso of the right zzso in zzso musicians indicates either an increased use of regions that are part of a tonal working memory zzso network, or the use of a zzso zzso strategy such as the zzso of a zzso mapping scheme zzso imagining notes on a staff or using a spatial coding for their relative pitch zzso for pitch zzso
