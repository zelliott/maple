The current study explored how factors of zzso and zzso competition affect access to the zzso network during spoken word zzso An auditory semantic zzso zzso decision task was presented to subjects while in the MR zzso zzso pairs consisted of prime words with the initial zzso stop consonants zzso zzso and zzso followed by word and zzso zzso To examine the neural consequences of zzso and sound structure competition, zzso either had voiced minimal pair competitors or they did not, and they were either zzso modified to be poorer zzso of the zzso phonetic category or zzso zzso zzso associated with semantic zzso zzso zzso revealed a bilateral zzso zzso Within this network, clusters in the left zzso frontal zzso zzso left superior zzso zzso zzso and left zzso middle zzso zzso zzso showed sensitivity to zzso zzso The zzso also demonstrated sensitivity to acoustic zzso and the zzso showed an interaction between zzso competition and acoustic zzso These findings suggest the zzso zzso network is modulated by both zzso and zzso structure, and that the resolution of these two sources of competition recruits frontal zzso
