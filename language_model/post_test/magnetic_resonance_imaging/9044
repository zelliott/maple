To test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso had a protective effect on cerebral zzso zzso zzso injury in zzso 

zzso was induced by zzso zzso of middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso solution was delivered through an zzso tail zzso zzso via zzso pump 30 zzso after the zzso of zzso at a rate of zzso zzso zzso Neurological deficit score zzso and brain water content were determined 24 h after zzso zzso volume was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso and nerve cell death was studied under an electron zzso 

There was a zzso relationship among 10, 30 and 90 zzso zzso The 90 zzso zzso had the best protective effect among the 3 zzso We compared 90 zzso zzso group with normal saline group and found that zzso had a protective effect on cerebral zzso by the results of zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso at 6, 30 and 54 h after zzso showed smaller zzso volume in 90 zzso group compared with 0 zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), and electron microscope showed less nerve cell death in 90 zzso group compared with 0 zzso zzso 

zzso has a zzso protective effect on cerebral zzso
