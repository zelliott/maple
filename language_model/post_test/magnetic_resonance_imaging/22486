To demonstrate the ability of a unique zzso MR system to be used safely and effectively as the only imaging zzso for all zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

An experimental disease model of zzso zzso was created in six zzso An zzso MR system, which employed previously reported tools for real-time zzso tracking with automated zzso zzso zzso image zzso and zzso zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso imaging coupled with a high-speed reconstruction technique, was then used to guide all zzso of the intervention, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deployment, and confirmation of therapeutic zzso zzso and zzso X-ray imaging was used as a gold standard to validate the experimental zzso 

All of the zzso zzso interventions were a technical success and were performed without zzso The average zzso residual zzso was zzso The image guidance enabled the zzso to be deployed with an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, using this zzso zzso system to guide zzso artery zzso significantly reduces the procedure time, as compared to using X-ray zzso 

This study has clearly demonstrated the first successful treatment of zzso artery zzso in an experimental animal model solely under zzso guidance and zzso
