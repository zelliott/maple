Review of results of experimental and clinical studies indicates that the zzso of zzso impaired but potentially zzso tissue surrounding the central core of focal cerebral zzso that develops shortly after onset of major conducting vessel zzso is complex and dynamic with severity and duration thresholds for hypoxic stress and injury that are specific to tissue site, cell type, molecular zzso or gene expression investigated and efficiency of collateral or residual flow and zzso Imaging methods that have been zzso in zzso to identify zzso and predict response to zzso and other protective therapies include magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso However, resolution of focal zzso characterized by zzso zzso or cellular zzso does not predict tissue survival, and imaging thresholds for resuscitation after zzso have not been determined zzso zzso stress protein induction represents an zzso protective mechanism that occurs in zzso but not core zzso A robust protective effect has been demonstrated during focal zzso in transgenic mice zzso zzso perhaps by suppressing early zzso c zzso Delayed zzso zzso zzso zzso can be detected with zzso zzso after brief episodes of transient focal zzso Future studies may define zzso zzso and zzso molecular zzso that can be exploited to improve outcome after temporary focal zzso
