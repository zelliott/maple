Technical case zzso 

To report an alternative to zzso for dual closure in minimally invasive spinal zzso 

zzso closure in minimally invasive spinal zzso tumor zzso can be technically zzso The zzso is a novel zzso device that was originally designed to facilitate coronary zzso zzso by obviating the need for zzso management and knot zzso Given its ability to achieve tissue approximation without knot zzso the zzso is ideal for zzso closure in the narrow surgical corridors provided by the zzso used in minimally invasive zzso 

We report the results of 2 cases in which the zzso device was used for zzso closure after minimally invasive spinal zzso of an zzso zzso 

Two patients presented with spinal zzso zzso Patient 1 presented with severe upper back pain and was found to have an zzso zzso mass at zzso causing severe spinal zzso zzso Patient 2 was zzso found to have an zzso mass causing significant zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso Both patients underwent minimally invasive tumor zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso closure was accomplished using the zzso device in conjunction with zzso zzso both patients were mobilized early and neither developed symptoms related to zzso fluid zzso 

zzso zzso closure can be achieved using the zzso device, thereby eliminating the difficulty associated with zzso management and knot tying during minimally invasive spinal zzso
