Three zzso bilateral imaging is the standard for most clinical breast dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso Because of high spatial resolution zzso requirement, the typical 1-2 zzso zzso resolution zzso afforded by a conventional zzso zzso echo zzso sequence zzso meaningful and accurate zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso The commercially available, zzso zzso zzso and data sharing zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso sequence was used in this study to perform zzso exams on thirty one patients (with 36 suspicious breast zzso before their zzso The zzso zzso was immediately followed by a zzso conventional zzso zzso zzso from each other, three zzso readers assessed agreements in multiple zzso zzso categories between the last set of zzso zzso images and the conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso test was used to evaluate zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso data were subjected to quantitative zzso zzso With a zzso zzso breast zzso the zzso sequence produced zzso images with 20 s or less zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences in zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratios between the zzso and conventional zzso zzso The agreements in zzso evaluations between the two image sets were excellent with the zzso agreement ranging from zzso for mass margin to zzso for zzso density and the zzso zzso value ranging from zzso zzso for zzso size to zzso zzso for background zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso data provided higher breast cancer diagnostic accuracy zzso specificity at zzso zzso than the current clinical practice of zzso and qualitative zzso zzso The zzso sequence may be used in clinical settings to acquire high zzso resolution breast zzso images for both precise zzso zzso characterization and accurate zzso zzso
