To compare zzso zzso placement with zzso zzso zzso zzso of carotid arteries with respect to zzso zzso and findings at zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging, and zzso zzso 

zzso was performed in zzso in one carotid artery, and zzso placement was performed in the other, in ten zzso (age range, zzso years; mean age, 68 zzso with severe zzso by using zzso and zzso US zzso The carotid artery was connected to a zzso tubing system in which a zzso pump circulated zzso The zzso water was collected during the interventions, and after zzso and zzso the zzso material was analyzed zzso After the interventions, the arteries were excised and zzso zzso MR imaging was zzso 

No difference in severity of zzso zzso during zzso placement versus during zzso was zzso The zzso particles were composed mainly of zzso strips and cellular constituents of the zzso zzso MR imaging accurately depicted zzso changes, and the findings correlated closely with those of zzso US and zzso zzso 

Although zzso placement and zzso were associated with equal zzso zzso the smooth surface and fully patent zzso zzso depicted at zzso US and MR imaging zzso may indicate that zzso placement is preferable to zzso
