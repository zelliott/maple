zzso zzso is found exclusively in zzso and their processes in the adult zzso Since the regional distribution of zzso may be zzso using magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso a regional measure of zzso density may be zzso zzso The technique may be particularly useful in the diagnosis of diseases where zzso are selectively injured, since these diseases do not result in definitive changes on conventional imaging zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether zzso measurement of zzso defects zzso loss following global zzso zzso was performed in rats 24 h after global zzso was induced by bilateral carotid zzso plus zzso zzso showed that zzso was decreased by zzso in vulnerable regions, including the cortex, zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, the zzso No change was observed in the brain stem or zzso zzso where zzso observed zzso was decreased also had zzso evidence of selective zzso necrosis and showed marked increase of zzso and zzso These results show that zzso detected loss of zzso in brain regions with selective zzso loss, suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso could detect zzso loss in a variety of disease states where there is selective zzso zzso
