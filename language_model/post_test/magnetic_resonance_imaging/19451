A high-resolution zzso zzso zzso segmented echo zzso imaging method was used for functional zzso zzso using a motor task at zzso zzso zzso images with an zzso resolution of 1 zzso and slice thickness of 4 zzso were obtained with good zzso matter zzso The zzso approach, combined with a short total zzso period of 82 zzso limits blurring effects for short zzso zzso (such as gray zzso assuring truly high-resolution zzso In all subjects, motor functions were clearly depicted in the zzso central zzso over several slices and sometimes zzso was detected in the supplementary motor area and/or zzso central zzso The average signal change of zzso was much higher than in standard zzso zzso zzso experiments, as a result of larger relative blood zzso
