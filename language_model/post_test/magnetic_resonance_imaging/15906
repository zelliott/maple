zzso boys' greater zzso fitness zzso V zzso has been attributed to their larger lean body mass zzso this bestowing a greater heart size and zzso larger maximum cardiac zzso No difference in peak zzso zzso difference is thought to zzso However other work indicates that boys' zzso fitness remains zzso higher even after controlling for differences in zzso zzso the purpose of this study was to investigate whether peak V zzso heart size, peak cardiac output and peak zzso difference would be comparable between a group of boys and girls with a similar zzso A group of 9 zzso boys and 9 zzso girls with a similar mean zzso zzso boys zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Left zzso mass zzso and end zzso volume zzso were measured using cardiac magnetic resonance zzso Peak V zzso was determined on a cycle zzso following an incremental exercise protocol to exhaustion, and cardiac output was recorded using zzso zzso zzso peak V zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso L zzso and zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso higher than girls' values, but there were no significant sex differences in peak cardiac output zzso L zzso zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Central factors of heart size and peak cardiac output are zzso to the zzso of the individual and sex zzso Sex differences in peripheral factors such as muscle zzso type profile, may affect zzso difference and zzso zzso boys' higher peak V zzso
