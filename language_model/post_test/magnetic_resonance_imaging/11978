zzso zzso zzso MR images of the normal human heart have been obtained from single cardiac cycles using a zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso equipped with conventional 10 zzso zzso zzso The present results demonstrate further technical improvements as compared to a previous report on the same subject zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso times of 139 zzso and 209 zzso were achieved by reducing the repetition time to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the spatial resolution to 32 zzso 128 or 48 zzso 128 measured data points, zzso The flip angle was zzso to 12 zzso zzso zzso of 60 zzso thick sections adjacent to the imaging plane resulted in a suppression of the blood signal and a clear zzso of the zzso Oblique rotation of the imaging slice provides convenient access to the anatomical long axis and short axis views of the zzso zzso images from separate zzso but at different cardiac zzso demonstrate that the effective time resolution is considerably less than the actual imaging zzso
