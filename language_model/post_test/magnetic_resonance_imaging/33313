To evaluate the degree and location patterns of zzso zzso injury in patients with prior anterior shoulder dislocation zzso 

zzso consecutive MR shoulder examinations in patients with a history of zzso and 20 consecutive MR examinations in patients without prior dislocation were zzso Two readers assessed for the presence and location of zzso and tearing in the zzso tendon, which was divided into three segments: superior, middle, and zzso The readers also documented the presence of anterior zzso tears, zzso zzso defects and zzso zzso zzso exact tests were performed to analyze the different types of pathology and their zzso 

zzso zzso and partial thickness and full thickness tears were more common in patients with a history of zzso zzso was found in zzso of the dislocation patients compared with zzso of the zzso zzso When zzso by location, the middle and inferior thirds were the most commonly affected with statistical significance zzso found in tearing of the inferior zzso zzso zzso tears, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were more common in the dislocation group with statistically significant associations with zzso in the middle and inferior thirds and tearing of the middle third zzso 

Our study suggests an association between middle and inferior zzso zzso pathology and prior anterior shoulder zzso Based on our results, careful MR assessment of the zzso zzso by the zzso is indicated in the setting of zzso as injury of this structure can be symptomatic and may be amenable to zzso
