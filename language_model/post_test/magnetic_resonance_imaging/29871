To determine the zzso of zzso zzso zzso scanning after acute zzso To assess the contribution of brain imaging to the diagnosis and management of stroke, and to estimate the costs, benefits and risks of different imaging strategies in order to provide data to inform national and local policy on the use of brain imaging in zzso 

A zzso model was developed to represent the zzso of care in acute stroke using zzso all patients within 48 hours' as the zzso against which to cost 12 alternative scan zzso 

zzso in zzso 

zzso were patients admitted to hospital with a first stroke and those managed as zzso 

The effect on functional outcome after zzso or zzso stroke, zzso or infections, of correctly administered zzso or other zzso of time to scan and stroke severity on diagnosis by CT or zzso on management, including length of stay, functional outcome, and zzso life years zzso of the diagnostic information provided by CT zzso the zzso zzso versus zzso of different strategies for use of CT after acute zzso 

Death and functional outcome at long-term zzso accuracy of CT and zzso cost of CT scanning by time of day and week; effect of CT diagnosis on change in health outcome, length of stay in hospital and zzso zzso of various scanning zzso 

CT is very sensitive and specific for zzso within the first 8 days of stroke zzso zzso scanning used in epidemiology studies suggests that the frequency of primary zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Aspirin increases the risk of zzso There were no reliable data on functional outcome or on the effect of zzso treatment given long term after zzso In zzso of patients with zzso stroke after zzso the cause is another zzso and mortality is high among zzso zzso A specific MR sequence zzso zzso is required to identify prior zzso zzso CT scanners were distributed zzso in Scotland, zzso provided CT scanning within 48 hours of stroke, and zzso within 7 days for zzso patients, but access out of hours was very zzso and for zzso was zzso The average cost of a CT brain scan for stroke was pounds zzso to pounds zzso in normal working hours and pounds zzso to pounds zzso out of zzso Average length of stay was greatest for severe strokes and those who survived in a dependent zzso For a cohort of 1000 patients aged zzso years, the policy zzso all strokes within 48 zzso cost pounds zzso and achieved zzso zzso The most cost-effective strategy was zzso all zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The least cost-effective was to zzso patients on zzso in a life-threatening condition immediately and the rest within 14 zzso 

In general, strategies in which most patients were scanned immediately cost least and achieved the most zzso as the cost of providing CT (even out of zzso was less than the cost of zzso zzso zzso independent survival by even a small proportion through early use of aspirin in the majority with zzso stroke, avoiding aspirin in those with zzso stroke, and appropriate early management of those who have not had a stroke, reduced costs and increased zzso
