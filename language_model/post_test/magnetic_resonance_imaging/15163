zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso is a juvenile zzso progressive zzso disorder characterized by bilateral loss of vision, central visual field zzso zzso vision zzso and zzso disc zzso zzso is most frequently associated with zzso in zzso zzso a zzso large zzso that zzso to zzso zzso studies in zzso patients have shown a zzso of retinal zzso cells zzso and a loss of zzso in the zzso zzso However little is known about the molecular mechanism and zzso of zzso due to the lack of appropriate in zzso zzso Here we report a first mouse model carrying a zzso site zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso a skipping of zzso 10 during transcript processing and leads to an zzso deletion of 27 zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed no evidence of a shortened zzso protein but a approximately 50% reduced zzso protein level supporting zzso as a major disease mechanism in zzso zzso zzso mice die in zzso during zzso with first notable zzso delay at zzso as detected by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso are viable and of normal zzso but exhibit an zzso loss of zzso that eventually zzso to a severe zzso of the zzso cell and nerve zzso zzso In addition zzso nerves of zzso mice showed a reduced number of zzso and a swelling and abnormal shape of the remaining zzso zzso in these zzso showed zzso zzso zzso All these defects zzso crucial features of zzso in humans and therefore document the zzso and importance of this model for future zzso
