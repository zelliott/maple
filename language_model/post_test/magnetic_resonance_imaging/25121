To describe the different imaging zzso for the evaluation of pathological changes in the cavernous zzso as well as to compile criteria for differential zzso Imaging of the cavernous zzso comprises the primary use of zzso zzso such as CT or zzso The continuing development of zzso zzso allows the depiction of zzso structures of the cavernous zzso with a high zzso reconstructions of the acquired data set allow a reliable evaluation especially of the zzso topography including the zzso of nerves and zzso zzso or bilateral structures can be zzso using zzso zzso is capable of demonstrating the course of the internal carotid artery and its involvement in zzso of the cavernous zzso this recent achievement has only been made available by use of the current short scanning zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso orientation, zzso using fat zzso techniques as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso are used to depict the soft parts of the cavernous zzso Care must be taken to cover all zzso detail including different signal zzso as multiple zzso zzso infectious or traumatic changes can be present zzso the zzso diagnosis of the cavernous zzso zzso and bilateral zzso of the cavernous zzso as well as vascular involvement represent additional criteria leading to the differential zzso The advent of dynamic sequences as well as diffusion and zzso weighted zzso have broadened the spectrum of diagnostic zzso Digital zzso zzso as an invasive technique is used during therapeutic procedures such as the local treatment of zzso or zzso zzso
