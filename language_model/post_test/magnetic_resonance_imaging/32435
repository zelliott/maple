To evaluate magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso for predicting the onset and spatial extent of zzso produced by focused ultrasound combined with a zzso contrast agent zzso GE zzso Milwaukee, zzso and to compare the resulting induced temperature increase and threshold for damage with those in studies performed without the zzso 

The experiments were approved by the animal care zzso zzso locations in the brains of 15 rabbits were zzso with various exposure parameters by using a zzso focused ultrasound zzso MR imaging was used to map the temperature rise and, along with light zzso to examine the zzso zzso of zzso created from zzso were compared with the resulting zzso by using zzso analysis and linear zzso The minimum acoustic power necessary for zzso creation was determined, and the apparent temperature threshold for damage was calculated with zzso zzso These thresholds were compared with prior work performed without the contrast zzso The heating induced with the zzso was compared with that in zzso performed without them by using a zzso zzso 

The MR zzso temperature zzso matched the shape of the zzso The diameters of zzso correlated well with diameters measured at contrast zzso MR imaging zzso difference between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso R zzso zzso The temperature increase with zzso was statistically larger zzso zzso zzso than for zzso performed without zzso In some locations zzso continuous wave zzso damage was observed along the ultrasound beam zzso The zzso acoustic power damage threshold was reduced by zzso for zzso zzso when compared with earlier studies performed without zzso The probability of producing zzso was 50% at a temperature increase of zzso degrees C, zzso degrees C lower than was observed earlier without the zzso 

MR zzso temperature zzso appeared to correlate with focused zzso zzso in the brain when zzso were present, even though the temperature appeared to be below the threshold for zzso zzso
