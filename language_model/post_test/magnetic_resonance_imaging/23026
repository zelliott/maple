zzso knowledge of in zzso ankle joint complex zzso zzso is critical for understanding zzso disease states and for improvement of surgical zzso This study investigated 6 zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the human zzso using a combined zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Five healthy zzso of living subjects were studied during three in zzso activities of the foot, including maximum zzso and zzso maximum zzso and zzso and three zzso positions in simulated stance zzso of zzso A three-dimensional zzso computer model of the zzso (including zzso zzso zzso and zzso was constructed using zzso MR images of the zzso The in zzso zzso position at each selected position of the foot was captured using two zzso positioned zzso In zzso zzso motion could then be reproduced by zzso the zzso images with the zzso zzso model in a virtual zzso zzso zzso From maximum zzso to zzso the arc of motion of the zzso joint zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly larger than that of the zzso joint zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso showed similar degrees of zzso and zzso zzso From maximum zzso to zzso all zzso and translations of the zzso joint were significantly larger than those of the zzso zzso From heel strike to zzso the zzso contribution from the zzso joint zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly larger than that of the zzso joint zzso zzso zzso zzso From zzso to toe off, internal rotation and inversion of the zzso joint zzso zzso zzso degrees and zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso were significantly larger than those of the zzso joint zzso zzso zzso degrees and zzso zzso zzso zzso Strong zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso was observed during in zzso zzso zzso The contribution of the zzso joint to active zzso was higher than that of the zzso joint, whereas the contribution of the zzso joint to active zzso was higher than that of the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso joint demonstrated larger motion during the early part of stance phase while the zzso joint contributes more motion during the later part of stance zzso The results add quantitative data to an in zzso database of zzso that can be used in clinical diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of the zzso after zzso
