To determine the efficacy and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso as front-line treatment in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 

From August 2004 to November 2007, 12 patients with stages zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were enrolled in a prospective trial of zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso therapeutic zzso For each patient, clinical examinations and imaging studies were used to document response to therapy using the The International Working Group response zzso All patients had zzso zzso zzso imaging to confirm expected zzso before zzso zzso in addition, three patients had an optional single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scan to estimate the absorbed radiation dose to the zzso and zzso zzso 

The study included seven women and five zzso The median age was 60 years zzso zzso Nine patients had zzso zzso tissue zzso of zzso or zzso three patients had grades 1-2 zzso zzso of zzso One patient who had been deemed stage zzso initially was found to have another zzso in her zzso muscle on zzso zzso zzso 2 weeks after zzso She was kept on trial although her disease was reclassified as stage IV due to this single additional zzso zzso Ten patients had a complete response and two partial response zzso within 3 months of zzso One patient had a recurrence in the upper zzso 6 months after an initial zzso he then received 30 zzso of zzso zzso zzso His disease later progressed again in the orbit and he is currently being considered for other zzso A second patient who attained a zzso has remained stable with no progression 12 months after zzso With a median follow-up time of 20 months zzso zzso zzso there were no cases of distant zzso zzso All 12 patients experienced grade I or II transient zzso during the first 3 months after enrollment in the zzso There were no episodes of grade III or IV zzso The estimated absorbed radiation dose to the zzso soft zzso was zzso zzso 10 times lower than that with zzso 

zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso is an effective and safe front-line treatment for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
