The objective of this study was to zzso zzso the fatty zzso of zzso zzso muscle due to zzso zzso injuries by using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso patients with suspected rotator cuff tear or zzso examined with MR zzso were included in the zzso The following images were obtained after injection of diluted zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso spin echo in the zzso zzso zzso was performed in the zzso plane using a zzso fast zzso shot zzso zzso zzso zzso changes were classified as normal, zzso and partial and complete tear according to MR zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso after measurement of signal intensity values within the region of interest zzso placed over zzso zzso Signal intensity zzso suppression ratio and zzso index were calculated with the values zzso Degrees of fatty zzso depicted in normal subjects and subjects with rotator cuff injuries were zzso Median zzso was used as descriptive zzso zzso suppression ratio was zzso zzso in normal subjects, whereas it was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso partial and complete tears, zzso zzso index was zzso zzso in normal zzso It was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso partial and complete tears, zzso The increase in degree of fatty zzso parallels the seriousness of zzso zzso zzso is a useful method for grading fat zzso within zzso zzso
