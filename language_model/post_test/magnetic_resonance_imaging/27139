In zzso iron load must be monitored to prevent complications from iron overload diseases such as zzso or zzso zzso While liver biopsy is the gold standard for determining in zzso iron load, zzso offers a zzso zzso MR zzso have been reported that estimate iron concentration in the liver and mimic relaxation characteristics of in zzso deposits of zzso None of these zzso take into account the size distribution of zzso which varies from patient to patient based on iron zzso We zzso stable and zzso zzso zzso zzso of different sizes that are easily characterized for several parameters that are necessary for modeling such as iron content and zzso zzso zzso s and zzso s were measured on a zzso zzso zzso zzso and followed a zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso T showed that signal zzso are dependent on the distribution of zzso around the zzso rather than the iron concentration zzso These particles can be used to study the effects of particle size, zzso distribution, and zzso fraction on zzso relaxation and may be of use in mimicking zzso in a phantom for zzso iron zzso
