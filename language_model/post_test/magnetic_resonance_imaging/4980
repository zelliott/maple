To compare the diagnostic performance of a zzso imaging zzso zzso and a zzso zzso imaging zzso for identifying zzso zzso zzso zzso in a rabbit zzso cancer zzso 

zzso zzso were injected into the zzso of 26 zzso Four weeks later, zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Two zzso independently reviewed the zzso set zzso zzso zzso and the zzso M set zzso zzso and zzso and recorded their confidence scores for zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analysis was performed to compare the area under the zzso curve zzso ) of the two imaging zzso zzso results were used as the reference zzso 

The zzso and sensitivity of the zzso M set were comparable to those of the zzso set zzso , for reader 1, zzso zzso P zzso zzso for reader 2, zzso zzso P zzso zzso sensitivity, for reader 1, zzso zzso for reader 2, zzso zzso P zzso zzso The specificity of the former was greater than that of the latter (for reader 1, zzso zzso P zzso zzso for reader 2, zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso images provided greater specificity than zzso for identifying zzso zzso whereas the zzso and sensitivity of the former were comparable to those of the zzso
