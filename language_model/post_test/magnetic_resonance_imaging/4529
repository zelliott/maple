This study examines the potential of zzso as a PET zzso in zzso imaging of benign and zzso zzso zzso 

Four patients with one or two benign zzso tumors zzso or zzso two patients with a tumor of borderline zzso and seven patients with zzso cancer were studied with zzso and PET before zzso CT or zzso were performed as a zzso zzso zzso was zzso by calculating zzso standardized zzso values zzso and the kinetic influx zzso zzso zzso 

zzso or borderline zzso tumors did not accumulate zzso whereas all zzso had significant zzso The mean zzso of the primary zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the mean Ki was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the distribution of zzso zzso was highly zzso in four of six zzso 

zzso cancer can be zzso with zzso and zzso This method also may be of value in the differential diagnosis between benign and zzso zzso zzso Due to zzso zzso and zzso limitations, the value of zzso PET in the staging of zzso cancer appears to be zzso
