zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso has proven useful in patients suspected of having zzso Delayed imaging is regularly performed up to 24 h zzso However, this procedure is time consuming and zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso imaging may be omitted in these zzso 

After clinical examination and standard zzso 71 patients were suspected of having 92 zzso zzso Before surgery, all patients underwent zzso after intravenous injection of 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained at 10 zzso and 1, 4 and 24 zzso and zzso was performed at 4 and 24 zzso zzso of zzso in all zzso were evaluated with respect to zzso and time of image zzso 

zzso yielded 58 zzso 20 zzso and 14 zzso results, with the zzso all less than 5 zzso zzso zzso in zzso In 52 of 58 zzso zzso zzso diagnosis could be established by zzso imaging without further information by zzso zzso In 10 of the 52 zzso zzso was necessary to confirm zzso zzso Imaging at 24 h was necessary in only 6 of 58 zzso zzso zzso 3 patients who had zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and 3 who had spinal zzso Thus, a diagnosis of zzso zzso could be established in 52 of 55 zzso zzso using a zzso imaging zzso 

With a zzso acquisition protocol that includes zzso imaging, zzso yields sufficient information in patients suspected of having zzso zzso Delayed imaging at 24 h is recommended only for patients who have small zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso spinal zzso or negative zzso at 4 zzso
