zzso has been attributed to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although patients with neglect may have defective visual zzso the nature of this exploration deficit has not been entirely zzso The purpose of this study is to learn how, compared with control subjects, a patient with neglect performs visual zzso 

The line zzso test is commonly used to detect and evaluate the performance of patients with unilateral or zzso spatial zzso We tested an experimental subject with left zzso neglect using an infrared eye monitoring zzso Thirteen right-handed healthy volunteers served as control zzso From different starting zzso positions, we assessed the direction of eye movements when the subjects initially oriented to the line, scanned the line, and then attempted to look at the center of the zzso 

Independent of starting zzso position, normal subjects most often initially orient to the left end of the line, scan zzso then look zzso to the zzso However, the eye movements in our experimental subject with neglect were directed to the right end of the line without any scanning or zzso eye movement back to the center of the zzso 

Our subject with neglect had defective line exploration that may be attributed to a directional zzso motor intentional zzso
