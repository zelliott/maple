zzso deficits have been reported in association with zzso psychosis zzso zzso in zzso matter zzso volumes have been documented in zzso subjects compared to healthy zzso However, the possible zzso between the findings of those two lines of research has been scarcely zzso 

To investigate the relationship between zzso deficits and zzso volume abnormalities in a zzso sample of zzso patients compared to healthy controls from the same geographical zzso 

zzso patients zzso and control subjects zzso were evaluated by zzso assessment zzso zzso Word Association zzso forward and backward zzso span zzso and magnetic resonance imaging using zzso zzso 

zzso analyses showed that prefrontal and zzso zzso volumes correlated significantly zzso zzso with cognitive performance in zzso zzso A similar pattern of direct correlations between zzso zzso volumes and cognitive impairment was seen in the schizophrenia zzso zzso In the control group, cognitive performance was directly correlated with zzso volume in the right zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso volumes zzso zzso analyses with zzso zzso as a predictor variable showed significantly greater positive correlation within the left inferior prefrontal zzso zzso in the zzso group relative to controls, and significantly greater negative correlation within the left zzso zzso in the control group relative to zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that cognitive deficits are directly related to brain volume abnormalities in frontal and zzso zzso in zzso subjects, most specifically in inferior portions of the zzso prefrontal zzso
