Nearly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by a zzso zzso decomposition of zzso zzso in air at 400 degrees zzso The presented synthetic route is simple, cost effective and allows to prepare the high-quality zzso particles in a large zzso The zzso particles were exploited for the development of magnetic zzso with the possible zzso in medicine and zzso For the purposes of the zzso zzso the zzso particles were simply dispersed in the zzso zzso The resulting zzso represents very effective and cheap oral negative contrast agent for zzso of the gastrointestinal tract and reveals excellent contrast properties, fully comparable with those obtained for commercial contrast zzso The results of the clinical research of this zzso contrast agent for imaging of the small zzso are zzso For zzso applications, the primary zzso of the prepared zzso zzso with zzso was zzso In this way, a highly efficient magnetic carrier for protein zzso was obtained as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso The zzso zzso resulted in a further increase in zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso and elimination of its zzso zzso the zzso of zzso allowed fast zzso zzso of proteins and their identification by zzso mass zzso
