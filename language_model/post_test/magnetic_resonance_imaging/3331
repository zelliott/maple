It remains unclear how the cerebral zzso of humans perceives taste zzso and whether or not such objective data about the brain show a correlation with the current widely used conventional methods of zzso sensory zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in the zzso profile between salty and sweet tastes in the human zzso The zzso profiles of functional zzso zzso data of the human taste zzso were analyzed using finite impulse response analysis for a direct interpretation in terms of the zzso time zzso Also, zzso sensory evaluations for tastes were performed under the same condition as zzso to confirm the reliability of the zzso profile in the zzso zzso The zzso profile for the brain zzso due to a salty taste changed more rapidly than those due to a sweet taste in the human brain zzso and was also similar to the zzso sensory zzso confirming the reliability of the zzso profile of the zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso profile using finite impulse response analysis for zzso data showed that there was a zzso difference in the neural responses between salty and sweet tastes over a given period of zzso This indicates that there might be zzso zzso profiles of zzso in the human zzso
