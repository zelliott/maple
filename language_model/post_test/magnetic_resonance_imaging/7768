To investigate whether zzso of zzso bone structure can already be found in young zzso subjects with knee zzso 

Forty-eight subjects with neutral, mild zzso severe zzso and zzso knee joint alignment were included in this study (12 subjects in each zzso zzso and texture parameters of the zzso bone in the zzso zzso were determined using zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso zzso thickness in the zzso zzso compartment was lower in the zzso group zzso zzso standard error, zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and severe zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso dimension was significantly greater in the mild zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and severe zzso groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

The observed findings may be signs of the adaptation of the zzso bone to altered loading conditions and possibly of early knee joint zzso
