This work evaluates the performance of zzso zzso to determine the sample geometry with high spatial accuracy from zzso MR zzso In particular, we show that by applying such zzso methods it is possible to reconstruct the internal and external contours of the object with a spatial precision that zzso the nominal spatial resolution of the image by more than one order of zzso Special attention is paid to find the spatial resolution and zzso ratio required by the described zzso methodology to achieve a desired spatial zzso Finally, we discuss the potential application of this image processing approach for zzso quality control of zzso rubber materials, where zzso spatial precision has to be achieved from images measured in short experimental zzso The results presented here prove that the sensitivity of mobile zzso sensors is enough to achieve the spatial accuracy required to proof check the production of zzso rubber fittings in acceptable experimental zzso
