To delineate the cardiac magnetic resonance zzso appearances of cardiovascular disease zzso in patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso 

zzso MR was performed on 22 patients with zzso with previous zzso and 11 matched zzso late zzso contrast enhancement zzso to identify areas of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on the same zzso 

Twenty female and two male patients zzso zzso was seen in zzso subjects in the zzso group zzso with previous zzso zzso and zzso in the control zzso zzso detected zzso abnormalities in zzso patients with zzso 

The cardiac MR appearance of zzso in these patients with zzso was suggestive of coronary disease, rather than cumulative inflammatory muscle zzso zzso MR detected more abnormalities than zzso Further studies of cardiac MR in patients with zzso are warranted to investigate these preliminary zzso
