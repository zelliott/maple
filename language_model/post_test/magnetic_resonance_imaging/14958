There have been few attempts to integrate zzso and cognitive models of obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso although this might constitute a key approach to clarify the complex zzso of the zzso Our study aimed to explore the neural zzso underlying dysfunctional beliefs hypothesized by cognitive models to be involved in the development and maintenance of zzso We obtained a high-resolution magnetic resonance image from fifty zzso patients and 30 healthy controls, and correlated them, zzso with the severity of zzso dysfunctional beliefs assessed by the zzso Beliefs zzso In healthy controls, significant negative correlations were observed between anterior zzso lobe zzso volume and scores on zzso of uncertainty and zzso to control zzso No significant correlations between zzso zzso and regional gray matter volumes were observed in zzso zzso A zzso zzso analysis detected that the zzso was zzso smaller in zzso zzso On splitting subjects into zzso and zzso subgroups, we observed that such brain structural differences between zzso patients and healthy controls were explained by significantly larger ATL volumes among healthy subjects from the zzso zzso Our results suggest a significant correlation between zzso dysfunctional beliefs and zzso zzso in the anterior zzso zzso a brain structure related to zzso zzso Future studies should address the interaction of these correlations with environmental factors to fully characterize the bases of zzso dysfunctional beliefs and to advance in the integration of biological and cognitive models of zzso
