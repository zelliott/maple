zzso brain tumor zzso is performed by using a diversified zzso of zzso zzso zzso MR images from 55 zzso These images are of primary brain tumors namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso childhood zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary zzso zzso and normal regions zzso Eight hundred zzso regions of interest zzso are extracted by a zzso active zzso zzso Two hundred zzso intensity and texture features are extracted from these zzso In this study, principal component analysis zzso is used for reduction of zzso of the feature zzso These six classes are then classified by artificial neural network zzso zzso this approach is named as zzso zzso Three sets of experiments have been zzso In the first experiment, zzso accuracy by ANN approach is zzso In the second experiment, zzso approach with random zzso has been used in which the zzso from the same patient may get repeated during zzso It is observed that the zzso accuracy has increased from 77 to zzso zzso has delivered high accuracy for each class: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the third experiment, to remove bias and to test the zzso of the proposed system, data is zzso in a manner such that the zzso from the same patient are not common for training and testing zzso In this case also, the proposed system has performed well by delivering an overall accuracy of zzso The individual class accuracy for each class is: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso diagnostic system zzso of developed methods for zzso feature zzso and zzso of brain tumors can be beneficial to zzso for precise zzso diagnosis, and interpretation of brain tumors on MR zzso
