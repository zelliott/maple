zzso zzso appear to be a stable and sensitive marker of zzso zzso as suggested by studies in coronary heart zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso are increased after zzso stroke and investigated the contribution of different zzso zzso to such zzso 

We serially determined zzso zzso and zzso zzso using flow zzso at days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 90 in patients with zzso stroke zzso zzso zzso and in zzso and zzso healthy control subjects zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso were more common in patients than control subjects from day 1 through day 10 zzso zzso zzso respectively), but not on day 90 after zzso The percentage of zzso forming zzso was increased on days 1-3 after stroke but not at other time zzso zzso zzso were not more common at any time point after zzso Total numbers and percentages of zzso forming zzso zzso were significantly increased on day 2 zzso zzso zzso but not at other time points after zzso 

The 3 zzso zzso showed different zzso regarding zzso formation with zzso after zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is short-lived and may reflect an acute reaction to cerebral zzso whereas zzso zzso formation persists into the zzso phase, suggesting that they are a particularly sensitive zzso reflecting both zzso and inflammatory processes after zzso
