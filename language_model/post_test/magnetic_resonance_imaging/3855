zzso walking, and running are zzso tasks that develop during zzso zzso they function automatically as a result of a zzso network that controls spinal pattern zzso The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate zzso changes in the zzso locomotor and zzso network of normal subjects during mental imagery of locomotion and zzso Sixty healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso who had undergone a complete zzso zzso and sensory examination to rule out disorders of balance and zzso were trained for the conditions zzso standing, walking, and running in order to imagine these conditions on command in zzso sequences with the eyes closed while lying zzso in an magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The following blood oxygen zzso zzso signal changes during locomotion and stance were found to be independent of age: zzso prominent zzso in the supplementary motor areas, the zzso zzso visual cortical areas, zzso and zzso zzso zzso significant zzso in the zzso zzso cortical areas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and the anterior zzso during zzso The following differences in brain zzso during locomotion and stance were zzso relative increases in the cortical zzso signals in the zzso zzso zzso zzso visual zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In advanced age this zzso zzso was most prominent during standing, less during walking, and least during zzso In conclusion, the functional zzso of the basic locomotor and zzso network, which includes the prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso zzso and zzso locomotor centers, is preserved in the zzso Two major zzso aspects of brain zzso during locomotion and stance were zzso the mechanism of cortical zzso zzso interaction between sensory systems during locomotion and stance declines in advanced zzso and consequently, zzso cortical control of locomotion and stance increases with zzso These findings may indicate a more conscious locomotor and zzso strategy in the zzso
