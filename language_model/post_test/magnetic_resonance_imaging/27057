We present a technique to measure the zzso relaxation time constant of zzso blood zzso ) in zzso in a few zzso The zzso sequence consists of a zzso zzso zzso followed by a series of zzso zzso and zzso echo zzso imaging zzso The time intervals between zzso were chosen so that blood in zzso vessels is fully zzso between zzso making the blood signal follow an zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso which experiences the inversion and all zzso zzso quickly reaches a steady state at a low signal as a result of partial zzso This allows zzso zzso to be zzso from those containing zzso zzso and to be fitted zzso to a simple inversion recovery zzso The sequence was tested on a flow phantom with the proposed method, yielding zzso values consistent to within zzso of those obtained using a conventional inversion recovery sequence with a zzso zzso The method was applied to seven adult volunteers and 18 zzso The blood zzso of the zzso zzso range, zzso was found to be more variable than that of adults zzso range, zzso A linear correlation between the inverse of zzso and the zzso was established in 12 zzso zzso zzso
