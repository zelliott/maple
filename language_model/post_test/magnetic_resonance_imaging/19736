zzso of bone zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso fractures zzso detected by MR imaging as selection criterion for zzso zzso zzso is zzso To clarify significance of zzso in zzso we assessed pain response after zzso in patients with zzso with full zzso versus patients with zzso with absent zzso 

From a cohort of patients with painful zzso selected for zzso pain response in 14 patients with absent zzso in zzso was zzso compared with pain response in 31 patients with full zzso in zzso zzso was evaluated before zzso and at 1 and 3 months after zzso with visual analog scores and analgesics zzso Back pain in general and at treated zzso levels was zzso 

zzso decrease after zzso at treated levels was observed in 10 zzso patients with absent zzso in zzso at both follow-up periods and in 29 zzso patients with full zzso 1 month after zzso and 30 zzso at 3 months after zzso zzso between the groups were significant zzso zzso zzso at 1 month; P zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso response was not affected by other patient or imaging zzso General back pain after zzso was comparable in both groups after zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1 month; P zzso zzso at 3 zzso 

zzso decrease after zzso in patients with zzso is more frequently observed when full zzso is zzso Because zzso of patients with zzso with absent zzso responded favorably on pain, zzso should not be withheld based on absence of zzso zzso
