A retrospective analysis of lung signal intensity zzso for fat and lung zzso area zzso for body surface area was obtained from cardiac gated zzso zzso time 40 zzso images before and after zzso transplantation in 12 patients with pulmonary airway disease zzso zzso two zzso and three zzso zzso and 14 with zzso lung disease (three pulmonary fibrosis, four zzso zzso and seven zzso Nine healthy volunteers were studied for zzso The native lung in pulmonary airway disease without inflammatory processes has zzso signal intensity (79 zzso zzso similar to that of the control zzso zzso zzso while zzso lung disease had a higher zzso signal intensity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The transplanted lung had a similar zzso signal intensity zzso zzso zzso to that of the control except when there was a rejection reaction (one zzso or infection zzso zzso Compared with the control, the native lung was smaller in pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (78 zzso zzso while larger in zzso zzso zzso zzso and pulmonary airway disease zzso zzso zzso The zzso area of the transplanted lung was comparable to that of the control zzso zzso zzso zzso features of lung zzso signal intensity and zzso area were demonstrated in patients with pulmonary airway disease and zzso lung disease before lung zzso These zzso could be useful zzso zzso for assessment of the transplanted lung and for frequent follow-up of patients without exposure to zzso zzso Future developments are required to enhance lung signal sufficiently to detect less severe zzso
