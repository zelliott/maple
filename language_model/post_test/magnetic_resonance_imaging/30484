zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso has been suggested to play a complex role in the response to central nervous system insults such as traumatic brain injury zzso and cerebral zzso In the current study, we zzso maps of regional cerebral blood flow zzso using an zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique, at 24 and 72 h after experimental zzso in zzso knockout zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our hypothesis was that zzso would contribute to the level of zzso at 72 h after experimental zzso in zzso Comparing anatomical brain regions of interest zzso at zzso post controlled cortical impact zzso there were significant reductions in zzso in the hemisphere, cortex, and zzso area of the zzso of injured animals versus zzso regardless of zzso Regional assessment of zzso at 72 h after injury demonstrated that recovery of zzso was reduced in the zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso zzso in zzso zzso versus zzso mice by zzso zzso and zzso zzso this attenuated recovery was restricted to structures outside the zzso These regions with reduced zzso in zzso zzso mice represented zzso where zzso in the zzso was either zzso or statistically greater than that seen in respective zzso zzso suggesting a contribution of zzso to delayed zzso zzso However, zzso analysis zzso that the contribution of zzso to zzso at 72 h was not limited to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso plays a role in the recovery of zzso after zzso in zzso Questions remain if this effect represents a zzso component of zzso recovery, zzso zzso linked to zzso or zzso zzso of zzso
