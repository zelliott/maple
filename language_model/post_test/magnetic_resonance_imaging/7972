zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been widely used for investigating the brain representation associated with dental pain evoked by zzso electrical zzso However, because of the zzso of experimental designs and the small sample size of individual studies, the common brain representation regarding dental pain has remained zzso We used imaging zzso to investigate six dental zzso zzso studies zzso zzso zzso and tested 3 zzso zzso zzso pain is associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso is zzso organized in the zzso zzso and zzso dental pain is associated with the zzso network related to zzso zzso and quantitative zzso zzso zzso common zzso of the core zzso network, including the zzso cortex, the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso inconsistency in zzso organized zzso of the primary zzso zzso and zzso common zzso in the zzso prefrontal cortex, suggesting a role of zzso and coping in the experience of dental zzso In conclusion, zzso combined with zzso stimulation can effectively evoke activity in the zzso zzso The dental zzso brain representation disclosed the mechanisms of how sensory and zzso factors shape dental pain, which will help in the development of more effective customized methods for central pain zzso
