The zzso of zzso flows is known to be an important zzso of the efficacy of oxygen delivery to zzso Studies in animals have demonstrated decreased flow zzso zzso in states of decreased zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to assess zzso FH changes in acute stroke with use of a novel zzso zzso technique and to evaluate the ability of combined zzso zzso and FH zzso to predict final zzso zzso 

zzso blood flow, zzso and plasma mean transit time zzso were measured in 11 patients who presented with acute zzso hours after symptom zzso zzso Final zzso size was determined with follow-up zzso or CT zzso 

In normal brain zzso the distribution of relative flows was markedly skewed toward high zzso flow zzso Within regions of decreased cerebral blood flow, plasma zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso were identified with significant loss of the zzso component of the flow distribution, thereby causing increased zzso of flow zzso In zzso maps that zzso the acute zzso of FH from that of normal zzso areas of extreme homogenization of zzso flows predicted final zzso size on follow-up scans of 10 of 11 zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso can be rapidly assessed as part of a routine clinical MR examination and may provide a tool for planning of individual stroke treatment, as well as in targeting and evaluation of emerging therapeutic zzso
