To evaluate the magnetic zzso effect on zzso MR images of the zzso zzso 

zzso phantom experiments and studies in normal volunteers were performed using various sampling bandwidth zzso zzso zzso sequences with the polarity of the zzso zzso normal or zzso 

zzso of a zzso zzso to the zzso floor was the major factor in the appearance of the inferior surface of the zzso zzso zzso of distortion and/or zzso signal zzso related to the presence or absence of the attachment, were zzso on the images with zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was observed both in the zzso phantom experiment, and when no zzso zzso was zzso When a zzso zzso was present, two zzso shapes side by side were zzso zzso artifacts were seen where the zzso floor was misplaced into the zzso zzso 

zzso of the patterns of distortion and high-intensity artifact is important in the diagnosis of zzso zzso
