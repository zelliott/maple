The clinical usefulness and the time course of zzso imaging and apparent diffusion zzso zzso in acute and zzso cerebral zzso have not yet been established, although it is known that zzso zzso zzso imaging can detect a zzso zzso Our aim was to study which imaging technique is useful in detecting recent zzso and whether an increase in zzso or a decrease in signal intensity on zzso images is correlated with enhancement on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with a duration of 9 hours to 27 days were studied in 29 zzso The zzso and signal intensity on zzso images were compared with the zzso ratio zzso on zzso zzso images zzso zzso signal intensity after contrast zzso intensity before contrast zzso 

zzso was zzso correlated with zzso and signal intensity on zzso images was zzso correlated with zzso The correlation between zzso and age of the zzso in the zzso phase was zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso images complement each other in detecting zzso zzso zzso and disruption of the zzso barrier in zzso can be important in increasing zzso in zzso zzso
