This study examined the zzso of an zzso estimate of thigh muscle zzso area using magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso model assumed that a cross section of the thigh could be represented as a circle with concentric circular layers of zzso muscle, and bone zzso On 18 healthy, active men and women zzso zzso zzso age zzso 23 zzso 5 zzso total thigh circumference zzso was measured with a fiberglass tape, zzso thickness was measured over the zzso zzso using zzso and the distance across the zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso was measured with zzso zzso zzso of each tissue were obtained by zzso of an zzso image taken at the same site as the circumference and zzso zzso muscle zzso area zzso was estimated as zzso zzso see zzso Mean zzso zzso AM from zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso Errors in the zzso approximations of AM were due to an overestimate of the total thigh zzso area and an underestimate of zzso zzso Because of the close relationship between zzso and zzso estimates of zzso zzso zzso was used to produce the following final zzso zzso for use in populations studies of young, healthy, active men and zzso zzso see zzso
