The median survival for patients diagnosed with zzso zzso the most common type of brain zzso is less than 1 zzso Animal zzso models that are more zzso of therapeutic response in human patients than traditional models and that are genetically and zzso accurate are an zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso genetically engineered mouse spontaneously develops zzso when infected with zzso expressing zzso growth factor, resulting in zzso zzso growth factor zzso 

In the zzso genetically engineered mouse model, zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance images were correlated with zzso zzso grade zzso or zzso and zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was therefore used to enroll mice with high-grade zzso into a second study that tested efficacy of the current standard of care for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso model generated a zzso group of zzso some with high-grade growth rate and zzso characteristics and others with characteristics of zzso zzso We showed that zzso could be used to predict tumor grade and zzso zzso treatment of high-grade zzso zzso provided a zzso growth delay compared with vehicle zzso zzso zzso measurement of the apparent diffusion zzso showed an early decrease in zzso with zzso similar to that observed in zzso 

The use of zzso in the zzso model allows determination of zzso grade and survival zzso distribution of mice with specific tumor types into zzso trials, and efficacy determination both by tumor growth and early apparent diffusion zzso zzso
