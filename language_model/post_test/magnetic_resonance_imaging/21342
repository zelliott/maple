zzso zzso is involved on the development of cerebral zzso in acute zzso zzso As zzso is a therapeutic target in cerebral zzso our aim was to study the effect of zzso for zzso receptors zzso and zzso specific zzso for receptors A and B, zzso on the development of zzso zzso volume and zzso deficits in rats subjected to zzso by zzso of the middle cerebral artery zzso We used zzso rats zzso zzso submitted to zzso by zzso transient (90 zzso zzso After zzso rats were zzso into 4 groups zzso zzso 6) treated zzso 1) control group zzso 2) zzso group (10 zzso zzso 3) zzso group (3 zzso zzso and 4) combined treatment zzso 10 zzso plus zzso 3 zzso zzso We observed that rats treated with zzso showed a reduction of zzso measured by zzso at 72 h zzso and at day 7 (both p zzso zzso and a decrease in the serum levels of zzso at 72 h zzso zzso zzso and at day 7 zzso zzso zzso The combined treatment also induced a reduction of zzso at 24 h zzso zzso zzso 72 h zzso zzso zzso and at day 7 zzso zzso zzso a reduction on zzso volume, measured by zzso at 24 and 72 zzso and at day 7 (all p zzso zzso and a better zzso recovery at 24 and 72 zzso and at day 7 (all p zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced a decrease in zzso zzso while zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso for zzso receptors may be a good therapeutic target for cerebral zzso
