To determine the zzso appearance of the zzso zzso on MR imaging after a zzso has been performed, and to compare the zzso appearance of the zzso after an open and zzso zzso 

Fifteen zzso volunteers (12 women, 3 zzso age range zzso years, mean age 33 zzso with prior zzso for treatment of longstanding zzso zzso were zzso Fourteen volunteers had a unilateral release and one volunteer had bilateral releases, allowing for assessment of 16 zzso Eight zzso were performed through an open incision and eight were performed zzso The average time between surgery and imaging was 24 months zzso zzso zzso The site of surgery was established from the operative zzso zzso density zzso and zzso images in three zzso planes were obtained on a zzso zzso In eight studies, zzso zzso and STIR zzso images were zzso The zzso in each ankle was assessed for zzso and signal zzso zzso soft zzso and bone zzso were assessed for zzso zzso MR studies were available in five zzso 

There was no apparent difference in the zzso appearance of the ankle after an open or zzso procedure except for zzso formation in the subcutaneous fat which was common after an open procedure zzso Three zzso had a gap in the zzso (one open, two zzso The zzso zzso measured a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso At the zzso 11 of 13 zzso had an zzso deep zzso and 9 of 13 had an zzso superficial zzso At the zzso 13 of 16 zzso had an zzso deep zzso and 6 of 16 had an zzso superficial zzso Compared with zzso MR studies there was an average reduction in the zzso thickness at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso but the thickness at the zzso nearly zzso No zzso was evident in the zzso zzso zzso deep zzso muscles, or zzso bone zzso 

The average thickness of the zzso zzso in zzso volunteers after surgery is nearly 2-3 times that of zzso While there is increased thickness at the site of surgery, the changes in zzso and signal intensity were most prominent at the zzso The key observation was absence of zzso in the zzso and zzso soft zzso This baseline information may be of value when assessing MR studies of symptomatic zzso
