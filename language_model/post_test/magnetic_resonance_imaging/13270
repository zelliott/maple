We hypothesized that, in obese persons without zzso cardiovascular responses to excess weight are zzso during weight loss by either zzso surgery or zzso 

zzso is associated with cardiac zzso zzso dysfunction, and increased zzso zzso which are independent zzso of cardiovascular zzso 

zzso obese zzso mass index 40 zzso 8 zzso and 20 zzso subjects zzso mass index 21 zzso 2 zzso without identifiable cardiac risk factors underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for the assessment of the left and right zzso and of indexes of zzso zzso Thirty of the obese subjects underwent repeat imaging after 1 year of significant weight loss, achieved in 17 subjects by diet and in 13 subjects by zzso zzso Seven obese subjects underwent repeat imaging after 1 year of continued zzso 

Left and right zzso masses were significantly increased, left zzso zzso function impaired, and zzso zzso reduced in the zzso Both diet and zzso surgery led to comparable, significant decreases in left and right zzso masses, zzso volume, and zzso dysfunction, and an increase in zzso zzso at all levels of the zzso most pronounced zzso zzso zzso descending zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before weight loss and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after weight zzso p zzso zzso No improvements were observed in continued zzso 

zzso of method, 1 year of weight loss leads to partial zzso of cardiac zzso and to reversal of both zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso zzso These findings provide a potential mechanism for the reduction in mortality seen with weight zzso
