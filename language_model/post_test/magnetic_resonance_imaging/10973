This work reports on the development of a pulse sequence to simultaneously acquire zzso density, zzso and zzso weighted images in a single zzso prepared fast spin echo zzso The technique is based upon the application of a zzso preparation consisting of a global inversion followed by zzso 180 degrees and 90 degrees zzso to prepare the signal of specific zzso Slices are acquired in an zzso manner with time delays appropriate for the desired image zzso Data acquisition is repeated for all combinations of slice zzso covering the region of interest until images from all slice locations have been acquired with all desired image zzso The multiple image contrasts obtained with this technique should be useful in applications where discrimination between different types of tissue components is zzso such as in the analysis of plaque in cervical carotid artery zzso
