Multiple sclerosis zzso appear as areas of high signal on zzso weighted zzso A proportion of these zzso when viewed on zzso weighted zzso appear zzso compared with surrounding white zzso These zzso zzso zzso are thought to represent areas of greater tissue damage compared with the more zzso total zzso zzso zzso This study aimed to better zzso the properties of high signal zzso zzso with differing appearances on zzso weighted zzso using quantitative MR zzso 

Eleven patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis were zzso Two high signal zzso zzso were selected from each zzso of which appeared zzso and one zzso on a zzso weighted zzso A zzso was positioned around each zzso and for this volume of brain the zzso zzso were estimated using zzso MR zzso zzso and the zzso relaxation time within each zzso calculated from a zzso map generated using a zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a significantly lower absolute concentration of zzso derived zzso zzso and a significantly higher absolute concentration of zzso zzso zzso relaxation time correlated significantly with both zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no correlation between zzso relaxation times and zzso or zzso containing zzso 

zzso zzso relaxation times seem to reflect the severity of zzso damage or dysfunction zzso by a low zzso and possibly also zzso zzso by a high zzso in chronic multiple sclerosis zzso
