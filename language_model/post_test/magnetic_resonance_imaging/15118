This review highlights technological developments in magnetic resonance imaging zzso which are creating opportunities for the three zzso zzso and zzso of lipids in plant zzso A major feature of zzso is that it is a zzso platform, and thus can be used for the analysis of living zzso An overview of the theoretical aspects of zzso is zzso followed by a description of the various zzso modes available, and an explanation of how zzso can be applied to plant samples and what it can zzso Various zzso maps and three zzso models of seeds and fruits are included to demonstrate the potential of zzso and to exemplify recent cutting-edge advances in the zzso The importance and prospects of the imaging of lipids in living plants, as well as the integration of zzso imaging with other emerging techniques, are outlined to provide impetus for future plant zzso zzso
