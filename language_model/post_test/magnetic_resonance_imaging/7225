zzso resonance zzso images of three major flight muscles of zzso were obtained with surface coils using a zzso zzso whole body imaging system zzso zzso zzso The two fast muscles, zzso major zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a slow muscle, anterior zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The signal intensity zzso of each muscle was zzso measured and its ratio to the background noise zzso was zzso Although visually the three muscles showed intermediate zzso the slow and fast muscles could be differentiated on the basis of their zzso zzso These values were invariably higher in the slow muscles than in the fast zzso To understand these differences, the muscles were excised and their zzso and zzso MR relaxation times zzso and zzso were determined at 30 zzso zzso analysis enhanced the differences between the muscle zzso With the sole exception of short zzso all relaxation components of the slow muscles were significantly longer than those of the fast zzso These results suggest that zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso values of muscles may not necessarily indicate a zzso event, but may reflect the preponderance of slow zzso
