zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso controls zzso in up to zzso of patients with intractable zzso lobe zzso zzso but, in the language dominant hemisphere, may impair language function, particularly zzso zzso reorganization can occur within the zzso and zzso zzso We investigated reorganization of language in zzso patients before and after zzso whether zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso predicts zzso naming zzso and efficiency of zzso language zzso 

We studied 44 patients with zzso due to unilateral zzso sclerosis (24 left) on a zzso zzso zzso All subjects performed language zzso and zzso testing preoperatively and again 4 months after left or right zzso 

zzso individuals with left zzso had greater bilateral zzso frontal zzso zzso and stronger functional connectivity from the left zzso frontal zzso to the zzso frontal lobe than zzso and this was not observed in individuals with right zzso zzso in left and right zzso better naming correlated with greater zzso left zzso and left frontal zzso for verbal zzso zzso In left zzso stronger zzso left middle frontal zzso for zzso was zzso of greater decline in naming after zzso zzso in left zzso with clinically significant naming decline, greater right middle frontal zzso zzso correlated with better zzso zzso In patients without zzso naming decline, better naming correlated with greater zzso in the remaining left zzso zzso In right zzso naming ability correlated with left zzso and left and right frontal zzso zzso zzso 

In left zzso early zzso reorganization to the zzso frontal lobe suggests multiple systems support language zzso zzso zzso recruitment involving the zzso zzso remnant is important for maintaining language, and reorganization to the zzso zzso is less zzso zzso left middle frontal zzso for zzso was zzso of naming decline in left zzso after zzso
