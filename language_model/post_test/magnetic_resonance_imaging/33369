zzso resonance zzso has emerged as a sensitive zzso to detect early and diffuse zzso in multiple zzso Recently, the hypothesis of neurodegenerative zzso has zzso the interest for measurement of zzso zzso to gain zzso in a large brain volume encompassing different tissue zzso zzso we proposed in this paper the zzso of an absolute zzso method based on localized zzso at short (30 zzso and long zzso zzso echo time of a volume including normal appearing white matter, cortical gray matter, and zzso First, zzso developments were implemented including external zzso and corrections of zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso fluid volume zzso Second, these improvements were validated and zzso using an original methodology based on simulations of brain images with zzso Finally, zzso zzso were assessed in 65 patients including 26 zzso 17 zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso patients, and in 23 normal zzso zzso showed increases of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and SP patients compared to controls, whereas the concentration of zzso compounds remained zzso The major finding of this study was the identification of zzso concentration and zzso ratio as putative markers of progressive zzso suggesting interesting perspectives in detection and followup of neurodegenerative zzso
