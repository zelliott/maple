To zzso compare zzso zzso and motion with resulting aneurysm location, direction of expansion, and zzso features in experimental abdominal zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was performed at zzso T with the following zzso zzso zzso acquisition for vessel geometry and zzso zzso zzso acquisition to zzso zzso zzso Male zzso mice were zzso before and after AAA formation induced by zzso II zzso zzso pump zzso or infusion of zzso zzso zzso formed near the location of maximum abdominal zzso zzso and the zzso direction of expansion was correlated with the direction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formed in a region of low vessel zzso and had no zzso direction of zzso zzso significantly increased mean blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas both models showed a significant zzso decrease in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso in patterns of zzso degradation and zzso of fluorescent signal from zzso zzso were also zzso 

The direction of zzso aneurysm expansion correlated with the direction of motion, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motion correlated with zzso zzso degradation in zzso zzso zzso from both models suggest a relationship between aneurysm pathological features and zzso geometry and zzso
