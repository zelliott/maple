Double zzso zzso are extremely zzso They can be divided into zzso and clearly separated zzso Most zzso zzso are surgically removed as one zzso and the zzso of different zzso types can be confirmed by zzso zzso In contrast, detailed zzso zzso studies can suggest the zzso of separated multiple zzso In patients with multiple zzso surgical failure may result when one zzso is missed during zzso Among 600 surgical cases we encountered four patients with clearly separated double zzso zzso all were highly suspect on zzso zzso zzso 

All four patients zzso zzso zzso one patient also exhibited hyperprolactinemia and two had familial zzso zzso unrelated to multiple zzso zzso type I zzso All underwent zzso surgery and zzso confirmed the diagnosis of zzso plus zzso zzso in two cases and of two zzso zzso each in the other two zzso 

Although the zzso of our double zzso remains unknown, genetic abnormalities may be involved because two patients had familial zzso zzso unrelated to zzso When zzso zzso is suggestive of double zzso careful surgical exploration is necessary to avoid missing the other zzso because the risk of surgical failure is high, especially in patients with functioning zzso
