Total hip replacement in patients with advanced zzso of the zzso head is often complicated by early loosening of the zzso zzso Recent evidence has suggested that abnormal bone extending into the zzso zzso may be responsible for the early failure of the zzso zzso We aimed to identify which patients were at high risk of early failure by evaluating zzso MR images of zzso zzso zzso beyond the zzso zzso Although the MR signal intensity has been shown to correlate well with zzso in the zzso head, it was found to be relatively insensitive at identifying zzso below the head, with a sensitivity of only 51% and a zzso value of a negative result of only zzso However, the specificity was zzso with the zzso value of a positive zzso finding being zzso Only those patients with zzso of the zzso head secondary to zzso disease, who are known to be at high risk of early zzso had changes in the MR signal in the greater zzso and the zzso zzso This observation suggests that changes in the MR signal beyond the zzso head may represent zzso zzso in areas essential for the fixation of the zzso zzso zzso identification of such zzso in the neck of the zzso may be important when considering hip resurfacing for zzso of the zzso head, following which early loosening of the zzso component and fracture of the neck are possible zzso
