To develop accurate and reliable equations from simple zzso parameters that would predict percentage of total body fat zzso total abdominal fat zzso subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso with a fair degree of zzso 

zzso zzso by zzso X-ray zzso zzso in zzso healthy subjects (95 men and 76 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso by single slice magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso zzso level in 100 healthy subjects were zzso Mean age and zzso were zzso years and zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis was used on the training data set zzso to develop zzso by taking zzso and demographic variables as potential zzso zzso equations were applied on validation data set zzso 

Multiple zzso analysis revealed the best equation for predicting zzso to be: zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso age zzso + zzso zzso gender zzso zzso 1, F zzso 2) + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso waist circumference zzso + zzso zzso zzso weight zzso - zzso zzso height zzso (R zzso zzso zzso The most precise zzso equation for zzso zzso was: zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso age zzso + zzso zzso gender zzso zzso 1, F zzso 2) + zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso hip circumference zzso + zzso zzso waist circumference zzso (R zzso zzso zzso zzso was best predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso age zzso + zzso zzso gender zzso zzso 1, F zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso hip circumference zzso (R zzso zzso zzso 

We present zzso equations to zzso body fat and abdominal zzso tissue zzso in healthy Asian zzso These equations could be used for clinical and research zzso
