The degree to which the process involved in visual perception and visual imagery share a common zzso zzso is zzso zzso evidence for zzso of visual imagery early in the visual pathways would have important bearing on current theories of visual zzso A magnetic resonance imaging technique sensitive to regional changes in blood zzso was used to obtain functional zzso maps in the human visual zzso During recall of a visual zzso focal increases in signal related to changes in blood flow were detected in zzso and V2 zzso in five of seven zzso These experiments show that the same areas of the early visual zzso that are excited by visual stimulation are also activated during mental representation of the same zzso Some of the processes used in zzso mapped cortical areas during visual perception may also be zzso during visual zzso
