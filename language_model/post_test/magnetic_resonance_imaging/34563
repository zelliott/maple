We investigated whether a zzso working memory zzso task would activate zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and whether zzso would be correlated with zzso zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we measured regional brain signal changes in 12 normal subjects performing a continuous performance, choice reaction time task that requires zzso A high zzso load condition was compared with a zzso choice reaction time control condition zzso zzso and a low zzso load condition zzso zzso zzso changes in signal intensity occurred in the zzso frontal motor regions and the zzso zzso zzso in both zzso These findings support the role of zzso and zzso in zzso and suggest that signal changes in zzso correlate with zzso zzso
