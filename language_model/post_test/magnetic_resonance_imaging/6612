zzso predictions about reasoning have usually contrasted two accounts, Mental zzso and Mental zzso zzso techniques have been providing new measures that transcend this zzso We tested a hypothesis from zzso and zzso zzso that predicts neural activity predominantly in a left zzso system when participants reason with arbitrary zzso zzso In an zzso zzso investigation, we employed zzso zzso the majority of which involved conditional zzso While investigating conditional reasoning generally, we ultimately focused on the neural activity linked to the two valid conditional zzso zzso (If p then zzso zzso and zzso zzso (If p then zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso we found a left zzso zzso frontal network for both zzso forms with increasing zzso when reasoning becomes more challenging by way of zzso zzso These findings show that the previous findings with more complex zzso zzso are robust and cast doubt upon accounts of reasoning that zzso primary zzso processes uniquely to either the right zzso or to language zzso
