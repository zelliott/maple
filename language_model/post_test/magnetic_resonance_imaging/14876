The zzso pressure zzso is an important factor defining prognosis in zzso zzso However, zzso prediction of the zzso and the possible reduction by establishment of a zzso is zzso A cohort of patients receiving zzso was evaluated with regard to imaging features of zzso in zzso imaging and the achievable reduction of the pressure zzso by establishment of a zzso 

In this study 70 consecutive patients with zzso liver disease were zzso zzso Patients received either CT or MR imaging before invasive pressure measurement during zzso zzso Images were evaluated with regard to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso short gastric vein and zzso zzso zzso were correlated with Child stage, zzso pressure zzso and zzso reduction of the pressure zzso 

In 55 of the 70 patients zzso reduced the pressure zzso to less than 12 zzso The zzso pressure and the pressure reduction were not significantly different between Child zzso Imaging features of zzso and zzso zzso did not show significant zzso The only zzso with a significant zzso value for the reduction of the pressure zzso was the zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso allows a reliable reduction of the pressure zzso even at high zzso pressure levels and a high collateral zzso In patients receiving zzso the presence and the characteristics of the collateral vessels seem to be too variable to draw reliable conclusions concerning the zzso pressure zzso
