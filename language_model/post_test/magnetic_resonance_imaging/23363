There is a growing consensus that the brain zzso value and zzso signals at the time of zzso Value signals are essential for making zzso zzso signals are related to zzso attention, and zzso Unfortunately, an unequivocal characterization of the areas involved in these 2 distinct sets of processes is made difficult by the fact that, in most experiments, both types of signals are highly zzso We zzso value and zzso signals using a novel human functional magnetic resonance imaging decision-making zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso anterior cingulate, and zzso zzso zzso was modulated by value but not zzso The opposite was true for zzso anterior cingulate, supplementary motor area, zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso and the zzso were modulated by both value and zzso
