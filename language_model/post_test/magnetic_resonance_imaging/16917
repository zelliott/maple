Prior research has demonstrated that the neural zzso of successful zzso zzso memory zzso partially overlap with neural regions selectively engaged by the zzso demands of the study zzso The primary goal of the present experiment was to determine whether this overlap is associated solely with zzso processes supporting later recollection, or whether overlapping subsequent memory and study condition effects are also evident when later memory is zzso zzso (N zzso 17) underwent zzso scanning while studying a series of visually and zzso presented zzso Memory for the words was subsequently tested with a modified zzso zzso zzso selective subsequent familiarity effects were evident in bilateral zzso regions that also responded zzso to auditory zzso Although other interpretations are possible, these findings suggest that overlap between study zzso subsequent memory effects and regions selectively sensitive to study demands is not uniquely associated with later zzso In addition, zzso subsequent memory effects were identified in several cortical zzso In every case, the effects were greatest for later zzso items, and smaller for items later recognized on the basis of zzso The implications of this quantitative zzso for zzso models of recognition memory are zzso
