Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso responses in human zzso zzso were zzso in response to changes in the zzso of peripheral stimulation during zzso passive zzso and zzso an zzso tactile tracking task zzso changes in zzso zzso were used to guide motor zzso zzso zzso was conducted using a scanner operating at zzso zzso and zzso was delivered to the zzso surface of the right index finger with a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that primary zzso zzso zzso reliably reflects changes in zzso zzso applied to the finger during passive zzso and also in the presence of a task that zzso the activity in zzso Secondary zzso zzso did not reveal any clear relationship with zzso zzso but was more often activated during the attention demanding tracking task compared with passive zzso The present study supports an increasing zzso relationship between zzso stimuli and activity in zzso that persists during zzso active zzso
