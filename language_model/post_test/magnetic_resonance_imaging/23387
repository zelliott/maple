To perform cardiac imaging in mice without having to invest in expensive dedicated equipment, we adapted a clinical zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanner for use in a zzso zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso sequence facilitated the determination of zzso sizes in zzso by late zzso zzso zzso were compared to zzso zzso areas in mice after zzso procedure with a good correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In addition, fractional area change zzso was assessed with single slice zzso zzso and was matched to zzso size zzso zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso measured with zzso zzso zzso zzso both P zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate the use of clinical zzso zzso scanners as a feasible method for basic zzso in zzso These widely available scanners are capable of investigating in zzso zzso dimensions as well as assessment of cardiac functional parameters in mice with reasonable zzso
