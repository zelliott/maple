As stimulus size increases, motion direction of zzso patterns becomes increasingly harder to zzso This counterintuitive behavioral result, termed zzso zzso is hypothesized to reflect zzso zzso receptive field property ubiquitous in sensory zzso Prior research proposed that spatial suppression of motion signals is a direct correlate of zzso antagonism within cortical area zzso Here, we investigated whether human zzso is indeed zzso involved in spatial suppression of motion zzso The key assumption is that a disruption of neural mechanisms that play a critical role in spatial suppression could allow these normally suppressed motion signals to reach zzso zzso Thus, our hypothesis was that a disruption of zzso should weaken spatial suppression and, consequently, improve motion perception of large, moving zzso To disrupt zzso we used zzso 1 zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso method that temporarily zzso normal functioning of the targeted zzso Early visual areas were also targeted as a control zzso The results supported our hypotheses and showed that disruption of zzso improved motion discrimination of large, moving zzso presumably by weakening surround suppression zzso This effect was specific to zzso stimulation and zzso presented zzso zzso the critical neural constraints limiting motion perception of large, zzso stimuli involve zzso Additionally, our findings mimic spatial suppression deficits that are observed in several patient populations and zzso impaired zzso processes as likely neural zzso for the reported zzso abnormalities in the elderly, patients with schizophrenia and those with a history of zzso
