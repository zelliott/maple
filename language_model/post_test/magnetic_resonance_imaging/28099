Continuous recording of vital zzso variables and sequential MR imaging were performed simultaneously during continuous expansion of an zzso rubber balloon over the left zzso in zzso zzso zzso expansion led to a progressive and slightly zzso rise in zzso zzso pressures and a fall in local zzso zzso Changes in systemic zzso pressure, pulse rate, and zzso rate usually appeared at a balloon volume of zzso to zzso of the zzso volume zzso zzso together with a marked zzso pressure zzso and MR imaging changes consistent with zzso zzso Respiratory arrest occurred at a balloon volume of approximately zzso of the zzso volume zzso zzso which was associated with zzso of the zzso zzso consistent with some degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso in tissue water was observed beginning at approximately the reaction volume, presumably due to zzso zzso due to the fall in zzso zzso
