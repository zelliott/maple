Intermediate end points are desirable to zzso the integration of zzso systemic therapy into the treatment strategy for high-risk localized prostate zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging at zzso zzso zzso response has been zzso as an end point in zzso trials but has not been correlated with clinical zzso 

Data were pooled from two trials exploring zzso chemotherapy in high-risk localized prostate zzso Trial 1 explored zzso for 6 months and Trial 2 explored zzso plus zzso for zzso months, both before radical zzso zzso was done at baseline and end of zzso zzso zzso response, based upon zzso zzso was zzso zzso Cox zzso was undertaken to evaluate the association between clinical parameters and zzso zzso 

There were 53 zzso patients in the combined analysis: 20 zzso achieved a zzso response, 16 zzso achieved an zzso partial response and 24 zzso achieved an zzso minor zzso Median follow-up was zzso years, and 33 of 53 zzso zzso patients developed zzso zzso On multivariable analysis, zzso response did not correlate with zzso recurrence zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and paradoxically zzso response was associated with a significantly shorter time to zzso recurrence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Response by zzso zzso does not correlate with a decreased likelihood of zzso recurrence in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer treated with zzso zzso and may be associated with inferior zzso These data do not support the use of zzso zzso response as a primary end point in zzso chemotherapy zzso
