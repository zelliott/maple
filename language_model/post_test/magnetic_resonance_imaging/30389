The assessment of forward stroke volume zzso using zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be feasible in a limited number of studies with small numbers of zzso The aim of this study was to compare zzso derived zzso with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging zzso values in a larger population of zzso 

zzso subjects with varying degrees of cardiac function were zzso Stroke volume was assessed using zzso water zzso dynamic zzso PET for both the right zzso zzso and left zzso zzso and compared with the findings of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was higher for the RV than for the zzso zzso zzso 34 vs 116 zzso 31 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and both were higher compared with values obtained by zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso both P zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso the correlations between PET and zzso were moderate for both the RV zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a progressive zzso with increasing zzso measured in either zzso 

zzso dynamic zzso PET for the assessment of forward zzso is zzso although values are progressively overestimated with increasing zzso particularly when the RV is used, and correlations with zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso These findings are probably zzso and warrant further study before the use of zzso dynamic zzso PET in clinical or research settings can be zzso
