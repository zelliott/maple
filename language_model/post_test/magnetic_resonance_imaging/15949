The aim of this study was to assess the dependence of the normal liver tissue threshold dose on the volume exposed and the zzso zzso dose zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso liver zzso A total of 50 patients with zzso liver tumors treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso planning was performed using a three-dimensional CT data set acquired after zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso performed 6 and 12 weeks after therapy, was analyzed zzso All zzso data sets were merged with zzso zzso zzso The border of zzso on zzso images zzso and of zzso on zzso images (impaired zzso zzso were analyzed to assess the radiation zzso The threshold zzso surface of the volume exposed was calculated from the zzso zzso zzso The relationships between zzso volume and threshold zzso surface as well as dose zzso and threshold zzso surface were evaluated over zzso The median threshold dose of the volume exposed, characterized by zzso dysfunction and zzso was approximately 13 zzso 6 weeks after zzso and approximately 16 zzso at 12 zzso We found a significant correlation between the normal liver tissue threshold dose and volume exposed zzso zzso zzso The zzso threshold dose was estimated between approximately 14 zzso for 500 zzso approximately 16 zzso for 100 zzso and approximately 18 zzso for 10 zzso of zzso zzso The results indicate that the dose zzso has no effect on the threshold liver zzso There was a significant shift of the threshold doses from regions of lower to regions of zzso exposure in the course of follow-up zzso zzso zzso Thus the normal liver tissue threshold dose is dependent on the volume exposed but not on the dose zzso
