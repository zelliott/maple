To evaluate an zzso reality zzso system in combination with a zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso as a navigation tool for needle zzso 

The experimental protocol had institutional animal care and use committee zzso zzso zzso were performed in zzso by using 20 tube targets, each with a diameter of 6 zzso and 50 virtual zzso The position of the needle tip in zzso and MR space was compared in multiple imaging planes, and virtual and real needle tip zzso errors were zzso Ten zzso zzso were performed in three zzso and the duration of each procedure was zzso After successful zzso the distance to the target was measured on MR zzso The confidence limits for the achieved zzso hit rate and for lateral zzso were zzso A repeated measures analysis of zzso was used to determine whether the placement error in a particular dimension zzso zzso or zzso differed from the zzso 

For the 50 virtual targets, a mean error of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso A repeated measures analysis of zzso indicated no statistically significant difference zzso zzso zzso in the errors in any particular zzso For the real targets, all zzso were inside the zzso tube in the zzso zzso The needle depth was within the target plane in 11 biopsy zzso the mean distance to the center of the target was zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For nine biopsy procedures, the needle tip was outside the target plane, with a mean distance to the edge of the target plane of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the animal experiments, the puncture was successful in all 10 cases, with a mean zzso distance of zzso zzso zzso zzso The average procedure time was 18 minutes per zzso 

zzso procedures performed with a combination of a zzso MR system and an zzso system are feasible and zzso
