zzso zzso are indicated as primary therapy for zzso zzso zzso while controversial results have been reported in zzso zzso zzso 

To evaluate whether the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression detected by zzso zzso using zzso zzso was correlated with the response to chronic treatment with zzso or zzso 

10 patients affected with zzso (5 men and 5 women, age ranging between 25 and 50 zzso and 10 with zzso zzso zzso (3 men and 7 women, age ranging between 22 and 59 zzso serving as zzso 

All patients underwent an acute test with zzso at zzso intervals and in random order all patients received the drug zzso zzso at zzso zzso or zzso Blood samples were taken 15 and 5 minutes before and every 30 minutes for 6 h after drug or zzso zzso The test was considered positive when zzso and/or zzso levels decreased zzso as compared to baseline zzso After 6 months of treatment, 10 patients were zzso to continue the treatment with zzso and the remaining 10 received zzso for the remaining 6 zzso The doses of zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and from zzso to 3 zzso zzso At study entry, a magnetic resonance imaging zzso study of the zzso region and zzso zzso zzso were zzso MR was repeated after 12 months of treatment to evaluate zzso zzso reduction of zzso volume zzso zzso in zzso and zzso 50% in zzso was considered zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

The zzso was negative in 6 out of 10 patients with zzso zzso zzso was observed in 3 patients with zzso and 2 patients with zzso whereas intense zzso was observed in the remaining 7 patients with zzso and 2 patients with zzso Among the 8 patients with zzso and high circulating zzso levels, the acute test was negative in 5 while it was positive in the remaining 3 zzso The acute test was positive in all 10 patients with zzso After 12 months of treatment with zzso and cabergoline, circulating zzso levels were decreased in all 10 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso being zzso in 7 zzso zzso of zzso levels was found in all 10 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant reduction of zzso levels was obtained in 9 out of 10 patients with zzso in 4 out of 8 patients zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso shrinkage was recorded in 4 patients with zzso among the 7 with intense zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso shrinkage was recorded only in the 2 out of 10 patients with zzso with intense zzso zzso of zzso A significant positive correlation was found between the degree of zzso zzso as zzso and the response to zzso or zzso treatment zzso as percent hormone zzso either in patients affected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or in those affected with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

An intense zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso was zzso of a good response to a chronic treatment with zzso and zzso This result suggests that a zzso zzso zzso could be considered in selected patients with zzso zzso before starting medical treatment with zzso zzso
