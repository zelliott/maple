This experiment aims to determine the diagnostic value of zzso imaging zzso in the differentiation of zzso inflammatory zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso in rabbit models in comparison with conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Conventional zzso and zzso were performed at 4 weeks after successful zzso into the zzso female New Zealand white zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso criteria and the relative apparent diffusion zzso zzso value were compared between the zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso findings as the reference zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the aforementioned criteria and zzso value in zzso the zzso inflammatory zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and 46 zzso ones were successfully isolated and taken into pathological zzso The differences of the aforementioned criteria between the two groups were not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso value of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher than that of zzso ones zzso zzso zzso with significant difference zzso zzso zzso When the zzso value was chosen as zzso the area under the zzso curve is greater than all other criteria, and the sensitivity, zzso zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value for zzso two groups were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso imaging is a promising new technique for zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Compared with routine magnetic resonance zzso zzso could provide more useful zzso and functional information for zzso
