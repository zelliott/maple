During zzso tasks, zzso in performance and functional abnormalities in the inferior frontal zzso have been observed in both schizophrenia patients and their unaffected zzso We sought to examine whether such functional abnormalities are a specific marker of genetic vulnerability to zzso We studied a sample of 132 subjects, zzso 39 patients with zzso 10 unaffected zzso zzso zzso of schizophrenia zzso 28 patients with bipolar disorder, 7 unaffected zzso zzso of bipolar disorder zzso and 48 healthy zzso Blood oxygen zzso response was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the performance of an overt zzso task with two levels of task difficulty, in a zzso region of interest encompassing zzso areas 44 and 45 zzso Patients with schizophrenia and the unaffected zzso zzso of schizophrenia zzso showed increased zzso in the inferior frontal zzso relative to healthy controls and bipolar zzso Increased engagement of the inferior frontal zzso during zzso may thus be a marker of genetic vulnerability to zzso
