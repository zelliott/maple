zzso MR imaging is being used increasingly during zzso zzso The aim of this study was to describe and zzso different forms of surgically induced zzso contrast enhancement observed during zzso MR zzso 

A total of 51 zzso MR examinations were performed to assess the extent of brain tumor zzso The zzso MR results zzso images, zzso and obtained serially after the IV administration of zzso contrast zzso were compared with zzso and early zzso MR zzso Animal experiments were conducted to obtain further evidence of the mechanism of surgically induced contrast zzso 

Four different types of surgically induced contrast enhancement were zzso zzso enhancement, increased enhancement of the zzso zzso delayed enhancement at the zzso margins, and immediate zzso contrast zzso The types of surgically induced contrast enhancement differ regarding their location, zzso and time zzso Their potential to be confused with zzso residual tumor also zzso Three of the four types of surgically induced contrast enhancement were zzso in an animal zzso 

zzso induced contrast enhancement is a potential source of error in zzso MR zzso zzso analysis of the location, zzso and time course of zzso observed zzso enhancement is critical to avoid confusing surgically induced contrast enhancement with zzso residual zzso
