Relative cerebral blood flow changes can be measured by a novel simple blood flow measurement technique with zzso water zzso as a zzso based on zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso Two inversion recovery zzso images are acquired by zzso zzso inversion and zzso zzso During the inversion delay time after zzso zzso fully zzso blood spins move into the imaging slice and exchange with tissue zzso The signal enhancement zzso zzso measured by the signal difference between two images is directly related to blood zzso For functional MR imaging studies, two zzso images are alternatively and repeatedly acquired during control and task zzso Relative signal changes in the FAIR images during the task periods represent the relative regional cerebral blood flow zzso The FAIR technique has been successfully applied to functional brain mapping studies in humans during finger opposition zzso The technique is capable of generating zzso functional zzso
