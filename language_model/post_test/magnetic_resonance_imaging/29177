zzso zzso zzso that are localized completely in the spinal zzso space are uncommon vascular zzso Although they have increasingly been reported in the literature in recent years, diagnostic and surgical features are not clearly zzso 

We report five patients with pure spinal zzso cavernous zzso zzso and review the literature, focusing on their zzso and surgical zzso We also compare these tumors with other zzso zzso as well as with their zzso zzso 

zzso like all other zzso zzso differ from zzso ones on zzso the zzso zzso is less zzso zzso rim is rare, the signal is different, and contrast enhancement is the zzso They are very similar to spinal zzso but they differ in their growth pattern and zzso since they zzso zzso zzso and have an oval zzso In zzso zzso bleeding is rarely zzso in contrast to other zzso zzso especially those of the cavernous zzso 

On zzso zzso and other zzso zzso constitute a homogeneous group since they enhance zzso At operation, since there is rarely enough bleeding to limit zzso radical zzso of zzso can be achieved with good zzso
