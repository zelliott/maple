To study the effect of zzso zzso gene therapy on zzso zzso zzso in a rabbit zzso 

zzso tumor was grown in the liver of 24 zzso Animals were divided into four groups: group A receiving zzso gene therapy zzso only, group B receiving combined zzso therapy and zzso zzso zzso group C receiving zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso control group zzso receiving sodium zzso zzso volume zzso was measured by using zzso zzso zzso zzso procedure was applied zzso zzso zzso volume zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and the mean ratio zzso was zzso After the second zzso specimens of the liver were zzso and examined zzso using zzso zzso zzso The positive expression was zzso 

Compared with control group zzso zzso zzso zzso therapeutic groups all showed a significant decrease in the tumor growth ratio zzso A slight difference was found between group A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and group B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant difference was observed between group B and group C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The positive expression rate of zzso zzso was the lowest in group B and significantly different between group A and group C zzso Compared to the control subjects, groups A and C both showed a decrease in the expression of zzso zzso but there was no significant difference between zzso 

zzso zzso gene therapy can reduce tumor growth of zzso in rabbit zzso
