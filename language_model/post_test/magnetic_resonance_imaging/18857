zzso data is very important for simulation procedures in zzso zzso While treating zzso a zzso skull the surgeon seeks to reconstruct its natural and harmonic zzso zzso or zzso data of the skull could support the surgeon in this effort, as it would provide a standard model of the skull which gives an idea of the natural zzso We create a standard skull by averaging regularly formed skulls in a shape space spanned by zzso zzso While state-of-the-art methods use landmarks to define the shape and mean shapes, this method is zzso zzso it manages averaging without landmarks and it provides a complete description of the zzso In addition the shape space can be used to zzso shapes to identify different types of an zzso
