Although zzso Type I zzso and Type 0 zzso zzso have been previously characterized clinically and zzso there have been no studies focusing on the possible genetic link between these zzso The goal of this study was to identify families in whom zzso and zzso zzso and to further assess the similarities between these zzso 

Families were zzso through a zzso with zzso zzso family histories were obtained to identify first-degree relatives diagnosed with zzso Several criteria were used to exclude individuals with acquired forms of zzso and/or zzso zzso were excluded with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso as well as zzso due to a zzso mass, zzso history of cervical or zzso surgery unrelated to zzso or development of symptoms following placement of a zzso zzso Medical records and MR images were used to characterize zzso and zzso individuals clinically and zzso 

Five families were identified in which the zzso zzso had a first-degree relative with zzso Further assessment of affected individuals showed similar clinical and zzso features between zzso and zzso individuals, although zzso patients in general had more severe symptoms and skull base abnormalities than their zzso zzso Overall, both groups showed improvement in symptoms and/or zzso size following zzso zzso zzso 

There is accumulating evidence suggesting that zzso and zzso may be caused by a common underlying zzso zzso The data in this study are consistent with this hypothesis, showing similar clinical and zzso features between zzso and zzso individuals, as well as the occurrence of both disorders within zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso suggests that these disorders may share an underlying genetic basis, although additional zzso and/or environmental factors are likely to play an important role in the development of zzso versus zzso
