To compare the diagnostic accuracy of contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for detecting zzso zzso 

In this prospective study, 35 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso proven zzso with clinical suspicion of recurrence were evaluated using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images were evaluated zzso and zzso Combination of clinical follow-up zzso zzso repeat imaging and/or biopsy (when zzso was taken as the reference zzso 

Based on the reference standard, 26 patients were positive and nine were negative for zzso The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, whereas those of zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of patients zzso On zzso analysis the difference was not statistically significant overall zzso for high-grade zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was more specific than zzso overall zzso for high-grade zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso shows a high but comparable diagnostic accuracy to zzso for the detection of zzso zzso However, it is more specific than zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in the zzso site remains a diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows high diagnostic accuracy for detecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and contrast enhanced zzso are zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso is more specific than zzso for zzso zzso
