zzso spin labeling zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a technique for depicting cerebral zzso without contrast zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso can be used to detect zzso after zzso for zzso disease as effectively as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fifteen consecutive patients with zzso disease were included in the zzso All patients underwent surgical zzso zzso regional cerebral blood flow zzso was measured by zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso zzso and zzso zzso during the acute stage, and zzso of the operative side was compared with the other zzso The asymmetry ratio zzso was then calculated from the zzso as measured using each zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was moderately correlated with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso R zzso zzso P zzso zzso In this series, 2 patients zzso suffered symptomatic zzso after zzso and accordingly exhibited increased zzso of zzso Our data indicate that early increases in zzso in patients with zzso could be detected using FAIR zzso supplemental to zzso zzso after zzso Our data indicate that FAIR zzso is a convenient method for evaluating zzso that can be performed repeatedly without the use of contrast medium or zzso
