Memory difficulties are a frequent cognitive complaint of patients with chronic zzso Previous studies have suggested that the presence of a seizure focus causes reorganization of brain mechanisms underlying memory zzso Here we examine whether seizure onset in the left zzso and onset in the right zzso have different effects on memory zzso and whether longer duration of zzso is associated with increased zzso of memory functions to the unaffected zzso We hypothesized that zzso of onset and duration of zzso would influence plasticity of memory mechanisms, similar to the plasticity observed for language zzso Healthy controls zzso N zzso 10) and patients with zzso (N zzso 23, 11 with a zzso and 12 with a zzso zzso performed a zzso zzso task at 4 zzso Active zzso zzso to scrambled image zzso were identified for each zzso Memory zzso zzso zzso were calculated in three regions of interest zzso designed on the basis of HC group zzso a functional zzso an zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso encompassing zzso and zzso zzso In healthy controls, zzso were suggestive of slight left zzso of zzso memory for zzso Patients with right zzso zzso showed a zzso increase in degree of left zzso In contrast, patients with left zzso zzso showed zzso zzso differing significantly from controls and from patients with right zzso zzso zzso measures of memory zzso Story zzso across zzso patients predicted zzso in the anatomical zzso higher scores were associated with more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither age of onset nor duration of zzso was significantly related to zzso These results indicate that focal zzso may influence the functional zzso of memory zzso
