The purpose of this study was to analyze the features of zzso enhancement detected on zzso zzso and to determine which of these features are significant zzso of zzso 

zzso review was performed of 124 consecutive patients with zzso enhancement detected on zzso zzso after biopsy or zzso We described zzso enhancement using the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso whether clustered ring enhancement was present and whether surrounding high signal intensity zzso was present on zzso imaging were zzso 

Cancer was identified in 85 zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was found in 41 zzso and invasive cancer in 44 zzso The features found to be significant zzso of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and clustered ring enhancement zzso zzso zzso and surrounding high zzso on zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso The features found to be significant zzso of invasive cancer were zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso and surrounding high zzso on zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso There were no significant zzso features for zzso zzso enhancement was found to be a significant predictor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns were not significant zzso of zzso zzso enhancement of 1 zzso or larger was more often zzso than zzso smaller than 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, a zzso size of 1 zzso or larger was found to be the only significant predictor of zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and clustered ring zzso surrounding high zzso on zzso zzso and a zzso size of 1 zzso or larger can act as zzso of zzso for zzso enhancement detected on zzso zzso but kinetic characteristics zzso
