Recent studies have questioned the ability of the zzso technique to place the anterior cruciate ligament graft within the footprint of the anterior cruciate ligament on the zzso There are limited data directly comparing the abilities of zzso and zzso zzso techniques to place the graft zzso at the zzso attachment site of the anterior cruciate ligament in zzso 

Because placement with the zzso zzso technique is zzso by the zzso tunnel, it would allow for more zzso tunnel placement compared with the zzso zzso 

zzso study; Level of evidence, zzso 

zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and advanced zzso modeling techniques were used to measure in zzso zzso tunnel placement in 8 patients with the zzso technique and 8 patients with a zzso zzso zzso zzso tunnel placement in 3 dimensions was measured relative to the center of the native anterior cruciate ligament attachment on the intact zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso technique placed the graft closer to the center of the native anterior cruciate ligament attachment compared with the zzso zzso The zzso technique placed the tunnel center an average of 9 zzso from the center of the anterior cruciate ligament attachment, compared with 3 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso technique resulted in a more anterior and superior placement of the tunnel compared with the zzso zzso independent zzso 

The zzso zzso technique allowed for more zzso zzso tunnel placement compared with the zzso zzso
