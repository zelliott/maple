zzso zzso and pathological findings suggest a close relationship between zzso lateral sclerosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso We studied the patterns of cortical zzso across the spectrum between ALS and zzso A zzso zzso analysis based on an zzso and zzso sample of 81 ALS patients and 62 healthy control subjects zzso was zzso In addition, we used an zzso zzso of 57 ALS patients and 31 HC to compare cortical thickness between 3 groups of zzso characterized ALS zzso zzso cognitively zzso zzso cognitively zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso the entire sample of patients demonstrated cortical thinning in the bilateral zzso zzso right zzso and right frontal and zzso zzso zzso patients showed cortical thinning in regions including the frontal and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso impaired ALS patients showed cortical thinning in regions largely overlapping with those found in zzso but changes were less zzso In conclusion, the cognitive status of ALS subjects is associated with different patterns of cortical zzso
