zzso regulation can be achieved in various ways, but few studies have evaluated the extent to which the zzso zzso of these distinct operations zzso In the study reported here, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to measure activity in the zzso and prefrontal zzso of 10 participants who completed two independent tasks of emotion zzso measuring intentional emotion regulation, and affect zzso measuring incidental emotion zzso the objective of identifying potential overlap in the neural zzso underlying each zzso zzso focused on a zzso regions of interest in the zzso and inferior frontal zzso zzso For both tasks, zzso showed decreased zzso zzso during emotion regulation compared with emotion zzso During zzso this decrease in zzso zzso was accompanied by a zzso decrease in emotional intensity zzso during affect zzso the decrease in zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso across participants, the magnitude of decrease in zzso zzso during zzso correlated with the magnitude of decrease during affect zzso even though the tasks were administered on separate days, and values indexing zzso zzso during each task were extracted independently of one zzso In addition, zzso zzso assessed via zzso interaction analysis, overlapped between tasks in two regions within the right zzso The results suggest that the two tasks recruit overlapping regions of prefrontal cortex, resulting in similar reductions in zzso zzso regardless of the strategy zzso zzso and incidental forms of emotion regulation, despite their zzso differences, may therefore zzso on a common zzso zzso
