zzso or continuous zzso tumors with accompanying portal vein zzso yield considerable changes in the magnetic resonance imaging findings of zzso zzso The overlapped imaging findings of these two zzso zzso may be zzso We aimed to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging findings of widespread zzso zzso zzso complicated with portal vein zzso 

Twenty-two patients (20 male, 2 zzso mean age: 57 zzso with portal vein zzso and zzso zzso zzso who underwent zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging in our department between August 2001 and November 2008 were evaluated zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso images were reviewed in each zzso 

On zzso magnetic resonance images, tumors were seen mildly zzso in 11 patients and zzso zzso in 11 zzso zzso zzso images demonstrated homogeneous zzso in 15 patients and zzso zzso in 7 zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance images showed zzso enhancement in 12 patients, zzso enhancement in 6 patients, strong enhancement in 1 patient, and minimal enhancement in 3 zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance images demonstrated zzso zzso in all zzso zzso vein zzso was present in all zzso The mean diameter of main portal vein zzso was 27 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated in all zzso 

In patients with chronic zzso liver disease, when portal vein zzso and high serum zzso values zzso careful attention must be paid to the zzso zzso changes, especially on zzso images, in order to not overlook zzso zzso zzso
