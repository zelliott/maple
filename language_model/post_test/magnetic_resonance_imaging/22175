The tunnel size is reported to play a role in median zzso The aim of the study was to zzso the volume of the zzso tunnel in a selected population with idiopathic zzso tunnel syndrome zzso as the zzso point of the canal was zzso zzso patients with zzso and 28 zzso controls were zzso All participants were zzso Both groups underwent nerve zzso studies and magnetic resonance zzso of the zzso On the MR zzso images, the volume of zzso tunnels, the zzso and the zzso muscles were calculated zzso in all zzso The values for the signal intensity of the median nerve from all zzso were also zzso and correlated with the zzso zzso The zzso tunnel volume zzso and the wrist volume zzso ratio were almost identical in both groups zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso The focal zzso point of the tunnel was similarly located in both zzso and detected at its zzso third, about 8 zzso from the zzso The median nerve in the patients zzso a higher signal compared with the controls, p zzso zzso Between the two groups, there were differences in the zzso and the zzso zzso of the median sensory branch zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso respectively), as well as in the zzso and the zzso zzso of the median motor branch zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso There was no difference in the size of the zzso tunnel in women with idiopathic zzso compared with healthy controls, as the focal zzso point was equally located in both groups near the canal zzso
