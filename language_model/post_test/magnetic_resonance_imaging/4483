Long term clinical and zzso benefits of dynamic zzso zzso have been zzso However, no information is available about long-term zzso changes in the wrapped zzso zzso zzso muscle in zzso 

The zzso zzso muscle zzso was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 5 patients submitted to DC for treatment of severe zzso zzso All patients were studied from 24 to 52 months after the surgical procedure at the time of the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso was zzso with burst of 6 zzso zzso duration 185 zzso burst zzso zzso synchronized to every cardiac contraction with a maximum of 100 zzso zzso Images were acquired on a GE zzso zzso T system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slice thickness zzso 

The thickness of was zzso zzso zzso In addition, the signal intensity of the zzso was compared with that of zzso skeletal muscle and was found to be increased zzso zzso zzso The signal intensity was similar to that of subcutaneous fat in those zzso 

zzso changes in the wrapped zzso muscle consistent with fatty zzso occur after DC and can be detected by zzso Further studies will be necessary to demonstrate the clinical significance of such zzso muscle zzso zzso
