There is a need for in zzso monitoring of cell zzso and survival after cardiac cell transplantation zzso This study assessed the feasibility and usefulness of combined PET and zzso for monitoring cell zzso and survival after cell zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells zzso derived from zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso blood, were zzso zzso with the sodium zzso zzso zzso gene for reporter gene imaging by zzso and labeled with iron zzso for zzso by zzso Imaging and zzso analysis were performed on 3 groups of nude rats on days 1, 3, and 7 after zzso injection of 4 million zzso 

In zzso studies demonstrated stable expression of functional zzso protein and normal viability of zzso after zzso On day 1, after zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso successfully on zzso as a regional signal void in the healthy zzso and on PET as zzso zzso The zzso zzso decreased on day 3 and was zzso on day 7, and the zzso signal remained unchanged throughout the follow-up zzso zzso analysis with zzso and zzso zzso confirmed the presence of either labeled or zzso control transplanted zzso at the site of injection on day 1 but not on day 7, when only zzso zzso were zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso end labeling showed extensive zzso at the site of zzso 

The combination of zzso and PET allows imaging of zzso and survival of transplanted zzso together with zzso information about the zzso Although iron labeling rapidly loses specificity for cell viability because of zzso of iron particles released from dead cells, reporter gene expression provided specific information on the number of surviving zzso This zzso approach allows complementary analysis of cell zzso and zzso
