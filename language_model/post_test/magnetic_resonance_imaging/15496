zzso adult zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso and rare seizures, and is a zzso disorder linked to the FAME 1 zzso A similar disorder has been linked to the FAME 2 zzso 

zzso patients from two families with zzso and zzso were evaluated clinically and underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three had responses to magnetic stimulation zzso zzso was assessed for zzso markers across the FAME 1 and 2 zzso 

The median age at onset was 20 years, with many patients having frequent seizures, cognitive zzso and zzso zzso zzso features of cortical zzso were typically present, but zzso was zzso zzso frequently demonstrated zzso zzso zzso of a single case showed zzso cell loss, zzso zzso and zzso loss and zzso in the olives and zzso Analysis of zzso for markers at the FAME 1 and FAME 2 zzso excluded these as the region containing the same locus in one family, but only the FAME 2 locus was excluded in the other zzso 

This form of familial adult zzso zzso does not show linkage to either of the known familial adult zzso zzso zzso and is characterized in some members by frequent seizures, zzso zzso zzso and progression of the zzso This may represent a new form of progressive zzso and zzso which we have termed familial adult zzso zzso type zzso
