This experiment investigates neural processes underlying zzso identification of the same zzso for zzso and zzso zzso A model is proposed implicating the use of zzso and zzso zzso to facilitate zzso identification under conditions in which the phonetic contrast is zzso as in the case of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso speakers are predicted to use zzso phonetic representations to a greater extent for zzso identification than zzso zzso The English zzso phonetic contrast, although easy for native English speakers, is extremely difficult for native Japanese speakers who learned English as a second language after zzso Twenty-two native English and zzso native Japanese speakers participated in this zzso While undergoing zzso zzso subjects were zzso presented with syllables starting with a zzso zzso or a vowel and were required to rapidly identify the zzso perceived by pushing one of three buttons with the left zzso zzso with the proposed model, the results show greater activity for second- over zzso speakers during zzso identification of zzso and zzso relative to zzso in brain regions implicated with zzso forward and inverse zzso zzso models zzso area, anterior zzso anterior superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso area zzso zzso and zzso The results further show that activity in brain regions implicated with zzso these internal models is correlated with better zzso and zzso identification performance for zzso zzso Greater activity found for zzso speakers especially in the anterior zzso for zzso and zzso zzso identification is consistent with the hypothesis that zzso speakers use auditory phonetic representations more extensively than zzso zzso
