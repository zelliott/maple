zzso zzso zzso have been described in individuals with Duane zzso syndrome with or without vertical gaze zzso This was a study of five family members with distinctive zzso zzso patterns that zzso with a novel zzso zzso zzso 

Participating members of a family segregating zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso and several underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the orbits and brain zzso zzso DNA was extracted and amplified for zzso analysis encompassing the zzso region on zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso signaling protein zzso In zzso functional studies of the zzso zzso were performed, including a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 

All five clinically affected family members exhibited zzso or zzso zzso deficits, three in the absence of Duane zzso zzso zzso in four affected individuals demonstrated small or absent zzso nerves in all four, small zzso nerve in one, and small zzso nerves in zzso Superior zzso muscle volume was also decreased in three of the individuals, supporting zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso with the zzso locus and affected individuals zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso this novel zzso behaved similarly to previously reported zzso zzso underlying familial Duane syndrome, zzso zzso by enhancing its zzso and membrane association and lowering total zzso zzso 

Analysis of the current pedigree expands the zzso spectrum of zzso zzso zzso to include vertical zzso and zzso deficits in the absence of Duane zzso zzso
