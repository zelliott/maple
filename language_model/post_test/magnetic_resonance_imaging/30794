The purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso MR imaging of the lung zzso in comparison with zzso zzso and lateral chest zzso zzso One hundred one zzso zzso patients who had received routine zzso were additionally examined with magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso zzso zzso sequences were: constructive interference in steady state zzso true fast imaging in steady state zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Consensus reading of two observers was performed for zzso Three other observers analyzed zzso of the zzso examinations for each sequence zzso The individual results for the comparisons between the sequences and zzso were calculated using zzso zzso with their corresponding confidence zzso Additionally, an zzso analysis was zzso The proportions of agreement for the three sequences compared with zzso were high, with zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso zzso and the corresponding confidence intervals were zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso differences between zzso and zzso were mainly related to advantages resulting from zzso zzso The smallest zzso lower confidence bound of the three zzso measures for comparing the MR readers with each other was zzso indicating a high zzso zzso zzso zzso of the lung zzso using the zzso sequence is well comparable with chest zzso and demonstrates slight advantages resulting from the zzso imaging zzso
