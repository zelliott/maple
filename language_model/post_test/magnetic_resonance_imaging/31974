Current functional zzso techniques relying on zzso zzso are inherently limited in their ability to accurately zzso neural activity in space and zzso To address these limitations, we previously proposed a novel technique based on the zzso effect and demonstrated its ability to directly image minute electrical activity with a zzso zzso resolution in gel zzso containing zzso wires as well as in the human median nerve in zzso To better characterize its contrast mechanism and ultimately further improve its sensitivity for in zzso applications, we now apply this technique to image zzso currents in solution, which serve as a better model for neural zzso in biological systems than the electronic currents in zzso wires used in previous phantom zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso currents with zzso and current zzso on the same order of magnitude as those induced by zzso activity in nerve fibers and in the brain can be zzso
