Recent studies of functional brain imaging have shown the involvement of the zzso zzso in executive processes such as planning and zzso However, the specific contributions of the zzso in those processes remain zzso This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the zzso nucleus is primarily involved in the preparation of a novel action and not in zzso per zzso 

In the present zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study, a new task was developed that permitted, for the first time, to distinguish between shifts in zzso when the rule is implicitly given by the task from shifts that require cognitive comparison and zzso 

zzso increased activity in the zzso nucleus and the zzso was observed only in conditions in which cognitive planning was required to perform a zzso whereas significant zzso was seen in the zzso nucleus (another region of the zzso zzso in all shifting conditions whether or not planning was zzso 

We suggest that the zzso nucleus and the zzso are particularly important, respectively, in the planning and the execution of a zzso novel action, whereas the zzso nucleus may be required when a new motor program is solicited independently of the choice of zzso
