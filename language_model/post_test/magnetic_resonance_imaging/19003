Several authors have recently reported encouraging results from low-level direct current therapy in easily accessible zzso zzso However, zzso effects in zzso zzso have not been investigated zzso 

Using an animal model with induced zzso zzso we analyzed the effectiveness and the tumor growth dynamics after direct current zzso Three weeks after induction tumor volumes were estimated with magnetic resonance imaging zzso Then direct current zzso zzso was applied in the treatment group by means of one zzso in the tumor center and four zzso zzso In the control group zzso were placed without applying zzso zzso growth dynamics was analyzed with zzso after 3 and 5 zzso After this all animals were killed, and the zzso zzso zzso 

After 5 weeks zzso showed a zzso tumor enlargement in the treatment group versus a zzso enlargement in the control group zzso zzso test, zzso The zzso analysis of the treated zzso yielded a zzso complete response rate and a zzso partial response zzso No zzso were found in the control zzso 

These results confirm the effectiveness of low-level direct current application as a potential zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso
