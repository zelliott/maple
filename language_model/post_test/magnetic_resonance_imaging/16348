zzso zzso zzso is a pediatric brain tumor with a median survival time of 1 year and few long-term zzso Conventional zzso has not been shown to predict overall zzso With this dismal zzso clinical improvement after radiation therapy might be a more relevant zzso 

To determine whether initial imaging would predict clinical zzso 

We performed a retrospective review of children with diffuse zzso zzso treated at The Children's Hospital, Denver, and the University of zzso from 1995 to zzso The 30 children were divided into two groups based on acute clinical response to radiation zzso zzso zzso on presenting zzso were compared between the zzso 

Seven of 30 children did not respond to radiation zzso There were no statistically significant differences in initial imaging characteristics between zzso and zzso zzso and enhancement were more common in zzso zzso surrounding the zzso artery, zzso of the 4th zzso and extension to the zzso were more common in zzso 

Conventional zzso at presentation does not predict clinical response in children with diffuse zzso zzso Additional studies with larger numbers of patients and other imaging zzso are zzso
