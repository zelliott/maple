zzso of visual systems after early brain damage has been extensively studied in animal models but poorly documented in children after visual zzso zzso This report describes the visual recovery of a male child who had a bilateral zzso lobe zzso at the age of 2 years 6 months, 10 days after colon zzso for zzso zzso In the acute phase he had severe visual impairment without visual zzso Some weeks later he could perceive zzso Since then, progressive recovery of his visual acuity and zzso abilities has been accompanied by a progressive reduction of the visual field zzso At 6 years 8 months, visual recognition acuity was zzso in both eyes and zzso examination was normal, except for persistence of the visual field zzso in the upper zzso and a selective impairment of higher visual functions zzso of object presented in a zzso way zzso overlapping zzso or use of complex zzso zzso The functional recovery observed in this patient confirms the zzso plasticity of developing visual systems after early brain zzso It suggests that in humans, as in animal models, processes related to cerebral plasticity may take place years after a brain zzso has been zzso
