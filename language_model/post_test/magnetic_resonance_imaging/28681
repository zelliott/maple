To determine whether there is a relationship between the zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso seen on magnetic resonance zzso imaging and the patient's age, duration of symptoms, or location of the zzso 

All zzso proven zzso zzso seen in our institutions during a zzso period in patients with known age, zzso duration of symptoms, and available zzso and MR imaging examinations were included in this zzso The extent of the zzso in the bone zzso and zzso soft tissue around the zzso of zzso zzso on zzso MR imaging were graded from 1 zzso to 4 zzso by two masked zzso The relationships between the patient's age, duration of symptoms, and location of zzso were evaluated by zzso correlation zzso and analysis of zzso 

zzso cases met the inclusion zzso The observer agreement on grading was zzso Patients of 15 years of age or younger had significantly higher grades than patients older than 15 zzso There was a moderate negative linear correlation between the patient's age and zzso zzso No significant relationship was identified between zzso and the duration of symptoms or the location of zzso 

zzso zzso in younger patients tend to be associated with more extensive zzso zzso
