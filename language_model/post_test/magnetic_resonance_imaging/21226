To investigate spatial patterns of intrinsic neural activity of depressed patients with vascular risk factors using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to examine the relationship between regional activity abnormalities and symptom severity factor, we analyzed spatial patterns of spontaneous brain activity in 19 depressed patients with vascular risk factors and 18 healthy zzso zzso brain activity was measured by the zzso of zzso fluctuations zzso of the zzso blood oxygen level dependent zzso zzso patients with vascular risk factors showed decrease in zzso in the zzso zzso Specifically, the altered zzso values zzso left zzso and right superior frontal zzso were significantly correlated with depression severity in the depressed zzso In addition, higher zzso values in the right middle zzso zzso and right superior zzso zzso were observed in depressed patients with vascular risk zzso Our findings reveal distinct functional patterns of abnormal brain activity in depressed patients with vascular risk factors and have implications for the understanding of the zzso of this zzso zzso
