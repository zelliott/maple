This study proposes a fast zzso dynamic programming expansion to find a shortest surface in a zzso zzso This zzso can detect boundaries in an image zzso Using phantom image studies with added uniform distributed noise from different zzso the unsigned error of this proposed method is zzso Comparing the automated results to the gold standard, the best averaged relative unsigned error of the proposed method is zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso and its corresponding zzso values are zzso We further apply this method to detect the boundary of the real superficial zzso artery zzso in zzso sequences without a contrast zzso The manual zzso on the zzso boundaries are performed by well-trained experts to be the gold zzso The comparisons between the manual zzso and automated results are made on 16 zzso sequences zzso total zzso The average unsigned error rate is zzso zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform zzso better than the zzso dynamic programming for vessel boundary detection on zzso zzso
