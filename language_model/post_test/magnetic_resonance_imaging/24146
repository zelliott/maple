The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of arm traction combined with MR zzso in the evaluation of superior zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso shoulders were studied with a zzso MR imaging unit with the arm zzso zzso Fifteen zzso of a zzso contrast agent were injected into the zzso zzso zzso sets of images of zzso zzso were evaluated independently by two zzso These sets consisted of MR zzso images obtained with traction zzso to the wrist using zzso to zzso zzso and without traction in five shoulders in which SLAP zzso had been excluded zzso or by zzso zzso and MR zzso images obtained with and without traction in seven shoulders in which various types of SLAP zzso had been created zzso and later confirmed by zzso zzso 

Analysis of the data indicated that MR zzso in combination with arm traction and external rotation improved diagnostic accuracy with regard to identification and categorization of SLAP zzso when compared with studies made without zzso 

The combination of MR zzso and arm traction with the shoulder in external rotation provides a more effective approach for detection of SLAP zzso than does similar MR zzso performed without arm zzso
