Rates of brain zzso derived from serial magnetic resonance zzso studies may be used to assess therapies for Alzheimer's disease zzso These measures may be zzso by changes in scanner zzso zzso For this reason, the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso included the imaging of a geometric phantom with every zzso This study compares zzso zzso correction using a phantom with correction using a 9 degrees of freedom zzso registration zzso We took 129 pairs of baseline and zzso repeat scans, and calculated the volume zzso zzso previously measured using the zzso We used the registration zzso to zzso any residual zzso zzso and found the zzso to be zzso with no significant zzso difference between control zzso and zzso subjects zzso but with a mean zzso absolute volume change of zzso zzso % due to linear zzso zzso registration was shown to be comparable to geometric phantom correction in terms of the effect on zzso measurement and unbiased with respect to disease zzso These results suggest that the additional expense and zzso effort of scanning a phantom with every patient scan can be avoided by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, based upon the zzso rates in the zzso subjects in this study, sample size requirements would be approximately zzso lower with zzso correction for zzso zzso than if no correction was zzso
