The authors sought to determine the diagnostic performance of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the evaluation of prostate cancer before and after zzso high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso zzso 

We zzso 25 patients with prostate zzso The zzso zzso zzso value was evaluated 1, 4 and 6 months after zzso zzso imaging was performed the day prior to and 1, 4 and 6 months after zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso were obtained at the time of diagnosis and 6 months after zzso 

Before treatment, zzso zzso were considered to be potential sites of zzso and subsequently confirmed as sites of prostate zzso in all 25 patients based on zzso zzso zzso values and zzso examinations zzso zzso Using zzso as the gold standard, zzso imaging displayed zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value and zzso negative zzso value before zzso After zzso treatment, zzso imaging showed zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso imaging can be used to zzso prostate zzso Several zzso and zzso modifications in the follow-up zzso images after zzso treatment were also zzso
