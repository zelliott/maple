As zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso have been widely used for the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso it is clinically relevant to determine the diagnostic efficacy of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for detection of zzso with respect to the severity of liver zzso 

To compare the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for detection of zzso with respect to the severity of liver zzso 

A total of 189 patients with 240 zzso zzso zzso zzso A, 81 patients with 90 zzso zzso B, 65 patients with 85 zzso zzso C, 43 patients with 65 zzso underwent zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso A zzso acid set zzso and zzso phase plus zzso zzso and zzso set zzso plus zzso zzso for each zzso class were analyzed independently by two observers for detecting zzso using zzso characteristic zzso The diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity were zzso 

There was a trend toward decreased diagnostic accuracy for zzso acid and zzso set with respect to the severity of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso For both observers, the sensitivities of both image sets were highest in zzso class A zzso zzso zzso followed by class B zzso zzso zzso and class C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were highest in zzso class A, followed by zzso class B, and zzso class C, indicating a tendency toward decreased diagnostic capability with the severity of zzso
