zzso zzso zzso is an established zzso method in gynecology and zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and their accuracy in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging zzso for assessing fetal lung volume using in zzso lung zzso 

zzso in zzso lung models with randomly defined volumes ranging from 1 to 60 zzso were made from gelatin with plastic zzso manually molded into the shape of fetal zzso The models were measured using zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso volumes were calculated using the zzso technique with angles of zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences were used for the zzso zzso The percentage error and absolute percentage error were calculated for each method, and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was assessed with zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso between calculated and real volumes using the limits of agreement method was also zzso 

The zzso for the rotation angles indicated very good zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso No systematic errors were observed in the mean percentage errors for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The lowest median absolute percentage error zzso was obtained with zzso zzso significantly lower than the values for zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There were no significant differences in absolute percentage errors between the rotation angles zzso zzso zzso and no significant differences in limits of agreement between zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was almost as accurate as zzso in this in zzso model and can be regarded as a good alternative zzso Further research is needed to confirm these findings in zzso and to assess the zzso value in fetuses with lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
