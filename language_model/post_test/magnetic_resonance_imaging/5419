zzso radiation therapy zzso provides excellent zzso control for zzso zzso zzso and has gradually replaced two-dimensional conventional zzso as the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in the new seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer zzso staging system, zzso zzso zzso were upgraded from zzso to zzso disease as a result of their negative impact on the distant zzso survival zzso rates of zzso This retrospective study was conducted in order to review the treatment outcomes and patterns of failure in zzso patients with zzso disease after zzso in order to effectively guide treatment in the zzso 

We zzso reviewed data from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were 191 patients with negative cervical zzso zzso zzso According to the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer zzso staging system, 110 patients zzso were staged with zzso disease, and 81 patients zzso were reclassified with zzso disease due to the presence of zzso zzso All patients received zzso as the primary zzso 

In patients with negative cervical zzso zzso involvement, distant zzso survival zzso was significantly higher in patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso For zzso disease, the zzso overall survival zzso local zzso survival zzso zzso zzso survival zzso and zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were higher in zzso zzso patients than zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso 

The seventh edition of the zzso zzso system improves zzso accuracy by upgrading zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso produces excellent survival rates in zzso zzso zzso however, zzso disease remains a challenge and additional improvements are required to achieve a favorable prognosis for these zzso zzso
