zzso zzso is required for episodic zzso zzso and retrieval of novel and memorable items have been related to different locations in the zzso however, the data remain zzso The application of a newly designed keyboard allowed investigation of brain zzso during zzso and free immediate and delayed recall with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in young healthy controls zzso zzso zzso Because of the repetitive learning and recall conditions, an individual learning zzso was used to contrast neural activity at different individual levels of zzso During learning, subjects were asked to memorize 10 geometric patterns requiring the establishment of zzso associations for zzso After learning, subjects were asked to recall the items actively via the zzso Learning and recall were zzso five zzso Delayed recall was scanned about 15 zzso after the fifth immediate recall condition without subjects having seen the items zzso zzso anterior zzso activity was observed during conditions of initial learning as well as maximum zzso zzso activity during delayed recall did not reveal zzso responses and was characterized by a transition of neural activity from zzso regions to bilateral zzso zzso We conclude that both zzso and segregation depend on the specific zzso characteristics of the stimuli requiring establishment of zzso associations for zzso as well as zzso The absence of zzso zzso during delayed recall together with the increase of lateral zzso involvement possibly zzso with an emerging transition from episodic to long-term zzso
