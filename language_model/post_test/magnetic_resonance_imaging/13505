MR images of 24 patients with 33 zzso collections were zzso reviewed to determine the spectrum of MR findings associated with such zzso The zzso were dated by history, when zzso zzso were grouped as zzso zzso zzso early zzso zzso late zzso zzso zzso zzso Six collections were classified as zzso and two patients had zzso zzso zzso zzso evolved in a pattern similar to zzso zzso with the exception of chronic zzso zzso in which zzso of zzso relative to gray matter was observed on short zzso images compared with the persistent very high signal intensity noted in chronic zzso zzso zzso was rarely seen in chronic zzso These findings are most likely the result of the absence of a zzso barrier, which allowed clearance and dilution of blood zzso zzso zzso with repeat zzso demonstrated multiple zzso of bleeding with layering phenomenon and more frequent zzso zzso It is possible that the clearance of blood products, as observed in chronic zzso zzso is impaired or poorly functional when zzso zzso The persistence of high signal from zzso in a zzso that is expected to be in the chronic phase also suggests repeated zzso Acute zzso zzso zzso had signal zzso identical to zzso without MR evidence of blood zzso At surgery, clear fluid under pressure was zzso MR imaging, with its unique ability to delineate the various zzso of zzso is well suited to the evaluation of zzso zzso
