Owning to its clinical accessibility, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been extensively studied in the past decades for prediction of Alzheimer's disease zzso and mild cognitive impairment zzso The volumes of gray matter zzso white matter zzso and zzso fluid zzso are the most commonly used zzso resulting in many successful zzso It has been widely observed that zzso structural changes may not occur at isolated spots, but in several zzso zzso zzso for better characterization of brain pathology, we propose in this paper a means to extract zzso correlation based features from local zzso zzso Specifically, our approach involves constructing an anatomical brain network for each subject, with each zzso representing a Region of Interest zzso and each edge representing zzso correlation of tissue zzso zzso between zzso zzso As second order zzso zzso network features are more descriptive but also more sensitive to zzso To overcome this zzso a hierarchy of zzso is used to suppress noise at different zzso zzso interactions are considered not only for zzso with the same scale in the same layer of the zzso but also for zzso across different scales in different zzso To address the high zzso problem resulting from the large number of network features, a supervised zzso reduction method is further employed to zzso a selected subset of features into a low zzso feature space, while at the same time preserving zzso zzso We demonstrate with experimental results the efficacy of this embedding strategy in comparison with some other commonly used zzso In addition, although the proposed method can be easily generalized to incorporate other metrics of regional similarities, the benefits of using zzso correlation in our application are reinforced by the experimental zzso Without requiring new sources of information, our proposed approach improves the accuracy of zzso prediction from zzso (of conventional zzso zzso to zzso (of zzso network zzso evaluated using data sets randomly drawn from the zzso zzso Disease zzso zzso zzso
