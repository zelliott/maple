We examined the relationship between portal zzso zzso and zzso fat in patients with zzso fatty liver disease zzso using spectral zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In this prospective study, 35 patients with zzso and 29 normal healthy adults zzso zzso underwent portal zzso zzso The severity of zzso zzso in patients with zzso was assessed by zzso through chemical shift imaging, using a modification of the Dixon zzso zzso zzso and zzso fat was measured by zzso 

The difference in portal zzso zzso between the patients with zzso and the control group was significant zzso zzso zzso There was no correlation between the degree of abdominal or zzso fat and portal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were strong correlations between the zzso fat fraction and subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fat zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that patients with zzso have lower portal zzso zzso than normal healthy zzso
