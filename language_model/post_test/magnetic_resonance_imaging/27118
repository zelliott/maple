The effect of zzso differences on an MR image is known to increase with field zzso zzso field zzso within the zzso influence the apparent zzso relaxation time zzso zzso while effects due to different zzso zzso between zzso caused by local field variations are evident in the image phase, and zzso imaging highlights the veins and deep brain zzso Here, these three contrast mechanisms are examined at a field strength of zzso zzso The zzso * maps generated allow the identification of white matter structures not visible in conventional zzso Phase images with zzso resolutions down to 130 zzso were zzso showing high zzso matter contrast and allowing the identification of internal cortical zzso The zzso images yield excellent visibility of small zzso structures and attain an zzso resolution of 175 zzso
