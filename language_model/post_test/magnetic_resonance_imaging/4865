zzso of idiopathic zzso hypertension zzso are usually caused by elevated zzso pressure zzso In a similar way as in the zzso zzso elevated zzso could also compromise the zzso nerve zzso On the other side, there is growing evidence that an extensive zzso network system around the zzso nerves could be disturbed in zzso fluid disorders like zzso The hypothesis that patients with zzso suffer from zzso has been suggested in the zzso However, this has not been proven in clinical studies zzso This pilot study investigates whether structural changes of the zzso nerve system can be detected in patients with zzso 

zzso patients with zzso and 23 matched controls were zzso zzso bulb volume zzso and zzso zzso zzso depth were calculated by magnetic resonance zzso While mean values of total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso depth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar in both groups, zzso correlation showed that patients with a shorter medical history zzso revealed a smaller zzso zzso zzso In zzso symptomatic patients zzso the effect was greater zzso zzso Patients who suffered from zzso for less than one year zzso total zzso was significantly smaller than in matched controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with visual disturbances zzso revealed a lower zzso depth than patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso changes of the zzso nerve system could be present in zzso patients at an early stage of zzso
