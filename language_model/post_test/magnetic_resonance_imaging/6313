The positively charged zzso spin label, zzso zzso was zzso in two types of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso were incubated with mouse zzso zzso zzso cells to study the zzso and metabolism of zzso zzso in zzso The effects of temperature, zzso zzso and fixation of cells were zzso The results indicate that different mechanisms are involved in the zzso of these two types of zzso zzso zzso interact zzso with the plasma membrane of zzso cells and release zzso zzso whereas the majority of zzso zzso are taken into the cells intact via zzso These findings suggest that it may be possible to deliver zzso zzso either to the membrane of cells or to their interior by manipulating the zzso composition of the zzso This study also found that the rate of reduction of zzso delivered using zzso was increased under hypoxic zzso Thus, the use of zzso for in zzso delivery of zzso has the potential to provide zzso contrast that reflects different zzso zzso
