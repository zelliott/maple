The objectives of the study were to zzso three zzso sequences for in zzso knee imaging at zzso T zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to compare imaging performance and diagnostic confidence concerning zzso zzso changes at zzso and zzso T zzso 

zzso zzso sequences for cartilage imaging at zzso T were tailored for zzso zzso an zzso fast zzso zzso zzso a fast imaging employing zzso acquisition zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three healthy subjects and seven patients with mild zzso were zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso ratio zzso diagnostic confidence in assessing cartilage zzso and image quality were zzso zzso were assessed with the whole organ magnetic resonance imaging score zzso zzso cartilage zzso and bone zzso zzso pattern zzso were also zzso 

At zzso zzso zzso was increased zzso zzso zzso for all zzso For the zzso zzso zzso limitations with the specific zzso rate zzso required modifications of the scan parameters yielding an incomplete coverage of the knee joint, extensive artifacts, and a less effective fat zzso zzso and image quality were increased zzso zzso zzso for zzso and FIESTA and decreased for zzso zzso zzso confidence for cartilage zzso was highest zzso zzso zzso for FIESTA at zzso zzso zzso of zzso was decreased zzso zzso zzso at zzso T due to limited performance of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso pulse sequences like zzso and FIESTA are well suited for imaging at zzso which may improve early detection of cartilage zzso However, zzso zzso zzso sequences are less feasible for clinical zzso
