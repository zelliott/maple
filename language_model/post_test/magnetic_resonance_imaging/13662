To determine whether the zzso white matter zzso regions surrounding and remote from multiple sclerosis zzso plaques have abnormal zzso zzso and to compare zzso maps with apparent diffusion zzso zzso maps for sensitivity in the detection of white matter zzso zzso 

Conventional and diffusion zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging examinations were performed in 26 patients with zzso and in 26 zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso maps were generated and zzso with zzso MR zzso Uniform regions of interest were placed on zzso zzso white matter zzso regions, zzso regions in the zzso side of the brain, and zzso regions in control subjects to obtain zzso and zzso values, which were compared across the zzso zzso 

The mean zzso was zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for control subject zzso The mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for control subject zzso zzso differences in zzso and zzso values were observed among all zzso regions zzso zzso for all zzso except zzso in zzso vs control subject zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso values were abnormal in all zzso regions in the patients with zzso and were worse in the zzso regions than in the distant zzso zzso zzso MR imaging may be more accurate than zzso MR imaging for assessment of disease zzso
