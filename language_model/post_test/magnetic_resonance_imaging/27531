Studies of pediatric conduct disorder zzso have described frontal and zzso lobe structural abnormalities that parallel findings in antisocial zzso The purpose of this study was to examine previously unexplored cortical thickness and folding as markers for brain abnormalities in zzso zzso zzso On the basis of current zzso theories, we hypothesized that CD youth would have thinner zzso or less cortical folding in zzso and frontal zzso than control zzso 

We obtained zzso brain structure images from 24 control and 19 CD participants aged 12 to 18 years, matched by gender and zzso We measured group differences in cortical thickness and local zzso index zzso cortical folding zzso using zzso zzso with zzso correction for multiple zzso 

The CD participants, compared with control subjects, showed both reduced cortical thickness and zzso zzso zzso was located primarily in zzso brain regions, including left superior zzso and zzso zzso zzso junction and zzso zzso right superior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso deficits were located mainly in anterior brain regions and included left zzso zzso and zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso right superior frontal and zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Our findings generally agree with previous CD zzso studies but here show the unique contributions of cortical thickness and folding to gray matter reductions in pure CD in different brain zzso
