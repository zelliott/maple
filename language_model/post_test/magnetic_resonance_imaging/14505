zzso of the cervical spine in patients who have sustained trauma remains a contentious zzso Clinical examination alone is sufficient in zzso intact patients without neck zzso Patients with neck pain or those with altered mental status or a depressed level of consciousness require further zzso zzso However, no consensus exists as to the appropriate imaging zzso Some advocate zzso CT zzso scanning alone, but this has been criticized because zzso is not sensitive in detecting zzso injuries that can often only be identified on zzso 

Patients were identified zzso from a zzso maintained database at a Level I trauma zzso All patients admitted between January 2004 and June 2011 who had a cervical zzso scan interpreted by a zzso zzso as being without evidence of acute traumatic injury and who also had a cervical zzso study obtained during the same hospital admission were zzso Data collected included patient zzso mechanism of injury, zzso zzso zzso score at the time of zzso the indication for and findings on zzso and the number, type, and indication for cervical spine zzso 

A total of zzso patients were zzso of whom zzso were male, with an overall mean age of 47 zzso The indication for zzso was neck pain in zzso patients, altered mental status in zzso and neurological signs or symptoms in zzso The zzso studies were interpreted as normal in 645 patients, zzso zzso injury alone in zzso and showing zzso degenerative changes in the remaining zzso Of the 125 patients with zzso injuries, 66 zzso had documentation of clearance (29 clinical, 37 with zzso zzso Another 32 patients were presumed to be zzso bringing the follow-up rate to zzso zzso of zzso Five patients died prior to zzso and 1 patient was transferred to another facility prior to zzso Based on these data, the zzso confidence zzso for the assertion that clinically irrelevant zzso injury in the face of normal zzso is zzso No patient with zzso injury on zzso was documented to require a surgical procedure or halo zzso for zzso Thirty-nine patients ultimately underwent cervical surgical procedures (29 anterior and 10 zzso 5 zzso for central zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso pain zzso None had an unstable zzso 

In this study population, zzso did not add any additional information beyond zzso in identifying unstable cervical spine zzso zzso resonance imaging frequently detected zzso injuries, none of which were found to be unstable at the time of zzso during the course of admission, or on zzso zzso resonance imaging provided beneficial clinical information and guided surgical procedures in patients with neurological deficits or zzso zzso An zzso study with zzso and zzso reconstructions negative for acute injury in patients without an abnormal motor examination may be sufficient alone for zzso
