During the 1980s, the zzso of primary zzso brain and other central nervous system tumors zzso called brain zzso was reported to be increasing among all age groups in the United States, while mortality was declining for persons younger than 65 zzso We analyzed these data to provide updates on zzso and mortality trends for brain cancer in the United States and to examine these patterns in search of their zzso 

Data on zzso overall and according to zzso and zzso site, and on relative survival were obtained from the zzso zzso and End zzso zzso Program of the National Cancer Institute for 1975 through zzso zzso data were obtained from the National Center for Health zzso Medicare procedure claims from the National Cancer Institute's zzso database were used for imaging zzso zzso significant changes in zzso trends were identified, and annual percent changes were zzso for log linear zzso 

Rates stabilized for all age groups during the most recent period for which zzso data were available, except for the group containing individuals 85 years of age or zzso zzso trends continued to decline for the younger age groups, and the steep increases in mortality seen in the past for the elderly slowed zzso zzso differed by age group according to the site and grade of tumors between younger and older zzso During the last decade, use of zzso zzso scans was relatively stable for those zzso years old but increased among those 85 years old or zzso 

zzso in diagnosis and changes in the diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients provide likely explanations for the observed patterns in brain cancer zzso
