It is important to understand anatomical feature of the zzso zzso zzso for treatment of zzso zzso zzso measurement of the zzso zzso zzso however, has not been available in zzso knees including zzso zzso This study evaluated zzso zzso geometry in 30 normal knees, 30 zzso knees with zzso zzso and 30 zzso knees with zzso zzso using zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso In zzso analysis in the zzso plane, the zzso joint angle zzso angle between the zzso zzso axis and a zzso to zzso zzso was zzso degrees in the normal knees, zzso degrees in the zzso knees, and zzso degrees in the zzso zzso In zzso analysis in the zzso plane, the zzso zzso zzso showed zzso degrees of internal rotation relative to the zzso axis in the normal knees, zzso degrees in the zzso knees, and zzso degrees in the zzso zzso These results suggested that there was no zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso knees, but the lateral zzso in the zzso knees was severely zzso Surgeons should take this zzso of the lateral zzso zzso into account when total knee zzso is performed for a zzso zzso
