Young and elderly adults performed a zzso task while scanned with functional magnetic resonance zzso A zzso separated a warning and a response zzso In the variable condition, the zzso varied randomly between 1 and zzso In the fixed conditions, it was kept constant at either 1 or zzso zzso subjects responded slower than controls in both task zzso An interaction was observed between age and zzso in the variable condition zzso in the young group, zzso decreased with longer zzso whereas the elderly participants showed the opposite zzso This was accompanied by difference in brain zzso Right lateral prefrontal regions were more activated in the young than in the elderly group in the variable zzso fixed zzso zzso These findings unveil the neural zzso of age-related preparation deficits, and confirm that the involvement of right lateral prefrontal zzso is essential for strategic preparation under uncertain timing zzso
