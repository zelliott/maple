zzso radiation therapy dose planning directly on magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans would reduce costs and uncertainties due to zzso image zzso zzso planning using a combined zzso accelerator approach will also require dose calculations to be performed using zzso zzso The aim of this work was to develop an zzso method to map realistic electron zzso to zzso scans for dose calculations and digitally reconstructed zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and CT scan data were collected from 39 prostate zzso zzso from 2 patients showed significantly different anatomy from that of the remaining patient population, and these patients were zzso A zzso zzso zzso was generated based on the manually delineated zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso was generated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans for each patient were automatically generated by global and zzso registration of the zzso zzso to the patient zzso zzso followed by application of the same transformations to the zzso zzso Comparisons were made between organ zzso by using the zzso similarity zzso zzso and point dose calculations for 26 patients on planning CT and zzso zzso 

The agreement between zzso and planning CT was zzso by differences in the point dose at zzso and distance to agreement in corresponding zzso zzso differences were found to be less than zzso zzso values indicated that the planning CT and zzso dose zzso were zzso No significant differences zzso zzso zzso were found between CT and zzso zzso units for zzso of zzso Mean zzso standard zzso zzso scores for the zzso zzso of the pelvic bones were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso 

The zzso zzso method provides the ability to automatically define zzso and map realistic electron zzso to zzso scans for zzso dose planning and zzso zzso This method provides the necessary tools for zzso treatment planning and zzso zzso prostate radiation zzso
