zzso enhanced zzso is the gold standard investigation for the detection of acoustic zzso zzso zzso sequences have been suggested as an alternative for screening zzso In order to determine the utility of fast spin echo imaging, both zzso enhanced zzso weighted images and fast spin echo zzso weighted images were acquired in zzso consecutive patients referred for exclusion of acoustic zzso Two zzso independently recorded their zzso Fast spin echo zzso weighted images were evaluated with respect to the visibility of nerves within the internal auditory canals and allocated a confidence score for the presence or absence of acoustic zzso 33 acoustic zzso were zzso Only zzso were confidently identified on fast spin echo zzso weighted images alone; zzso enhanced zzso weighted images were required to confirm the diagnosis in zzso of the cases, including 9 of the 10 zzso zzso However, when identification of two normal zzso nerves is employed as the criterion of zzso the single fast spin echo zzso weighted sequence excluded acoustic zzso in 59% of this screened zzso It is concluded that an imaging strategy intended to identify small zzso acoustic zzso cannot rely on fast spin echo zzso weighted imaging zzso zzso enhanced zzso weighted imaging could be restricted to patients where fast spin echo images do not exclude acoustic zzso but this strategy requires continuous supervision by an experienced zzso In most practices the screening examination should continue to include a zzso enhanced sequence in order to zzso the detection of small acoustic zzso
