The zzso plays a crucial role in the mediation of affective behavior in humans and is implemented in the zzso network that is supposed to zzso human zzso The aim of the present study was to measure the zzso volumes in patients with a first episode of major zzso 

Thirty zzso with a first episode of depression were compared with 30 healthy volunteers matched for age, zzso zzso and education by performing structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures of the zzso 

Patients showed increased zzso volumes in both zzso as compared to healthy control zzso No significant correlations were found between zzso volumes and age, age of zzso illness zzso or severity of depression in the patient zzso 

zzso zzso volumes in patients with a first episode of major depression might be due to enhanced blood flow in the zzso rather than to a zzso structural predisposition to major zzso
