The anterior approach to the zzso nerve block may be associated with a high failure rate because the nerve lies zzso to the lesser zzso of the zzso at the level of needle zzso However, previous work using zzso demonstrated that internal rotation of the leg renders the nerve more accessible to the anterior zzso 

Ten volunteers zzso to undergo magnetic resonance zzso zzso were placed on the surface where a needle would have been inserted for an anterior approach to the zzso zzso Three scans were then zzso the first with both legs in the neutral position, the second with zzso bilateral internal rotation at the hip, and the third with zzso bilateral external rotation at the zzso 

zzso of the scans by a consultant zzso showed that, as the thigh is zzso the number of scans showing an zzso needle passage from the skin marker to the zzso nerve rate increased from zzso in external rotation to zzso in internal zzso The number of times the needle path passed through zzso zzso bundle also fell from zzso in external rotation to zzso in internal zzso 

The results confirm that, as the thigh is moved from an zzso to an internally rotated position, the zzso nerve becomes more accessible by the anterior approach at the level of the lesser zzso and the risk of zzso artery or nerve puncture is reduced but not zzso
