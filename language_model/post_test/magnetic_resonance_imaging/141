zzso and zzso assessments of zzso invasion zzso are commonly used for planning surgical procedures such as dissection of the zzso zzso however, the assessments often differ from the final diagnosis determined by pathological zzso The present study evaluated the accuracy of zzso and zzso assessments of zzso 

A total of 191 patients with zzso cancer, who underwent zzso from 1995 to 2007 in zzso University Hospital, were included in this zzso One hundred zzso patients underwent zzso zzso or zzso biopsy zzso zzso grade was compared between zzso and zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was performed before surgery, and the depth of zzso was assessed as 3 levels (no zzso zzso and zzso During surgery, the zzso wall was zzso at the most invasive part, and then, zzso gross assessment was evaluated as less than or greater than zzso 

zzso evaluation revealed that 34 patients had no invasion, 97 had less than 50% zzso and 60 had greater than 50% zzso On zzso assessment, 135 patients had correct diagnoses, and the accuracy was zzso Regarding the diagnosis of greater than 50% zzso depth, the zzso the sensitivity, and the specificity of the zzso assessment were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients were zzso and 15 patients were underestimated by the zzso zzso On zzso gross assessment, 162 patients had correct diagnoses, 8 patients were zzso and the remaining 21 patients were zzso The accuracy of the gross assessment was zzso the sensitivity was zzso and the specificity was zzso The zzso grading accuracy was zzso zzso A zzso between zzso and zzso grades was more frequent in a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was significantly higher in patients with a grade 3 zzso tumor than in those with a zzso or zzso tumor in both zzso 

The present study suggests that gross assessment may be useful to determine zzso of less than zzso although patients with a zzso tumor were more frequently zzso
