The zzso neurotransmitter system has been proposed to be involved in the processing of zzso zzso information provided by zzso cues in zzso zzso It has been shown that the behavioral and neural effects of a zzso zzso stimulation resemble the effects obtained by manipulating the zzso of the spatial zzso enhancing cortical nicotine levels and decreasing cue zzso both reduce the reaction time difference between zzso and zzso cued targets zzso the zzso zzso as well as neural activity related to zzso zzso in zzso brain zzso In the present study, we investigated whether the behavioral and neural effects of nicotine in zzso zzso are dependent upon different a zzso cue zzso zzso subjects were investigated in a zzso zzso zzso design with functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso was administered to zzso volunteers via zzso gums zzso 2 zzso before performing a zzso paradigm with valid and invalid cues in the context of 90 and zzso cue zzso in the MR zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso effect in the zzso but not in the zzso cue zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions showed stronger zzso reductions of zzso neural activity in the high than in the low cue zzso zzso Our data reveal an interaction effect between the pharmacological and cognitive zzso of zzso zzso which is evident at both a behavioral as well as the zzso zzso
