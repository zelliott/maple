Diseases of the spinal zzso are associated with zzso changes in cerebral zzso zzso Many studies in this area have examined spinal zzso conditions not associated with recovery, making it difficult to consider the value of these cortical events in the restoration of neurological zzso We studied patients with zzso a syndrome of transient spinal zzso zzso in order to probe cortical changes that might contribute to recovery after disease of the spinal zzso Seven patients, each of whom showed improvement in hand motor function after a diagnosis of zzso involving cervical spinal cord, were clinically evaluated then studied with functional zzso During right and left index finger zzso zzso volumes were assessed in three cortical motor regions within each zzso zzso were compared with findings in nine control zzso Compared to the control group, zzso patients had larger zzso volumes within zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso The degree of daily hand use showed a significant correlation with the volume of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Recovery from zzso is associated with an enlarged zzso volume in zzso motor zzso This change in motor zzso function is related to behavioral experience, and thus may contribute to motor zzso The expanded zzso in motor cortex, seen with several forms of spinal zzso insult may have zzso utility when zzso tract zzso are zzso
