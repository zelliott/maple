The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of zzso zzso zzso on MR imaging with zzso zzso zzso The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from each zzso zzso patients zzso age zzso years; age range zzso zzso with zzso zzso tears and 50 zzso shoulders of 32 controls zzso age 43 years; age range zzso zzso without rotator cuff tears were zzso The zzso and zzso angles were measured on zzso images, the zzso and zzso head version as well as the zzso distance on zzso zzso zzso differences were found between the patients and controls for both zzso version and zzso distance, which are considered to influence the distribution of forces placed on the cuff zzso zzso zzso The patients had a decreased zzso version by an average of zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a decreased zzso distance by an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were found between these groups for zzso head version and the zzso and zzso angles, which might contribute to zzso zzso by narrowing the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso version may be responsible for zzso tears by changing the orientation of the rotator cuff and thus increasing zzso zzso
