The diagnosis of cardiac zzso zzso is challenging zzso to vague zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

To describe regional patterns in zzso strain zzso using two-dimensional zzso zzso in CA and to test the hypothesis that regional differences would help differentiate CA from other causes of increased left zzso zzso wall zzso 

55 consecutive patients with CA were compared with 30 control patients with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso A relative zzso zzso of zzso defined using the equation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso was sensitive zzso and specific zzso in zzso CA from controls zzso under the curve zzso In a zzso zzso zzso analysis, relative zzso zzso was the only zzso zzso of CA zzso 

CA is zzso by regional variations in zzso from base to zzso A relative zzso zzso pattern of zzso is an easily zzso accurate and zzso method of zzso CA from other causes of zzso zzso
