zzso is a sensitive technique for assessing disease activity in zzso zzso white matter zzso can be identified on zzso images, and active disease is reflected by abnormalities in the zzso barrier zzso shown on zzso images after administration of zzso contrast zzso Active disease may be demonstrated by zzso zzso in patients with early, mild zzso zzso zzso even during periods of clinical stability, which indicates that zzso is an active process even during the early phase of the zzso To examine the amount of abnormal zzso at frequent intervals over time, we studied seven mildly affected zzso patients, all of whom had frequent zzso zzso These zzso patients were zzso monthly for 26 to 36 months at zzso zzso the area of abnormal increased zzso signal was calculated by zzso software that zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso All patients showed fluctuations over time in amount of abnormal zzso zzso which reflected factors such as the amount of zzso breakdown zzso by number or area of enhancing zzso and measurement zzso All seven zzso patients, however, showed an overall increase in abnormal zzso Because of the fluctuations between individual zzso the increase was most accurately reflected when the mean of the first 6 months' zzso was compared with the mean of the final 6 months' zzso or when a linear zzso model was zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
