Reliable separation of arteries from other stationary zzso is accomplished through spectral decomposition by exploiting the zzso nature of the blood flow in the zzso zzso transformation of a series of projection images in the zzso direction along the cardiac cycle results in spectral images where the arteries are a part of the harmonic component images while stationary zzso and veins are represented as a de component zzso From the magnitude of the spectral images an zzso can be obtained by zzso of the harmonic component images excluding the de component zzso This principle is applied to zzso imaging in a zzso mode data acquisition as well as line scan zzso Since there is no need for the zzso of the zzso zzso this technique is free from zzso current artifacts which have been one of the major obstacles to projection zzso using the zzso zzso
