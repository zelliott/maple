According to the reports described in the literature, zzso zzso zzso seems to represent one option for the primary treatment of cervical zzso In order to render such treatment transparent and comparable for those interested in the field, we have attempted to report our recent experience obtained in Vienna from zzso using the zzso proposed by the zzso report 38, focusing in particular on dose and volume reporting and a zzso zzso Based on these zzso a comparison with the preceding period in Vienna zzso has been made, with an attempt to correlate different methods and parameters with zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients zzso age 67 zzso were treated with zzso intent zzso zzso 2, zzso 11, zzso 11, zzso 79, zzso 19, zzso 59, zzso 5, zzso 3 zzso using a combination of zzso high-dose rate zzso zzso zzso zzso and a box technique for zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso Small tumors were treated with 5-6 zzso of 7 zzso at point A and 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso reference zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso at point zzso Large tumors received zzso zzso of 7 zzso after 50 zzso zzso with open fields, which is zzso to zzso zzso at point zzso zzso varied from mean zzso zzso (3 zzso to zzso zzso (6 zzso at one zzso 3-D treatment planning for zzso was based on conventional zzso and in zzso patients on zzso zzso zzso with the zzso in zzso zzso volumes of the zzso reference zzso (7 zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso 87 zzso the respective mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was 180 zzso The 60 zzso zzso volumes zzso zzso from zzso for the zzso of small tumors ranged from 240 to 407 zzso zzso 337 zzso and for larger tumors zzso zzso for zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso 607 zzso The mean dose for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso reference point and zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso Taking into account the dose for zzso the mean zzso dose at the zzso zzso reference point was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment time was six weeks for small tumors and eight weeks for large zzso 

After a mean follow-up of 34 months, zzso pelvic control and zzso survival rates at three years were zzso for all patients, zzso for stage zzso zzso stage zzso zzso stage zzso zzso stage zzso zzso stage zzso and zzso stage zzso According to the zzso score which had been zzso introduced, the zzso late complication rate for grades 3 and 4 was zzso for the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso in total for all grades zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In our experience, zzso zzso combined with zzso is an efficient method if sufficient radiation doses and volumes are applied, both with regard to tumor control and adverse side zzso In future, the therapeutic window will be increased by systematic integration of magnetic resonance imaging zzso into treatment planning, thus allowing for a highly individualized approach with further adaptation of radiation dose and volume both to the target and to the individual topography of zzso at zzso
