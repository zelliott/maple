The purpose of the current study was to describe the usefulness of spinal magnetic resonance imaging zzso in children with zzso or primitive zzso tumor zzso of the zzso zzso 

Children zzso diagnosed with zzso and followed in the Hospital for Sick zzso were zzso A zzso cohort of children treated with zzso zzso as part of their initial treatment was zzso zzso spinal zzso done zzso with zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso was defined as any new abnormal zzso (in the brain or in the zzso in symptomatic or zzso zzso zzso after the first recurrence were excluded in the final zzso The utility of a spinal zzso in the presence of a negative zzso zzso was zzso 

In all, 73 patients (21 females and 52 zzso median age, zzso years, median follow-up time, zzso zzso had at least 1 zzso zzso during the follow-up zzso Since zzso zzso and spinal zzso was introduced as the standard evaluation for zzso in 1991, zzso zzso were zzso Fourteen spinal zzso and 25 zzso zzso showed new zzso or zzso zzso In 2 patients, repeat zzso ruled out recurrence zzso All confirmed spinal zzso were associated with zzso zzso Of 261 zzso with negative zzso zzso no new zzso was identified on spinal zzso 

An absence of progression on zzso zzso is highly zzso of absence of progression on spinal zzso There is little evidence that surveillance spinal zzso (in children who underwent zzso radiation as part of their initial zzso improves the detection of zzso in children with zzso
