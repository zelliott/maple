After the resolution of contrast enhancement, the majority of new zzso zzso become zzso with surrounding white matter on zzso zzso Less commonly, a zzso zzso zzso develops, representing the development of more severe focal tissue zzso zzso beta zzso reduces both the number of new enhancing zzso and the duration of contrast zzso 

To determine if zzso affects the degree of tissue damage within new zzso and if its effects are related to zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with secondary progressive zzso from seven European sites were zzso to receive either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were acquired at zzso at months 1 to 6, and at months 19 to zzso The size of all new enhancing zzso developing between months 1 and 6 was recorded and their appearance at follow-up zzso 

In the first 6 months, fewer new enhancing zzso occurred in the zzso zzso This difference was greater for small zzso zzso than for large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were more likely to form from large zzso than from small zzso enhancing zzso in both treatment zzso Patients taking zzso developed fewer zzso zzso zzso however, the proportion of enhancing zzso developing into zzso zzso zzso was similar in both zzso 

zzso reduced the number of new enhancing zzso with a greater effect on small zzso However, when a new enhancing zzso did become established, treatment with zzso did not alter its subsequent zzso
