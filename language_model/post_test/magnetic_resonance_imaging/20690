zzso zzso detection in the visual environment has been known to be reflected by an zzso brain potential zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, however, we demonstrated that zzso zzso comprises two, temporally and zzso overlapping zzso zzso by using an experimental protocol consisting of oddball and zzso sequences zzso Kimura, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Visual mismatch zzso new evidence from the zzso zzso zzso 46 zzso zzso zzso visual zzso that reflects a zzso zzso zzso detection system and zzso visual mismatch zzso zzso that reflects a zzso zzso zzso detection zzso In the present paper, we further zzso the neural generators of the visual zzso and visual zzso with standardized zzso brain electromagnetic zzso zzso zzso showed that the visual zzso was involved in neural zzso of the primary and zzso visual areas, while the visual zzso was involved in neural zzso of the zzso visual areas and the prefrontal zzso These results suggest that the sensory and cognitive zzso detection systems zzso by distinct neural structures zzso our efficient zzso visual zzso zzso
