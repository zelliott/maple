To evaluate the long-term imaging and clinical outcomes of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso surgery zzso 

The study included 85 patients with zzso zzso undergoing zzso during the period zzso The locations of the zzso were the zzso in 42 patients, zzso in 31 patients, and zzso zzso in 12 zzso The volume of the zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso and the prescription dose ranged from zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso mean zzso zzso After the initial zzso zzso 18 patients had repeat zzso for zzso zzso that were still zzso Two patients had a third zzso 7 years and 16 years after a failed repeat zzso Clinical follow-up ranged from zzso months with a mean of 100 months zzso 102 zzso after the initial zzso 

zzso yielded a total zzso obliteration in 50 zzso patients and zzso obliteration in 4 zzso zzso In 22 zzso patients, the zzso remained zzso In 9 patients zzso no flow voids were observed on magnetic resonance imaging zzso but zzso confirmation was zzso A small zzso volume and a high prescription dose were significantly associated with increased zzso obliteration zzso zzso changes developed in 34 patients zzso 24 were zzso 1 patient had only headache, and 9 patients developed zzso zzso One patient developed a large zzso 6 years after zzso 

Given the poor surgical outcome of zzso zzso the results of 59% zzso obliteration and zzso permanent zzso deficits make zzso a reasonable management of these difficult zzso
