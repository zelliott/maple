Heavy zzso users display smaller zzso and zzso than controls, and genetic variation accounts for a large proportion of zzso in liability to zzso dependence zzso A single zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso has been associated with CD diagnosis and intermediate zzso including zzso withdrawal, zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso This study compared zzso and zzso volumes zzso CD intermediate zzso between heavy zzso users and healthy controls, and analyzed interactions between group, zzso variation, and the volumes of these zzso zzso heavy zzso users zzso of whom 37 zzso men, 23 zzso mean zzso were matched to 37 healthy controls zzso men, 23 zzso mean zzso for zzso zzso Controlling for total zzso volume and other zzso zzso matched zzso users had smaller bilateral zzso (left, zzso right, zzso and left zzso zzso than zzso When zzso was considered in the zzso zzso there was a group by zzso interaction, such that the zzso G zzso predicted lower volume of bilateral zzso among zzso users relative to controls (both zzso This interaction persisted when all 94 zzso users were compared to zzso There were no group by zzso interactions on zzso zzso These data replicate previous findings of reduced zzso and zzso volume among heavy zzso users, and suggest that zzso zzso variation may zzso smaller zzso volume after heavy zzso zzso This association should be tested in future studies of brain volume differences in zzso
