zzso smoothing is an important zzso procedure that is used to increase the zzso ratio zzso of blood zzso zzso signals zzso in common functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso However, recent studies have shown that smoothing artificially shifts zzso local zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we show shifting of the zzso of functional centers in hand motor areas of the cerebral zzso by three-dimensional zzso zzso kernel smoothing or two-dimensional heat kernel smoothing in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso maps derived from smoothed echo zzso imaging zzso data by zzso and zzso analyses were assigned to the zzso of individual cortical surface models, and local zzso in the primary motor area zzso and the primary zzso zzso zzso were compared with those derived from zzso risk map analysis, which is commonly used in zzso zzso For each analysis, the zzso and zzso distances between the correlation zzso of local zzso derived from smoothed and zzso zzso data were zzso The results show that the correlation zzso derived from the zzso and zzso analyses were about zzso and zzso higher for smoothed than for zzso risk map zzso and show minimum shifting of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso on average in zzso distance, respectively, and about zzso zzso and zzso zzso on average in zzso distance, zzso
