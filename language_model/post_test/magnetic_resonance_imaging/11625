zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso experiments at variable temperature and pressure have been used to zzso the solution dynamics of both M and m zzso of three zzso zzso The direct zzso zzso observation of the bound water signal allows the zzso rates on each zzso to be measured zzso They are definitely independent of the zzso for both M and m zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and proceed through a zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and + zzso zzso zzso for zzso The overall water exchange only depends on the zzso zzso zzso The m zzso which exchanges more quickly, is zzso by zzso of the ring zzso Therefore the synthesis of zzso zzso which predominantly form complexes in the m form, should be a sufficient condition to ensure faster water exchange on potential zzso contrast zzso zzso the zzso parameters for the zzso and zzso processes are both compatible with a zzso complex as zzso
