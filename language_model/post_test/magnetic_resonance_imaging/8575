We present a non zzso zzso zzso method to characterize the zzso Response zzso as function of zzso This is done by extending and adapting the zzso zzso zzso method proposed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prior for a zzso approach to zzso zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso time series analysis, zzso zzso zzso 735 zzso zzso We choose an initial zzso model and apply the zzso method to assign a zzso probability of activity for every zzso This can be used to construct the map of zzso But it can also be used to construct the zzso averaged time series activity for different zzso This permits defining a new model which is only zzso Now in turn it can be used as the model behind a new application of the zzso method to obtain another zzso probability of zzso The method zzso in just a few zzso and is quite independent of the original zzso model, as long as it contains some information of the zzso state of the zzso We apply this method of zzso zzso both to simulated and real data of blocks and zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso are used to measure the number of errors with respect to a few zzso We also study the deterioration of the results for real data, under information zzso This is done by decreasing the signal to noise ratio and also by decreasing the number of images available for analysis and compare the zzso to other zzso
