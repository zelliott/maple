zzso feedback plays an important role in natural speech zzso We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiment using a transformed auditory feedback zzso method to delineate the neural mechanism for auditory feedback control of zzso Twelve right-handed subjects were required to zzso zzso for 5 zzso while hearing their own voice through zzso In the zzso condition, the pitch of the feedback voice was randomly shifted either up or down from the original pitch two or three times in each zzso The subjects were required to hold the pitch of the feedback voice constant by changing the pitch of original zzso In zzso condition, the pitch of the feedback voice was not modulated and the subjects just zzso zzso zzso The contrast between zzso and zzso conditions revealed significant zzso the zzso zzso the prefrontal area, the anterior zzso the superior zzso area and the zzso zzso in the right hemisphere, but only the zzso area in the left zzso This result suggests that auditory feedback control of pitch is mainly supported by the right zzso zzso
