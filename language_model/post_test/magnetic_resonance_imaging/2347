A three-dimensional brain imaging protocol with PET and zzso was used to zzso the cortical structure in relation to brain function and zzso zzso to determine tumor zzso 

Sixteen patients with zzso had a PET scan with zzso to zzso tumor zzso The PET images were zzso to the patients' own zzso reconstructed to the three-dimensional brain surface images to indicate the zzso structure and the extent of tumor zzso Thirteen patients, who bore tumors adjacent to the language or motor cortex, had zzso zzso zzso study to locate the eloquent zzso The area of tumor zzso was superimposed on the brain surface images together with the language and/or motor zzso 

When a tumor was located within a single zzso without influencing surface cortical zzso pattern, the motor and language areas were identified zzso by three-dimensional surface image zzso However, when the tumor caused swelling and deformation of cortical structure, functional mapping with zzso zzso technique was essential in locating them zzso In such cases, the combined mapping of the facial motor area with oral movement and the language area with word repetition was the most useful method to identify the zzso structure in the dominant zzso Total or near total zzso of zzso zzso in eight patients and the effective zzso of the active part of the zzso zzso in four patients was completed without causing functional neurological zzso 

The three-dimensional expression of cortical structure and function combined with PET zzso imaging with zzso is useful for radical zzso of cerebral zzso
