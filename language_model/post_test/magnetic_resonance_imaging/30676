In an effort to simulate the compromised function and zzso of lower limb muscles experienced by astronauts after zzso 21 men and women age zzso zzso were subjected to unilateral lower limb unloading for 5 zzso Whereas 10 of these subjects performed unilateral knee zzso resistance exercise zzso two or three times weekly, 11 subjects zzso refrained from zzso The exercise regimen consisted of four sets of seven zzso actions, using an apparatus that offers concentric and eccentric resistance by utilizing the inertia of rotating zzso zzso zzso muscle strength was measured before and after zzso and zzso and knee zzso and ankle zzso zzso muscle volumes were determined by means of magnetic resonance zzso Surface zzso activity measured after zzso zzso increased muscle use to perform a given motor zzso zzso induced an zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso in knee zzso muscle zzso After zzso and as a result of only approximately 16 zzso of zzso zzso activity over the zzso course, muscle volume increased zzso zzso zzso zzso Muscle strength decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso Group zzso showed maintained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle volume of the unloaded limb decreased zzso zzso zzso in both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso In neither group did the right zzso limb show any change zzso zzso zzso in muscle volume or zzso The results of this study provide evidence that resistance exercise not only may offset muscle zzso but is in fact capable of promoting marked zzso of chronically unloaded zzso
