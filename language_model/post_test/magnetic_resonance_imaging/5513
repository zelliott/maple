Our group, along with others, has previously reported associations between zzso syndrome and a number of genetic disorders, including Down syndrome, zzso zzso zzso cell disease, and zzso type zzso Here we present the first reported case of a patient with the zzso diagnosis of zzso and zzso syndrome - a rare genetic disorder characterized by zzso faces, zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso The clinical, zzso and surgical findings are zzso as well as the importance of this zzso 

Case zzso 

A 13-year-old girl with zzso syndrome presented with multiple transient zzso attacks consisting of speech arrest and generalized zzso zzso revealed probable bilateral zzso zzso Initially, she was treated conservatively due to the rarity of her symptoms and relatively unremarkable zzso zzso However, she ultimately had progression of her disease both clinically and zzso leading to surgical zzso She underwent staged bilateral zzso zzso without complication and has done well zzso 

The potential difficulty of detecting symptoms related to cerebral zzso in the zzso population - where cognitive impairment may obscure initial zzso symptoms - can result in delayed diagnosis and zzso Given the excellent outcomes of zzso patients when treated prior to the development of fixed zzso deficits, case reports such as this and identifying zzso associations serve to highlight conditions that may result in improved patient outcomes through earlier diagnosis and zzso The clinical and zzso features of zzso syndrome associated with zzso syndrome seem comparable to those of primary zzso zzso The presence of zzso syndrome should be considered in the evaluation of patients with zzso syndrome who present with transient zzso zzso zzso
