Patients with extinction show a characteristic impairment in the identification of objects when two items are presented zzso typically reporting the zzso item zzso The effect is thought to be due to a spatial bias zzso the zzso item under conditions of competing concurrent zzso Action relations between objects can result in recovery from extinction as the object pair may be perceived as a single group rather than competing zzso zzso However, objects interacting together can also have implied zzso Here we test whether implied motion is necessary to generate recovery from zzso We varied zzso whether animate and inanimate objects were paired together in positions related or unrelated to zzso zzso motion was greater when an animate object was present than when both stimuli were zzso Despite this, recovery from extinction was greater when actions were shown between inanimate zzso We suggest that actions between inanimate objects are perceived more easily due to the surfaces of these stimuli being designed for functional goals zzso the flat surface of a hammer head is designed to hit the flattened head of a zzso Attention is sensitive to the fit between potential action and the functional properties of objects, and not just to implied motion between zzso
