The collateral ligaments of the knee are important in maintaining knee zzso However, little data has been reported on the in zzso function of the collateral zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the change in length of different fiber zzso of the zzso collateral ligament zzso deep fibers of the zzso zzso and the lateral collateral ligament zzso during in zzso knee zzso The knees of five healthy subjects were scanned using magnetic resonance zzso These images were used to create three-dimensional models of the zzso and zzso including the insertions of the collateral zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were each divided into three equal zzso an anterior zzso a middle bundle and a zzso zzso Next, the subjects were zzso from two zzso directions using zzso while performing a zzso zzso for 0 degree to 90 degrees of zzso The models and zzso images were then used to reproduce the in zzso motion of the zzso From these models, the length of each bundle of each ligament was measured as a function of zzso The length of the anterior bundle of the zzso did not change significantly with zzso The length of the zzso bundle of the zzso consistently decreased with zzso zzso less than zzso The changes in deformation of the zzso and zzso as a function of zzso were similar to each zzso The length of the anterior zzso increased with zzso and the length of the zzso zzso decreased with zzso These data indicate that the collateral ligaments do not zzso zzso as the knee is zzso with different zzso becoming taut and zzso These data may help to provide a better understanding of the in zzso function of the collateral ligaments and be used to improve surgical reconstruction of the collateral zzso Furthermore, the data suggest that the different roles of various portions of the collateral ligaments along the zzso path should be considered before releasing the collateral ligaments during knee zzso
