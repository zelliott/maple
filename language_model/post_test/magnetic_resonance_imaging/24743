zzso The authors investigated the effects of recently identified zzso significant schizophrenia genetic risk zzso on zzso and brain zzso zzso A panel of six zzso zzso zzso was selected to represent zzso significant zzso from three recent zzso association studies zzso for schizophrenia and was tested for association with cognitive measures in zzso patients with schizophrenia and zzso healthy comparison zzso zzso significant results were evaluated for replication in an independent zzso zzso For zzso showing evidence of association with zzso associations with brain structural volumes were investigated in a large independent healthy comparison zzso zzso Five of the six zzso showed no significant association with any cognitive zzso One marker in the major zzso complex zzso region, zzso showed independent, zzso evidence of association with delayed episodic memory and was significant when both samples were zzso In the combined sample of up to zzso individuals, this zzso was associated with widespread effects across cognitive zzso although these additional associations were no longer significant after adjusting for delayed episodic zzso In the large independent structural imaging sample, the same zzso was also associated with decreased zzso zzso zzso The authors identified a zzso in the zzso region that was associated with cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia and healthy comparison zzso This zzso zzso showed a zzso association with episodic memory and zzso zzso These findings zzso the zzso region in zzso structure and zzso consistent with the role of zzso proteins in synaptic development and zzso zzso of these results has the potential to provide insights into the zzso of schizophrenia and zzso
