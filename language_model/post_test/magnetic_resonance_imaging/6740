To demonstrate the feasibility of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso resolution zzso zzso for analyzing the zzso closure in comparison with zzso zzso 

Seven patients (three females and four zzso zzso years old, mean zzso zzso with suspected zzso zzso and one healthy volunteer were examined with zzso and real-time zzso using a zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso slice zzso zzso six images per zzso Imaging was done during zzso in all three image zzso The results were analyzed by two zzso in comparison with zzso as the standard of reference for overall image quality and the pattern of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso correctly depicted the pattern of zzso closure in correspondence to zzso in all zzso zzso the movement of the zzso walls, real-time zzso falsely depicted a general movement of the zzso zzso wall in one case, whereas zzso showed no zzso In one patient, real-time zzso provided additional information by showing an zzso movement of the lateral zzso walls that could not be depicted by zzso due to technical zzso zzso image quality, the zzso plane was more difficult to evaluate with real-time zzso compared to zzso The zzso plane was easier to analyze in real-time zzso compared to zzso 

zzso zzso has the potential to depict the pattern of zzso closure in close correlation with zzso and may deliver additional information in selected zzso
