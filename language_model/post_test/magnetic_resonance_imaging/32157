zzso zzso zzso projecting to the zzso zzso code for reward magnitude and probability during reward anticipation and then indicate the difference between actual and predicted zzso It has been questioned whether such a common system for the prediction and evaluation of reward exists in zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a guessing task in two large zzso we are able to confirm zzso zzso responses coding both reward probability and magnitude during zzso permitting the local zzso of expected value zzso However, the zzso zzso only represented the zzso part of zzso zzso At reward delivery, the same area shows a reward probability and zzso prediction error zzso best modeled as the difference between actual outcome and zzso In contrast, zzso expected value zzso and the associated prediction error was represented in the zzso Thus, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso process the value of a prediction and subsequently zzso a prediction error for gains and losses, zzso zzso a zzso balance of both systems might be important for generating adequate expectations under zzso zzso of either part might render expectations more positive or negative, which could contribute to the zzso of mood disorders like major zzso
