The purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso a zzso zzso technique for zzso blood flow in transplanted zzso and to determine if magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of zzso zzso could be used to differentiate between zzso kidney zzso and zzso with acute zzso necrosis zzso or acute zzso 

zzso subjects were enrolled within 4 months of receiving a kidney zzso A biopsy was performed on subjects to diagnose each zzso as having either zzso or acute zzso A group of subjects with normal functioning transplants was also enrolled in our zzso zzso zzso images were acquired on a zzso T zzso system within 48 hours after biopsy using an echo zzso zzso zzso and an injection of zzso contrast agent administered at a dose of zzso zzso zzso parameters were: repetition zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso zzso degrees , field of view zzso 340 zzso 340 zzso zzso zzso 128 zzso 64, slice thickness zzso 10 zzso and zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood flow values were zzso 

zzso blood flow values were significantly zzso zzso zzso lower in zzso undergoing acute rejection zzso zzso 41 zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso 96 zzso zzso and those with zzso zzso zzso 124 zzso zzso zzso blood flow values were also significantly zzso zzso zzso reduced in zzso with acute rejection zzso zzso 116 zzso zzso compared to those with normal function zzso zzso 116 zzso zzso 

zzso results indicate that zzso zzso techniques may provide a means of determining zzso the viability of zzso zzso potentially alleviating the need for biopsy in some zzso
