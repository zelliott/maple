zzso surgery is the most zzso therapeutic zzso for patients with medically zzso focal zzso but surgical failures remain a challenge to the zzso treatment zzso The aim of present study was to evaluate the zzso outcome of patients who underwent zzso after a failed zzso surgery on the zzso zzso 

We systematically analyzed the results of comprehensive zzso evaluations before the first surgery, and before and after zzso in 17 patients with drug resistant zzso lobe zzso 

Overall, 13 of 17 patients zzso improved after zzso five patients zzso were completely seizure free after zzso zzso duration zzso range zzso six patients zzso were seizure free at least zzso before observation points zzso duration zzso range zzso and two patients zzso had a decrease in seizure zzso Four patients zzso remained unchanged with respect to seizure frequency and zzso There was no correlation between the improvement in seizure outcome after zzso and other clinical data except of the history of traumatic brain injury zzso The patients who had no history of zzso improved after zzso compared to patients with zzso zzso The zzso seizure outcome of patients with zzso zzso results before the first surgery zzso and before zzso zzso was not poorer compared to patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can considerably improve the operative outcome of the first failed zzso surgery in patients with drug resistant zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso should be encouraged to report the results of failed zzso zzso
