The zzso of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors zzso is zzso but only a subset of these zzso tumors will progress to zzso disease, which is associated with a poor zzso Currently, there are limited data on the natural history of these tumors and it is difficult to determine which patients require surgical intervention because the risk of zzso disease cannot be accurately zzso 

We conducted a prospective study of 87 patients with von zzso zzso zzso solid pancreatic zzso to determine the natural history of these tumors with zzso testing, follow-up zzso and functional imaging, and advanced imaging analysis, with a median follow-up of 4 zzso 

zzso zzso of consecutive tumor zzso during follow-up were decreased in size and zzso showed no zzso This included 2 of 4 surgically proven zzso tumors, which had a net decrease in tumor size over zzso zzso volume, as derived from greatest diameter and zzso zzso showed good correlation to pathology tumor measurement of surgically zzso tumors zzso rank correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso density measurement had an inverse relationship with tumor size zzso rank correlation zzso p zzso zzso A tumor density zzso of 200 was zzso specific for zzso zzso 

zzso neuroendocrine tumors demonstrate a zzso growth pattern, which includes periods of no growth and apparent decrease in size by zzso These growth patterns are variable and are not associated with tumor grade and zzso zzso density, as measured in this zzso may offer a specific diagnostic tool for zzso zzso
