zzso zzso have been shown to be powerful zzso relaxation enhancers and are under consideration as an MR contrast agent for the detection of liver and zzso zzso This work describes the magnetic properties of a commercially available magnetic particulate and a zzso Carlo simulation of the effect of these particles on the zzso relaxation rates of water zzso for zzso zzso From the zzso empirical relations were developed to describe the dependence of the enhancement of particle size, and concentration as well as the diffusion constant of water and the pulse spacing of a zzso pulse sequence used to measure the zzso relaxation zzso The simulations are shown to agree with zzso of relaxation rates in zzso samples containing the magnetic zzso
