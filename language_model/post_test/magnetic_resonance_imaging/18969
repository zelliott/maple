To determine an optimal zzso transfer zzso technique for diagnosis of zzso in the head and zzso 

zzso zzso transfer ratios zzso and zzso zzso were zzso measured in 52 head and neck zzso of 52 patients at frequency zzso of zzso zzso and 1 zzso from water zzso The diagnostic capability for each zzso pulse was calculated by using receiver operating characteristic zzso curves, and an optimal zzso technique was determined for diagnosis of zzso 

The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso tumors were statistically significantly greater than those in benign zzso at both zzso and zzso zzso zzso but no significant differences were noted between them at the zzso zzso zzso Diagnosis with the zzso zzso was better than that with the zzso zzso at each zzso zzso Among all zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso pulse showed the highest diagnostic capability for zzso zzso under the zzso curve zzso zzso With a zzso zzso at a zzso zzso pulse of zzso or greater, the highest accuracy of zzso was attained with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso at a zzso zzso pulse were optimal for diagnosis of zzso in the head and zzso
