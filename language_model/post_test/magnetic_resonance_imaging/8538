To investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of right heart failure and pulmonary pressure in patients with zzso zzso defects zzso before and after zzso zzso zzso 

We performed correlation analysis for zzso and right zzso zzso pressure zzso as well as right zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso zzso determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso before and up to one year following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were correlated with right zzso zzso and RV zzso pressure zzso zzso size and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso zzso which decreased significantly during zzso Initially, zzso levels were zzso zzso After closure, a reduction to zzso zzso was obvious zzso zzso zzso showed enlarged RV volumes in all zzso At six and twelve months follow-up a significant reduction of zzso and zzso was zzso A positive correlation was noted between RV volumes and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure, zzso zzso and zzso shunt significantly correlated to zzso zzso No correlation was seen between zzso size and zzso 

zzso zzso to right zzso zzso pulmonary pressure and zzso shunt in volume load of the right heart caused by an underlying zzso
