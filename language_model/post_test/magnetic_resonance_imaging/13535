This study attempted to assess the feasibility and the accuracy of lung contrast enhanced magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging in the evaluation of 20 healthy volunteers and to correlate the zzso zzso zzso with the pulmonary zzso zzso 

After an informed consensus, zzso zzso subjects, without any present or past pulmonary zzso were studied by means of an zzso zzso echo sequence after a zzso intravenous zzso The acquisitions were performed in zzso and zzso planes, in zzso and prone position, in breath zzso An zzso acquisition was performed in only five cases immediately after 2-3 minutes of physical zzso 

All the zzso reviewed according to a visual score by three independent observers, resulted fairly zzso The zzso curves, obtained in zzso zzso have the same trend in all cases and are correlated to the lung zzso criteria: the position changes of the examined subjects confirm the gravity dependence of zzso the study performed immediately after physical exercise showed a reduction of zzso in the whole lung due to a zzso massive shift of blood mass from visceral to muscular zzso 

The extremely short acquisition and zzso time coupled with a simple zzso the ability to detect zzso zzso changes, the minimal zzso indicate a potential clinical use of MR in the pulmonary zzso defects zzso
