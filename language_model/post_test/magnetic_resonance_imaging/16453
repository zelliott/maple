While evaluating zzso results in patients with primary and secondary zzso nerve sheath zzso zzso treated between 1993 and 2002, a large amount of data about early signs and symptoms has been collected which might be helpful for establishing an early zzso 

We have reviewed the charts of the patients available at the Centre of zzso collecting especially zzso zzso 

112 patients, 4 with bilateral zzso 83 % female were zzso Mean age was zzso zzso Visual acuity loss with relative zzso zzso zzso was the main symptom and sign in primary zzso zzso zzso Median zzso between first symptoms and diagnosis was 12 zzso zzso discs were in approximately one half zzso the other half were zzso and only rarely normal (3 cases zzso zzso shunt vessels were seen in 10 zzso Nerve zzso bundle defects were the major visual field finding (including zzso and central zzso Visual acuity was better than zzso (20 zzso 40) in 46 % and worse than zzso (20 zzso zzso in 30 zzso In secondary zzso the zzso to diagnosis was with a median of 6 months shorter than in primary zzso zzso half of the zzso discs were zzso only 6 % were zzso Even here nerve zzso bundle defects were zzso only 7 % had vertical zzso zzso Visual acuity was better than zzso (20 zzso 40) in 30 % and in worse than zzso (20 zzso zzso 22 zzso 45 % had zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso defects were surprisingly zzso The high rate of nerve zzso bundle defects and the relatively high number of patients with good visual acuity might explain why this disorder is occasionally mistaken for zzso A typical clinical appearance can be zzso mainly zzso women, slowly progressing visual loss, frequently zzso disorders, relative zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso bundle defects and zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso disc form the characteristic zzso
