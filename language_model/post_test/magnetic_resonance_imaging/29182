In this study we use zzso data from living zzso zzso subjects to test the following three zzso zzso that the human zzso is significantly larger than expected for a zzso of our brain size, zzso that the human prefrontal zzso is significantly more convoluted than expected for our brain size, and zzso that increases in cerebral white matter volume zzso increases in zzso gray matter volume among zzso zzso Whole brain zzso scans were obtained from 44 living zzso subjects from 11 different zzso Image analysis software was used to calculate total brain volume, zzso gray matter volume, cerebral white matter volume, and the cross zzso area of the spinal zzso in each zzso zzso zzso analyses were used to compare the relative size of these brain structures across species, with an emphasis on determining whether human brain proportions zzso with predictions based on nonhuman zzso zzso zzso All three hypotheses were supported by our zzso The results of this study provide additional insights into human brain evolution beyond the important observation that brain volume approximately tripled in the zzso lineage by demonstrating that the zzso was uniquely modified throughout zzso zzso These modifications may constitute part of the zzso zzso that supports some of our species most distinctive cognitive zzso
