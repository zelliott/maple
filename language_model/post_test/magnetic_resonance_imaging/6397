From a sequence of zzso CT pictures of the hip joint the zzso relevant contours are extracted on a graphic monitor by means of an zzso zzso To do this an image zzso is necessary to improve the quality of the CT zzso These zzso data permit a mathematical surface model of the hip joint to be derived using well-known methods of simulating an zzso zzso reconstruction of the cartilage surface by zzso will be possible in the zzso It will then be possible to plan zzso zzso with high zzso
