The aim of this study was to address, in normal knees, the zzso of zzso offset of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the presence of any correlation between the two that might be needed to achieve an adequate joint motion in zzso zzso resonance images of normal knees of 80 subjects, 45 males and 35 zzso with a mean age of zzso years, were zzso zzso were performed by two independent observers using an imaging zzso zzso The zzso slope averaged 8 and zzso zzso on the zzso and lateral sides, respectively zzso zzso zzso the mean zzso offset of zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso on the two sides, respectively zzso zzso zzso The variation zzso of the zzso offset and zzso slope was zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso a significant correlation was found between the zzso zzso offset and the zzso zzso while the same was not observed in the lateral compartment of the zzso zzso resonance imaging allows the assessment of zzso slope and zzso zzso offset in the zzso and lateral side zzso taking into account any difference between the two zzso The zzso zzso slope exhibits a greater zzso compared with the zzso offset of zzso zzso The correlation found, in the zzso zzso between the zzso slope and zzso zzso offset suggests that the zzso of the proper zzso of the zzso part of the knee joint may be necessary to obtain a full range of motion in zzso after total knee zzso
