One of the main limitations of zzso feature selection is that it focuses on zzso the target zzso for each sample individually without considering relations with other zzso However, it's believed that the geometrical relation among target zzso in the training set may provide useful information, and it would be natural to expect that the predicted zzso have similar geometric relations as the target zzso To overcome these limitations, we formulate this as a zzso feature selection problem between a predicted graph and a target zzso In the predicted graph a zzso is represented by predicted zzso that may describe regional gray matter volume or cortical thickness features, and in the target graph a zzso is represented by target zzso that include class label and clinical zzso In particular, we devise new zzso terms in sparse representation to impose zzso graph matching between the target zzso and the predicted zzso Finally, the selected regional gray matter volume and cortical thickness features are fused in kernel space for zzso Using the zzso zzso we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and obtain the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
