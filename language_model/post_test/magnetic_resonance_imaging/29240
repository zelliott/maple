zzso zzso zzso was used to study zzso sensitivity to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with increased zzso activity were seen in areas whose normal zzso input from the zzso zzso zzso zzso had been zzso by zzso Sites of increased activity following zzso included the lateral zzso the zzso region of the zzso head, zzso areas, and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Increased activity was also observed in the same areas in the zzso hemisphere, but was less pronounced in spatial extent and zzso suggesting either zzso zzso damage and/or functional adaptations in the zzso zzso zzso The increases in zzso activity following zzso treatment were temporally correlated with increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced behavioral responsiveness to zzso and abolished the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso can detect changes in zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso
