To determine the accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso MR imaging zzso or volume modeling in distinguishing tumor progression from radiation injury following zzso for brain zzso 

Twenty-six patients with 33 zzso zzso zzso who underwent MRS zzso with or without zzso zzso after zzso zzso were zzso zzso The final diagnosis was based on zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso follow-up with clinical correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso normal brain zzso ratios were zzso calculated for the zzso zzso Relative cerebral blood volume zzso relative peak height zzso and percentage of zzso recovery zzso were also zzso derived for the zzso zzso volumes were determined using manual zzso method and analyzed using different volume progression zzso Different ratios or models were tested and plotted on the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso with their performances zzso as area under the zzso curve zzso zzso follow-up time was calculated from the date of initial zzso until the last zzso or the last zzso before surgical zzso 

Median zzso follow-up was 16 months zzso zzso Thirty percent of zzso zzso were determined to be radiation zzso zzso zzso were determined to be tumor zzso For the zzso zzso had the best performance zzso of zzso and zzso zzso had zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity in predicting tumor zzso For the zzso zzso had the best performance zzso of zzso and zzso zzso had zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso The best volume model was percent increase zzso of zzso zzso tumor volume increase had zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and percent increase of zzso volume modeling provide the best discrimination of zzso zzso tumor progression from radiation injury for their respective zzso zzso and zzso appear to have high zzso but low zzso In contrast, percent volume increase of zzso can be a highly sensitive and moderately specific predictor for tumor progression after zzso Future incorporation of zzso volume increase as a zzso selection criterion may compensate for the low sensitivities of MRS and zzso
