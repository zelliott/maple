In this work, we evaluated three zzso zzso zzso and compared their performance to partial volume zzso correction based on structural imaging in brain zzso zzso zzso zzso using a database of zzso zzso zzso We limited our interest to quantitative zzso PET imaging, particularly to zzso and zzso zzso The studied zzso methods included zzso zzso Van zzso and zzso Van zzso with the total variation zzso We studied the bias and zzso of the regional estimates of binding potential zzso values and the accuracy of regional zzso as a function of the applied image zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso images was addressed as zzso The regional zzso values and zzso obtained by zzso were almost as accurate than those by structural zzso zzso correction zzso zzso when the ideal volumes of interests zzso were used to extract zzso from the zzso For zzso methods, the ideal zzso were slightly eroded from the exact anatomical zzso to limit the bias due to tissue fraction effect which is not corrected for by zzso zzso For the zzso method, the ideal zzso were the exact anatomical zzso The zzso values and zzso by zzso were less affected by zzso and registration errors than those with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso estimates and zzso with zzso zzso correction were more accurate than zzso and zzso derived without zzso zzso The zzso images obtained by the zzso zzso correction showed considerably improved resolution with only slightly increased noise level compared to the case with no zzso zzso The zzso Van zzso method was the best of the studied zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso is an interesting alternative to structural zzso zzso correction as it leads to zzso results of similar zzso and it is less prone to registration and zzso errors than structural zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso images can be readily zzso based on zzso dynamic zzso
