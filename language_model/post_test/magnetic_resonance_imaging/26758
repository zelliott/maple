The purpose of our study was to use magnetic resonance zzso imaging and MR zzso to demonstrate the anatomy of the lateral ankle ligaments using standard and zzso imaging planes in zzso 

MR imaging of ten zzso zzso was performed before and after zzso administration of contrast zzso zzso MR images were acquired in standard and zzso imaging zzso MR imaging was correlated with zzso zzso zzso using zzso imaging planes were obtained to characterize the zzso of the lateral zzso 

The anterior zzso ligament zzso had a variable number of bands in all zzso separated by fat signal oriented obliquely parallel to the long axis of the zzso The zzso attachment of zzso was located in close proximity to the zzso attachment of the zzso band of the anterior zzso ligament zzso The angle formed by the zzso ligament zzso and the zzso zzso varied with different ankle zzso Special zzso zzso plane best demonstrated the zzso The zzso zzso ligament zzso was zzso in zzso zzso of the ankle joint helped zzso the zzso and best depicted this ligament in its entirety in the zzso zzso 

Oblique imaging planes parallel to the long axis of the individual ligaments may improve zzso of the anatomy of the lateral ankle zzso The orientation of the lateral ankle ligaments is affected by the position of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the lateral ankle ligaments can help zzso diagnose abnormalities of these zzso
