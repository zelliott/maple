To correlate the zzso and MR imaging characteristics of the area of intersection of the first and the second zzso zzso zzso compartments zzso in the zzso zzso in an attempt to improve the design of MR imaging protocols used for the evaluation of intersection zzso 

Ten zzso of nine zzso underwent MR imaging in the zzso and zzso planes before and after zzso with direct injection of a zzso contrast agent into the first zzso in four zzso the second zzso in four zzso and both compartments in the remaining two zzso The area of intersection between the first and second zzso was identified in each case as well as its distance from zzso zzso zzso all zzso were zzso in the zzso (8 zzso or zzso planes (2 remaining zzso to parallel the imaging zzso zzso examination of each of the zzso slices was performed in a search for zzso variations and for possible zzso connections of the zzso zzso One zzso was dissected to identify the area of zzso 

The area of intersection between the first and second zzso occurred between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso After zzso zzso solution was noted in the third zzso in two of four specimens in which the second zzso was injected and in one of two specimens in which both the first and second zzso were zzso Extension of the zzso solution between the first and second zzso was noted during isolated injections of either zzso although this finding may have related to zzso injection zzso The zzso plane was the most valuable for assessment of the area of intersection of the first and second zzso 

MR imaging is a zzso method that can be used for the evaluation of zzso zzso and wrist zzso Standard wrist protocols do not include the area of intersection between the first and second zzso and, in those cases in which intersection syndrome is suspected, the MR examination must be tailored to include the zzso
