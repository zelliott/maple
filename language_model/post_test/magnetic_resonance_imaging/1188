Thirty male zzso rats were divided into two groups and trained to zzso either saline zzso zzso zzso or heroin zzso zzso per injection, zzso zzso zzso for zzso days until a stable zzso zzso behavior was zzso After zzso days of withdrawal, each group was divided into two zzso for zzso tests and functional magnetic resonance image zzso zzso respectively, to determine the neural zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso For zzso testing, zzso rats zzso zzso 10) displayed robust zzso of zzso behavior triggered by an acute heroin zzso injection, whereas saline control rats zzso zzso 8) did not show such a behavioral zzso Regional positive or negative blood oxygen zzso zzso signals, induced by heroin zzso injection, were observed in both groups of rats during zzso zzso However, such zzso positive zzso signal primarily in the prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso was significantly attenuated in zzso rats zzso zzso 6) when compared to saline control rats zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso negative zzso signal in the zzso regions, such as in the nucleus zzso and zzso was also significantly attenuated in both signal intensity and number of brain zzso activated in zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso behavior zzso with a zzso enduring reduction in zzso brain activity in zzso rats, suggesting a possible role of zzso tolerance in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
