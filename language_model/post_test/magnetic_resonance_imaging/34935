This study linked 2 experimental zzso for the zzso study of reading that zzso have been used zzso zzso on a zzso decision task designed to isolate zzso effects in the identification of printed words were examined in young zzso The results were related to previously obtained measures of brain zzso patterns for these participants derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso measures were taken as the participants performed tasks that were designed to isolate zzso zzso and zzso processes in zzso Individual differences in the magnitude of zzso effects in word recognition, as indicated by zzso zzso effects on zzso decision zzso and by sensitivity to stimulus length effects, were strongly related to differences in the degree of zzso zzso in 2 cortical zzso
