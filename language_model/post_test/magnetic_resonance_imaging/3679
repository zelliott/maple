The risk of pancreatic cancer is increased in patients with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer or a zzso zzso zzso zzso can detect zzso zzso pancreatic zzso but the optimal imaging approach is not zzso We determined the baseline prevalence and characteristics of pancreatic abnormalities using 3 imaging tests to screen zzso high-risk individuals zzso 

We screened 225 zzso adult zzso at 5 academic US medical centers once, using zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso We compared results in a zzso independent zzso 

zzso of 216 zzso zzso were found to have at least 1 pancreatic mass zzso zzso 3 zzso or a zzso pancreatic duct zzso zzso 5) by any of the imaging zzso Fifty-one of the 84 zzso with a zzso zzso had multiple zzso typically small zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso in multiple zzso The prevalence of pancreatic zzso increased with zzso they were detected in zzso of subjects younger than 50 years old, zzso of subjects zzso years old, and zzso of subjects zzso years old zzso zzso zzso CT, zzso and zzso detected a pancreatic zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Among these zzso proven or suspected zzso were identified in 85 zzso (82 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 pancreatic zzso zzso Three of 5 zzso who underwent pancreatic zzso had high-grade zzso in less than 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in multiple zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso frequently detects small pancreatic zzso including zzso zzso high-grade zzso zzso and zzso detect pancreatic zzso better than zzso
