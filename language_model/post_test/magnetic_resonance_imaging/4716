The zzso zzso zzso is thought to contribute to the secondary injury process following spinal zzso trauma although little is known about the zzso mechanisms zzso In the present study, we have used a combination of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso and zzso motor function tests to examine the effects of zzso zzso infusion on rat spinal zzso zzso of 100 zzso of zzso zzso caused pronounced zzso development as determined by zzso at 24 h after zzso zzso of 100 zzso of the zzso zzso fragment, which does not have any activity at zzso zzso also produced profound zzso whereas 100 zzso of the low potency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or artificial zzso zzso did not produce any zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced significant zzso motor deficits at 24 h when compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but the deficits in the zzso zzso group were significantly worse than in the zzso zzso treated animals zzso zzso zzso Similarly, mortality in the zzso zzso treated animals was significantly higher than in the other groups zzso zzso zzso zzso MRS demonstrated that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso treated animals also had a pronounced decline in high energy zzso in the spinal zzso 24 h after zzso We conclude that zzso contributes to spinal zzso cell death by causing zzso failure and zzso zzso
