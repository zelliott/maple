To determine whether a surveillance program including clinical breast examination zzso and three screening zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso high-resolution ultrasound zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso and whether it could improve detection of pathological zzso in young women at high risk of developing breast zzso 

Western Australian women aged 50 years or under at high risk of developing breast cancer were recruited to our zzso For a zzso period, they were offered breast zzso and zzso scans in addition to their annual zzso and zzso Our study was conducted between June 2002 and October zzso 

Number and type of zzso or zzso zzso recall rates after zzso comparative sensitivity of screening zzso 

Of 102 women approached, 72 agreed to zzso Fifteen zzso were zzso of which three were zzso a zzso zzso cancer in an zzso zzso zzso a borderline zzso (multiple zzso with zzso and a zzso All 15 zzso were visible on zzso and four were detected by zzso zzso Only one zzso was visible on all three imaging zzso Nothing significant was detected by zzso The recall rate after zzso scans fell from zzso zzso in the first year to zzso zzso in the second zzso 

Our study gave valuable experience in a team approach to screening zzso and showed that zzso can detect more zzso than zzso or zzso in women at high risk of developing breast zzso zzso zzso may not add value to zzso and zzso zzso and we suggest a single zzso zzso may be used in some zzso
