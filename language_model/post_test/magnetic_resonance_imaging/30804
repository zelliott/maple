We sought to determine the prevalence of joint diseases in patients with either of 2 forms of zzso pain (with and without limited mouth zzso and to verify the accuracy of zzso zzso clinical diagnoses through the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

On the basis of the results of a clinical examination carried out according to the Research zzso zzso for zzso Disorders zzso 61 patients were divided into 2 zzso The first group consisted of 36 patients who had zzso pain with limited mouth opening zzso whereas the other 25 patients were diagnosed with zzso pain without limited mouth zzso zzso was carried out on all zzso The clinical zzso diagnoses from zzso were compared with zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso often had joint diseases that were not detected by means of a clinical examination zzso The zzso statistic was used to compare zzso and clinical diagnoses, confirming poor agreement in patients with zzso zzso and acceptable agreement in patients with zzso pain without limited mouth opening zzso 

zzso zzso mobility is frequently associated with zzso joint diseases that were not identified during a clinical zzso zzso an adaptation of the zzso scheme used for the zzso may result in the improvement of the sensitivity of clinical zzso diagnoses, especially in patients with zzso
