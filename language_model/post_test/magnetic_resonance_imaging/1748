zzso is used to treat breast cancer and may reduce the risk of breast zzso However, there are conflicting reports as to whether tamoxifen use is associated with changes in brain metabolism and function or cognitive zzso zzso we assessed the effects of tamoxifen and zzso on the brain chemistry of elderly zzso 

We used zzso magnetic resonance zzso to measure the zzso of zzso compounds, zzso zzso total zzso zzso plus zzso and zzso compounds in the frontal white matter, zzso zzso and zzso of 76 elderly women of whom 16 had received tamoxifen therapy, 27 had received zzso as hormone replacement therapy zzso and 33 had received neither zzso zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso was performed to determine the statistical significance of differences in cerebral zzso zzso among subject groups and brain zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

Women in the tamoxifen and zzso groups had lower zzso of zzso in all areas than women in the control group zzso zzso overall group effect on zzso Compared with the control group, the tamoxifen group zzso zzso and the zzso group zzso zzso had lower zzso of zzso in their zzso zzso The zzso concentration in the zzso zzso was zzso correlated with the duration of tamoxifen treatment zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

The reduced zzso of zzso in the brains of women treated with tamoxifen and zzso compared with those of control women, suggest that tamoxifen has an effect similar to that of zzso These results, if confirmed, may alleviate concerns about the safety of using tamoxifen to reduce breast cancer risk in elderly zzso
