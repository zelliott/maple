The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of local zzso solution by magnetic resonance imaging zzso after combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso injection in relation to clinical zzso 

zzso clinical zzso 

Fifteen patients scheduled for cataract surgery, 5 patients in each zzso 

Five patients received combined zzso and zzso zzso 5 patients received zzso zzso injection, and 5 patients had zzso injection, all with a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso scans were performed before the injection and up to 35 minutes after the zzso 

Reliable zzso is achieved using a combined zzso and zzso block and a relatively great volume of local zzso solution, which spreads throughout the orbit, as evidenced by zzso After zzso zzso and zzso injection, the local zzso solution accumulates behind the zzso zzso injection gives good analgesia and slight zzso with a very small zzso zzso zzso injection and combined zzso and zzso block provide a similar degree of zzso which seems to be the result of the volume injected behind the zzso
