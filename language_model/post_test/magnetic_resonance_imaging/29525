To provide guidance on how to gather and evaluate evidence from the literature on the efficacy of imaging, using as an example the assessment of the role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnosis of zzso This method was adopted for evaluating evidence for the musculoskeletal section of the 5th edition of the Royal College of zzso zzso zzso 

A systematic review of the literature published between 1966 and July 2001 was carried zzso zzso articles described studies in patients with suspected zzso and who were diagnosed using zzso Search strategies were developed to identify relevant imaging zzso Studies included in the systematic review were selected using zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso accuracy and likelihood ratios for zzso reported in the studies were used to evaluate the value of the procedure in zzso Where the above were not reported, they were calculated by the zzso 

The average sensitivity of zzso in zzso was zzso zzso zzso the average specificity was zzso zzso zzso average accuracy was zzso zzso zzso and the average positive likelihood ratio was zzso zzso zzso Four studies evaluated the use of zzso in the diagnosis of zzso in the diabetic foot, two in zzso of the lower zzso while four each evaluated the use of zzso in zzso zzso in the diagnosis of any form of zzso zzso in spinal zzso patients and in zzso zzso 

zzso reviews of literature can be used to obtain evidence on the value of imaging zzso The quality of the studies included in the review should always be considered when selecting studies to limit zzso In our example, zzso appears sensitive, specific and accurate in the diagnosis of zzso at different zzso
