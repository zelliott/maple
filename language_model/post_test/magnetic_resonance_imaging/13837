A zzso retrospective analysis of cervical zzso 

To determine the effectiveness of the loss of resistance zzso technique in identifying the cervical zzso zzso To delineate the pattern of zzso contrast spread during cervical zzso steroid zzso 

Previous studies have shown that if performed without zzso the zzso technique can result in inaccurate needle placement in up to zzso of zzso zzso steroid zzso To date, no study has examined accuracy of zzso technique and pattern of zzso contrast spread in cervical zzso zzso 

zzso of 38 cervical zzso steroid injections in 31 patients were zzso The number of zzso attempts and pattern of contrast spread was zzso The effects of age, zzso zzso results, previous cervical zzso and the zzso level of training were correlated with zzso 

The authors found a zzso rate of false zzso during the first attempt to enter the zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast spread was found in 51% and zzso zzso spread was found in zzso of zzso The average number of cervical zzso levels covered with 2 zzso of contrast was zzso with significantly wider spread noted in those patients who had not undergone previous cervical zzso Other variables did not influence the accuracy of needle placement and pattern of zzso contrast zzso 

The loss of resistance technique may not be an adequate method for ensuring accurate needle placement in blindly performed cervical zzso zzso The use of zzso can improve the accuracy of needle placement and medication delivery to targeted areas of zzso
