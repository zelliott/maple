zzso were compared for the same human seizure between simultaneously measured zzso and zzso which were both zzso to zzso The zzso zzso localized a zzso in a sphere zzso zzso to the zzso sensor zzso with an error of zzso zzso A focal zzso seizure was induced in a patient with partial zzso by stimulation at a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a known location, which was zzso to the zzso and to the zzso sensor zzso The simultaneous zzso and zzso during the 30-second seizure was measured and analyzed using the single, moving zzso model, which is the zzso model used zzso The zzso zzso from simultaneous whole zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were then compared for the repetitive zzso at six different times during the zzso There were two main regions of zzso and zzso zzso The locations of these regions were confirmed by determining the location clusters of 8,000 zzso on zzso at consecutive time points during the zzso The mean distances between the zzso zzso location versus the zzso location of the zzso and versus the zzso location of the zzso were each about one zzso zzso The mean distance between the zzso locations of the zzso versus the zzso locations of the zzso was about 2 zzso These errors were compared to errors of zzso and zzso reported previously for zzso and for zzso evoked responses zzso in zzso Comparing the findings from the present study to those from prior studies, there appeared to be the expected zzso increase in mean zzso error progressing from the zzso to the zzso to the zzso
