The purpose of this study was to examine the diffusion patterns of new medical technologies in Korean zzso We also sought to identify critical factors leading to the decision to acquire capital-intensive medical zzso The rationale and timing of magnetic resonance imaging zzso acquisitions were zzso evaluated according to a zzso when, and zzso zzso 

We analyzed data pertaining to 232 hospitals with active medical residency zzso Of these, 185 hospitals owned or leased an zzso unit, and 47 had not acquired units as of June zzso Data were collected from the Ministry of Health and zzso Korean National zzso Office, and Korean Hospital Association databases, and variables were identified and classified as zzso zzso or reinforcing zzso 

The zzso diffusion rate curve was linear for two types of hospital but was zzso for zzso hospitals, which were early adopters of zzso zzso zzso for zzso adoption included the per capita number of regional physicians zzso total number of existing regional zzso units zzso percentage of the regional population over 65 years of age zzso private ownership of the hospital, presence of a zzso residency program, number of beds zzso and regional per capita zzso income zzso 

zzso of zzso technology is occurring rapidly across Korean zzso The factors affecting zzso adoption in Korea are similar to the factors documented in other countries, namely regional population over age 65, regional income per capita, large hospitals, and teaching zzso This study provides baseline information for predicting diffusion patterns of other new and/or expensive medical zzso
