The purpose of this study was to investigate patients with a clinical diagnosis of internal zzso to determine the diagnostic value of zzso high resolution zzso zzso when compared with magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso with a clinical diagnosis of internal zzso were investigated by zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso investigations were performed by experienced zzso The zzso were done with a real-time zzso zzso zzso The zzso interpretation errors were re-evaluated zzso by the same zzso knowing the zzso results by comparing these with the zzso and zzso zzso The prospective and retrospective diagnoses were also compared with each zzso 

zzso of the 132 zzso had a disc displacement proved by zzso in the zzso zzso At maximum mouth zzso 54 zzso had a disc zzso The prospective interpretations showed a sensitivity and specificity of zzso each, accounting for an accuracy of zzso At maximum mouth zzso zzso resulted in a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso The retrospective interpretations yielded a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso in the zzso zzso At maximum mouth zzso zzso showed a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso 

zzso is suitable for the detection of disc zzso in the zzso However, further studies may be warranted to reduce the proportion of zzso zzso thereby avoiding the application of unnecessary zzso
