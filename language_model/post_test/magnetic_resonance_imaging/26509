Too few patients are receiving zzso limb salvage procedures for zzso 

To determine how magnetic resonance zzso imaging can best predict the zzso extension of zzso 

Forty children underwent complete zzso zzso and dynamic zzso MR imaging zzso zzso MR images zzso and short zzso inversion recovery zzso of the zzso were read in three ways: zzso for suspicion of any zzso zzso or zzso zzso for suspicion of zzso excluding suspected zzso and zzso zzso the second method by using a scale to rate the likelihood of zzso zzso imaging was compared to zzso findings after chemotherapy and zzso The receiver operating characteristic zzso method was used to analyze the scaled ratings of zzso MR and zzso zzso 

At delayed zzso 20 of 40 children with zzso had confirmed zzso zzso however, 32 zzso were abnormal on STIR and 28 abnormal on zzso zzso suspected tumor from zzso increased the accuracy to an zzso zzso under the zzso zzso of zzso for both zzso and STIR zzso zzso zzso MR had better specificity and STIR better sensitivity at any given zzso zzso was slightly less accurate zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging most accurately detected zzso extension of zzso when readers distinguished suspected tumor from zzso or normal zzso
