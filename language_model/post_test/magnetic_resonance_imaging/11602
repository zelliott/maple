To determine whether the presence of a single zzso zzso of the zzso gene is associated with an increased rate of zzso volume loss or decline in zzso in healthy women in their sixth decade of zzso 

Nine zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 16 zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso healthy women underwent zzso testing and zzso at the time of entry into the study zzso and 2 years zzso zzso testing consisted of the zzso Free zzso verbal zzso tests, the zzso Figure zzso the zzso Memory zzso and the zzso Adult Intelligence zzso Block zzso zzso volume zzso were based on manual outlining of zzso slices aided by zzso zzso and three-dimensional views of high-resolution zzso zzso zzso the scans were obtained with a zzso scanner using a zzso three-dimensional zzso echo sequence with zzso zzso zzso angle, 24 zzso zzso degrees zzso 

The percent change in zzso volume per year was greater in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of any of the cognitive measures, and zzso volume loss was not correlated with changes in any of the zzso cognitive zzso 

The presence of a single zzso zzso is associated with an increased rate of zzso volume loss in healthy women in their sixth decade of life that is not related to any zzso memory zzso
