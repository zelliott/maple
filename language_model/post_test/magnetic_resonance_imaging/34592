zzso and zzso zzso were used to evaluate changes in brain water characteristics following zzso injury in zzso Images were collected within the first 2 h and at 24 h and 7 days following the traumatic event and then compared with zzso The ratios between the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of the traumatized zzso and normal brain zzso were significantly different from unity and were found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1-2 zzso 24 zzso and 1 week after the zzso zzso In severe zzso areas of zzso which were not apparent on the zzso images could be detected on the zzso images within 1-2 h after the zzso At 24 h following the traumatic event, large areas of zzso are observed in both types of zzso One week following the zzso the zzso of the traumatized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are much larger than those of normal brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and approach the value of free zzso At 7 days, the areas of zzso in the zzso images seem to underestimate the injured areas found by zzso At this time point a good correlation is obtained between the areas of zzso observed on the zzso images and the zzso areas obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso
