The aim of the study was to determine if patients with zzso zzso zzso both with and without zzso fibrosis, have altered zzso zzso as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso pulse wave zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso implies an zzso prognosis and has been established in a variety of zzso diseases and zzso zzso However, the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso has not been studied zzso 

The study was institutional review board approved and Health Insurance zzso and Accountability Act of 1996 zzso zzso zzso was performed in 100 zzso and 35 normal control zzso zzso was determined between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was acquired for identification of zzso zzso 

Mean age was zzso years in zzso and zzso years in control zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso in zzso was zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso patients compared with control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso was higher zzso increased zzso zzso in zzso patients with zzso zzso than in those without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Increased zzso zzso as indicated by increased zzso is evident in zzso patients, and is more pronounced in those with zzso zzso Further, zzso stiffening may adversely affect left zzso zzso In addition, increased zzso zzso zzso with zzso fibrosis, and may represent another potentially important zzso for risk zzso in zzso zzso further zzso
