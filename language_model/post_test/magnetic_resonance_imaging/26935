the clinical role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the outcome after zzso stabilizing surgery is poorly zzso The study hypothesis was that zzso cartilage zzso and zzso are associated with a poor long-term outcome after zzso stabilizing zzso 

the study cohort included zzso patients who underwent zzso stabilizing surgery by traditional zzso procedures and were evaluated a minimum of 10 years zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso was assessed by magnetic resonance zzso images and plain zzso obtained at zzso Median patient age at follow-up was 33 years zzso 

at the final zzso zzso zzso cartilage zzso were observed on MR images in 29 zzso zzso Only zzso of the patients reported satisfaction at zzso and dissatisfaction was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso cartilage loss on MR zzso P zzso zzso Especially high zzso zzso of zzso zzso facet cartilage zzso were found among the patients dissatisfied with the result zzso zzso zzso Eight zzso of the 37 patients reported zzso zzso instability episodes at zzso Median zzso score was 83 points zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a significant long-term risk of zzso surgery for zzso instability and has a greater impact on zzso outcome than residual instability more than 10 years after zzso
