We examined whether the degree of zzso stress in patients with chronic zzso cerebral vascular disease can be zzso evaluated with the use of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso patients with zzso disease zzso age, zzso years; range, 18 to zzso underwent zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso within a month's zzso The zzso data were calculated by three different zzso zzso The cerebral blood flow zzso ratio, cerebral blood volume zzso ratio, and mean transit time zzso of the anterior circulation were calculated using the zzso as a control region and compared with PET data on the same three parameters and oxygen extraction fraction zzso zzso maps of zzso attained a higher resolution than the PET maps and revealed focal zzso failure on a zzso zzso The relative zzso and zzso obtained with zzso showed significant linear correlations with the corresponding PET values zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso We also found that we could detect regions with zzso elevated zzso and zzso based on the delay of zzso zzso relative to the control region by defining a zzso delay as a zzso The sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso in detecting regions with zzso elevated zzso and zzso and zzso in detecting regions with zzso elevated zzso zzso Among the parameters obtained with zzso our results suggested that the relative zzso value and delay of zzso might be zzso manipulated to assist in clinical decision-making for patients with zzso zzso
