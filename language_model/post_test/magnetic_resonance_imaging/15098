The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of the zzso activity of zzso zzso induced zzso that are zzso coated with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso 

Human zzso were divided into control and zzso zzso The zzso were labeled with zzso and zzso zzso After labeling of zzso the mean signal intensity zzso of the zzso group was significantly lower than that of the control zzso 

The labeling of both control and zzso groups with zzso showed significantly lower zzso than those labeled with zzso After labeling with zzso the zzso iron zzso of zzso in zzso blue zzso was markedly demonstrated in the zzso group, but not in the control zzso zzso was more effective than zzso in the labeling of zzso in zzso 

The in zzso labeling technique of zzso zzso with zzso on MR imaging could be developed into a diagnostic method of zzso zzso
