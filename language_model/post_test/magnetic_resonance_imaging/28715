One hundred six patients who underwent high field strength magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent zzso of the knee were evaluated to determine the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in predicting zzso tear zzso Each scan was independently read by three examiners with varying degrees of zzso a musculoskeletal zzso a senior zzso surgeon, and a general zzso Each suspected tear was characterized by its zzso type, maximum zzso and minimum distance from the zzso zzso A prediction was then made of whether the tear was zzso There were 115 zzso tears noted in the 106 patients zzso The zzso ability to correctly estimate tear type was only fair, with correct estimates made only zzso to zzso of the zzso The overall correlation of the three examiners to correctly predict the method of treatment was zzso The average zzso sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value of magnetic resonance imaging in predicting zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for predicting zzso these values were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were no significant differences between the three examiners in the accuracy of their treatment zzso The results of this study suggest that magnetic resonance imaging is only moderately reliable for the prediction of zzso zzso In addition, the training of the reader does not appear to significantly influence the zzso
