Producing and maintaining distinct zzso neural representations for similar events is critical to avoiding interference in long-term zzso Recently, our laboratory provided the first evidence for zzso signals in the human zzso Here, we extended this by zzso varying the change in input zzso while monitoring zzso and zzso for separation and zzso signals using high-resolution zzso In the zzso activity varied in a graded fashion in response to increases in the change in zzso In contrast, the zzso showed a zzso transfer function that was highly sensitive to small changes in zzso
