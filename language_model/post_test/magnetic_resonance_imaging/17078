We evaluated the diagnostic performance of zzso zzso and zzso for the assessment of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso Since early treatment might prevent zzso zzso we also evaluated THE performance of early zzso zzso zzso in residual tumor zzso The study was zzso performed on 32 patients who underwent zzso zzso and zzso before treatment and at 4 and 12 months after zzso zzso zzso was also performed 2 weeks after the end of zzso zzso or a minimum of 18 months follow-up were used as gold zzso Before treatment zzso zzso and zzso detected all primary tumors except for two limited vocal fold zzso zzso zzso zzso was more sensitive than zzso zzso for the detection of local extension sites zzso 75 vs zzso but at the cost of a higher rate of false positive results zzso zzso value 74 vs zzso For zzso detection at 4 months, sensitivity was significantly higher for zzso zzso zzso than for zzso zzso but the diagnostic performances were not significantly different at 12 zzso For the detection of residual zzso tissue 2 weeks zzso sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso were respectively 86 and zzso zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso is effective in the differentiation between residual tumor and zzso changes, as early as 2 weeks after treatment of a primary zzso For zzso performance of zzso zzso and zzso are similar except for a higher sensitivity of zzso zzso at 4 zzso
