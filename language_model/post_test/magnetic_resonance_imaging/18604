This review paper focuses on studies in healthy human subjects that examined the functional zzso and cerebral plasticity associated with the learning, consolidation and retention zzso of motor skilled behaviors using modern brain imaging zzso Evidence in support of a recent model proposed by zzso and zzso zzso Anatomy of Motor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso New York: Guilford Press, zzso is also zzso The latter suggests that zzso changes in the brain depend not only on the stage of learning, but also on whether subjects are required to learn a new sequence of movements zzso sequence zzso or learn to adapt to environmental zzso zzso zzso This model proposes that the zzso and zzso systems contribute zzso to motor sequence learning and motor adaptation, respectively, and that this is most apparent during the slow learning phase zzso zzso when subjects achieve zzso performance, as well as during zzso of the new skilled behavior in the retention zzso
