In this comment on a recent paper by zzso et zzso (1999) I argue that the authors failed to consider important empirical facts that are at zzso with their favored theory of the causes of semantic zzso zzso I also argue that the predictions they make about zzso zzso zzso on the basis of the interactive zzso hypothesis of semantic organization do not obviously follow from that zzso I point out that simulations are needed in order to derive predictions from the zzso Finally, I argue that the zzso results they obtained are not obviously relevant to our understanding of the causes of semantic zzso zzso
