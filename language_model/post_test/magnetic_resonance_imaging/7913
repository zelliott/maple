zzso zzso may be superior to other zzso in zzso for localized zzso prostate cancer because of its relatively short zzso higher initial dose rate, and greater dose zzso within the target zzso these properties also underscore the need for accurate target zzso and zzso quality zzso We assessed the use of prostate sector analysis based on zzso for quality assurance after zzso zzso 

Fifty men with zzso prostate cancer underwent zzso zzso in a prospective phase II trial at MD Anderson Cancer zzso zzso analyses on day 30 after the implant were done using both CT and fused zzso zzso zzso variables were assessed for the entire prostate and for each of three or six zzso Volumes and zzso variables were compared with paired zzso zzso 

zzso zzso variables for the entire prostate were significantly different on CT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and p zzso zzso for zzso zzso volumes were smaller on the zzso scans zzso zzso zzso The base sector contributed the greatest difference, with doses based on zzso lower than those based on CT zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso To date, these lower base doses have not affected zzso outcomes for patients with disease in prostate base biopsy zzso 

zzso is more precise than CT for prostate volume zzso and zzso quality assessment and thus provides superior zzso control assessment after zzso zzso zzso
