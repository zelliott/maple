zzso involves zzso in communication and social interaction, as well as high levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and extreme resistance to zzso This latter dimension, whilst required for a diagnosis, has received less research zzso We zzso that this extreme resistance to change in zzso is rooted in zzso processing of unexpected zzso We tested this using auditory zzso zzso to determine regional brain activity associated with passive detection of infrequently occurring zzso and complex novel sounds in a zzso zzso Participants were twelve zzso to 15-year-old children with zzso and a group of 12 zzso and zzso healthy zzso During zzso zzso significant zzso common to both groups was located in the superior zzso and inferior frontal zzso During zzso zzso both groups showed activity in the superior zzso zzso the zzso zzso the superior and inferior frontal zzso and the zzso zzso Children with zzso showed reduced zzso of the left anterior zzso zzso during both zzso and novelty zzso During novelty zzso children with zzso also showed reduced zzso in the bilateral zzso region and in the right inferior and middle frontal zzso This study confirms previous evidence from zzso studies of zzso brain function related to automatic change detection in zzso zzso involved a cortical network known to have a role in attention switching and zzso resource zzso These results throw light on the zzso processes underlying zzso zzso to zzso
