zzso zzso are zzso benign and usually incidental magnetic resonance imaging findings that must be differentiated from ominous zzso The authors describe 32 zzso in 30 patients using conventional zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso images zzso fast zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso occurred most commonly in the zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso on zzso zzso and of variable appearance on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso on zzso zzso and zzso on zzso Chemical shift artifact zzso usually was present on either zzso zzso or zzso zzso but was not seen on zzso zzso One patient had zzso zzso associated with a large zzso zzso The authors conclude that zzso appear different on zzso zzso than on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are complementary in detecting zzso The lack of zzso being detected in zzso on zzso images most likely relates to inherent bandwidth differences compared with those of zzso The zzso appearance of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be confused with zzso zzso The authors recommend that if zzso technique by itself is used to exclude zzso (in centers that are not using zzso then zzso zzso and zzso usually are zzso For centers using zzso zzso fat zzso or zzso sequences also may be needed to exclude zzso Finally, the zzso series suggests that zzso zzso may occur in lateral locations more frequently than reported zzso
