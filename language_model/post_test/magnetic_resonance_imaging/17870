zzso resonance imaging zzso is commonly zzso as part of the diagnostic zzso for the clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso further guiding the clinical treatment of this aggressive zzso Recent research has shown that zzso zzso may act as zzso or in some cases, tumor zzso genes that in turn may reflect the zzso features of zzso This study aimed to investigate the relationship between zzso features and zzso gene expression in patients with zzso zzso 

In order to identify the relationship between the zzso findings of zzso and those identified changes in zzso gene expression of zzso we reviewed the zzso images of zzso patients and compared them with the identified zzso expression profiles utilizing zzso analysis of paired zzso tumor zzso We chose five zzso imaging features: zzso contrast tumor zzso ratio, zzso contrast tumor zzso ratio, zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The relationship between these five imaging features and zzso expression was studied using significance analysis of zzso zzso 

We found that the expression of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso was zzso correlated with an zzso ratio zzso zzso The zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso were associated with a contrast tumor zzso ratio zzso The zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso were associated with multiple zzso identified on zzso and the expression of zzso was associated with zzso by zzso The expression of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso The gene expression of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso was relatively low when compared with the larger zzso volume group as identified by zzso 

The zzso gene expression profiles correlate with several selected zzso features of patients with zzso Further analysis of key imaging features of zzso with correlation with zzso gene expression patterns may help to guide treatment decisions based on these unique zzso profiles of zzso
