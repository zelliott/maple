The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of single zzso zzso MR imaging for detection of focal zzso zzso 

zzso MR images were zzso reviewed from 51 patients with 85 solid and 59 zzso zzso using the following four zzso conventional zzso zzso fast zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Images were reviewed on a zzso zzso zzso zzso images of a total of zzso zzso segments were reviewed separately and independently for solid and zzso zzso by four zzso zzso zzso and receiver operating characteristic analyses were zzso 

For solid zzso no significant differences were seen among the zzso zzso ratios with the four zzso In terms of solid zzso zzso no significant difference was seen between the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, which showed the best performance of the four zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso fast zzso imaging were judged the best zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences can be zzso for conventional zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso zzso
