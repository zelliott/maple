zzso is uncommon in acute cerebrovascular zzso Its appearance is in relation to the zzso involvement of the zzso zzso particularly the zzso zzso With current zzso techniques it is possible to identify the zzso responsible for these abnormal zzso zzso resonance zzso is the technique of choice for detection of small sized zzso 

We have zzso our series of patients to try to relate the site of the zzso to the appearance of zzso 

We made a retrospective study of the cases of zzso of vascular origin admitted between January 1993 and April zzso In all cases, cerebral zzso and/or MR had been done to find the site of the zzso 

A total of 10 patients with an average age of zzso years zzso zzso was zzso In eight of them zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso half of which were of zzso type and the other half zzso The sites were: zzso nucleus in one case zzso zzso in two cases zzso and zzso zzso in five cases zzso All zzso were zzso to the side of the body affected except in one case with a left zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso found were very varied in zzso In zzso of the cases they were not detected by conventional zzso zzso This fact supports the concept of a functional global network of the zzso zzso which may be interrupted at several points and lead to the same clinical zzso
