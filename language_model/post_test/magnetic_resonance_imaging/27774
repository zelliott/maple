zzso evidence suggested that the zzso zzso may play different roles in the progress of idiopathic generalized zzso zzso This study aimed to demonstrate the zzso in zzso and functional connectivity in the zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso patients with zzso characterized by generalized zzso zzso and 67 healthy controls were involved in the zzso The three-dimensional high-resolution zzso zzso data were acquired for zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso zzso level functional zzso data were acquired for functional connectivity zzso The zzso zzso of bilateral zzso zzso nucleus zzso and zzso as detected with decreased gray matter volumes in patients with zzso through zzso analysis, were selected as seed regions for functional connectivity zzso 

Different zzso patterns were found in functional connectivity of the zzso zzso with decreased gray matter volumes in zzso zzso at the zzso decreased connectivity in the bilateral zzso frontal cortex, zzso nucleus, zzso and zzso were found in the patients zzso with zzso However, seeding at the zzso no significant zzso of functional connectivity was found in the patients zzso with zzso 

Some specific impairment of zzso zzso in zzso was identified using zzso and functional connectivity zzso zzso These findings may strongly support the different involvement of the zzso networks in zzso
