zzso determining the clinically isolated syndrome zzso patient's likelihood of developing multiple sclerosis zzso are important for the zzso who needs to identify patients zzso zzso zzso 

To determine whether motor abnormalities found during the initial zzso event imply an increased risk of a second event within the first zzso 

zzso early onset zzso patients, volunteered to participate in the prospective zzso Motor parameters collected at onset included zzso balance, lower limb peak zzso strength and fatigue index zzso At the end of one year, patients were subdivided into two groups, those who had experienced a second zzso attack suggestive of zzso and those who maintained their clinical zzso 

zzso patients were included in the final zzso Within the first year, 24 patients experienced a second attack, while 25 maintained their neurological zzso Patients who suffered a second zzso attack, demonstrated reduced overall lower limb peak strength compared with patients who maintained their clinical status zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences were observed between groups in gait and balance zzso 

An initial zzso event characterized by reduced lower limb strength can possibly suggest an increased risk of an early second zzso
