This study aims to investigate quantitative zzso blood flow as well as zzso and zzso blood flow changes in the zzso of the Royal College of Surgeons zzso rats with spontaneous retinal zzso and to compare with those of normal rat zzso 

zzso were performed on male zzso rats at zzso days zzso zzso and zzso zzso and on zzso controls at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso balance zzso challenges were used to zzso blood zzso zzso baseline blood flow, and zzso and zzso blood flow changes in the zzso were zzso using continuous zzso spin labeling zzso at 90 zzso 90 zzso 1500 zzso 

In the normal rat zzso zzso blood flow of the zzso was zzso zzso per zzso significantly higher than those reported in the brain zzso 1 zzso per zzso zzso decreased blood flow due to zzso and zzso increased blood flow due to zzso in the normal zzso In the zzso rat zzso zzso blood flow was diminished significantly zzso Interestingly, absolute zzso and zzso blood flow changes in the zzso zzso were not statistically different from those in the normal zzso zzso However, blood flow percent changes in zzso zzso were significantly larger than in normal zzso due to lower zzso blood flow in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso markedly reduces zzso blood flow but does not appear to impair vascular zzso These data also suggest caution when interpreting relative zzso functional zzso changes in diseased states where zzso parameters are significantly zzso zzso blood flow zzso may serve as a valuable tool to study the zzso without depth zzso
