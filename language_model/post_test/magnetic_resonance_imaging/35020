Imaging to determine zzso zzso size is difficult in the emergency setting because the current gold standards, zzso and nuclear medicine techniques, are difficult to perform in unstable zzso Delayed enhanced zzso has recently been proposed as a technique to study contrast zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we compared the extent of acute zzso zzso as measured by delayed enhanced zzso performed immediately after zzso coronary intervention zzso without an additional zzso injection with that measured by delayed zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients presenting with primary acute zzso zzso underwent delayed enhanced zzso immediately after coronary zzso and underwent delayed enhanced zzso within 8 days of zzso Only patients with a zzso in zzso zzso zzso score of 0 or 1 of the culprit coronary artery before zzso zzso and zzso score of 2 or 3 after zzso were zzso zzso of delayed enhanced zzso and delayed enhanced zzso was performed by three observers and focused on identifying the involved segments and determining the zzso extent of enhancement and zzso zzso 

The mean signal intensity was significantly higher in the involved territory than in healthy zzso 197 zzso 81 H versus 71 zzso 20 zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso We found significant agreement between delayed enhanced zzso and delayed enhanced zzso for the number of involved zzso zzso extent of enhancement, and zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso with good zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results of our study show that delayed enhanced zzso allows accurate zzso of early zzso contrast zzso compared with delayed enhanced zzso and does not require an additional contrast injection after zzso
