zzso necrosis factor is an zzso possessing a well-established zzso zzso In Crohn's disease zzso patients, zzso therapy may thus result in visceral fat zzso which is associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso 

A total of 132 CD patients were zzso In a first prospective study, magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat was performed before and 8 weeks after initiation of zzso induction therapy (5 zzso at weeks 0, 2, and 6) in 21 responding patients treated for zzso zzso In a second prospective study, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso LDL, and total cholesterol and zzso levels were assessed in 111 responding patients receiving zzso infusions every 8 weeks, with a mean follow-up of 41 zzso 

A significant homogeneous zzso increase in total abdominal fat was observed in the 21 CD patients after zzso induction therapy zzso zzso zzso independently of body mass index zzso zzso maintenance therapy was associated with a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso together with an increase in both total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso and zzso parameters remained within the normal range throughout the zzso 

zzso induction therapy is associated with a significant increase in abdominal fat tissue in CD zzso zzso maintenance therapy has no deleterious effects on zzso profile and is accompanied by a decrease in zzso and zzso zzso probably by reversing the impairment of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso
