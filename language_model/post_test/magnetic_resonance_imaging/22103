zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging in the liver was compared with four zzso fast and conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In 58 patients with focal liver zzso imaging was performed with a zzso magnet and a zzso zzso Images obtained with fast zzso conventional zzso zzso zzso SE, and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso and receiver operating characteristic analyses were zzso 

zzso contrast for solid tumors was significantly higher with the fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences than with the conventional zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso was significantly higher with the conventional and fast zzso sequences than with the zzso or zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso were negligible on all fast and conventional zzso zzso In receiver operating characteristic zzso diagnostic performance was significantly higher with the fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences than with the conventional zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso 

Images obtained with the fast zzso sequence were free from motion artifacts, and observer diagnostic performance was similar to that with the zzso zzso zzso zzso
