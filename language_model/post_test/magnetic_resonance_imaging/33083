The African zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used as a model system in a wide range of zzso and zzso zzso The increasing number of genetic tools available for this species, together with the emerging interest in its use for zzso studies, increased the need for an accurate zzso mapping of the zzso brain to supplement the available zzso zzso The goal of our study was to elaborate a zzso high-resolution digital zzso using magnetic resonance imaging, supported by zzso zzso zzso images were viewed and zzso in all zzso zzso zzso and zzso and manually zzso to reveal structures in the zzso bulb, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This high resolution zzso brain zzso is expected to become a very useful tool for neuroscientists using this fish model and will certainly expand their use in future studies regarding the central nervous zzso
