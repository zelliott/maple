Recent studies with multiple sclerosis zzso participants have provided evidence for cortical zzso Greater recruitment of zzso areas and additional brain regions are thought to play an zzso role in the performance of cognitive zzso In this study, we compared cortical zzso recruited by zzso patients and controls during a selective attention task that requires both focusing attention on zzso information and ignoring or zzso zzso zzso Despite comparable behavioral performance, zzso patients demonstrated increased neural recruitment of zzso areas along with additional zzso of the prefrontal zzso However, this additional zzso was associated with poor behavioral performance, thereby providing evidence against zzso brain zzso Future studies specifically investigating the nature of additional zzso seen in zzso patients in a wider variety of cognitive tasks would provide insight into the specific cognitive decline in zzso
