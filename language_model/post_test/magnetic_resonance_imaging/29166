The zzso between zzso and bone damage in zzso arthritis zzso is a subject of zzso Using magnetic resonance imaging zzso this study followed the bone changes in early zzso and determined their relationship to zzso 

Thirty-one patients with early zzso who had swelling of the zzso zzso zzso and 31 healthy control subjects with no clinical evidence of arthritis underwent zzso of the second through fifth zzso zzso of the dominant hand by use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppressed zzso sequences were performed to evaluate bone zzso and zzso acid zzso pulse sequences were obtained to evaluate zzso zzso abnormalities were described as bone zzso zzso signal on zzso sequences and zzso signal on zzso zzso sequences adjacent to the bone zzso or as bone zzso zzso zzso abnormalities with low signal on zzso images and with very high signal on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso films were scored in a blinded manner, and zzso exact probability test was used to determine differences between zzso 

zzso of the 31 zzso patients zzso had bone zzso which was seen in 43 of 124 zzso zzso of zzso and 3 of the 31 control subjects had bone zzso seen in 3 of 124 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thirty zzso patients zzso had zzso zzso joint zzso and bone zzso was seen in 40 of the 75 zzso with zzso zzso zzso but in only 3 of 49 without zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso joint bone zzso is present in the majority of patients with zzso at zzso but is seen only occasionally in normal control zzso The fact that bone zzso occurred rarely in the absence of zzso in patients with zzso suggests that zzso changes in zzso are secondary to zzso
