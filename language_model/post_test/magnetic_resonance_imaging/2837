To find an optimal diagnostic protocol for the zzso MR evaluation of patients with zzso lobe zzso 

MR imaging in 14 healthy subjects and 25 consecutive patients with zzso lobe zzso was performed in zzso sections perpendicular to the zzso with zzso inversion recovery and zzso zzso Volume zzso of the zzso complex were performed and a zzso sequence yielded zzso zzso 

zzso disease was seen in 22 of 25 zzso lobe zzso patients on zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso Four had bilateral zzso zzso for zzso disease were features such as volume loss, decreased zzso and loss of internal zzso Only 17 of 25 patients demonstrated zzso pathology on zzso images, and in one patient this was zzso Patients with only minimal structural loss on zzso inversion recovery had normal zzso zzso zzso calculation was no more sensitive than visual assessment on the zzso zzso Volume zzso were normal in one patient and misleading in two zzso zzso as compared with clinical and zzso findings, was most confidently done with zzso zzso inversion recovery images and volume zzso 

An optimum MR protocol for zzso lobe zzso patients is zzso Its essential feature is that the zzso be evaluated by zzso zzso inversion recovery images and volume zzso zzso imaging can be zzso
