The authors report outcomes in 18 patients with zzso zzso zzso who were treated with gamma knife zzso and in whom magnetic resonance zzso imaging was obtained a mean of 14 years zzso zzso zzso after treatment and 10 years zzso zzso zzso after confirmed obliteration of the zzso All patients were zzso after zzso and during the time of the zzso In five patients zzso zzso formation was observed that corresponded to the site of the obliterated zzso zzso formation and contrast enhancement on MR imaging could not be statistically correlated to the radiation zzso In 11 zzso of the 18 patients, contrast enhancement that was not related to a zzso of the zzso was observed in the target zzso In three patients zzso an increased zzso signal was detected at the site of previous zzso this was interpreted as zzso or zzso which appeared to be dose zzso The study illustrates that zzso formation, contrast enhancement, and an increased zzso signal can be observed in zzso patients in the area that was targeted for zzso zzso up to 23 years after the zzso The report provides new and essential information about long-term effects on normal tissue after zzso and provides a basis for the interpretation of MR studies in the follow up of small zzso treated by zzso
