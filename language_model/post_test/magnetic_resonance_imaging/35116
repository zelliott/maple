zzso findings indicate that the core executive functions of zzso and working memory are closely linked, and zzso studies indicate overlap between their neural zzso There has not, however, been a comprehensive study, including several zzso tasks and several working memory tasks, performed by the same zzso In the present study, 11 healthy adult subjects completed separate blocks of 3 zzso tasks (a stop task, a zzso task and a zzso zzso and 2 working memory tasks (one spatial and one zzso zzso common to all 5 tasks was identified in the right inferior frontal zzso and, at a lower zzso also the right middle frontal zzso and right zzso regions zzso 40 and BA zzso Left inferior frontal regions of interest zzso showed a significant conjunction between all tasks except the zzso zzso The present study could not pinpoint the specific function of each common region, but the zzso region identified here has previously been consistently related to working memory storage and the right inferior frontal zzso has been associated with zzso in both zzso and imaging zzso These results support the notion that zzso and working memory tasks involve common neural zzso which may provide a neural basis for the zzso between the two zzso
