The authors performed a retrospective review of records of patients referred to a zzso service with acute bilateral zzso zzso from zzso zzso criteria included previous multiple sclerosis or zzso known systemic disorders or medications associated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso Patients received intravenous zzso followed by oral zzso Visual acuity zzso zzso mean zzso zzso for visual fields, percentage of zzso plates seen, zzso and neurological evaluation were recorded at baseline and at 6 months or 12 zzso zzso to strong correlation for visual loss between eyes, the results for the worse eye in each patient were zzso 

11 men and four women, with an age range of zzso years, had bilateral decreased vision, 12 with pain on eye zzso Except for one patient, no zzso was zzso All patients had normal neurological evaluations, average visual acuity zzso zzso zzso zzso vision zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso nerves showed abnormal signal on magnetic resonance zzso 14 patients improved and their last average visual zzso zzso vision, and mean zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No patient developed a neurological problem during the follow up with a mean of 11 zzso
