zzso tagging by cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso is a comprehensive method for the assessment of cardiac regional zzso However, imaging the right zzso zzso using this technique is problematic due to the thin wall of the RV relative to tag spacing which limits assessment of regional function using conventional zzso zzso 

We zzso that the use of zzso tags in the zzso zzso zzso technique would result in zzso zzso of the RV regional function due to the high image quality and spatial resolution possible with zzso 

To test the zzso and zzso zzso of RV peak zzso strain zzso with zzso zzso for assessment of RV regional function zzso zzso in healthy zzso 

Healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso were zzso using zzso A zzso view was acquired in a single zzso zzso strain was measured during zzso at six zzso points along the RV free zzso Peak contraction is defined as the maximum value of zzso strain averaged from the six points, and regional function is defined as the strain value at each point at the time of peak zzso 

Mean values for peak zzso strain zzso standard zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso regions of the RV free wall were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Altman plots showed good zzso and zzso agreements with mean difference of zzso and zzso and limits of agreement of zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso allows for rapid zzso of RV regional function with low zzso and zzso zzso which could permit accurate zzso of regional strain in patients with RV zzso
