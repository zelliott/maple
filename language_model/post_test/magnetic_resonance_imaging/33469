A new approach to understanding and reducing motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging zzso is zzso This paper presents a novel technique for correcting generalized motion artifacts arising from translation, zzso zzso and zzso or any combination zzso We also describe a new pulse sequence and a specialized zzso technique required to suppress these motion zzso The correction zzso zzso for generalized zzso The theoretical basis of the correction scheme is founded upon the zzso zzso and the concept of pulse sequence contrast mapping zzso The proposed zzso zzso is based on the zzso projection slice zzso and allows us to determine how motion artifacts zzso The correction technique currently suffers from some spatial resolution and zzso ratio limitations, and works better for small objects than large zzso These problems will be investigated in subsequent zzso
