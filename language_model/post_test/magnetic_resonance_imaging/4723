With the advancement of technical progress, especially with respect to magnetic resonance imaging, zzso cerebral white matter zzso zzso are being found with increasing zzso The zzso diagnosis between the two main zzso of old age, zzso zzso of the zzso type zzso and vascular zzso zzso is made more frequently in zzso of the latter, since the detection of zzso leads to support a vascular origin for zzso The present article reviews the literature concerning X-ray zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in these zzso For comparison purposes some zzso problems must be taken into account including different scoring systems for zzso severity, differences in imaging techniques and in the criteria for the selection of patients and zzso A great number of studies demonstrates a strong association of frequency and severity of zzso with increasing age and presence of cerebrovascular risk factors such zzso zzso Some studies revealed an association with zzso deficits including gait disorders, urinary zzso affective zzso and reduced attention and information processing zzso In CT studies, about zzso of patients with zzso had zzso but zzso in MR zzso However, only few studies controlled for the presence of cerebrovascular risk zzso More recent studies - with improved techniques - revealed a higher frequency of zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso group compared to zzso The prevalence of zzso in zzso patients was zzso in CT studies and about zzso in MR zzso zzso without the presence of zzso the diagnosis of zzso is currently in zzso A number of in zzso investigations proved consistently - and with different methods - that cerebral blood flow was reduced in zzso zzso As shown in some studies the zzso zzso of zzso have in common that the relative tissue water content is zzso This includes zzso zzso complete and incomplete zzso zzso of the zzso zzso spaces with zzso zzso Thus the finding of zzso in watershed areas can be zzso Three case reports serve to illustrate the problems pointed zzso In conclusion, the occurrence of zzso is an unspecific finding which is observed in up to 50% of the zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso or signs of zzso zzso or zzso based on CT or zzso alone, should not be zzso
