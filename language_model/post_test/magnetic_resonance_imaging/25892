zzso zzso is a new zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agent with a dual zzso zzso via the liver and zzso and zzso via the kidney in normal zzso The abdominal enhancement patterns of this new compound and the zzso mechanism by the liver were studied in rats using tissue zzso and zzso 

Twelve normal rats, 33 rats treated with agents designed to inhibit zzso zzso of the agent, and 6 rats with surgically zzso common zzso ducts received zzso zzso Distribution and zzso were measured by MR zzso MR signal intensity was measured over time for liver, zzso and zzso 

In normal animals, zzso zzso zzso induced a significantly greater zzso and more prolonged liver signal enhancement zzso at 30 minutes) than zzso at the same zzso Either zzso induced by common zzso duct zzso or zzso zzso infusion inhibited liver zzso of zzso resulting in a preferential elimination via the zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso acid zzso was unable to block the liver zzso of zzso Blood zzso of zzso in rats were zzso minutes for the first component and zzso minutes for the zzso 

Data indicate that transport of zzso through the liver into zzso is driven by the organic zzso zzso The relation between enhancement of liver and kidney may be zzso useful to indirectly evaluate liver zzso zzso Yet, persistent enhancement of liver, even in the presence of severe zzso should be sufficient to identify focal mass zzso
