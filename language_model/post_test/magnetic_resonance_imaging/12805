zzso spike wave zzso zzso are the zzso zzso hallmark of absence seizures, clinically zzso by a zzso interruption of ongoing activities and impaired consciousness, occurring during states of reduced zzso Several theories have been proposed to explain the zzso of zzso zzso and the role of zzso and zzso as zzso In this work we extend the existing theories by zzso a role for the zzso a brain region neglected in previous works on zzso generation but already known to be linked to consciousness and zzso We zzso zzso data using dynamic zzso zzso zzso to investigate the effective connectivity between zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso data from seven patients affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso with frequent zzso zzso and significant zzso zzso signal changes in the thalamus, the prefrontal zzso and the zzso Using zzso we assessed their effective zzso zzso which region drives another zzso Three dynamic zzso models were zzso zzso was zzso as autonomous input to the zzso zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso B), and zzso zzso zzso zzso model comparison revealed Model C zzso as autonomous input to zzso to be the best in 5 patients while model A prevailed in two zzso At the group level model C dominated and at the zzso the p value of model C was approximately zzso 

Our results provide strong evidence that activity in the zzso gates zzso zzso in the zzso cortical zzso This study is the first demonstration of a zzso link between zzso changes in the zzso -- an index of awareness -- and the occurrence of pathological zzso in zzso
