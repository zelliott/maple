zzso zzso to zzso zzso have been detected not only in patients with overt central diabetes zzso zzso but also in patients with zzso zzso diseases without zzso This suggests that complete zzso can be preceded by a zzso zzso Among zzso patients with zzso zzso diseases without zzso 9 patients found to be zzso positive and 139 zzso controls were enrolled in this open prospective zzso They were evaluated for zzso and zzso zzso function at least yearly for about 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso during this span, magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso zzso and stalk was performed only in the zzso zzso Five of the 9 zzso patients had normal zzso zzso function at study zzso They were zzso positive throughout the follow-up zzso At later stages of the study, 3 of them developed partial zzso and 1 developed complete zzso The remaining 4 patients showed impaired response to the water deprivation test at study entry and were diagnosed as having partial zzso Two of them agreed to receive zzso replacement for 1 zzso After this treatment, the patients became negative for zzso and displayed normal zzso zzso function until the end of the zzso zzso the 2 zzso patients with partial zzso remained zzso zzso One of them developed overt zzso None of the controls became zzso positive or developed zzso The normal zzso zzso signal of the zzso zzso present at study entry, persisted subsequently in all 9 zzso patients, including those developing overt zzso only disappearing in the late phase of complete zzso In zzso subjects, the monitoring of zzso but not zzso seems to be useful to predict a progression toward zzso zzso Early zzso therapy in patients with partial zzso could interrupt or delay the zzso damage and the progression toward clinically overt zzso
