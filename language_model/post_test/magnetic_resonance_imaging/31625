The concept of sodium imaging zzso pulse zzso zzso for zzso ratio zzso under specific zzso rate zzso constraints is zzso This zzso concept is unique to sodium imaging, as sodium exhibits zzso zzso relaxation in zzso and involves minimizing echo time zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso minimizing TE (and zzso zzso requires minimizing the zzso pulse zzso zzso zzso also involves exploiting rapid zzso relaxation with shortened repetition time zzso zzso However, especially at higher fields, both zzso pulse length and zzso are constrained by zzso which is also dependent on the flip zzso zzso mechanical simulations were performed for zzso equivalent sets of zzso pulse zzso zzso and flip zzso It was determined that an zzso advantage is associated with a zzso zzso approach to sodium imaging with zzso acquisition even though significantly longer zzso zzso (and zzso are required to implement this approach under the zzso constraint at zzso This advantage, compared to zzso pulse sequences implementing zzso echo times, 90 degrees flip angles, and longer repetition times, was confirmed in healthy volunteers zzso zzso increase of approximately zzso and used to produce excellent quality sodium images of the human zzso
