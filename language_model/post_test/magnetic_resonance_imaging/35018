The objective of our study was to zzso compare the degree of pelvic organ zzso shown on dynamic true fast imaging with zzso zzso zzso versus zzso sequences in symptomatic zzso 

zzso women zzso age, 57 zzso with suspected pelvic floor dysfunction underwent zzso using both a zzso true zzso zzso acquired continuously during rest alternating with the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso acquired zzso at rest and at zzso zzso Data sets were evaluated in random order by two zzso in consensus using the zzso line zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso was based on a zzso grading system indicating severity as zzso no zzso zzso mild, 1; moderate, 2; or zzso zzso A comparison between sequences on a zzso basis was performed using a zzso analysis with p zzso zzso considered zzso 

Overall, zzso zzso of patients had more severe zzso zzso 1 degrees ) based on dynamic true zzso images, with zzso zzso of the cases of zzso seen exclusively on true zzso zzso Only zzso zzso of patients had greater degrees of zzso on zzso images than on true zzso images, with zzso zzso of the cases seen exclusively on zzso zzso A statistically significant increase in the severity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a trend toward more severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso descent zzso zzso zzso shown on true zzso zzso 

Overall, greater degrees of organ zzso in all three compartments were found with a dynamic true zzso sequence compared with a sequential zzso zzso Near real-time continuous imaging with a dynamic true zzso sequence should be included in MR protocols to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction in addition to dynamic zzso zzso zzso
