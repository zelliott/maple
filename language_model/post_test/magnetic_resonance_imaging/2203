The suitability of the zzso fluid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso as an internal zzso reference was studied on magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso spine using a surface zzso and motion zzso suppression zzso A zzso reference is needed when signal is compared between images, studies or zzso zzso of the zzso was estimated visually on zzso images of 60 subjects at zzso T and of another 60 subjects at zzso zzso zzso with a severely narrowed zzso zzso or marked zzso were excluded from the study to avoid partial volume zzso zzso was homogeneous in zzso and zzso of the examinations at zzso T and zzso zzso zzso The type and location of the local zzso did not relate to local zzso of the zzso zzso The signal intensity of zzso was measured in 108 examinations at zzso T after correcting the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso difference between the zzso in the upper and lower zzso zzso zzso was less than zzso in zzso of the zzso The zzso in the zzso zzso zzso can be a useful zzso reference for zzso of the signal of the adjacent structures in patients without severe narrowing of the zzso zzso or marked zzso It may contribute to assessing spinal disease zzso
