We report a method for mapping apparent diffusion zzso using two zzso zzso zzso Image slice selection is performed prior to each zzso allowing the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso Phase cycling of the zzso process for each projection zzso zzso contributions to echo zzso This permits an accurate evaluation of both zzso and apparent zzso zzso zzso
