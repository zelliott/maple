To describe pathological findings identified with zzso in the zzso zzso bones of horses with unilateral hind limb zzso attributable to zzso pain and to compare the usefulness of zzso with that of zzso and nuclear zzso in evaluation of this zzso 

zzso case zzso 

20 lame zzso 

In all horses, zzso zzso (4 standard zzso and nuclear zzso of the zzso had been zzso zzso were excluded if the results of all 3 imaging zzso were not available or if zzso was detected in more than 1 zzso zzso changes identified with zzso were zzso with the findings determined with other imaging zzso 

Compared with zzso findings, the following zzso were identified with zzso zzso and zzso bone sclerosis in 9 of 16 horses, pathological changes related to zzso zzso in 0 of 10 horses, and zzso in 5 of 8 zzso Standard zzso projections did not aid in the identification of fracture of the zzso zzso bones (3 zzso zzso of increased zzso zzso with nuclear zzso corresponded with the location of pathological changes detected with zzso in all zzso The intensity of the zzso zzso on nuclear zzso images did not zzso with the severity of the pathological changes identified with zzso 

zzso was unreliable for the detection of pathological changes related to zzso zzso identified with zzso zzso and zzso bone sclerosis in the zzso zzso Nuclear zzso was effective in zzso pathological changes, but zzso provided superior zzso zzso
