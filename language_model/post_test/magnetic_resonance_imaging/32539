Visual attention can be automatically zzso by another person's zzso gaze as well as by symbolic zzso zzso We investigated whether the shifts of attention triggered by biologically relevant gaze cues and biologically zzso zzso cues rely on the same neural systems by comparing the effects of zzso and zzso zzso on blood zzso zzso zzso signal in zzso Participants detected zzso presented reaction signals preceded by centrally presented zzso gaze and zzso zzso zzso gaze cues and zzso cues were presented in separate zzso Furthermore, two separate control blocks were run in which zzso cues zzso gaze or segment of a line) were zzso The zzso signals during the control blocks were zzso from those during the respective blocks with directional zzso zzso data showed that, for both cue types, reaction times were shorter on zzso than zzso zzso Imaging data revealed three zzso of zzso for zzso zzso in the left inferior zzso zzso and right zzso and inferior zzso zzso For zzso zzso a much more extensive network was zzso There were large zzso zzso zzso including areas in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and in the left zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso also activated the right frontal eye field and supplementary eye zzso The results suggest that attention zzso by gaze cues and attention zzso by zzso cues are not supported by the same cortical network and that attention zzso by symbolic zzso cues relies on mechanisms associated with voluntary shifts of zzso
