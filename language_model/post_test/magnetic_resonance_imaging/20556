Blood oxygen level zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso signals are both coupled to zzso zzso although their relationship is incompletely zzso Here, the wide range of zzso and zzso responses produced by auditory zzso was exploited to better understand the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso responses were made in the same subjects using the same stimuli for both zzso The zzso zzso sequences of click trains, had duty cycles of zzso 25, 72, and zzso For the zzso zzso the zzso response was elevated throughout the zzso whereas for zzso it peaked after sequence onset and offset and showed a diminished zzso in zzso On the finer zzso of zzso responses at zzso consisted of a complex of zzso including zzso to each click train of the zzso whereas for zzso the only zzso occurred at sequence onset and offset between which there was a sustained zzso in the zzso signal (a sustained zzso A model that separately estimated the contributions of transient and sustained zzso signals to the zzso response best fit zzso zzso when the transient contribution was weighted 8- to zzso more than the sustained zzso The findings suggest that zzso responses in the auditory zzso are tightly coupled to the neural activity underlying zzso not zzso zzso zzso
