It is well known that the zzso zzso is engaged in face perception, such as the processes of face familiarity and zzso However, the functional role of the zzso zzso in face processing related to high-level social zzso remains zzso The current study assessed the functional role of individually defined zzso face area zzso in the processing of zzso physical properties and zzso zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor neural responses to rapidly presented face stimuli drawn from zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and a zzso friend's face zzso zzso in a face recognition zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso that differed in zzso physical properties but were both recognized as the self uncovered neural activity sensitive to zzso physical properties in the left zzso zzso zzso 50% that were recognized as the self versus a friend on different trials revealed neural zzso associated with zzso identity in the right zzso Moreover, the right zzso activity correlated with the frequency of recognizing zzso 50% as the zzso Our results provide evidence for functional zzso of the left and right zzso in the representations of zzso physical properties and zzso zzso
