Increased zzso and vascular zzso are integral processes in tumors, and various therapeutic strategies seek to reverse the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumors such as the rat zzso zzso and accumulate in zzso zzso Under such conditions, zzso zzso zzso provides approximately zzso increase in life span, but free zzso is no more beneficial than a saline zzso However, the relationship between drug deposition and therapeutic effect is understood zzso In the present work, magnetic resonance zzso and functional MR zzso imaging were used for zzso serial evaluation of zzso zzso tumor responses to repetitive doses of free zzso or zzso in zzso stabilized zzso zzso zzso After multiple doses of zzso MR imaging revealed the induction of zzso zzso in zzso of rats zzso zzso zzso No zzso was observed by MR imaging after a single dose of zzso in normal brain regions in animals treated with free zzso zzso zzso 3) or in saline controls zzso zzso zzso zzso sections from rats sacrificed immediately after MR imaging verified the putative zzso regions and revealed zzso and zzso tumor cells surrounding the area of the zzso zzso maps were obtained by comparing paired images acquired during air and zzso zzso CO2 and zzso zzso zzso These blood zzso zzso zzso maps showed enhanced image intensity after both single and multiple doses of zzso which suggested increased and progressive vascular zzso The results suggest that the breakdown of tumor zzso induced by zzso may arise from the zzso zzso of zzso in tumor and zzso effects on tumor vascular zzso
