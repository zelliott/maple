We aimed on identifying the differences of zzso and zzso zzso associated with mild zzso zzso zzso in the pediatric zzso 

Medical charts of pediatric patients who had been admitted between July 1999 and June 2011 due to zzso were zzso zzso zzso were ultimately divided into three zzso zzso zzso zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with fever during zzso zzso zzso zzso patients without fever during zzso Comparisons between groups were carried out on demographic and clinical zzso laboratory test results, electroencephalogram findings, brain magnetic resonance imaging findings, zzso treatment, and zzso 

Among the zzso subjects who had been admitted due to mild zzso zzso zzso zzso did not have any seizures, 17 zzso had zzso seizures, 42 zzso had zzso zzso The duration of gastrointestinal symptoms before the onset of zzso were significantly shorter in the zzso group compared to the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A single seizure attack was significantly higher in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso episodes; zzso and the frequency of zzso that were of focal type with or without secondary zzso were significantly higher in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients among the zzso and zzso group had not received further zzso treatment after zzso and none developed zzso during follow up zzso 

Despite some differences in seizure zzso both zzso and zzso zzso associated with mild zzso were mostly benign with a favorable zzso
