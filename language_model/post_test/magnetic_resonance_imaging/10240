zzso zzso is an increasingly common method to treat zzso zzso zzso zzso To date, however, published data are rather scarce, especially with regard to true zzso complications and their zzso The purpose of our study was to evaluate treatment safety and correlate zzso results with clinical outcome by using MR imaging, including zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso 

We performed 50 zzso procedures in 21 zzso Most zzso were zzso zzso grades zzso MR imaging was scheduled within 1 week before and 3 days after each zzso MR imaging findings were correlated to digital zzso zzso procedure reports, and the clinical zzso zzso was graded according to the modified Rankin scale zzso 3-6 months after zzso 

In this study, 104 MR imaging examinations were zzso mean zzso between the zzso procedure and zzso MR imaging was 28 zzso Nine adverse events occurred in 7 patients during 8 procedures zzso one causing a permanent zzso New zzso were noted on MR imaging after zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the procedures, frequently located zzso Most zzso were small, frequently zzso and zzso zzso Four zzso were zzso zzso zzso developed from a zzso zzso on 2 zzso New zzso including zzso developed between treatments in 4 patients, mainly because of progressive zzso of the zzso or draining zzso zzso overestimated the zzso zzso on most occasions, and transient worsening of the zzso pattern was noted in 2 zzso zzso mortality and morbidity were zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso 

zzso procedures are rather safe but are associated with more zzso events and followed by less zzso disturbances than previously zzso zzso procedural events and new MR imaging zzso were generally zzso and most often zzso if zzso Most zzso would not have been verified without MR zzso zzso and zzso were most useful to detect and understand the cause of various zzso The most clinically important complications were caused by late zzso zzso
