Four patients with zzso zzso zzso were treated with a magnetic targeted carrier bound to zzso zzso by using a joint magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso system consisting of a zzso zzso magnet connected to a zzso zzso unit by a sliding zzso Selective zzso delivery of the zzso to the zzso artery was monitored by using zzso MR imaging, and interim zzso manipulation was performed with zzso guidance to zzso agent delivery to the tumor and minimize delivery to normal zzso The final fraction of treated tumor volume ranged from zzso to zzso The fraction of affected normal liver volume ranged from zzso to zzso The dual MR zzso zzso system shows promise for directing zzso targeted tumor zzso
