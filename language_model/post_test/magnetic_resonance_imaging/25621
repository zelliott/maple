A zzso retrospective review of 83 zzso masses zzso benign and 34 zzso was performed to evaluate the ability to distinguish benign from zzso zzso masses with magnetic resonance zzso zzso The correct zzso diagnosis was reached in zzso of cases by one reader and in zzso of cases by the second zzso Mean sensitivity was 50% for benign masses and zzso for zzso zzso The majority of both benign and zzso masses had zzso signal intensity and at least partially irregular zzso zzso masses uncommonly had smooth borders and homogeneous signal zzso MR imaging can be used to evaluate the extent of zzso masses, but most masses will require biopsy to determine if they are benign or zzso
