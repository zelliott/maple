zzso acts on the zzso circuits of the brain leading to the release of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the brain may cause smokers to become less sensitive to zzso zzso To test the theory that adolescents with low nicotine exposure may already have decreased zzso when exposed to a natural zzso we looked at the effect of visual cues representing zzso food on light adolescent smokers compared with zzso 

Twelve adolescent light smokers zzso zzso years, smoked zzso zzso and 12 nonsmokers zzso zzso years, never smoked a zzso from the San Francisco Bay Area underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso During zzso they viewed blocks of photographic images representing zzso foods zzso high fat, and salty zzso and control zzso 

Smokers reported smoking a mean of zzso zzso There was no difference in body mass index between groups zzso zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso Food images zzso greater zzso in nonsmokers in multiple areas including the zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso inferior frontal region zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There were no regions where smokers demonstrated greater blood zzso zzso zzso compared with nonsmokers when viewing food versus neutral zzso 

The finding of decreased zzso to zzso food among adolescent light smokers supports the theory that these adolescents are displaying decreased sensitivity to at least one natural zzso This also supports the theory that nicotine may affect the brain early in the trajectory of smoking, thus zzso the need for early intervention among adolescent zzso
