zzso resonance zzso zzso can be used to determine the side of seizure onset in patients with zzso lobe zzso Some patients with abnormal MR zzso findings also have zzso zzso which in some cases have been reported to zzso after zzso lobe zzso With the aim of better understanding the mechanisms underlying abnormal MR zzso findings, the current study was performed to define patient features that would predict this zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients with zzso lobe zzso were subjected to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso and zzso lateral zzso lobe zzso were zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso was more pronounced for patients showing extensive zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities on MR zzso A second factor that influenced the degree to which the zzso levels changed zzso was the focus zzso Surgery tended to have a more pronounced effect on the zzso zzso levels in patients with a right zzso focus, whereas in patients with left zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were virtually zzso In the zzso zzso region, neither zzso abnormalities nor focus side was related to zzso zzso 

We have thus identified 2 different factors zzso zzso MR zzso abnormalities and zzso zzso that predict zzso zzso of zzso MR zzso zzso We suggest that both factors indicate a more generalized zzso disease zzso that the patients in whom the MR zzso abnormalities zzso are recovering from a more severe zzso
