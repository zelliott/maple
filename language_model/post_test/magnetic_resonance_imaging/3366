The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with suspected zzso cancer recurrence after total zzso or zzso surgery, as well as zzso or zzso chemotherapy, who had undergone zzso zzso imaging were recruited for the present zzso All patients also underwent zzso within a month of zzso zzso for the same zzso zzso cancer in the abdomen and pelvis was evaluated in each of the 47 patients and classified as either distant zzso or local pelvic recurrence involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region, and/or abdominal and pelvic zzso zzso Special attention was paid to zzso zzso These were divided into five groups according to size of the zzso less than zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso 1-2 zzso zzso zzso 2-3 zzso zzso zzso and larger than 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso findings were compared with zzso MR zzso zzso analysis was carried out using the zzso signed rank zzso 

Thirty-nine of 47 patients were found to have zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were negative for recurrence in six zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, negative zzso value, and diagnostic accuracy of zzso were zzso 100, 100, zzso and zzso respectively, whereas those of zzso were 95, zzso zzso 75, and zzso zzso For the zzso implants in groups 2 and 3, the sensitivity, negative zzso value, and diagnostic accuracy values of zzso were significantly better than those of zzso zzso 

The present study revealed that zzso is similar to conventional zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso has greater accuracy in the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso implants compared with zzso This may affect surgical decision zzso
