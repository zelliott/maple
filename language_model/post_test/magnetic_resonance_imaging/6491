The zzso of missed diagnoses of acute cardiac zzso in the emergency department could be reduced by a new imaging zzso In the present study, the clinical significance of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the detection of culprit zzso in patients with acute coronary syndromes zzso was zzso 

The study group comprised 18 patients with zzso 12 patients with acute zzso zzso zzso (11 zzso mean age, zzso zzso and 6 patients with unstable angina zzso (3 zzso mean age, zzso zzso Of the 12 patients with zzso 10 underwent zzso and zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies as a zzso acquisition zzso and 8 underwent zzso zzso within 1 week of the zzso zzso All 18 patients underwent zzso zzso and zzso The zzso pulse sequence was black blood zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed higher sensitivity and negative zzso value than zzso and zzso and higher specificity and positive zzso value than zzso and zzso The area under the zzso characteristic curve for zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The difference between the areas of zzso and zzso was significant zzso 

zzso detection of culprit zzso is improved by using zzso rather than zzso particularly for patients with zzso
