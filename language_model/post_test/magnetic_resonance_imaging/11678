To explore the role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in distinguishing zzso from benign zzso zzso 

All 64 patients were examined with both zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso features of zzso zzso and MR signal intensity on zzso zzso and zzso zzso images were zzso 

zzso zzso involvement, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the chest wall and/or zzso were most suggestive of a zzso cause on CT and MR zzso zzso to what has been reported in the literature, zzso thickness greater than 1 zzso either on CT or on zzso did not reveal a significant difference between zzso and benign zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso features in combination with signal intensity features, zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso in the detection of zzso zzso 

Compared with those on CT, the zzso features on zzso allowed a mostly equal and in some cases superior detection and evaluation of the spread of zzso zzso In combination with signal intensity and zzso features, zzso is very useful in distinguishing zzso from benign zzso zzso
