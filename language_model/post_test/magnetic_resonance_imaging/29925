Our visual environment consists of information ranging from coarse to fine patterns with respect to spatial frequency zzso zzso studies using experimental animals have shown that there exist specific zzso channels in zzso and zzso visual zzso In the present study, we used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and healthy subjects to investigate whether manipulation of the zzso of visual images zzso neural responses in the zzso zzso zzso were scanned while performing zzso zzso with zzso or zzso filtered images of a face and zzso We demonstrated that visual attention to the stimuli with high zzso more specifically involves cortical zzso in the left zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso as compared to that with low zzso zzso specificity in the left zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso comparison of original images with zzso flipped zzso There was no zzso region in the right zzso however, processing of zzso images may be zzso in zzso and zzso zzso These results may shed light on the neural zzso of behavioral evidence that zzso stimuli are handled faster and more accurately when presented to the right visual zzso than to the left zzso The present results were also discussed in a viewpoint of zzso processing and functional asymmetry of cerebral zzso
