The usefulness of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging during zzso surgery for functioning zzso zzso was zzso evaluated based on long-term zzso zzso from the records of 14 patients who underwent zzso surgery with zzso imaging for functioning zzso zzso and small zzso located in the zzso zzso The maximum tumor diameter was zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients were diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease zzso zzso zzso If zzso imaging detected tumor remnants after zzso the zzso cavity was zzso and further zzso was zzso zzso zzso follow-up period was mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remnants were detected after the first zzso in seven zzso Further zzso was performed in five of these patients, and three achieved long-term zzso zzso As a result, the overall long-term zzso zzso rate was zzso zzso instead of the zzso zzso that would be expected if zzso imaging had not been zzso zzso zzso zzso had a tendency to be associated with the absence of tumor remnants on the final zzso images, but this was not significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with presence of tumor remnants in the cavernous zzso on the final zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging is useful for depicting tumor remnants after zzso and increased the long-term zzso zzso rate for patients with functioning zzso zzso and small zzso
