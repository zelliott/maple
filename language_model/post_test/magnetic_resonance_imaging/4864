Museum fish collections possess a wealth of anatomical and zzso data that are essential for documenting and understanding zzso zzso access to specimens for research, however, is not always practical and frequently conflicts with the need to maintain the physical integrity of specimens and the collection as a zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso digital imaging therefore serves a critical role in zzso the zzso of these specimens for anatomical and zzso analysis as well as zzso an efficient method for online storage and sharing of this imaging zzso Here we describe the development of the Digital Fish Library zzso zzso an online digital archive of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans of the soft tissue anatomy of an array of zzso preserved in the Marine zzso Collection of Scripps Institution of zzso We have zzso and uploaded zzso data for over 300 marine and freshwater species, developed a data archival and retrieval system with a zzso image analysis and zzso zzso and integrated these into the public zzso zzso to zzso data and associated zzso freely over the zzso We show that zzso is a rapid and powerful method for accurately depicting the zzso zzso anatomy of preserved zzso in sufficient detail for large-scale comparative digital zzso However these zzso zzso data require a sophisticated zzso and archival infrastructure in order to be broadly accessible to researchers and zzso
