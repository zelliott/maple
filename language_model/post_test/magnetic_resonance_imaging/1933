The diagnostic value and zzso of MR imaging were compared with US before zzso retrograde zzso zzso in patients with clinically suspected zzso tract zzso 

In a prospective study of 219 patients, 85 were examined with both MR and US before zzso 

To find the correct diagnosis in the jaundiced patients the sensitivity of zzso MR and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the patients with abdominal upper zzso pain and normal serum zzso the sensitivity of zzso MR and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with MR costs four times more than zzso zzso with US and supplemental MR in zzso cases would cost zzso of the total amount compared to screening with MR zzso 

MR had a higher sensitivity than US for diagnosing zzso tract disease and MR was superior to US in zzso stones in the common zzso duct and in diagnosing the cause of zzso However, screening with US and supplemental MR in zzso cases is at present most zzso With increased accessibility and slightly lower costs, MR will probably replace US as screening method in patients with suspected zzso tract zzso
