zzso changes in brain structure can occur in task relevant brain regions as a result of extensive training in complex motor tasks and long-term cognitive training but little is known about the impact of visual zzso learning on brain zzso Here we studied the effect of five days of visual zzso learning in a zzso conjunction search task using anatomical zzso We found rapid changes in gray matter volume in the right zzso superior zzso zzso an area sensitive to zzso moving zzso that predicted the degree to which an zzso performance improved with zzso Furthermore, behavioral improvements were also predicted by zzso changes in an extended white matter region underlying the visual zzso These findings point towards quick and efficient plastic neural mechanisms that enable the visual brain to deal effectively with changing environmental zzso
