Reconstruction of the central surface representation of the cerebral zzso is an important means to study the structure and function of the human zzso In this paper, we propose a novel method based on an elastic transform zzso field to drive a zzso model for the reconstruction of the central cortical zzso Both simulated brain zzso and real brain images are used to evaluate this zzso We applied the surface reconstruction method and a hybrid zzso and surface registration zzso to detect simulated brain zzso Experimental results show that the central cortical surface representation has better performance in detecting simulated zzso than the traditionally used inner or outer cortical surface zzso
