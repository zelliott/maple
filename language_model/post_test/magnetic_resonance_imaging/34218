zzso characterization of white matter pathways is important for the understanding of zzso relationships in the human zzso While it is known from zzso studies that the connectivity of cortical areas is conveyed by projection, zzso and association zzso most clinical studies disregard useful information about specific fiber zzso zzso transfer zzso MR detects the relative proportion of free mobile zzso and immobile zzso bound to zzso zzso values correlate with zzso and it has been proposed that in the white matter, the amount of zzso transfer zzso with the degree of zzso Thus, zzso provides measures that may reflect more accurately the physiology and natural course of diseases involving the white zzso We applied this quantitative in zzso method to five children at different ages to determine whether the zzso changes of distinct fiber tracts could be zzso All regions of interest were localized by means of zzso original descriptions and the additional use of reconstructed zzso data from 10 zzso human brain zzso With this zzso approach we localized and measured 26 zzso white matter fiber tracts in each hemisphere, connecting to primary as well as association zzso All fiber tracts showed consistent age-related zzso changes and the strongest effects were found in those tracts projecting to the primary cortical zzso These results suggest that our method is suitable for in zzso zzso zzso in specific fiber zzso It can provide data that relate to zzso during zzso or zzso delays in zzso zzso In the clinical domain, the focus on specific fiber tracts appears to be advantageous over standard approaches, because such system of zzso is based on the functional anatomy of the white zzso zzso it may be especially useful for topical analysis in neurology allowing the assessment of the functional consequences of white matter damage as well as the effectiveness of treatments in patients with any zzso that can be zzso by zzso
