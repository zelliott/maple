The discrimination of zzso time, an zzso cue to zzso in stop zzso was investigated to explore the neural systems underlying the perception of a rapid zzso speech zzso zzso of synthetic stimuli taken from a zzso to zzso zzso varying in zzso time zzso were presented for discrimination zzso Participants exhibited zzso perception, discriminating zzso and zzso zzso comparisons and failing to discriminate zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with a tone discrimination task demonstrated left superior zzso zzso zzso in all three zzso conditions with recruitment of additional regions, particularly the right inferior frontal zzso and middle frontal zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso differences using zzso defined regions of interest showed two distinct patterns with anterior regions showing more zzso in the right zzso relative to the left zzso and zzso regions demonstrating greater zzso in the left zzso relative to the right zzso zzso in the zzso regions appears to reflect initial zzso analysis of zzso Greater zzso in the right zzso anterior regions may reflect increased processing demands, suggesting involvement of the right zzso when the acoustic distance between the stimuli are reduced and when the discrimination judgment becomes more zzso
