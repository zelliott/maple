To assess the efficacy of single, double and triple doses of zzso zzso in the magnetic resonance zzso evaluation of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso in order to establish the best zzso in terms of dose and number of zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso or secondary progressive zzso underwent MR scans of the brain, spine or zzso Signal intensity, the number of enhancing zzso and the areas of zzso plaque were measured in zzso images before and after single, double or triple doses of contrast zzso zzso zzso test and the zzso zzso were used to evaluate the differences between the groups, and between doses in the same zzso 

There was no significant difference in area signal intensity or the number of enhancing zzso between the group examined after a single injection of zzso zzso contrast medium and the group examined after multiple injections of a triple dose zzso The difference in the areas of enhancement and signal intensity between a single dose zzso and TD significantly increased after the second zzso 

zzso injections in zzso patients can be zzso by giving a single zzso zzso which leads to the same results as a TD administered as two zzso
