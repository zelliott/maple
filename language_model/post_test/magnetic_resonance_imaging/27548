zzso complexes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain a highly stabilized zzso center in the zzso state, which is zzso by an zzso zzso The complexes are resistant to acid, metal zzso zzso zzso and oxygen in zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso and zzso contains zzso zzso attributed to alcohol OH donors, which give chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso zzso at zzso pH and 37 zzso at 50 and 54 zzso from bulk water, zzso The distinct pH dependence of the zzso peak of the two complexes over the range of pH zzso shows that these two groups may be useful in the development of zzso pH sensors based on zzso
