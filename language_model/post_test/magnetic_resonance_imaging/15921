The theoretical description of steady state free zzso zzso sequences is generally well accepted and zzso although it is based on zzso acting zzso zzso zzso In practice, however, all zzso processes are zzso thereby questioning the overall zzso of the common zzso signal description for use with finite zzso zzso In this paper, finite zzso pulse effects on balanced zzso signal formation are analyzed as a function of the zzso time, the pulse repetition time, the flip angle zzso and relaxation times zzso The observed signal zzso from finite zzso zzso zzso to zzso ones) can range from only a few percent (for zzso zzso repetition time zzso 1, alpha zzso 90 degrees, zzso approximately 1) to over zzso (for zzso zzso repetition time zzso 1, alpha approximately 90 degrees, zzso zzso 1) and may even exceed zzso in the limit of zzso zzso repetition time zzso 1 (for alpha approximately 90 degrees, zzso zzso zzso As a result, a revision of zzso signal theory is indicated not only for reasons of zzso but also seems zzso zzso for all quantitative zzso zzso A simple modification for the common balanced zzso equation is derived that provides an accurate framework for zzso signal description over a wide variety of practical and zzso zzso
