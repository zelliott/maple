To examine the efficacy of zzso as a new agent to reduce inflammatory activity in an animal model of multiple sclerosis zzso by in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was used for treatment of rats in a model of chronic zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso at an oral dose of zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso based on in zzso tracking of zzso labeled with zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and neurological zzso was used to study the burden of disease in treated and zzso zzso 

While zzso animals showed severe paralysis of the hind zzso intense zzso of zzso in brain zzso and areas of zzso barrier zzso zzso zzso animals displayed no signs of inflammatory activity or neurological zzso These observations were made for both acute phase and first zzso 

Tracking of zzso by zzso provides direct evidence of the zzso efficacy of zzso in the zzso model and zzso well with neurological symptoms and zzso
