A clinical series of patients with unilateral zzso treated with the anterior cervical zzso zzso 

To establish procedural techniques and clinical and zzso outcomes for the anterior cervical zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is typically caused by unilateral disc zzso or zzso zzso that compress the zzso aspect of the zzso zzso removal of a cervical zzso causing zzso symptoms without zzso fusion seems to be an ideal treatment in selected zzso The indications for an anterior cervical neural zzso are limited to unilateral zzso symptoms at one or two levels, with minimal neck zzso 

zzso patients were treated with the anterior cervical neural zzso procedure during a zzso period with follow-up from 6 to 36 zzso There were 13 men and 8 women (age range, zzso zzso Fourteen patients had symptomatic soft disc zzso and 7 had zzso zzso confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and/or zzso and zzso zzso Sixteen patients had a single anterior cervical neural zzso and 5 had procedures at adjacent zzso 

zzso patients zzso had improved or resolved zzso symptoms, and 2 zzso had persistent zzso symptoms zzso further surgery (one zzso anterior cervical neural zzso and fusion and one zzso zzso zzso 

Patients treated with the anterior cervical neural zzso procedure have equivalent or better outcomes than those who undergo current cervical zzso It appears to be a good alternative procedure for carefully selected patients with unilateral cervical zzso and avoids a fusion of the disc zzso
