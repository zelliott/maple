The advent of zzso gene engineering and genetically modified mouse models has led to renewed interest in developing resources for zzso and quantitative analysis of mouse brain zzso In this study, we used diffusion zzso imaging zzso for quantitative characterization of anatomical zzso in the developing mouse zzso As an anatomical reference for zzso research using mouse models, this paper presents zzso based zzso of ex zzso zzso mouse brains at several zzso zzso The zzso zzso existing zzso and zzso zzso by providing users access to zzso high-resolution images of the developing mouse brain, with distinct tissue contrasts and zzso of major gray matter and white matter zzso The usefulness of the zzso and database was demonstrated by quantitative zzso of the development of major gray matter and white matter zzso zzso average images of the mouse brain at several zzso stages were created using large deformation zzso metric mapping and their anatomical variations were zzso zzso The zzso and database enhance our ability to examine the zzso in normal or genetically engineered mouse strains and mouse models of neurological zzso
