The utility of three-dimensional zzso zzso for right zzso zzso assessment is uncertain in older children and adults with zzso heart disease zzso in whom the right zzso is often zzso and dysfunction is zzso 

RV assessments using zzso were compared with manual tracing and automated border detection zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso as the reference zzso zzso of 54 consecutive patients zzso median age, 17 zzso with zzso had adequate three-dimensional zzso data sets for zzso 

There were wide ranges of RV size zzso RV zzso volume index, 143 zzso 43 zzso and function zzso RV ejection fraction zzso 48 zzso zzso on zzso zzso volume was underestimated on zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a greater degree in larger zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in zzso zzso between zzso methods and zzso except for zzso zzso zzso 6, P zzso zzso The mean analysis time for zzso was 5 minutes, compared with 19 minutes for manual tracing zzso zzso zzso 

zzso half the patients with zzso had adequate three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso accurately estimated zzso but underestimated volume, particularly when the right zzso was zzso zzso minimally underestimated zzso but offered a significant reduction in analysis zzso
