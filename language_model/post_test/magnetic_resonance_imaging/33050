The aim of the present work was to perform the zzso of zzso by their zzso with zzso magnetic zzso zzso zzso in order to obtain a zzso suitable for dual imaging zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso were washed with zzso solution and zzso by magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso saline solution was added to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was allowed to react with zzso zzso zzso at zzso followed by zzso exchange zzso with a specific activity of zzso zzso of zzso were obtained from peripheral zzso zzso zzso by zzso was obtained and zzso viability was assessed by the zzso blue exclusion zzso test performed at zzso zzso and zzso assessment of the release of zzso from zzso zzso in plasma was performed by measuring the zzso of both the cellular zzso and the zzso zzso 

Our data showed the binding capacity of zzso zzso for zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso captured per zzso of zzso was constant and independent of the zzso zzso In all cases, more than zzso of the engulfed zzso were positive to the zzso zzso The zzso were zzso within the zzso 

In our in zzso model, zzso are taken up by zzso through zzso whereas previously described methods were based on the use of a zzso agent that permit zzso to cross the cell zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso showed a high stability of up to zzso of retained zzso after zzso of zzso
