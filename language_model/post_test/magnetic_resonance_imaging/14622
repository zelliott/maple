zzso spin labeling zzso techniques are gaining popularity for visualizing and zzso cerebral blood flow zzso in a range of patient zzso However, most zzso methods lack zzso information, which is important for the assessment of collateral flow and the zzso supply to zzso In this study, we explored the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso with multiple zzso delays to obtain individual quantitative zzso and zzso arrival time maps for each of the four main zzso arteries and compared the results against those obtained with conventional zzso zzso zzso using matched scan zzso zzso showed that zzso systematically underestimated zzso by up to 37% in zzso supplied by two zzso whereas zzso maintained zzso accuracy since each vascular component is treated zzso Experimental results in healthy volunteers showed that there is no systematic bias in the zzso estimates produced by zzso and that the zzso ratio of the two techniques is zzso Although more complex acquisition and image processing is required and the potential for motion sensitivity is increased, zzso provides comparable data to zzso but with the added benefit of zzso zzso This could lead to more accurate zzso estimates in patients with a significant collateral zzso
