zzso for detecting recruitment patterns of the zzso muscles during exercise in patients with chronic low back pain are zzso This article discusses the use of magnetic resonance imaging with Roman chair extension exercise to examine zzso muscle usage in five normal volunteers, five chronic low back pain patients without surgery, and five chronic low back pain patients with zzso Changes in signal zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with graded exercise were measured at three zzso disc zzso At rest, there was a difference between zzso and zzso signal intensity in chronic low back pain subjects without surgery zzso zzso zzso and in chronic low back pain subjects with surgery zzso zzso zzso but not in normal zzso At peak exercise, there was a difference in signal zzso between zzso and zzso in all groups zzso volunteers, P zzso zzso chronic low back pain patients without surgery, P zzso zzso chronic low back pain patients with surgery, P zzso zzso The exercise response was attenuated in chronic low back pain patients with zzso Thus, zzso demonstrates zzso and dynamic differences in zzso zzso zzso in chronic low back pain subjects compared to normal zzso
