Observations and zzso of zzso structures in humans have been difficult and not of common zzso zzso Because of our interest in zzso we have studied the presence, size, and function of these structures in normal subjects and in patients with smell zzso 

zzso resonance imaging studies of brain were performed in 220 consecutive patients in our medical center for a variety of clinical neurological zzso zzso resonance imaging studies were performed in each subject including high-resolution zzso zzso zzso echo images in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso bulb diameter, zzso zzso depth, and zzso of the zzso grooves were zzso 

zzso bulbs were present zzso in each patient zzso zzso bulbs appeared duplicated in 11 patients and zzso in one zzso of the total zzso Whereas zzso zzso depth was similar in all patients, zzso bulb diameter in patients with duplicate or zzso bulbs was significantly smaller than those in subjects with single bilateral zzso zzso One patient with zzso zzso and zzso bulb zzso had significant impairment in zzso zzso None of the other subjects complained of smell zzso 

zzso bulbs with a duplicated or zzso appearance and associated changes in zzso groove zzso can be present in patients examined with zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and are not zzso Although the zzso for this finding is zzso it may relate to zzso and genetic zzso
