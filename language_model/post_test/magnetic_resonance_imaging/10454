zzso resonance zzso imaging is increasingly used in the diagnosis of zzso foot pain, but improved understanding of how MR images represent zzso changes in the zzso foot is zzso We hypothesized that zzso in signal intensity and tissue zzso would represent changes in tissue structure detected using zzso zzso The study objectives were to determine the significance of MR signal zzso in feet from horses with and without zzso by comparison with zzso zzso Fifty-one zzso feet from horses with a history of zzso improved by zzso digital analgesia zzso zzso zzso or zzso control horses with no history of zzso zzso zzso zzso were stored frozen before undergoing MR imaging and subsequent zzso examination at standard sites zzso digital zzso tendon, zzso bone, zzso zzso zzso zzso collateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using MR images, signal intensity and zzso size, definition of zzso margins, and relationships with other structures were zzso zzso were graded as mild, moderate, or severe for each zzso For each zzso site examined zzso the structures were described and scored as no changes, mild, moderate, or severe zzso also taking into account zzso formation within the zzso zzso detected on zzso zzso zzso in MR signal intensity were related to changes at the tissue level detected by zzso zzso A sensitivity and specificity comparison of MR imaging with zzso examination was used to evaluate the significance of MR signal zzso for detection of zzso zzso of the deep digital zzso zzso zzso zzso bone, zzso zzso zzso ligament zzso collateral zzso ligament zzso and zzso zzso zzso between the MR and zzso grading was assessed for each structure using a weighted zzso zzso zzso comparison between zzso and MR imaging for individual limbs revealed that signal zzso on MR imaging did represent zzso zzso These included structural damage, zzso zzso zzso and zzso in ligaments and zzso zzso damage, zzso zzso cortical zzso and increased zzso in zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging had a high sensitivity and specificity for most zzso MR imaging had high specificity for zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso quite high specificity for zzso of the zzso of the zzso bone and its zzso zzso with moderate specificity for the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso aspects of the zzso bone, and was sensitive for detection of abnormalities in all structures except the zzso aspect of the zzso zzso When MR and zzso grades alone were zzso there was good agreement between MR and zzso grades for the zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso and zzso zzso agreement in grades of the zzso and zzso aspects of the zzso zzso fair to moderate in grades of the zzso and poor agreement for the zzso and zzso aspects of the zzso zzso The results of this study support our hypothesis and indicate the potential use and limitations of MR imaging for zzso of structural changes within zzso and soft tissue structures of the zzso zzso
