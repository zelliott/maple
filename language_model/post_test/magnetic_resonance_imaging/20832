On occasion, zzso in zzso type 1 may be present on the zzso zzso or face of an infant or child, a circumstance commonly referred to as zzso zzso zzso The present study evaluates the causes and extent of visual loss in a group of patients with zzso 

Case zzso 

Fifty-five patients with zzso 

zzso medical record review and zzso of selected patients from one zzso 

Visual acuity and identification of underlying cause of reduced zzso 

Fifty patients with unilateral zzso zzso male, 27 female, aged zzso years at last visit) and 5 patients with bilateral zzso (2 male, 3 female, aged zzso zzso had adequate information available to assess zzso visual zzso Nine patients (4 male, 5 female, aged zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso Patients were followed as long as 27 years zzso zzso zzso Thirty-nine patients zzso of total) had visual acuity of zzso on the side of zzso involvement (or the side of worse zzso involvement in patients with bilateral zzso One or more causes of zzso were present in 29 of these patients, 19 patients had organic disease of the eye zzso glaucoma or retinal zzso or the zzso system zzso zzso and 12 patients had zzso zzso zzso 

Visual loss in this zzso cohort was common, typically profound, and usually zzso Some causes of visual loss (including zzso glaucoma with zzso and retinal zzso zzso gaze due in part to distorted skull development causing zzso zzso and zzso were difficult to treat adequately and tended to cause progressive, profound visual zzso zzso careful observation should be made during the period of visual zzso for possible causes of zzso that might be zzso such as zzso changes, zzso of the visual zzso or zzso zzso As affected individuals get older, physicians must be vigilant for the progression of zzso nerve disease due to glaucoma or zzso and to the possibility that vision might be improved by zzso
