We examined neural activity, in the frontal zzso associated with speech production during affective zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso the blood oxygen zzso zzso response to the overt reading of emotionally neutral sentences was measured before and after a happy or sad mood zzso There was no explicit demand to produce zzso speech and a cover story was used to zzso the significance of the speech task in light of our experimental zzso Each zzso measurement was acquired 6 s after the onset of sentence presentation so that speech could be recorded while the scanner noise was zzso speech parameters zzso pitch zzso were extracted from the sentences and zzso against zzso zzso In the sad group we found the predicted changes in affect and pitch zzso Further, the zzso data confirmed our hypothesis in that the zzso zzso zzso the zzso response to reading minus the zzso response to baseline zzso in the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso with both pitch variation and zzso Our results suggest that the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso features of speech during affective states, thus placing this neural structure at the interface between action and zzso
