To assess the zzso zzso in the zzso assessment of response to chemotherapy in patients with zzso zzso 

Five clinicians with experience in the treatment and follow-up of patients with zzso measured tumor size in 20 pairs of CT and 20 pairs of zzso scans of 35 patients who had been treated with chemotherapy for zzso zzso zzso size was defined as the product of the two largest perpendicular enhancing tumor diameters on the zzso zzso To assess the zzso zzso in the zzso of tumor size, and in the zzso according to the widely used Macdonald response criteria, zzso correlation zzso zzso and weighted zzso values were zzso 

zzso zzso agreement was noted in the manual, two-dimensional zzso of tumor size on CT and zzso in patients treated with chemotherapy for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of response to chemotherapy according to the Macdonald criteria resulted in moderate zzso agreement zzso weighted zzso zzso In zzso of evaluated CT and in zzso of evaluated zzso studies, no complete consensus was found for the zzso tumor response zzso 

The zzso assessment of response to chemotherapy in patients with zzso zzso is susceptible to considerable zzso zzso This zzso the difficulties that arise in scoring response to chemotherapy by conventional zzso zzso
