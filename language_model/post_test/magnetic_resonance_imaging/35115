When we attend to other people in pain, the neural circuits underpinning the processing of first-hand experience of pain are activated in the zzso This basic zzso zzso resonance plays a critical role in the primitive building block of empathy and moral reasoning that relies on the sharing of others' zzso However, the full-blown capacity of human empathy is more sophisticated than the mere simulation of the target's affective zzso Indeed, empathy is about both sharing and understanding the emotional state of others in relation to zzso In this functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study, 17 typically developing children zzso zzso zzso were scanned while presented with short animated visual stimuli depicting painful and zzso zzso These situations involved either a person whose pain was accidentally caused or a person whose pain was intentionally inflicted by another zzso After zzso children rated how painful these situations zzso zzso with previous zzso studies of pain empathy with adults, the perception of other people in pain in children was associated with increased zzso activity in the neural circuits involved in the processing of first-hand experience of pain, including the zzso zzso cortex, anterior zzso cortex, zzso gray, and supplementary motor zzso Interestingly, when watching another person zzso pain onto another, regions that are consistently engaged in representing social interaction and moral behavior (the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso were additionally zzso and increased their connectivity with the zzso attention zzso These results are important to set the standard for future studies with children who exhibit social cognitive disorders zzso antisocial personality disorder, conduct zzso and are often deficient in experiencing empathy or zzso
