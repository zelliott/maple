zzso zzso matter abnormalities have been described in zzso primary zzso zzso zzso zzso spatial discrimination thresholds are found in familial and sporadic zzso and in some unaffected relatives who may be zzso gene zzso Our hypothesis was that a subset of unaffected relatives with abnormal spatial acuity would have associated structural zzso zzso unaffected relatives of patients with familial cervical zzso 24 relatives of patients with sporadic cervical zzso and 27 control subjects were zzso zzso discrimination thresholds zzso were determined using a grating orientation zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso images zzso zzso were zzso using zzso zzso zzso familial relatives with abnormal zzso had reduced zzso zzso matter volume zzso zzso relative to those with normal zzso zzso Z zzso zzso left Z zzso zzso where there was a negative correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso relatives also had bilateral sensory cortical expansion relative to unrelated controls zzso Z zzso zzso left Z zzso zzso zzso relatives of patients with sporadic cervical zzso who had abnormal zzso had reduced zzso zzso zzso compared with those with normal zzso zzso Z zzso zzso left Z zzso zzso zzso abnormalities in some unaffected relatives correlate with a zzso zzso and may be a marker of genetic zzso in these zzso Further investigation of zzso matter changes as a candidate zzso may assist future genetic studies of zzso
