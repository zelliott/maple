Turner syndrome affects one in 2,500 girls and women and is associated with cardiovascular zzso zzso the descending zzso zzso in adults with Turner syndrome with zzso is zzso zzso cardiac zzso is the preferred imaging zzso for zzso Our goals were to use cardiac zzso describe the spectrum and frequency of cardiovascular abnormalities and to evaluate zzso zzso and associated abnormalities in pediatric patients with Turner zzso 

The cases of 51 patients with Turner syndrome zzso age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso were evaluated with cardiac zzso The characteristics assessed included zzso structure, zzso of the zzso zzso arch, zzso diameter at multiple locations, and zzso of the zzso zzso Additional evaluations were made for presence of zzso zzso valve zzso and partial anomalous pulmonary zzso return zzso zzso between the cardiac zzso data and the following factors were zzso age, zzso body surface area, blood pressure, and zzso sizes and zzso 

Sixteen patients zzso had zzso of the zzso zzso arch, eight zzso had zzso 20 zzso had zzso and eight zzso had zzso zzso zzso was most common at the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso arch was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso of the zzso zzso arch had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso had increased right heart mass zzso zzso zzso increased ratio of main pulmonary artery to zzso valve blood flow zzso zzso zzso and increased right zzso volume zzso zzso zzso 

zzso anomalies in pediatric patients with Turner syndrome include zzso abnormalities and zzso The significant association between zzso of the zzso zzso arch and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may contribute to increased risk of zzso zzso The presence of zzso can be zzso zzso These findings indicate that periodic cardiac zzso screening of persons with Turner syndrome is zzso
