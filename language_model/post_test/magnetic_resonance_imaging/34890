The development of effective therapies for acute zzso stroke zzso the existence of potentially zzso zzso tissue when therapy is initiated because it is widely assumed that the effectiveness of most acute stroke therapies under development is related to reducing ultimate zzso size to promote functional zzso Such zzso zzso tissue was previously labeled the zzso zzso and must be distinguished from irreversible zzso 

zzso identification of zzso zzso appears to lag behind the actual development of this condition, and zzso injury after focal zzso should be differentiated from zzso Imaging and zzso markers apparently can provide clues for distinguishing potentially zzso from zzso injured zzso tissue in experimental and clinical zzso Recent zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies suggest that these clinically available imaging technologies will be useful for determining the presence of zzso zzso in individual stroke zzso The progression from potentially zzso to irreversible injury after focal brain zzso has many potential mechanisms that may be synergistic and vary among zzso 

zzso and zzso these mechanisms provides the opportunity to develop multiple potential acute stroke therapies that ultimately will be used in zzso perhaps directed by imaging zzso
