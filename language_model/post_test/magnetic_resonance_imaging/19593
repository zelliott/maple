zzso zzso offers new opportunities for clinical zzso and the solution of scientific zzso Data acquisition is possible using different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso is the most promising approach, but is still limited by several zzso zzso zzso reconstruction is based on a number of zzso acquired zzso image planes (like in zzso zzso which are put together zzso There are 2 ways of data zzso zzso zzso zzso Surface rendering of the zzso border can create perspectives not achievable with conventional methods such as the zzso zzso view of zzso zzso defects or the zzso view of the zzso zzso zzso leaflets and the spatial relationship can be identified much easier than using zzso zzso In complex zzso heart disease zzso echo may provide better spatial orientation and easier communication with the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of volumes, masses, and surfaces is only possible after manual zzso tracing with several cut planes generated from the zzso data zzso This procedure is time consuming and limits the use in clinical routine, even though validation studies demonstrated that zzso echo determination of masses and volumes is superior to one- or two-dimensional techniques which are based on geometric zzso Furthermore, quantitative zzso analysis has a unique zzso and zzso diagnostic zzso 

Combination with color zzso data may lead to a more precise zzso of valve zzso zzso of zzso and software will allow faster zzso zzso and quantitative zzso Assessment of regional zzso zzso may be possible in combination with left heart contrast zzso 

zzso zzso allows perspectives not achievable conventionally and has a great potential for precise quantitative and zzso analysis of cardiac zzso which overcomes the limitations of zzso zzso
