Local increase in blood flow during neural activity forms the basis for functional brain imaging, but its mechanism remains poorly zzso Here we show that cortical zzso in zzso possess a powerful mechanism for rapid zzso We zzso the activity of zzso labeled with the calcium zzso indicator zzso in zzso zzso of adult zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the vessel wall was associated with an zzso increase in zzso zzso area that corresponded to a 37% increase in blood zzso zzso occurred with a zzso of only 1-2 zzso and both zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso blocked the zzso zzso These observations zzso zzso in the control of local zzso and suggest that one of their zzso roles is to mediate zzso in response to increased neural zzso
