The increased risk of long-term zzso from zzso injuries to the zzso or cartilage after an anterior cruciate ligament zzso injury in adults is well zzso In zzso immature children, zzso reconstruction is often recommended to reduce the risk of new zzso zzso However, the prevalence and zzso of new injuries after zzso treatment of zzso injuries in children are zzso 

To zzso investigate the zzso of new injuries to the zzso and joint cartilage in zzso treated, zzso immature children with a known zzso injury by use of bilateral zzso zzso 

Case series; Level of evidence, zzso 

Forty zzso immature children with a zzso zzso (41 knees) followed a zzso treatment zzso and were evaluated with bilateral zzso zzso on 2 occasions zzso and zzso The zzso structures were analyzed by 2 independent zzso zzso Monitoring of participation in physical activities was accomplished through a monthly online activity zzso zzso statistics and zzso were extracted from the scoring forms and compared using the Fisher exact zzso 

Fourteen girls zzso and 26 boys zzso with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso years at the time of injury were zzso Time from injury to the final follow-up was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of the zzso children confirmed monthly participation in pivoting sports and/or in physical education classes in zzso The prevalence of zzso injuries in the 28 zzso knees was zzso at zzso and zzso and the zzso of new zzso and cartilage injuries in the zzso knees from zzso to zzso was zzso Thirteen children underwent zzso zzso with a prevalence of zzso procedures of zzso The zzso of new zzso injuries from diagnostic zzso to final follow-up was zzso zzso treatments for zzso injuries were performed in 8 of the 41 zzso 

The zzso of new injuries to zzso and joint cartilage was low between zzso and zzso in the 28 zzso zzso zzso percent of the knees required zzso zzso and zzso required zzso surgeries during the zzso zzso zzso years of follow-up from zzso Further follow-up is needed to evaluate the long-term knee health in these zzso
