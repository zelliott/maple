The present study investigates the effects of trait anxiety on the neural efficiency of working memory component functions zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso For the manipulation of zzso neutral verbal information held in working memory, zzso and zzso individuals (N zzso zzso did not differ in their behavioral performance, yet trait anxiety was positively related to the neural effort zzso on task processing, as measured by zzso signal changes in zzso Higher levels of anxiety were associated with stronger zzso in two regions implicated in the zzso control of zzso is, right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and left inferior frontal zzso with stronger zzso in a region assigned to the zzso zzso zzso is, zzso anterior zzso zzso Furthermore, anxiety was associated with a stronger functional zzso of right zzso with zzso prefrontal zzso We interpret our findings as reflecting reduced processing efficiency in zzso individuals and point out the need to consider measures of functional integration in addition to measures of regional zzso strength when investigating individual differences in neural zzso With respect to the functions of working memory, we conclude that anxiety specifically zzso the processing efficiency of zzso manipulation processes (as opposed to mere zzso zzso this study contributes to an accumulating body of evidence showing that anxiety also affects cognitive processing in the absence of zzso zzso
