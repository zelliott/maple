To determine whether zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging can be used to differentiate high-grade primary zzso and solitary zzso on the basis of differences in zzso and zzso levels in the zzso zzso 

Fifty-one patients with a solitary brain tumor zzso zzso 18 zzso underwent zzso contrast zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging before surgical zzso or zzso zzso Of the 33 patients with zzso 22 underwent zzso MR zzso nine, zzso MR zzso and two underwent zzso Of the 18 patients with zzso 12 underwent zzso MR imaging, and six, zzso MR zzso The zzso region was defined as the area in the white matter immediately adjacent to the enhancing zzso on zzso images, but not enhancing on zzso zzso zzso portion of the zzso Relative cerebral blood volumes in these regions were calculated from zzso MR zzso zzso from the enhancing zzso the zzso region, and normal brain were obtained from the two-dimensional zzso MR zzso The Student zzso test was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in relative cerebral blood volume and zzso ratios between high-grade zzso and zzso 

The measured relative cerebral blood volumes in the zzso region in high-grade zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso imaging demonstrated elevated zzso levels zzso ratio was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso but not in zzso zzso ratio was zzso zzso zzso The difference was statistically significant zzso zzso 

Although conventional MR imaging characteristics of solitary zzso and primary high-grade zzso may sometimes be similar, zzso and zzso MR imaging enable distinction between the zzso
