Children with attention zzso disorder zzso often show deficits in working memory zzso zzso zzso is an effective medication to improve these cognitive zzso This study aimed to clarify which effect MPH zzso on the underlying functional networks of working zzso 

Fourteen boys diagnosed with zzso and 12 healthy controls were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Each patient was tested twice, once with medication and once zzso The zzso experiments consisted of three verbal zzso tasks with increasing zzso zzso images were acquired on a 3 zzso head zzso 

On the behavioral level, zzso patients performed similar to healthy controls and significantly better than without zzso On the functional level, patients showed the expected frontal and zzso zzso which were more pronounced in the zzso and zzso zzso Healthy controls showed significantly more zzso in these regions and additional zzso in the zzso Interestingly, patients showed an additional effect of zzso zzso frontal and zzso zzso in patients was significantly less pronounced than in zzso 

zzso data indicate different zzso patterns in verbal working memory tasks between healthy controls and patients with zzso irrespective of medication zzso zzso of MPH led to a clear improvement on a behavioral zzso However, this effect was not reflected by changes in functional brain zzso zzso changes leading to better performance in verbal working memory tasks might be very subtle and therefore not zzso by zzso
