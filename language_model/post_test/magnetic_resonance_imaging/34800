zzso changes from silent to acute and chronic cerebral zzso have seldom been zzso We evaluated zzso profiles of the whole blood zzso plasma zzso and zzso level in stroke zzso patients with silent cerebral zzso patients with acute or chronic cerebral zzso zzso and subjects at low risk for zzso zzso profiles were measured in 88 zzso zzso 36 patients with silent cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso who provided no clinical history of having had definitive stroke but showing zzso 5 zzso zzso of cerebral zzso or zzso zzso zzso observed in magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 patients with acute cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured within 3 days and repeated 1 month after zzso zzso 25 patients with chronic cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured zzso months after zzso and zzso 15 subjects at low risk for stroke zzso zzso zzso without cardiovascular risk factors or zzso on zzso Patients with silent cerebral zzso were subdivided into two groups of less advanced and more advanced grades, based on the number of zzso or the grade of zzso Whole blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected blood zzso for zzso standard zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso serum total zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Plasma zzso levels were lower in silent cerebral zzso than in chronic cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients with more advanced grades of silent cerebral zzso showed higher levels of plasma zzso than those with less advanced grades zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso Whole blood zzso corrected blood zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso and zzso levels in acute cerebral zzso within 3 days after onset were higher significantly than those in subjects at low risk for zzso Plasma zzso level persisted to be elevated up to 1 month after zzso which continued as well in patients with chronic cerebral zzso Advanced grades of silent cerebral zzso in stroke zzso patients are accompanied by zzso of plasma zzso level, which increases further after onset of cerebral zzso such abnormalities persist up to the chronic zzso zzso plasma zzso level might reflect progression of zzso in patients with advanced grades of silent cerebral zzso resulted in an increased probability as to be a risk factor for cerebral zzso
