Previous studies have suggested that zzso can reproduce known gestures shown by a model using a semantic, indirect route, and novel gestures using a zzso direct zzso In the present study we aimed at testing the zzso of such a zzso model of action zzso Patients with either zzso damage zzso or zzso damage zzso were tested on an action zzso zzso zzso were either meaningful zzso zzso zzso or meaningless zzso zzso zzso and were presented in an zzso list and, on a different day, in separate zzso We predicted that, in the mixed condition, patients would use a direct route to imitate meaningful and meaningless actions, as it allows the zzso of both action zzso In the blocked condition, patients were expected to select the semantic route for meaningful actions and the direct route for meaningless zzso As hypothesized, none of the 32 patients showed zzso between zzso of meaningful and meaningless actions in the mixed zzso In contrast, eight patients showed a zzso between zzso of meaningful actions and zzso of meaningless actions in the blocked zzso Moreover, two of these patients showed a classical double zzso between the zzso of the two action zzso zzso were interpreted in support of the zzso of a zzso model for explaining action zzso We argue that the decrease in zzso of meaningful actions, relative to meaningless actions, is caused by a damage of the semantic route, and that the decline in zzso of meaningless actions, relative to meaningful actions, is produced by a breakdown of the direct zzso The brain areas that were zzso in all six zzso patients who showed a zzso were in the superior zzso zzso and the angular zzso whereas the two zzso subjects had common zzso of the zzso and of the zzso The brain structures affected in our patients with selective zzso are consistent with those reported before in other zzso zzso They are also in agreement with areas found activated in imaging studies in which the neural mechanisms underlying zzso were zzso
