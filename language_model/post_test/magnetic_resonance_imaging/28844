We investigated whether zzso zzso the course of new enhancing zzso in zzso multiple zzso zzso patients were studied by monthly magnetic resonance imaging zzso in a zzso design including 6 months of observation and 6 months of zzso We examined the course of new zzso zzso on two consecutive scans during observation and during zzso zzso detected during treatment were also analyzed by zzso 1 year later for persistence of enhancement, persistence of zzso zzso development of zzso zzso or zzso Among the enhancing zzso detected by observation and treatment zzso respectively, zzso persisted at 2 months in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso persisted in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso developed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was significantly more frequent in larger zzso during both the observation and treatment periods zzso zzso zzso No zzso of plaques was present at zzso zzso a further reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed while zzso zzso remained zzso Both the duration of zzso enhancement and the short-term zzso course of new enhancing zzso benefited by treatment with zzso zzso zzso
