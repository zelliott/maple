A patient in whom a variety of abnormal zzso findings can be zzso by elimination of central vision and fixation demonstrates zzso zzso The underlying mechanisms of zzso sensitivity and its relationship with alpha rhythm remain zzso To obtain a better understanding of this issue, we used a zzso zzso to study an zzso child with zzso sensitivity resulting in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso over the zzso regions on the zzso zzso source zzso revealed alpha activity around the zzso zzso and surrounding zzso zzso zzso sources of abnormalities relating to zzso sensitivity, however, usually were located deeper in the brain, suggesting more extensively distributed sources, with involvement of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sources of both types of activities show independent clusters but also an appreciable domain of zzso Our findings indicate that abnormalities related to zzso sensitivity can emerge in zzso networks, with larger and more anterior cortical distribution than those that generate alpha zzso Transition in the type of zzso appears not only to depend on a change in cellular dynamics but also to be reflected in a different spatial distribution of the underlying zzso zzso
