zzso and acute unilateral zzso of the auditory periphery zzso and zzso zzso can induce changes in the central nervous system that may result in unique forms of zzso These zzso perceptions can be controlled zzso on and zzso or modulated zzso in pitch or zzso by performing certain overt behaviors in other zzso zzso Clinical reports from our laboratory and several other independent sources indicate that zzso change in eye zzso from a neutral zzso position, is one such behavior that can evoke, zzso and/or suppress these phantom auditory zzso This report deals with a new clinical entity and a form of zzso that can be evoked directly by zzso stimulation of the upper hand and fingertip zzso In 2 adults, zzso zzso was reported following neurosurgery for zzso zzso at the base of the skull and zzso zzso where hearing and zzso functions were lost completely and acutely in one ear zzso zzso and facial nerve paralysis zzso zzso was present either immediately following neurosurgery or had occurred as a zzso zzso zzso we focus on the zzso of this discovery, provide zzso zzso using contemporary zzso methods and document in one individual zzso zzso neural activity using functional magnetic resonance zzso In a companion paper, zzso and zzso interactions between auditory and zzso systems, possible zzso accounts and relevant functional zzso studies are zzso
