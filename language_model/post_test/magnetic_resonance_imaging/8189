Monitoring of zzso depth is difficult zzso particularly in zzso The aim of this study was to assess the correlation existing between zzso zzso State zzso or zzso zzso zzso and a clinical sedation scale such as zzso (University of Michigan zzso zzso during deep sedation with zzso in children undergoing diagnostic zzso 

Twenty zzso I and II children, scheduled to undergo deep sedation for magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso zzso were zzso The patients were randomly assigned to receive depth of zzso monitoring with zzso or zzso The zzso administered repeated doses of zzso every 10 s to a zzso score of zzso An attending zzso not involved in drug administration, recorded time and doses of sedation medications, vital signs, zzso score and zzso or zzso zzso All the evaluations were recorded at awake state zzso every 10 s until an zzso score of zzso and every 3 zzso until the children were zzso 

We enrolled 13 males and seven females ranging in age from 8 months to 7 zzso After induction of zzso zzso and zzso scores decreased and from the end of the procedure to emergence the two scores zzso The zzso data showed a strong correlation with the zzso scores zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso we found a similar correlation between the zzso data and the zzso scores zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Our study suggests that zzso and zzso may be two, real-time and objective tools to assess induction and emergence during zzso sedation in children undergoing zzso and zzso
