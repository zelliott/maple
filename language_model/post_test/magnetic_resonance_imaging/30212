Recently, we demonstrated that vessel geometry is a significant zzso of zzso contrast in zzso This is especially relevant for zzso enhanced zzso of tumors with their characteristically abnormal vessel zzso In order to better understand the zzso of this contrast zzso it is of interest to model how various factors, including zzso zzso contribute to the measured MR zzso and was the primary motivation for developing a novel computer modeling approach called the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso the limitations of traditional zzso approaches, and enables us to study zzso contrast arising from arbitrary zzso zzso in zzso such as those typically observed with brain tumor zzso Here we describe this new modeling methodology and some of its zzso The excellent agreement of the zzso with theory and the extant zzso modeling data, coupled with its zzso efficiency demonstrates its potential to transform our understanding of the factors that zzso zzso contrast in zzso
