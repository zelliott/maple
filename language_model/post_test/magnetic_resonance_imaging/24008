zzso line scan imaging zzso was adapted to zzso zzso zzso by replacing the initial 90 degrees zzso pulse of the underlying high-speed zzso echo sequence by a zzso zzso preparation zzso Implementation on a zzso 0 T zzso zzso system yielded zzso images of the human brain with b factors of 750 s zzso and total imaging times of about 500 zzso either for a single slice at zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso resolution or simultaneously for up to seven slices at zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso images and maps of the trace of the diffusion zzso were calculated from four scans with different combinations of three zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso combines high speed with zzso against image artifacts caused by motion (no phase zzso and tissue zzso differences (no signal losses, no geometric zzso Because the latter is an important advantage over zzso imaging, zzso zzso may find useful applications despite a limited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
