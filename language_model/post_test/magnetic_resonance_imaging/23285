The aim of this zzso study was to investigate the cerebral zzso interactions between human faces and voices during a gender categorization zzso Twelve healthy male participants took part to the zzso They were scanned in 4 runs that contained 3 conditions consisting in the presentation of faces, voices or zzso zzso zzso The task consisted in zzso each trial zzso auditory or zzso according to its gender zzso or zzso The zzso between the zzso condition and the sum of the zzso ones showed that zzso zzso associations according to their gender produced zzso zzso of the visual zzso zzso zzso and auditory regions zzso superior zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso of the left superior zzso zzso and the right inferior frontal zzso Moreover, zzso interaction analyses zzso revealed that both zzso regions were zzso and connected to the prefrontal zzso and the zzso and that the left zzso zzso had an enhanced connectivity with a zzso circuit involved in the zzso control of zzso This zzso study showed that the zzso zzso categorization of human gender is sustained by a network of cerebral regions highly similar to those observed in our previous studies examining the zzso interactions involved in zzso recognition zzso et zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso processing of human stimuli requires the zzso of a network of cortical regions, including both zzso visual and auditory regions and zzso zzso and frontal regions involved in the integration of both faces and voices and in the zzso zzso zzso and activated independently from the task to perform or the cognitive level of zzso
