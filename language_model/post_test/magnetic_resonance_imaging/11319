zzso and zzso effects of static, zzso bipolar zzso and zzso magnetic fields, as well as combinations of them, were examined using the Ames zzso The Ames test using zzso zzso bacteria, zzso strain zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso was zzso All combinations of magnetic fields were tested with and without zzso to zzso and zzso zzso oxide, zzso or zzso As expected, chemical zzso caused a clear-cut increase of the zzso in the Ames zzso However, neither the zzso fields nor a combination of a zzso magnetic field with the zzso bipolar zzso field or a zzso zzso magnetic field caused an zzso in the number of zzso in the Ames zzso No zzso effect of any magnetic field combination was zzso In conclusion, magnetic fields used during clinical magnetic resonance imaging zzso were neither zzso nor zzso
