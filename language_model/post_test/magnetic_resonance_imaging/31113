The location, size, and rim of an zzso zzso zzso zzso are major determining factors for zzso zzso We compared the zzso of zzso size and the characteristics of zzso zzso rim using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso with those obtained using zzso zzso zzso Patients with an zzso that met established criteria were selected for evaluation by cardiac zzso and zzso There were 66 patients who underwent both zzso and cardiac zzso zzso comparative analysis was performed to demonstrate agreement between measurement of zzso by zzso and balloon zzso compared to measurement of zzso by zzso and balloon zzso Twelve patients were excluded from zzso closure of zzso zzso did not demonstrate an adequate measurement of the zzso inferior rim in 10 of 66 zzso zzso patients underwent zzso closure using the zzso zzso zzso Of these, 52 patients had successful closure zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso The median device size was 28 zzso zzso zzso Patients who had successful closure had a significantly smaller major axis of zzso and larger zzso inferior rim compared to those of patients who were excluded from the closure zzso zzso zzso showed a better correlation of zzso diameter measurement to balloon zzso compared to zzso We believe that the most important zzso factor for successful zzso closure of an zzso is an adequate zzso inferior zzso which is best zzso using cardiac zzso
