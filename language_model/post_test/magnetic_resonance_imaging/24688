Interest in the association of zzso and zzso zzso was rekindled since the identification through magnetic resonance imaging zzso of bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso are often intractable, but zzso zzso surgery has not been zzso However, a similar clinical picture can be encountered in patients with bilateral zzso destructive zzso which fit the description of zzso zzso We report a series of patients with zzso and zzso zzso due to bilateral zzso zzso zzso show that zzso sclerosis zzso is often associated and highlight the fact that in this entity, unlike in zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso may be surgically zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso and imaging features of 12 patients with zzso zzso followed at three institutions are zzso For patients with zzso seizures, we detail zzso and zzso zzso recordings, surgical strategies, zzso analyses of the zzso zzso and outcome of surgical zzso zzso statistics were used for quantitative and zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to compare means, and a p zzso zzso was considered zzso 

zzso zzso and mental zzso were present in all patients with symmetrical zzso Five had zzso zzso There was no relationship between the severity of the zzso zzso or of the mental zzso and the degree of seizure control with zzso The five patients in whom zzso were zzso to medication had significantly earlier age of onset and longer duration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathology with associated unilateral HS was present in zzso One patient with dual pathology had a zzso zzso picture and had an anterior zzso zzso zzso based upon zzso zzso The other four had zzso zzso suggesting involvement of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso seizure onset in the anterior zzso region and in the zzso zzso in three of the four with dual pathology and in the zzso zzso in the one without zzso zzso guided by a combination of zzso zzso and extra and zzso zzso led to complete seizure control in two and almost complete seizure control zzso class zzso in two other zzso The only surgical failure was an isolated ATL in a patient with dual pathology, and zzso seizure onset in both zzso according to zzso and zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso mimics the clinical features of bilateral zzso zzso In patients with zzso seizures, recognition of this entity should lead to consideration of zzso surgery despite the bilateral zzso
