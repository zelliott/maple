zzso zzso zzso is an effective minimally invasive treatment for zzso One primary source of difficulty is monitoring and controlling the zzso zzso Currently, zzso is performed at 460 zzso for which magnetic resonance imaging zzso could play a role given its capability for temperature monitoring and tumor zzso If instead the zzso were to be performed at the zzso zzso frequency, then the MR capability for zzso field mapping could be used to directly zzso the zzso zzso fields created by the zzso zzso zzso the zzso fields may enable better control of the zzso zzso enabling better control of zzso shape and size and improving zzso We demonstrate the feasibility of performing zzso at 64 zzso and show preliminary results from imaging the zzso fields from the zzso The zzso zzso fields show an increase in current density in the zzso region, consistent with an increase in zzso of the zzso zzso
