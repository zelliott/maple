The aim of this study was to assess whether zzso zzso through zzso analysis of zzso MR zzso maps would improve breast zzso zzso 

zzso female patients with primary tumors of the breast were zzso using zzso zzso The rate of transfer of contrast medium between the zzso and plasma was calculated via zzso modeling over zzso delineated regions of zzso The zzso of transfer rate values were subdivided into 10 segments for each zzso The rate of change of the statistical moments of the transfer rate measured over the 10 segments allowed a quantitative measure of zzso 

In this patient group of 25 zzso and 25 benign zzso improved differentiation was achieved by using a measure of zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity obtained were 88 and zzso respectively, compared with 84 and zzso when using the mean value of the transfer rate zzso 

zzso analysis of contrast medium transfer rate maps allows the examination of zzso zzso and offers improved zzso zzso The new method used to zzso zzso zzso relies on the manner in which the exchange rate zzso varies when calculated over different segments of the zzso
