The zzso zzso zzso zzso is an established genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease zzso However, its effects on cognitive performance and brain structure in healthy individuals are zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on cognitive performance and zzso zzso lobe zzso measures in cognitively zzso young elderly with and without zzso memory impairment zzso which is an zzso condition for zzso 40 individuals with zzso and 62 without were tested on episodic memory and on tasks of speed and executive zzso All participants were zzso zzso 21 subjects with zzso and 47 without received additional structural magnetic resonance zzso zzso measures of the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso were obtained zzso 

In the zzso group, zzso carriers performed worse on the episodic memory zzso and showed smaller left zzso volumes zzso In the individuals without zzso the zzso carriers performed better on episodic memory zzso and had larger right zzso volumes zzso The interaction of group zzso zzso and zzso zzso was significant for episodic memory zzso and right and left zzso volumes zzso zzso There were no zzso differences or interaction effects on speed and executive function composite measures or other zzso zzso 

The negative effect of zzso on episodic memory and zzso volume in zzso supports zzso as a zzso condition of zzso The positive effects of zzso in subjects without zzso adds to a number of reports on positive zzso effects in young and very old zzso
