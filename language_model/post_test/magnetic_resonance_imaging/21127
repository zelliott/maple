A physically stationary stimulus surrounded by a moving stimulus appears to move in the opposite zzso There are similarities between the characteristics of this phenomenon of induced motion and surround suppression of zzso selective zzso in the zzso Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the link between the zzso perception of induced motion and cortical zzso The visual stimuli consisted of a central drifting zzso surrounded by a moving zzso zzso The change in cortical activity in response to changes in speed and direction of the central stimulus was zzso The human cortical area zzso showed the greatest zzso when the central stimulus moved at a fast speed in the direction opposite to that of the zzso More importantly, the activity in this area was the lowest when the central stimulus moved in the same direction as the surround and at a speed such that the central stimulus appeared to be zzso The results indicate that the activity in zzso is related to perceived speed modulated by induced motion rather than to physical speed or a kinetic zzso Early visual areas zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a similar zzso however, the relationship to perceived speed was not as clear as that in zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a neural correlate of induced motion perception and play an important role in contrasting motion signals in relation to their surrounding context and zzso modulating our motion perception depending on the spatial zzso
