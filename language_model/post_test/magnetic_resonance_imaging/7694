To develop an zzso zzso global score zzso of Crohn's disease zzso activity compared with a reference standard of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso index zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were zzso recorded for 71 patients zzso age 33, male zzso with zzso CD undergoing zzso zzso Two observers in consensus scored activity for nine zzso zzso grading mural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement and pattern, and zzso zzso zzso scores were multiplied according to disease zzso Five points each were added for zzso comb sign, zzso and zzso to derive the zzso A previously validated zzso CD activity score zzso was also zzso zzso scores were correlated with clinical references using zzso zzso A zzso zzso diagnostic model was built to discriminate active zzso zzso from inactive zzso 

zzso and zzso were significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso The model for discriminating active from inactive disease achieved an area under the zzso curve of zzso and zzso after zzso zzso 

A magnetic resonance zzso global score zzso of CD activity correlated significantly with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resonance imaging is now widely used to assess Crohn's zzso zzso zzso zzso activity scores depend on local zzso zzso reference zzso zzso Scores including assessment of disease zzso better demonstrate full disease zzso zzso This new global Crohn's disease burden score zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso score of disease activity can complement existing clinical zzso
