zzso and motion zzso in balanced zzso free zzso zzso imaging require high magnetic field zzso This requirement is due to the zzso signal response to spin phase variations in zzso Here, a technique that zzso background zzso for preparing strong zzso spin phase variations is zzso As a result, periodic patterns of increased motion sensitivity appear, which are zzso with bands of low zzso zzso zzso filters commonly used in MR zzso zzso remove these bands and leave wave images equivalent to a uniform phase response in zzso Since phase preparation zzso locally enhance motion sensitivity, the technique can be employed for selectively increasing the wave signal zzso in zzso The method is applied without the need for previous zzso which reduces the examination zzso In zzso phase prepared zzso is demonstrated in human liver and zzso
