To determine whether Experience Corps zzso a social service program, would improve zzso executive functions and increase activity in brain regions in a high-risk group through increased cognitive and physical zzso 

Eight zzso older female volunteers and nine matched zzso controls were recruited to serve in the ongoing zzso Baltimore program in three elementary zzso We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso to examine whether zzso volunteers improved executive function and showed increased activity in the prefrontal zzso relative to zzso zzso volunteers were trained and placed with other volunteers 15 zzso for 6 months during the academic year to assist teachers in kindergarten through third grade to promote children's literacy and academic zzso 

Participants were African American and had low education, low income, and low zzso State zzso scores zzso zzso 24), indicative of elevated risk for cognitive zzso Volunteers exhibited zzso increases in brain activity in the left prefrontal zzso and anterior zzso zzso over the zzso zzso relative to matched zzso zzso gains were matched by behavioral improvements in executive zzso zzso 

Using zzso we demonstrated zzso short-term gains in executive function and in the activity of prefrontal cortical regions in older adults at elevated risk for cognitive zzso These pilot results provide proof of concept for zzso brain plasticity in later life, and, that interventions designed to promote health and function through everyday activity may enhance plasticity in key regions that support executive zzso
