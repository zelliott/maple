The latest innovation in MR imaging is zzso zzso zzso a technology providing an important solution for the time necessary for signal zzso In the zzso zzso zzso approach, an array of zzso simultaneously operated receiver coils is used for signal zzso In particular, the efficacy of zzso technology is able to reduce the number of phase zzso by a factor (named R factor or Reduction zzso and to evaluate the same k space with fewer zzso lines obtaining higher spatial and zzso zzso 

An zzso group of 30 patients with a variety of clinically proven diagnoses underwent zzso MR with zzso technology to evaluate the zzso diagnostic zzso The sequences used were zzso zzso zzso Echo zzso zzso by a zzso blood signal with zzso zzso and single slice zzso zzso 

In addition to reducing scan times, zzso technology improved spatial and zzso resolution (40 zzso zzso providing optimal dynamic evaluation of valve structures and wall zzso Furthermore, the use of the zzso technique with zzso sequences zzso enabled the qualitative evaluation of abnormal blood movements and zzso zzso 

The considerable time savings allowed by zzso technology and the clear improvement in image quality constitute a step forward in cardiac MR zzso The possibility of executing zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies in the same MR examination session with short acquisition times and good image quality are becoming more zzso
