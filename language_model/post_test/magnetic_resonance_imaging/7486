To determine the impact of delay between surgery and zzso on overall survival zzso in zzso zzso patients with the incorporation of zzso zzso zzso From 2000 to 2012, 345 consecutive zzso patients were treated with surgery, zzso and zzso at our zzso A zzso model was constructed using significant zzso zzso known zzso factors including zzso and the zzso from surgery to zzso zzso 2, 2-5, and zzso 6 zzso Survival rates were calculated by zzso zzso zzso was zzso to calculate adjusted hazard ratios zzso The median survival for the entire cohort was zzso zzso The 1 year zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % zzso zzso zzso for intervals from surgery to zzso of zzso 2, 2-5, and zzso 6 weeks, zzso Patients radiated within 2 weeks zzso were more likely to have older age zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso techniques zzso zzso zzso and dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso undergo a biopsy only zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso severe zzso zzso symptoms zzso zzso zzso and bilateral disease zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis including zzso status demonstrated a significant detriment in delaying zzso zzso 2 weeks as zzso 3-5 weeks zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso weeks zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso We report the first analysis on the survival impact of delaying zzso zzso for zzso treated zzso patients with zzso zzso Our data does not support the zzso benefit previously seen in delayed zzso when correcting for important zzso We demonstrate a survival detriment with delaying zzso zzso greater than 6 weeks on zzso zzso
