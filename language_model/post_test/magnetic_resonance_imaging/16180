It is hypothesized that pauses at major zzso boundaries zzso grammatical zzso but not zzso zzso word zzso pauses, are planned by a high-level cognitive mechanism that also controls the rate of articulation around these zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging is used to analyze articulation at and around grammatical and zzso pauses in spontaneous zzso zzso zzso the speed of zzso were developed and applied during these pauses as well as during their immediate zzso zzso pauses were found to have an appreciable drop in speed at the pause itself as compared to zzso pauses, which is consistent with our hypothesis that grammatical pauses are indeed choreographed by a central cognitive zzso
