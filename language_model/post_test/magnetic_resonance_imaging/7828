The zzso is emerging as a key anatomical structure underlying normal zzso and cognitive control zzso zzso within zzso circuits may contribute to the core symptoms of Attention zzso Disorder zzso In the present study we aimed to characterize surface zzso features of the zzso in zzso and healthy comparison zzso Further, we studied the association of zzso zzso with the severity of zzso symptoms and the effects of stimulant zzso We examined 46 youths with zzso and 59 comparison youths zzso years of age in a zzso zzso study using magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso surface zzso were the primary zzso Relative to comparison participants, youths with zzso exhibited smaller regional volumes corresponding to the lateral surface of the left anterior and the right zzso zzso zzso zzso medication was associated with larger regional volumes over the left zzso surface, whereas more severe zzso symptoms were associated with smaller regional volumes in the zzso We used zzso measures of zzso to detect zzso in zzso anatomy specific to zzso dimensions of zzso and stimulant zzso zzso of treatment correlated positively with volumes of specific zzso zzso supporting a model zzso zzso zzso changes support the effects of stimulant zzso
