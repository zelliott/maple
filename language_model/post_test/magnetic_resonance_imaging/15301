This phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a zzso zzso off regimen of zzso before zzso zzso in patients with zzso newly diagnosed zzso 

Patients received zzso zzso zzso on days 1 to 7 and days 15 to 21 every 28 zzso 7 days zzso days zzso for up to four cycles before conventional zzso zzso zzso to a total of 60 zzso and for four cycles thereafter or until disease zzso The primary end point was tumor zzso zzso tissue from 25 patients was analyzed for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with a median age of 60 years were treated, and 28 were zzso for zzso Seven zzso of 29 patients had a partial response, nine patients zzso had stable disease, and 12 patients zzso had progressive zzso Median zzso survival zzso time was zzso months, and median overall survival zzso time was zzso zzso Patients with low zzso zzso compared with patients with high zzso zzso had a significantly higher response rate zzso v zzso zzso P zzso zzso and improved zzso zzso zzso v zzso months, zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso 16 v 5 months, zzso P zzso zzso The most common grade 3 and 4 zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This zzso zzso regimen resulted in modest zzso activity with an acceptable safety profile in the zzso setting, and expression of zzso correlated with response to zzso However, this treatment approach seems to be inferior to standard zzso zzso plus zzso
