A method for comparing estimated zzso zzso zzso zzso with regional cerebral blood flow zzso zzso areas is zzso This approach zzso individual zzso matching of zzso data, of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and of anatomical information obtained from magnetic resonance zzso zzso The zzso data and the zzso zzso were recorded in a healthy subject during zzso simple voluntary movements of the foot, zzso index finger, and zzso High resolution zzso MR images of the brain consisting of 128 zzso zzso slices of zzso thickness were zzso zzso integration was performed by zzso the zzso head coordinate system constructed during the zzso measurement onto the MR image data using identical anatomical landmarks as zzso zzso integration was achieved by a zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in one integrated zzso zzso The estimated zzso locations followed the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso increases as evident from zzso although they did not match zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso matching of zzso PET and MR data provides a tool for relating estimated zzso field locations to zzso zzso changes in individual zzso Our method offers the perspective of refined zzso zzso
