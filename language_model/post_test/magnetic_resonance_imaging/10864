A measure for registration of medical images that currently draws much attention is mutual zzso The measure originates from information theory, but has been shown to be successful for image registration as zzso Information theory, however, offers many more measures that may be suitable for image zzso These all measure the divergence of the joint distribution of the zzso zzso values from the joint distribution that would have been found had the images been completely zzso This paper compares the performance of mutual information as a registration measure with that of other zzso zzso The measures are applied to rigid registration of zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso images, for 35 and 41 image pairs, zzso An accurate gold standard transformation is available for the images, based on implanted zzso The registration performance, zzso and accuracy of the measures are zzso Some of the measures are shown to perform poorly on all zzso The majority of measures produces results similar to those of mutual zzso An important finding, however, is that several measures, although slightly more difficult to zzso can potentially yield significantly more accurate results than mutual zzso
