Besides conventional zzso in the diagnostic work up of initial changes in patients suffering from zzso arthritis zzso zzso bone zzso zzso is as well established as magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of a newly developed low field zzso with proven methods such as conventional zzso and zzso 

42 patients were studied using a one days protocol with zzso zzso and zzso of the hands with yearly follow up zzso Images were visually assessed by two blinded nuclear medicine physicians and zzso and classified as zzso and zzso zzso All methods were compared to the zzso findings interpreted by a rheumatologist in consideration of the Ritchie zzso index as zzso 

zzso patients presented with clinical symptoms of initial changes by zzso zzso Conventional zzso revealed in zzso patients within the correct diagnosis in the study zzso On the other hand zzso and low field zzso zzso showed all 24 patients with initial changes due to zzso Time of detection showed variations with a tendency to later findings by conventional zzso 

In the diagnostic work up of initial changes conventional zzso should be the first choice in zzso Our findings suggest that zzso represents an equally sensitive method for the diagnosis of initial changes due to zzso in the region of the hands as compared to the zzso The limitation of the low field zzso is the small field of view, so we prefer zzso or high field zzso in the diagnosis of patients with suspected zzso
