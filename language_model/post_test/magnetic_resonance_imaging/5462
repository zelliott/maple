The zzso nerve may become zzso either within the zzso canal or near the zzso ligament resulting in a partial zzso zzso The goal of the present anatomical study was to assess a new zzso injection technique in terms of the precise injection site and the resulting distribution of the injected zzso 

This study was carried out using eight fresh human zzso An zzso needle with a removable wing was inserted and the zzso position zzso using zzso Through the zzso 10 zzso of zzso contrast medium was injected into three of the zzso A further four zzso were injected with latex and blue zzso and the zzso area of each then separated from the trunk for freezing before being cut into zzso zzso thick sections with an electric zzso One final zzso was injected with a mix of zzso (5 zzso and latex (5 zzso and both the zzso and anatomical procedures outlined above were zzso 

Using zzso we clearly zzso both the site of injection, near the trunk of the zzso zzso and the zzso contrast medium in different pelvic and zzso areas and around the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the anatomical study, latex was observed mainly around the zzso zzso along the zzso zzso muscle and in the zzso area in contact with the dividing branches of the zzso zzso The mixed injection of latex and zzso in the zzso canal was found with the same zzso between zzso and anatomical zzso 

This easily performed technique should provide a new approach for treating zzso zzso via zzso nerve block in the consultation room without the need for zzso zzso
